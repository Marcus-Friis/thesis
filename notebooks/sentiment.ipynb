The third one is people think you're friendly and approachable, and so they wish to spend time with you and they wish to talk to you. Even if you don't want them to, and if you're really lucky, they might even fall in love with you, and therefore you have to ring the police. The fourth one is your generally very funny, and you can use that wit and that sarcasm to break down barriers and form bridges with people, which can lead on to bigger and better things.

I mean it wasn't the worst of the night that surely has to go to Ireland, but somehow they did really well. Good news, I was at it, because it was awful. A bunch of screaming people, that is all it was. But Ollie Alexander's was just Guy Rotica, simple as that. And for a show that should be, including children, children should be able to watch it. It's a singing competition. That's it. So why has it always got to be who could be the most controversial? What, why is that? Why do people need to do that? I mean Ollie's was just a bunch of naked men, just thrusting and just shaking about. And he's singing with Shambolic. It was shaky, it was Paul, the Sam was awful, the song was crap anyway. So no wonder we got zero points from the wider public outside of the UK. No one guy, I have no problem seeing, you know, men dancing about. Don't fight with that. But why do you need to always, always, show it down people's throats? Why do you gay people always need to do that? Because it just makes us all look really, really shallow. You can enjoy that and that's fine, you can do that, that's fine. But why does someone like that have to represent the UK and a worldwide audience to what? I think there's a two hundred million people watch it every year. And it's no wonder we do so badly. The one year that the UK has done well in the last God knows how many years, is two years ago with Sam Rider. And why is that? Because we put art and talent above everything else. And we should have won. The only reason we didn't win was because everyone gave you crime, the sympathy vote. Since then, we've had a girl who hates the UK who can't sing. I kind of remember her name, but she was awful and no one's heard of her since. Now we've got Oli Alexander who's the week before said that the UK flag is controversial. You can't sing, who puts gay erotica in his performance and then wonders why he doesn't do well. He actually gets humiliated and probably now his singing career has gone down the pan if it had no end. Why can't we just get back to a time where art and singing talent and vocalisation was put at the top of the tree? That was more important than anything else. Why now is choreography and how someone is going to be so controversial and how controversial can I be? Why is that always put to the top? Singing these down here, how controversial can I be, is put up there for simply likes and attention. And it's just really, really embarrassing and it's no wonder the UK just shied every year with people as woke, as who are doing your revision for like LIKOLIA, Oli Alexander. It's no wonder that it's about people like that, everyone in the show, for the UK. So we're always going to do badly when you've got way for left is ruining it for everybody else.\\n\",\n",

And he thought that posting this video and ranting about how his feelings are hurt because his son doesn't want to come over to his house, and he doesn't want to speak to him anymore, is making it worse. And I doubt, I feel like parents, they don't respect or treat their children like people when they're little, but the tables flip when they get older. And I feel like the relationship you had with your parents where you were going up or the way they treated you will really show as the kid gets older. Like, there's no reason for him to go online and embarrass his son like this. And parents wonder why their children go no contact with them, or their children don't want to speak to them in their adulthood. And no, we shouldn't just blindly respect people older than us just because of their parents or their family. That's not how that works. Parents take accountability, stop treating your kids like they aren't people. I promise you, I promise you the same way you treated them. They will give it right back to you.

We were born into it, fifth generation. It's only really existed for five generations. So our family's been in it for as long as it's existed. And something just never really felt right with it. Which is easy to be the case with something like that. But it just like there was no real spirituality to it. It was just control and demand. And I would say tradition, but not even. Like there was no actual traditions to it. It was very strange. And I know it's not what most Christians experience. Although there are large swaths of Christians who do. So we ended up considering ourselves atheist from about 13 years old. For the most part, not 100%. We're a dissociative system. So some of us took a little longer than others to fully leave. But by the time we were 19, we were kicked out for being queer. And then we started learning about politics and the world around us more. Realized, of course, that we were queer and trans. We started learning. And we realized not only A, there is a huge evangelical movement in the United States. Which is responsible for a lot of the reasons that the world is getting worse right now. But other parts of the Christian community don't really call them out much. And the history of Christianity itself is rooted in colonialism and control. And when you get to the history of the Bible, you realize that it was created by the Septuagint. And which was a political body of political leaders from the time. Who ended up twisting the Bible so that it could mean anything that they wanted it to be many things to many people. But the one thing that no matter what it had in common was that it told you to listen unquestioningly to those who claim to be the leaders of the church. And it really is the heart of Christianity. It's not like the spirituality you find in other faiths. And I can say that because we've since found a really rich spirituality in in painism, specifically in Hellenism and heathenry and meeting the gods and connecting with them and feeling cold to them and feeling genuinely like they're communicating with us is it's not something we'd ever experienced before. Even when we tried to reach out to the Christian God in ways that weren't related to the witnesses, even when we've talked to other Christians and they've described their experience and stuff. It's just quite frankly it's a it's it's a dead as far as I'm concerned. Wisted religion. And people are realizing that like I'm not the only one who understands the Christianity is a high controlled religion with roots in colonialism and white supremacy. I'm not it's it's really hard to make that desirable to people when we start realizing that and it should be hard to make that desirable because it's awful. The only people that that appeals to is people who are willing to be controlled willing to turn their brains off and people who like the white supremacy and colonialism. So no it's not it's not really going to appeal to most people. So the church is dying and may it die soon.\\n\",\n",
       " \" And so now I'm going to ask you guys to please educate me.\\n\",\n",
       " \" It's definitely really hard to keep track of everything, all of the information out there. We spend like 16, 18 hours a day staring into the void of news and it's hard for us to keep track of everything that's happening. But let me try and use the 10 minutes here, hopefully less, to help explain. First in Palestine with Israel, Israel actually invaded and began taking over the land of Palestine back in 1948 with the assistance of the UK, the US and a bunch of other European countries. The day that that happened is remembered on actually May 15th, which is coming up here, and it's called the Nakba and a KBA, I'm pretty sure it might be a queue. Anyway, so point is, this has been going on since then. Ethnic cleansing, genocide, mass displacements, everything you can imagine. There's now CNN has articles out showing that there are in fact concentration camps designed specifically, not like the work camps or the death camps that the Nazis had, this is a torture camp. This is just holding Palestinians and torturing them until they die. I'm not laughing out of humor. It's so, it's so nuts. Anyway, so that's happening, what's been happening since October 7th is just the most recent escalation and because of TikTok and the internet now, it ended up becoming what is being called the first live streamed genocide, which is unfortunately accurate, but it's gotten a lot of people aware of what's going on. And so the block list thing actually happened because of the Met Gala a few days ago, a week ago, something like that at this point. Anyway, so the just mass disparity between people scrolling and seeing the obscene wealth on display at the Met Gala and then seeing all of the horrors coming out of not only Palestine, but there's also the Congo, which is genocide and ethnic cleansing campaign based mostly in slavery, specifically trying to mine cobalt. And I know there's another medal that I cannot think of the name of right now, both of which, however, are integral in making electronics, like the iPhones and Apple products that come out every year and like vapes and if it's got batteries in it, and it's an electronic type it's probably harming the people of Congo and incentivizing the slavery and the genocide is happening there. There's also stuff happening in Sudan, which I'm going to be honest, I don't know much about, I really wish I did. I can't do much education there. I just know that there's a lot of people saying that there's like 800,000 people, I think, that are trapped in this one city that is being attacked and also there's not food and aid getting in there because of the people in control of this city. Again, I don't know much about it. I just know it's a horrific situation. I'm currently trying to learn more about that. So there's also, there's stuff going on in Puerto Rico. There's issues with, there's targets on the backs of trans people and queer people around the world. And so like all of this happening, people are unable to make rent and unable to pay for food and stuff, even here in America, which is supposedly the richest nation in the world. And so all of these things happening together and people seeing them and scrolling one by one past these horrors and atrocities and people screaming for help interspersed with let them eat cake, right? Interspersed with the copulence of the Met Gala is just such a display of the disparities in our world that people really just said, fuck the bread, fuck the circuses, we're taking our life back. This is unacceptable now. There's already been the massive wave of unionization. People have been really organizing. There's been the BLM protests that happened, you know, that have been happening since 2015, but especially kicked off in 2020 when everybody was staring into our phones because of COVID and people got out in the streets and more people than ever were prudalized by the police because they went out to say, hey, maybe stop murdering people, right? Like, and so all of this stuff is happening and quite frankly, everybody's fucking sick of it and we're taking our, we're taking our life and we're taking our society back. And so the block lists and the abandoning digital cards and the protests that were started by the students at Columbia and have been led by students. I mean, all of this stuff, each one separately is kind of targeting a different problem to some degree, but it's also, it's all completely interconnected. There is no way to take what's happening to black people here in America and separate it from what's happening in Palestine or the Congo or Sudan because the police and the military here in America is training and funding the actions that are happening over there, right? NYPD and the LAPD both have offices in Israel. In fact, the NYPD has offices all over the world. Supposedly, one city's police department, but offices all over the world training doing combat scenarios with the fucking IOF, like generally known as the IDF, like these are all completely interconnected. There's the stop cop city movement because there's what are called cop cities that are popping up, where they are trying to build these massive prison and military, but police training facilities, right? Like these are essentially military bases, but for police, right? And people are realizing that the police are an occupying force and like all of these things are coming into play and the blacklist is definitely a very small part of that, but also capitalism is not the sole factor, but it is one of the major factors that all of these issues are resting on. And so if whether people realize it or not, these blacklist are intended to attack capitalism as one of the primary sources of people's misery. And so it's really, it's this mass movement, but all of these little pieces, like separate from each other seem confusing. They don't necessarily seem like they go together unless you do start seeing that big picture, which is a lot more than I can help anybody learn in 10 minutes, but hopefully this was a good explanation, at least like an intro video, to help get people just kind of caught up understanding where we're at and where we're going from here. From here, we're going to we're going to fuck shit up and take our life back all of us together. We're going to build a better society where all of us can have what we need and want and you know, it's not going to be a utopia, but why can't we fucking try? Why not? We can. If we get these greedy, rich, powerful fucks out of our way, because no matter how much power, no matter how much money they have, there is no power like the power of the people. The power of the people don't stop.\\n\",\n",

       " \" So I am a gay man and I have a lot of things to say about this whole fudoshi situation. So for those of you who don't know, the term fudoshi is Japanese in origin. It originates off of this Japanese forum website called two-channel. Fudoshi itself is a pun on a Japanese term for a proper woman and it instead means rotten woman. And this is rotten in the sense of like the classical definition of rotten, like decayed, spoiled, stuff like that. And this was a term used largely by men to refer to women in fandom spaces. Who are typically do things that they didn't like, such as, you know, shipping characters in general or whatever else. But notably it was not a term that exclusively referred to women who enjoyed the a boy's love genre. And the reason that these women were called rotten specifically was because in Japanese society, there is a expectation that in a woman's life at some point she will leave behind the things of the things of her childhood and such. And you know, begin to focus on adult life and being, and like being the mother of the family. And these women were called rotten because they had spoiled themselves by either making themselves quotes around this by making themselves undesirable to men or by, or in the case of ones who were married shaming their families and husbands and such. And so this term was eventually reclaimed by women in these fandom spaces. Like, oh, you're saying that I'm rotten. Well, all Bias rotten as I want to be. And they began self identifying as Fujioshi. And so what people in Western spaces have done is take a derogatory term that was reclaimed by the people it was used against and using it as a derogatory term again. So a lot of people are using the language of gay liberation to be misogynistic because Fujioshi began as a misogynistic term. And frankly, which of these sounds more homophobic to you? Is it A, there are women who consume media about gay men and like it? Or B, gay men are endangered and need to be protected from the scariest straight women. Like one of those sounds far more homophobic to me than the other. Additionally, to ignore the effect that the anti-Fudoshi movement, I guess you'd say, has had on gay trans men would be at best naive and at worst outright malicious. Like the amount of people who will say, oh, these are just straight women pretending to be gay men to infiltrate gay male spaces to get with gay men because they fetishize them. Like, if you switch the genders around the night, that's basically just classic trans folk rhetoric. Like, there really is no way around it. And that's not to say that all anti-Fudoshi people are transphobes. There are definitely transphobic people, mostly TERFs, who will peddle this narrative of straight women attempting to fetishize gay men. And then there are people who otherwise would not hold a lot of transphobic views hearing that and thinking, oh, I don't like gay men being fetishized. So I'm also against Fudoshi's and just agreeing that without any agreeing with it at face value. So the ultimate takeaway to this is that whenever you hear about a group of people, do your own research, like look into them from sources that are notistic cock videos. Yeah.\\n\",\n",

       " \" Number one, stop putting your expectations of what you would do or how you would handle a situation on to other people. They would disappoint you every time. I'm sorry to say it, but they will your best friends. The new friends you make, the old friends you've had, they will all disappoint you if you continue to put your expectations of what you would do in the situation or what you would do for someone on to someone else. You need to vocalize those things. You just cannot assume. Like trust but verify. You can trust that your friend will be there for you with things and will do what they need for you or support showing the ways that you're looking to be supported. But trust that they will do it but verify that they will make sure you know what I'm saying. Put them in like a little situation where you can test that but don't put them in a string you with situation. Don't be down bad. You need a friend. You ain't never rely on this friend for nothing and then now you want to rely on them for everything because that will never work. rely on them for something very little. We're relying on them for like a conversation about you know, a boy or girl, however you want to do that. I don't know. Figure out a way to test that they would be there to support you because baby again. So you just automatically put expectations on people to be something or do something that you need without verifying that they're able in a quip to do those things. You will be very upset. Also making new friends is an adult is very tough and very hard. Do not expect it to be easy. You have to remember when we were back in high school and when we were in school and we were doing things like that like we had to be around certain people every day. Every day whether we went to the same classes or not we still were at the same school building from 8 to 2 or 7 to 2 30. However y'all did it. We were there. That entire day, you know what I'm saying for that seven eight hours or even six to eight whatever it was we was there for that. You know what I'm saying. You don't have that in real life. You know what I'm saying. There's not a there's not a constant being around each other five days a week to where your lives kind of intertwine. You'll remember that someone is living their own life especially as an adult. So when you make a new friendship with them. You can't expect them to be like, oh, this will be my best friend. They're gonna be there for everything for me every time I need them. They're gonna be there. They're gonna drop everything they need because that's not gonna happen. You're putting again unrealistic expectations out there for people and you're gonna set yourself up for failure because you know about expect these people to be there for you. When you need them at y'all back in call and they're gonna disappoint you because again they're a grown adult. They might have a family they might even have relationships that they're dealing with problems they're dealing with. You're just again when you're making a new friend you're stepping into their life. Don't try to take the man over their life because you're stepping into it. You need to find out where you fit in not force them to be something that they might not be able to. My last rule for y'all is just be as genuine as you possibly can. If you are always being yourself you will attract great people or you will attract like minded people. If you're putting out a front or if you're trying to play a part it will never work out for you because you can only play a part for so long babe. Like after that part and that role has been filled and you are done with it you are gonna try to switch it up and when you try to switch it up to be who you really are not who you portray to be there will be a problem in the relationship the friendship whatever it is like just don't do it just be yourself be genuine again we're all grown we're all adults. We know how to this is for me and this ain't for me and if you aren't for somebody don't turn yourself into something that you think they want just so you can fit it will make you stress and we are to have enough to do things to deal with being a dot so like again. Stop trying to push yourself into that mold if you don't fit move on babe there is so many other people in this world I promise you you will meet great people just go out there and be willing to meet them to another thing be open be open to willing. will need more people you know I'm saying like don't shut yourself off or just but oh this is the only crowd people that I like to talk to are the only crowd people that I like to entertain. entertain more people outside of your friend group especially if you are like experiencing problems are continuously going the same cycles with your old friends like. competing the same habits and expecting different results baby is the definition of insanity so stop being in saying with these other maniacs okay love y'all.\\n\",\n",

I live in UK and there are various pubs and bars. And most of the time, if you want to take a children's own way, take them to the pub because there are child-friendly, family-friendly pubs. If you say bar, people will automatically assume it's a nightclub and children should not be there, so automatically bars are child-free. But anyway, yes, there are some bars and pubs that are child-free and some are not. And it's usually due to safety and licensing. I mean, I'm a local weather spoons. We, they are family-friendly, but children have to be in designated areas where the bar area is. Only people eating it over can approach the bar. Is that offensive? No. That's being safe. And it's complaining about the, you know, dog-friendly. What's wrong with her and the dog-friendly place? Because a lot of people tell the dogs I have to walk and, you know, they want to sit down, have a drink, and there aren't many dog-friendly places. I mean, where I live, there are a lot of dog-friendly places because there are a lot of dog owners, so they see, you know, we'll have to have a friend leave or customers to come and, you know, buy our products. What's saying, oh, is that saying child-free? How about to say you have no children? This is the exact same thing. I mean, you even try to say debt-free was bad because it's not utilizing your money. What being debt-free is actually a really good thing because it shows that you have managed to scream for save and buy it outright instead of actually owning, oh, we, oh, we money to someone else. I mean, are you going to say that dairy-free is bad? Hands-free is bad? Are you? Because it's just a load of rubbish, really. Because at the end of the day, the only time I've heard child-free used, you know, an offensive way is when people have kids try and shove down other people's throats that they should have kids when they either don't want to have kids or do two medical reasons they can have kids, and they're shoving all these kids going, oh, look, they're so great in the face. I'm a parent. I would never shove the idea of other people having kids because it is a massive, massive decision, but yes, those get you in debt. And at the end of the day, if you're taking a fence, that's someone who is child-free, I'm sorry, but that is really a huge problem right now.

Well, as said in the other video, it's been going on a bit longer than that. I mean, I should start at the beginning of Dr. Huiz. I mean, they give some really good examples. The Meep Pro now thing though, where the Meep goes, I just go back to the Meep. I should call back to Tom Baker, who basically used the doctor as well. All the Meep said is what Tom Baker said in one doctor who observed. And if you go into a Sarah Jena Avengers where Matt Smith did a crossover, Clyde asked him, you know, if you can regenerate and look like anything, could you also be black? And he said, yes, and now we have it, Judy Getwar. Though that's not the first time it happened because Peter Capaldi caused another time or two generations to generate and he went from a white old man to a young black woman. But there just is, time lords are literally gender benders. They can change their gender with every generation, wherever they please. I mean, it would, if regenerations only brought up because we've had an uncle and continue with the series due to his health, but it's brilliant how there's really, there's no gender in the time lord world because they can be man, they can be woman, they can not binary, they go whatever they want. They can chase their parents, they can be white, black, they can be Chinese, they can be Japanese, they can be Korean, they can be Russian, etc. It's just a regeneration. And yet they think now it's gone woke. I mean, that's like people watching Star Trek and thinking it's just now gone woke when it's been woke since it first began. I mean, you do realize that a lot of sci-fi's are woke. I mean, there's Andromeda until the later series where it went really, really wrong, there's Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis, Star Wars, X-Men.

But I don't see you on your pay saying we need to stop cis women accessing women spaces. So we can save little girls. I mean, if we put the same energy that haters like you have towards the trans community against cis men and women who harm children, we'd have that problem solved very, very quickly. But no, for such a strange reason, it's all the trans community's fault that these crimes happen when 10, 20, 30 years ago, it was blamed on people who were lesbian gays by sexuals. They wouldn't want them in the bathroom because kids should be near that the dangerous folk seriously. No. Most of those crimes are committed by cis straight men.

       " \" My guy I fear you're lost in the sauce. So let me try to help before you put your foot further in your mouth. You seem to be confusing descriptive and prescriptive notions of our society. Things that are descriptive are factually grounded and based in reality. Prescriptive describes what should be done. So descriptive refers to what is demonstrably true, and prescriptive refers to what ought to be. And according to data, what we descriptively know to be true about fraternities is, those associated with Greek life are at a higher risk of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Fraternity men have higher stereotypical gender attitudes than non-faternity men and sorority women. Fraternity men had higher rates of rape myth acceptance. And that fraternities are nexus of sexual violence on campuses. And being a male athlete or fraternity member is possibly associated with homophobic and transphobic attitudes. These are things that descriptively we know to be true. No one is saying that it should be that way, that it should be prescriptive. People are simply acknowledging that it is true. And thus, your identities are relevant as you exist in spaces and interact with fraternities. We know that men prefer to listen to women, that they disregard women's contributions, and they quite literally listen differently. Never mind that most fraternities were founded quite literally when pretty much only white men could go to college, and that they were socially exclusive groups on top of that. Descriptively, we know that social identities affect how different people interact with different groups of people. That's not a moral failing. That's not indictment of you or your friends specifically. We are just aware that your positionality is conducive to frat culture, whereas other groups are not and recognize that. People from ajouritarian groups take white or male or cisgender or heterosexual as negatives. When usually, we're just using them as markers of social interactions.\\n\",\n",

       " \" Also, I'm not sure today as a... Hi, hi, hi, hi! I'm really happy about everything you said, everything. Every point that you said was perfect. But I would like to just focus on exactly that sentence, whether it's where you say that Western ideologies are not going to come with Western bombs. But this is exactly place in the agenda that people like to hear that being queer is actually Western ideology, but it's not Western ideology. I am Arab. I am queer. We exist. We've always existed. And on a second note, I would like to remind everybody that all the homophobic law that came at least to my area and the one I read in, in West Asia, North Africa came with colonisation. And let me tell you about how it happened in Egypt. Okay, so I'm not going to really mention dates because I'm not really good at remembering dates, but this is exactly what happened. British colonisers were there, British soldiers were in Egypt. Egypt was colonised by the British for at least 80 years. And without, of course, adding up all the revolting against them, whatever we did again. But guess who was really, really, really working against the British? Sex workers in Egypt. And a small tiny influence, sex worker in Egypt, has never been illegal. Since ancient Egypt, there has been sex workers in Egypt, legally working part of the society, and it's a with respect to respectful job. Till the British came. And of course, they started working against the British. So, what did the British do? They went to street called Hayel as the K.N. Basically they burned the entire street. So according to some books, I think I read, but most of these books are in Arabic, so I don't know how to bring them here. But some books actually mention that they even went inside every single house and they threw all their, all of their cupboards, all of their wooden items, their furniture, all of their stuff, they threw it from top of the buildings, and they burned the entire street. And that's when they put one of the laws that now are taking home of, most of them, most of the people, almost of the gay or the LGBT community in Egypt. This law was basically that you cannot do anything against morality. This word doesn't even exist in Islam. This thing of like against nature, against morality, it absolutely does not exist in Islam. So, this is not Western ideology. So basically the first law, one of the first laws that were put in Egypt against the country, was put by the British to control sex workers. And that's it. Another case was also Lebanon by the French, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, by the French, Ghana, by the British. So we cannot ever say, we can never say, there's the Western ideology. It's as strong as just plays exactly for their agenda, for these homophores, these these homophobic people that they have always been always being a king there. A homophore became the killed everybody in the world, and they killed all the queers and all the gays. But I would like to also introduce you to an Iraqi researcher. His name is Mulsar Shadditi, and he's being attacked massively in this country, and Iraq. But he actually talked to me about the connection between the insane homophore that's happened in Iraq, and the connection with the American invasion. So basically after, I don't know if you know this or not, but Abu Ghirib, it's not incident. Torture accident that the, when the American soldiers basically started torturing Iraqi prisoners and, and they're, I don't know, dungeons and undergrounds or whatever, and the pictures emerged and all of us in the Middle East with all of us, we have seen all of us, have seen that my dad saw that and we were even using CDs to see these stuff because what did the Americans have, what look what if the Americans have done to us? The problem with this is, Mulsar Shadditi mentions this in his book, Ruguwa and Mostama El-Saba, which is basically a dirty turn of the colonized search, it's young, but he basically mentions how an act of love between two people, man, man, woman, woman, or non-binary people or whatever the gender was. These two acts used to be for love between people, till the American army came and they used to humiliate them. They used to significantly use sexual activities that could be, and could be consensual, and between lovers, to humiliate the men or to humiliate the population. And then you have an explosion of homophobia in the area. This is what happens. On a second thought, also, there's another book, remember the author's name, but it's called Ishtihhella, which basically meaning, fittishism of the Arabs, and it's talk about the entire history of how Europe just to perceive the Arabs and how they basically put a microscope on our sexuality and how we're doing things and don't get me wrong. Fucking Arabs were having so much fun, sex parties, gayness, queerness, and this is not Western ideologies. And we can ask the Ottoman Empire, the al-Kelifat, the Abbasid Empire, the Fatima Third Empire, all of them, we have existed in the Islamic nation in the big Islamic Uma, till colonialism and Europe started to come to us. Till the Western Christian ideology started to hitting us. Also, the last thing that I would mention in the book is to head out, which is the Fittishism of Arabs. It talks about how Western's Westerners or white people, when they came to Turkey, or they came to the Islamic Uma, and they saw all these sexual activities. They shamed us, they shamed us for it, and they called the Arabs the people that do saw to me. This is basically how they identified Arabs, are the people that you have in of sex. Because when one of the books actually they said, they were very relieved to find one share, one big king in the Islamic era that actually liked women. And they were very surprised because he was one and a kind for them. And it was how, finally, they found one that was decent like them. They shamed us for our sexual activities, and then they took it away from us, and then they categorized it, and then they started to say, let's be inclusive. This is what happened in our history. The last thing I would say is if you, if me, or Musa, shouldy-dee, what we've been trying to do for the lessons I came to France, basically look for my queer and her art, for my queer Islamic art, and guess where it is. It's in the Louvre, not your polyton. And Italy, I cannot have access to it. I do not have access to it. Musa, shouldy-dee, at the beginning of this book, we'll go on most cameras about, and if you want to take a send it to you, and we'll be trying to translate this book so many times, but these are a lot of funds. Of course, it doesn't play perfectly for the Western agenda. So at the beginning of his book, he writes a whole big paragraph about how many museums he thinks, for allowing him to take a look at our art, a him as a researcher, and basically he's saying, absolutely no thanks to the Louvre, or I think it's another British museum that refused to give him access, and they put all of the queer art in the fucking, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the closet, where I don't know what do you call it. Yeah, they can, in their storage. So basically not even people that can go there can see. I cannot find my queer art. I cannot find my queer Islamic art. I cannot find my queer african art, because it's still in the houses of Western elites, and it's not a Western ideology.

       " \" Personally, I don't have a problem with what they're doing over there in Peru, and I also feel that other trans individuals shouldn't see this as a problem either and let me explain. For one, here in America, when you go to the doctors to try to get on testosterone or estrogen, they are going to put you into mental disorder or mental illness category in order to basically make it medically necessary for you to transition. Because in the past, with other trans individuals fighting for our rights, they made it to where in the medical field, they see it as medically necessary to transition because it is classified as a mental disorder or mental illness. It is why I'm able to be who I am right now and is why other trans individuals themselves that choose to go through medical transition also are able to be who they are. Because the insurance does not see it as an elective anymore, they see it as a basically a necessity. So if you take away the fact that we are not mentally ill or have a disorder, then of course the insurance is going to feel the need to cover it. And I don't know about you, but I like much of testosterone being about 40 bucks every six months. That is cheap. And I'm blessed and privileged enough that insurance does cover a big portion of it because without that, it would be really expensive. The reason why activists have a problem with basically calling trans people mentally ill or having a disorder is because it is stigmatized in our society to have any of those things. And really in actuality, the activists that are against this are actually confirming making it seem like it's a negative thing to have a mental disorder or a mental illness. They actually took the time to normalize mental disorders and mental illnesses instead of trying to be say like, well, it's wrong to call it mentally mentally ill or is transphobic to call mentally ill, then they will make more progress. Look, it's not transphobic to say that someone like me has a disorder or mental illness. It is, I was not born in the wrong body. Okay, that is the reality. There was nothing wrong with how it was born. I wasn't born in her sex, nothing like that. My brain just does not align with my body. That doesn't mean I was born in the wrong body. That means I have a mental illness and mental disorder. There's nothing wrong with saying that. I don't feel crazy. I don't feel like I shouldn't be taking seriously or anything like that. I just needed help and I have that through the means of insurance, making it easier from it to access my medicine. And the more that we push reality into this, the more we're going to be taking seriously as a community. That's what I need to realize.\\n\",\n",

For me, I grew up in a really religious household so I just I didn't really have like the permission mentally to take a look at myself until I actually moved out of my parents' house I actually had to leave at their house while I was in college So I kind of just kept on pushing that part of myself down until I finally got my own place And I've self-reflective on this like so much since I've come out like over the past decade and I really don't think that I could have come out sooner Like I don't think I was in the mental place that I could actually do not and I wasn't in an environment where I felt good to do that I think it's so easy to forget how much the world has changed and even like the past decade like Just looking back when I came out gay marriage wasn't even legal in the US And the time I grew up in was obviously a lot more gay friendly than like the 90s or the 80s or any time before But it still wasn't friendly and I actually feel like it's detrimental to your mental health to your Furdier self as late blooming or anything like that like whenever you finally felt safe enough to do self-reflection That was the right time for you to do it and Just looking back when I was 22 and I was like really self-conscious about coming out late Nobody gave a shit. The age that I came out and to be honest I was single now and I was dating and when I give a shit when somebody came out either I'm just happy that you finally are Out I do think that people younger than me come out sooner than I ever did But I think it's because we live in a very different time and play as compared to even like 10 years ago So people who are later blooming coming out now, it's finally a safe environment to come out and to be honest Where I suppose I should say it's safe for now like I feel like there's so much positive representation within media At least like if I were growing up now, I would have felt So much more normal Self-reflecting on these feelings that I had always had But depending on the context of what you grew up in and also the environment that you were living in your 20s There may not have been that Space for you to safely mentally At least in the US I feel like there is very much a culture of meeting Your partner young and getting married in your 20s and if you Were kind of forced onto that highway of thinking you could very easily have gotten married to Someone of the office sex without having that time to mentally self-reflect So anyway, I guess the point of this is that I think whenever you got to that point where you could self-reflect And you could come out that was the perfect time to do it and You shouldn't judge yourself and you shouldn't let others judge yourself for how long it took you to get to that place This is whenever you got to that place.

Have you ever considered why it is not just for maybe a biblical theological perspective and for a basic plain reading of the text perspective, but also how it affects not just an individual on a mental, emotional, spiritual level, but also in couples, in broader contact group, context of group relationships, and then on a greater scale, a national level, a legislative level, and then even from a naturalistic point of view how it just makes us nothing more than just the animals, how it doesn't actually progress, it actually takes us backwards. There's nothing good objectively about sodomy. So I don't know why you're sitting here trying to act like this with this false dilemma that you invent. It doesn't do anything for your argument nor anything remotely. In fact, it actually makes my case that homosexuality is still as soon as the scriptures have said from the beginning. This is observable, understandable, knowable, testable, and you will be held accountable by an almighty God who created you as a sexual being with a right understanding of what is morally good and what is morally wrong. When you take away the boundaries of that morality that God is clearly established, sexuality is meant to be an honorable, glorifying thing made between a husband and their wife to create life and so forth. When you take those boundaries away from a society, guess what? You will have mayhem, you will have abuse, you will have traumas, and you will have the exact same thing exponentially more than even in a straight sexual relationship issues. So you can't even use that as an argument to say, oh well that happens just with straight couples too. No, not to the extremes that homosexuality does. So you know exactly what's happening. You know that it's wrong, you just want to do whatever feels good and withhold yourself from any real moral capability and accountability. So what did we lose when we try and act like it's not a sin? Morality, humanity, identity, community, society, mentality, and ultimately eternity.\\n\",\n",

Like, that is a giant inside joke in the fender, and I bet even on this video, I will have people in the comments saying her Usopp is so good. I don't think so. Like, people love this joke. Even though it is super unrealistic that Luffy and Chopper didn't recognize Usopp in his disguise. Like, all the other strawheads immediately recognized him, but only Luffy and Chopper didn't. And obviously, them not recognizing the fake strawheads as that is not exactly the same thing. But it is showcasing the same personality trait that Luffy and Chopper share. And that is that they don't assume that people are lying. And they take everything at face value. And so, even though it is annoying and it gives us a bad feeling that they can't recognize that those people aren't their crew members, it is, in my opinion, in character for them. And obviously, it is ridiculous, but so are a lot of things in one piece. Like, realism is never a point in one piece. And I don't really have a conclusion for this video. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this.\\n\",\n",
       " \" What's a coincidence that you think about a lot? I'll go-\\n\",\n",
       " \" So in 2018, my girlfriend and I decided to move from New York to Austin and we planned a day and then her work up pushed back. So I moved and then she was going to come like a month after that. So the first week on there, this girl that I kind of knew invited me to this entrepreneur dinner and at the dinner is like six people. Really the dinner I didn't really get to talk to is this guy right across this like circular table because it was like too big a table to talk to. But after the dinner, he drove us to this party in his Tesla and I never been in Tesla and I was like oh this is so cool and he said oh if you ever want to drive in one like let me know. I didn't even have my license but I didn't tell them that. So I go to a couple of days later. I've been awesome for a week at this point and I'd signed up before I moved for this like charity bike ride so I was like 50 miles from Austin because I'm like okay I'll get to know the city. 10 miles in I come off my bike, break my collarbone and the ride people are like we're going to call your emergency contact and I'm like well she's in New York so that's not really helpful. Obviously I didn't think I was going to have to use my emergency contact and they're like okay so if you should be cool. Now at the time I knew a lot of people in Austin. We were friendly but I'm not going to bother them on a Saturday to take me to the hospital. So they're like who should we call them? I'm like yeah I don't I don't have anyone to call and so they're like okay well we're going to have one of the volunteers take you. So they put me in the van they take me back to meet this volunteer and picture that's like lightly raining. I've been like crying. I'm just like this shabbled and clearly distressed and I see this Tesla roll up and who is the volunteer but this guy from the dinner that I didn't get to talk to but told me he would take me out in his Tesla. Well it's funny as I'm getting into this car like even though I'm like broken and upset I mean it's a dumb joke about the death from measures I would get to get a ride in this car again. So he takes me to the hospital. I go in and you know get looked at her at a vert and later he picks me out from the hospital we go and get let's start from the pharmacy then he like drives me home. He brought a whole tree of food for me and then I was going to my apartment. But there's like boxes of vert because again I just moved and my dog's there there he's like do you want me to walk your dogs and I'm like no no no it's fine like don't worry about it because I'm already phone-bought that I've taken up so much this time and he's like I'm just I'm just going to walk them. So he walked the dogs and then he left and then over the next week he would like check in and make sure everything was good and we ended up coming like good friends because he sees me at the like low point in my life I feel like and I don't know just built up trust but that's and so my girlfriend and like talk talk about this guy and she's in New York being like who the business guy like moving in in my girl. She's getting like paranoid but she wasn't wrong because cut three years later and he's my baby daddy. He's not a home wrecker because we're married and he's our donor and we have this like cool blended family night. In the moment I'm like oh I just moved Austin and my abboc broken collarbone like that's terrible but if I look back and was in the out I'm like actually that led to this which led to this and so yeah cool coincidence.\\n\",\n",

And he goes on with a valid point. What happens if his son goes over to his friend's house and does what he saw his dad doing? Now we all know that there's homophobes out there.

Second of all, trans women were peacefully using their restrooms that they identified with long before any of you were so focused on trans people. Now, a trans person just goes into the bathroom to have a quick wee or do a quick number too. If in these hypothetical thought processes where people are scared of a man entering the women's bathroom to grate someone, they wouldn't go through with either surgeries, years of psych evaluations, doctor appointments, hormone replacement therapy, the fact that you have to come out to your family, your work getting your legal sex changed, all the documents changed. And again, you could ask, well, I don't know all of this. I'm like, sweetie. The only time I am faced with trans phobia in my life is online because here I talk about the fact that I'm a trans woman and I disclose it. In my real life, I have never had an issue going into the women's bathroom. Women gladly talk to me when they hear my voice, they don't clog it. I have women coming over to protect me from men. However, do I agree with the fact that if you do not pass that you should not go into the women's bathroom or the men's bathroom yet? Well, yes, I do until you are passable in a sense of how the society views you. Yes, but also for your own good, for your own safety of not getting attacked as a trans person and also for the respect of everybody else. I do agree. But that is a topic for another day. But I'm so tired of seeing especially femme gay boys attacking trans women because the only fact that gay boys can exist in somewhat peace in a feminine presence. A lot of that you can fucking thank trans women, especially trans women of color and black trans women for that. That was all I had to say. I'm so tired of this discussion.\\n\",\n",

Now not get it to step, these are amazing jobs, astronauts, many doctors, you know, all you'll be walkers on all of that. But that is not all that feminism is about. Everything is missing that everyone has the right to decide where she wants to be of service in society, to what extensions she wants to be of service and should be respected as such. That is to say that if you want to be a housewife, go ahead, I for one, I follow a lot of housewives on TikTok and Instagram and I see how they take care of their man and their children and their household. It is so wholesome you cannot take away from that. I also follow lots of CEOs and they inspire me the way they break barriers, the way they run their company. Amazing. That is what feminism is about.

But this day I had just got off a work and I worked night So I got to work it like 2 a.m. And I stayed longer so it's about like 4 3 or 4 a.m. at the time and they just wanted to start arguing they were trying to get me to leave I didn't want to leave I'm like I'm not leaving like I'm tired I was like I'm not gonna leave right now.

They poured a half a gallon of water on me from French, you know cold ass pitcher They poured a pitcher of water on me Was at least a half gallon if not a full can they poured it all on me I wake up like trench like what the fuck So I feel like I'm getting water boarded because I'm getting water poured on me in my sleep Of course they started with my head right then after that they flipped me under the mattress and sat on it Then after they did that they did so much shit then they I fucking snapped They started throwing stuff on me throwing stuff on me and I finally snapped and I'm screaming Not I'm not even dressed at the time too I'm naked I'm screaming I'm getting the fuck away from me Leave me alone like you're such a bitch like I'm saying every fucking thing under the sun because I am Sleep deprived I had been drinking I'm exhausted I'm tired But no they wanted me out so what do they do pull out their phone and record me secretly and then show the cop I want to lie they laughed they're like I'm scared I'm scared for my life And I'm like why do you keep saying that they're like I'm scared for my life I'm like go fucking be scared away for me right now while I sleep Listen to our later cops come in it's dark and I see flashlights waking me up calling my names you know my some some more more of her reunion or do you have any weapons One I would never do that like Like how as a black person do you call the cops on another black person and say you fear for your fucking life And then try to say that you know I might have weapons like because why did the cops come with their weapons out pointing towards me Soaked in fucking bed but naked tired telling me that I had to fucking leave Long storage short after I showed that because they lied it said I wasn't released and I had a copy of the least The work I was on because I was on the fucking lease because I said I wasn't gonna move in with them unless I was on the least So I had got put on the lease So yeah after that they said they couldn't make either of us go But they kept saying go go go and after like three fucking hours of the police being there and saying they could have Make either of us go but they kept saying well, why don't you go because she kept saying She kept saying well, she's from here. She's from here. She is family here because again this happened in Hawaii Am I access from Virginia Mmm D&D motherfuckers But anyway, so eventually of course I ended up leaving and sleeping in my fucking car because I'm exhausted And the police couldn't make her leave and the police couldn't like me leave and I was like I don't want her to leave I just want to sleep and they're like well We can't make you leave but she doesn't want you here. Why don't you just stay with them? Leads since you know you have family here I just eventually got tired and I'm like it's not even worth the battle because I'm here to sleep And I'm obviously not gonna get any sleep so I just left But yeah, narcissists narcissists will do that. Marceus is love Like I just saw a video on TikTok where this other chick was like She was recording it but luckily she had another camera set up in the room and she got everything on camera with the Marceus's throwing water on her And then all this shit and then like acting surprised when she started recording Oh, you recording me you're gonna really pour water on me and then record me you're just sick in the head You need to go to you know, you need to go you need help Narcissists love telling people that you need help. They love telling people there's something wrong with you I mean honestly, I think they're just speaking to themselves through you speaking to themselves at you like you're a mirror Either way protect yourselves and side story later on they ended up taking the least because at a copy of the least on my iCloud They ended up going through my phone deleting the least from my phone And then someone the next time when this shit happened I Had no proof.

I was raised in very conservative Christian evangelical Appalachia. I didn't think there were any adults that I could safely tell about me having a crush on this guy and me liking boys and having known that for years at that point. Um, and so I was navigating a bunch of these, you know, big complex feelings for the first time by myself. There was only one adult that when I was in high school, like concretely, like explicitly knew that I was gay and they tried to send me to conversion therapy. So, uh, my fears were pretty well founded. And having nobody, um, that I could like process a lot of these feelings with meant that like I was dealing with them in very unhealthy ways. Like it's beyond cringe-worthy. Like, it was it was harmful to myself and others. When Facebook tries to show me like memories from that year of my life, I go back and I delete it. I, no, absolutely not. It wasn't until the summer between my sophomore and junior year of high school, uh, when I went to the West Virginia Governor School for the Arts for three weeks that I like looked around at other kids who were like the same age as me, who like got it. And I kind of realized and like, okay, living is something I can do. But like the struggle to get to that point, um, you know, was orchestrated by Christina Perry's hit song, Jar of Hearts.

They're not gonna be self aware of it They're not gonna be treating it as much and therefore I don't think that they should be running the country by that same logic like yeah I'm kind of making blanket statements here But I guarantee if you go like North Carolina to Portland, you know like North Carolina You got a coffee shop, you know Yeah, somebody if they're neurodivergent Maybe if you're in a major city, but if you're in the rural part that's definitely not gonna happen I've actually had friends move from like Phoenix like North Carolina, Texas basically those like like Southern hemisphere or Southern part of the country states and You know once they move to Seattle once they move to Portland once they move to New York You know once they move to California then They're starting to talk about stuff that they've never talked about before which is mental health and obviously it just goes back to the whole Trans issue where it's bad enough that we're just like taking away trans rights, but it's just like we're gas sliding trans people and to be in like no you don't know what your actual gender You are this way not that way.

They really wanted to let the P on the end and they've been doing this kind of stuff since like the 70s and it backfired. So now it's just this sort of blob of organisation that manipulate young people in their formative years that when you're 15, 16, 17, 18 and kind of smart you think you really know what you're doing but you don't. So then these young Gen Z people are just kind of like these little rebels with whatever random calls they've been told to think for the week for whatever reason. They have decided to boycott an institution like Lyat Foxen Tavern which is so funny because there's been a place, a safe place for gay people for years and it's almost like sometimes these young Gen Z people, they just get on a cause and just don't really understand what they're doing and they get used and manipulated for. Basically the powers that be don't want nightclubs there. So they somehow figure out how to get young people to boycott things that they're going to really need in a few years time and let people really enjoy going to, especially gay people and I feel like they just got used somehow to end the business and it's a crime shame and they think they're doing this for some positive reason but it just sounds like they got conned into, I don't even know why they've got it but they've got conned into thinking it's best not to go to a place that's been housing gay people for years in some sort of, for some political bit, it's actually quite sad really, it's quite silly but yeah, I'm happy that there are gay people that are actually just coming out of the closet and saying actually I don't like that movement and hasn't really done anything. And from somebody I feel like it just doesn't actually help straight and gay people understand each other more. I just think it's just trash and I think it's a corrupted, a corrupted movement that's actually deep seated in perverts.

The problem is once you get rid of the people who make the least, which arguably is working class people, you have no more working class people. Also removing the bottom line by removing poor people doesn't remove the bottom line it just makes the bottom line higher. If you watch this far, I can explain it to you very easily. So here is our helpful little drawing. So what this person is saying, if you get rid of this class of person over time, the economy gets bigger. But what you see once you have no more poor people, the bottom line becomes lower class. And then the lower class becomes replacement for being poor. So if I just now the bottom line is middle class. Do you see where I'm getting at? And once you get rid of middle class, all you have is rich.

People that identify as part of the LGBTQ plus community like myself can have a relationship with God. I myself who identifies as a gay man has a very confident relationship in my own relationship with God. You do not need to identify a straight to have a relationship with God, which would make that point invalid. I don't understand this narrative of people fighting against gay marriage, like it's a positive or productive thing for society. Like, they wake up every day and put on the top of their agenda to take our rights away. And that could go for other attacks on other communities as well. Carison, like many others, I'm me and you to mind your business. I'm not forcing you to marry a man. You can marry a woman like you already have, and I don't mind. But people that want to marry outside the typical heterosexual relationship should have that right as well. I myself who identifies a gay man like I said before will and once a marry a man one day, because that's how God created me.

I have been avoiding trying to do stitches on my page right here because this page is strictly from my art form. But as somebody who doesn't art form that also takes over what this person just attacked, I'm just going to go ahead and make this stitch. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say time and place for people who are just wearing something that is just different for their gender. Billy Porter didn't walk out on a sesame street wearing a bra and candy set, flapping it out. No, he wore a dress, a dress, mind you something that I have seen tons of people to the women wear on sesame street. The problem doesn't come down to the fact of what he was wearing. The problem comes down to the fact that you're not like a man wearing a dress. And then on top of that, you have the nerve to sound like Billy Porter and still get on here and act that way. Because if you're going to think somehow these people are going to be like, you're the one, you know, no, baby. Conservative still don't like you. The people who have a problem with men and dresses still don't like you. This is because you validate their feelings in your head. They still don't like you. I don't want my son to say that. I wonder why. Because heteronormativity and all of the world has told you that there's something wrong with the way somebody wears a particular fold of fabric. No, this is fabric, y'all. It's just cut and shaped fabric that is used to also wear men's clothing. And you were like, well, if Billy Porter had been in a suit, out of being so bad. I just, I just try, girl, know you wouldn't have, you would have had something to say then. And to be honest with the fact of matter is, I don't even think you're even watching the day of episode talking about, I don't want my son to see that. I don't want my son to see that. Well guess what? Mimi, he saw it. Y'all need to talk about this stuff early on that there are people that are different. Because I'm going to go ahead and say this, a person about a week ago named Deilicious was just traveling, local drag queen in Philadelphia. Don't know the full circumstances, but essentially the person was attacked by a group of teenagers. The four being different was jumped by a group of teens for being different and succumbed to his injuries for days later. And I say he because that is the pronouns that he wanted to be called. Was died from the, from the injuries a few days later. All because these teens, these kids had been taught that people that are different than you, men that wear dresses or makeup or are too feminine or too this are somehow less than you. And you don't know what type of mindset a person is going to have. Even though those are kids or your kids or your son and your daughter, you don't know what type of mindset they're going to have. You don't know what type of crazy they're going to be. So you don't know where they're going to go with that. And you don't know what type of validation they're looking for from their friends. My person is dead because of that. And I know you may fit, well that has nothing to do with it. BS people should understand that there are people who are different because when they don't understand that there are people that are different, they attack that which they do not understand. And people die because they decided to wear a different fold of fabric than you. It's honestly disgusting and I have zero respect for homophobes. Like homophobes, the way the church goes, I don't know if I can love my son anymore because he's gay or I don't know if I can love my child, my daughter anymore because she's gay. It's the way I look at them. I go, I don't want your love. I honestly am disgusted by you. I don't like you. I don't like homophobes. The way they look at gay people is the way I look at them. I just think you're disgusting. I don't like you. It's been enough time that you should understand this should be talked about. The fact of the matter is we have teenagers and kids that watch Drag Race and go, hey, that's me. I see me. There's a kid who's on a watchbelly porter and go, hey, that's me. I see me. But instead you got some parents who wouldn't like it if the baby porter was in a suit. They wouldn't care. They don't like anything that's different and would have a problem, anything, anything that was different. They would have a motherfucker problem. Please try to be yes. Also, baby, let it go. I have seen several of you very effeminate black gay men on this app talking about we didn't need to see that on the sesame street. There's a time in place. Where's the time where's the place? Because I'm sure that time in place to you is never. People don't have to do, when most of you consider drag, don't have to do that in your time in your place. Baby, I grew up on Mrs. Doubtfire, him, Madea, ain't no time in place for them. Kids watching them, kids watching Tyler Perry. I grew up on so much drag and ain't nobody had an issue or a problem with it. Now all of a sudden, y'all got issues and problems with it talking about I don't want my children to see that. Baby, you grew up on that. You grew up on that. You grew up on so Mrs. Doubtfire. You grew up on some big amount of sounds. It's a dress. It's a fold of fabric. Essentially, it equates to a robe and you have not much of a panic attack about it. Sit down. Sit down and shut up. Also, this idea that you have, that you said something where you were like, we thought it's a little bit that's that agree. And the reason I make a fun of the way you talk is because you have the nerve to sit there and talk like that, the way that a lot of us talk and sit there and have the audacity to sit there and make fun of somebody is insane to me. But this fact that you're saying we fight for acceptance, not a grunts. And you said it with your whole chest, like you had said, it's not special. It's an agree it's not exclusive. We fight for the ability to be understood. We fight for the ability to be left alone. That's what we are fighting for. Acceptance? Yes. I don't need you to understand me. But what you're going to do is respect me. What you're going to do is lead me alone. I want the ability to live my life and be left alone. If I'm not hurting anyone or myself, I'd like the ability to be left alone. That's what you're not getting, baby. And it's people like Billy Porter. It's people like us, the ones who dare to be different. And dare to go, there is no such thing as time or place because you'll never care for the time or place that make it easier for people like you to do what you need to do. The ones of you that are mad at Billy Porter and have something the same, we are the ones who make it so you can't have an easier life. Because that's what changes never made by the people who are just going with the flow. It's never made with you. That's the people who dare to be different. It's the people who dare to break norms. It's the people who dare to be different. Maybe we are the ones that make change. and people like you getting our way. And I just want to go ahead and let it be known that if this was during slave days, you would be one of those people that Harriet Tubman would have to pull out to get on. You would. I very much know it. You would. And guess what? I'm the gay Harriet Tubman and I'm going to pull out again because we can't do this. This can't be. Okay? This can't be.\\n\",\n",

You're refusing to acknowledge all of the terror attacks that Palestinians have committed against Israelis and against Jews since before Israel was a state. And let me put this out there for you right now. So it's not so black and white in your head because that's the way that you're perceiving it. This is not a genocide. This is a war that was committed by age group on October 7th. Age group terrorizes their own people, Palestinians. There are actual videos of Palestinians thanking IDF soldiers for saving them and trying to rid them of age group. But another fun fact for you, if you don't know this, in 2006, that's when the Palestinian people elected age group as their ruling government. Did you know in Muslim culture it is forbidden to be gay? It is frowned upon. It is almost, it's basically illegal. Did you know in Judaism, we don't care.

Yeah, I do feel like there are first of all there's no wrong, nothing wrong with you have a strong preference either you are more attracted to ethnicities other than your own, so it's like biodirectional, some people prefer to date no Asian man and some people they prefer Asian and they have special time for this called Rice Queen or Samsung like that. Yeah, I think why like gay Asian man they feel sometimes disadvantaged or it's not in a position that you can choose how many choices. I think it's in the gay community that works like a Mexican identity to a large extent so just naturally gay Asian men tend to mature relative late so in that case they will have their body here like in a late age then maybe other races also yeah some people just tend to have less body hair, facial hair which are loved by the gay community in general so the reality is neck data also especially people like me who were born just naturally more feminine I would say I'm not definitely to know the one of the popular types in the gay community. I think like people like me are really identified as a twink when I was younger yeah I kind of relate to those feelings like especially for me in my case I'm I'm felt particularly attracted to people with small body hair, facial hair so I felt it was difficult for me to get a response from the type I'm attracted to when I identify as gay but the irony is that after I didn't explore my family side just be comfortable with my femininity I identify as you know whatever you call it gender fluid cross dress dress, dress, pre-up transgender I received so many so much more attention from straight guys you know for gay men straight guys are like unreachable because they are they're just not into name masculinity but after I transition or identify the other side people just approached me so many people straight guys who would approach me and ascension me their pictures without me asking that's a very interesting thing the experience like a flipped very drastic contrast how people react to you for me I personally enjoyed the letters why I kind of want to steal to express my femininity rather than try to force myself to be masculine which I didn't enjoy from the very beginning I didn't know how to be masculine and didn't I even resisted to dress like very formal masculine clothes like a suit to be that typical webroom to you know image and I never wanted to gain muscles to grow big my body so yeah and that's one thing I want to let people know maybe I think many people transition from like they identify as gay to then become transgender they would feel so but nobody has mentioned that talked about it I was a little surprised but for this were curious about it there was the difference between these two kind of experiences it is like that you don't even need to ask straight men they were sent their pictures to you without like an unsolicited way but the point I want to make here is that I think the Asian men especially in the gay community they do because they sometimes they are portrayed as less masculine, lessness attractive not just to gay men but also to you know heterosexual girls but I just want to tell you that it's not like that I think we should try to have more self-love self-ass there's one person there we all want that approval or took it as a compliment or even a trophy you know as a verification of our beauty no you don't need to do that first of all I do think there are many Asian guys are very very attractive despite they don't you only have facial hair or they have less body hair I mean even I'm prominently attracted to those features as we all feel this way so it's not just about physical appearance and different types of physical experience are attracted in different ways to different group of people and especially to girls and to feel like because now I have a lot of experience dating these triggers I do feel it's not just about their physical appearance or attractiveness it's the whole package you know many factors many elements of faculty in that kind of situation in that chemistry and another very a little bit of sense to the topic is about the you know down there the size I think you guys really needed to it's that is not tied to any ethnicity or race according to my personal experience because you know guys do send me pictures without me asking so I was forced to see these pictures it's really not not dependent on the race on the ethnicity and you know even for for the experience pleasure it's not it's not just the size it's also all the interactions and just want to make that point\\n\",\n",

And I read some of the comments that were pretty interesting. Some of them were questioning baptism, some of them were saying, this is brainwashed, all this stuff. Listen, Aidan has an amazing testimony. God has been so faithful in his life. He's been faithful in my life and in my wife's life. And so it's been cool because seeing Aidan before this moment, he was a good kid, but we all have stuff that's going on. As you see, Aidan made the decision to be baptized. And after that moment, if you ask him, he's like, bro, my life was radically changed. Not by me, not by worship, music or by, but it was by Jesus. By Jesus Christ, his life was changed. And so it was so cool to see what God has been doing in his life. So, Aidan, I'm proud of you for standing up for your faith in a world that tells Christians, hey, you need to sit down, Aidan's standing up and he's being a leader in his school and in our community here. And so, people are wondering, hey, what's baptism? I wanna give you a brief explanation. Baptism is a physical representation of what's going on in our heart. That water resembles a grave of like, hey, when I go into this water, the old me is buried. Everything that I have been struggling with, everything that I have been, maybe that's been weighing me down, it's staying in that grave and I'm coming up and I'm made new. I'm a new person. I'm a new creation in Christ, according to Second Corinthians 517. And so, man, it's awesome. Aidan, I love you and I'm so proud of you.\\n\",\n",

If any of you all are new and you haven't been following this journey, what I've had done is I had my brows contoured. It's called a Type 3 forehead contour. And they reduce the brow bone from the side. In the front, it's not as big of a difference, but you can probably see if you're looking at the original part of this video or the stitch from the video. So then that, what we did is we put a little bit of fat in the ball of my cheeks and then a little bit in my lips as well. And I also did some hair implants, which I think you're coming in really well. You can see kind of the difference of the longer hair up here and that as it's coming in, but it's six months, it's going to be a full year and a half before the hair implants are all like where they need to be. So that one, I have to really be patient for. The healing has gone so well. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I just couldn't have. It's, it's been wonderful. Oh, and here's a better view from the side, just like how smooth out this is. I'm just, I'm so grateful for having been able to have the surgery. It's, it has completely changed my life.

       " \" Well, there's a couple of reasons why they blew up this artist, not godly artists, which is a weird term to use, a godly artist. Like are they chosen by god? I don't know dude, that makes no fucking sense. But the reason why they chose that artist for Eurovision was because she was non-binary and shows the spectrum of genders that actually exist in reality. Also, they chose her because she's representing Celtic paganism. And in Ireland, Celtic paganism is a big thing, you know, it's kind of how we got Halloween and stuff. And the kind of the point of Eurovision is to represent the country you're from in that country's culture. Like I'm sorry you want Eurovision to be all about your religion and your faith and your culture. But that's not what Eurovision is about. It's about celebrating your culture and the place that you're from. And Celtic paganism is a big part of Irish culture in history. That's nothing to do with Satanism or evil or wickedness, whatever you fucking said in this video. Ireland just chose an artist that was good at representing not only Dell GPT community, but also their culture and history. But if you want to blow up godly artists, simple. Tell them to make actually good fucking music. Music that represents the culture and society that they live in. And then maybe just maybe the Eurovision committee will choose that song to represent their country. So get out of your high horse and realize that other religions and other cultures exist in around the world. It's not all Christianity.\\n\",\n",

So one would assume that most people that go there are, in fact, queer, or at least part of the LGBT community in a way. So when I was there with my friends, I saw this guy that I thought was really cute, okay? He looked nerdy, but then was dancing and had this confident vibe to him. So I was immediately attracted to him and I commented with my friend, like, oh, that guy, that guy's super hot, super cute, I'm into him. And my surprise, he said, oh yeah, I know him. I was here last time I spoke to him and we hung out for a bit and he was dancing in the stage and everything. So I was like, oh, fantastic, I have my way into the conversation. So when that guy and my friend were speaking, I kind of went to them and I was like, oh, you two are friends and made conversation with the guy. And then maybe it was my mood or a drink or two, but I was more confident than average for a night out. So I said to the guy, look, you are cute, can I have your number kind of thing, right? And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, took my phone, put his number, gave me the phone back. So I was like, okay, okay, like things are going well, go grab a drink, come back to the dance floor and then I was dancing with him, right? At a certain distance, but I was dancing to him and then I tried to get closer to him to dance just with him. And as I do that, he kind of like steps back. And I took that as a sign of like, okay, maybe he's just here to kind of like vibe and have fun with his friends or whatever. And he just comes to dance and not really to meet people, I guess. So I was like, okay, no worries. Still, he's still hot, still cute, whatever. I will just vibe. The next day, I messaged the guy. Oh, like I've never seen you before on gay town, because like the queer events kind of happens in a venue that is a bit separate from the local gay bars area. So I said, look, I've never seen you around, that you usually go out, you should tag along with us next time we go out and everything. And he's like, yeah, I never go there. I'm not gay, I'm straight. And I was like, what the fuck? I had references for my friend. I was like 99% sure he was by gay, whatever, right? And I was like, look, just out of curiosity, why do you go to that event if you are straight? And he told me that he goes there because it's where he feels like he can be whatever he wants to be or dress how he wants to dress and like dance how he wants to dance without, I guess the pressures of straight culture or something? I don't know. Like my friend said that, oh, maybe he's like straight and going by or he's starting his journey or whatever, but in this case, as I take people for their work. So, you know, if he tells me he's straight, he's straight and that's it until he tells me otherwise. So it kind of like the conversation died down and I moved on, but it was such a shame because it was like the day I got confident to kind of like go to someone and ask for their number. And he knew my friend. And my friend had told me they had danced before in the stage on the queerest event in Liverpool. So I was like, you know, it's my shot, it's going to be a hit and then it wasn't. So yeah, it is what it is, right? But it's funny how even straight guys will feel the pressure of acting, you know, they have to work a certain way. So these guys going to queer events, just to escape from that world, even though he's straight. So at least he didn't have a girlfriend because he told me he was trying to get with the girls there. And funny enough, the next month I saw him again and kind of laughed about the situation. But yeah, that's it.\\n\",\n",

Like their older, they're not in nets, like they still have brains, they can learn to use technology, like my 97 year old Nan like we sat down with her and showed how to do it and she was like oh that's really cool, they're really easy, I'll know how to do that again in the future, that's it, that's all it takes, like old people they're not stupid, they can learn how to do things and also like if somebody really doesn't know how to use QR code or maybe doesn't have the technology to be able to use it which I know some people don't, I really don't care if people just drop me a text to be like, by the way, didn't really know how to use it so just let you know we can come and then I asked them what food they want because that's one of the choices on the QR code and that's it, it's done, for me as a bride doing QR code has been so much easier than anything else because I don't have to like it just all goes into a Google form then goes into a spreadsheet form or may I like look at the responses put in spreadsheet and that's it, so for like me as a bride it saves so much admin because I'm not constantly chasing people up like it's easy, most people receive the invite and just did it straight away, it takes 30 seconds. The main reason why me and my fiance decided to go with QR code over the traditional like post it back is because postage is so free expensive now, like we weren't about to ask people to go to the post office to post the letter or go and buy a whole book of stamps just to send us our invite back because like most people don't have stamps in their house nowadays, like especially young people like I personally don't, I don't remember last time I used stamps, so I'm not going to ask people to go and go all the way to post office, buy stamps, post it and with the state of our postal system right now who knows if things will even apply, reply, even arrive back here, like really like is it going to? Probably not, then I'm going to be chasing people up and it's just going to be an nightmare, like QR code speaking for a bride's perspective is so much easier, so much easier, I don't get the problem, I really don't.\\n\",\n",

You can buy my musical bandcamp even if you want to donate on PayPal or something. That's good. But just by sharing this video and sharing my music on Spotify you are doing a lot. Thank you so much to everyone.\\n\",\n",

So naturally I was intrigued But I did want clarification because I didn't really sit well with me Although he was initially charged with first-degree murder It was brought down to a lesser charge because he didn't actually commit the murder He was just driving the getaway car of his friend who then murdered somebody But yeah, I never talked to him again after that Thank God I finally found my husband because it is scary out there.
