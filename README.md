# TikTok Project?

## TikTok API
### Getting started
The [TikTok API documentaiton](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/about-research-api/) describes how to use it. We have created a [notebook](/notebooks/1.0-mahf-tiktok-api-fun.ipynb) to explore the use of this API. 

### Setup TikTok API access
To access TikTok API, you need a `client_key` and `client_secret`. These are to be put in a `/secrets/` directory. To set this up, copy [`/secrets_template/`](/secrets_template/) as such
```
cp -r secrets_template secrets
```
Fill out the `/secrets/tiktok.json` file with your secrets, and it should work.
