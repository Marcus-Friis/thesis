    "voice_to_text": "so this video reminds me of the Todoroki family and uh my Hero Academia and spoilers for My Hero Academia obviously but right I do wanna say first and foremost I think that Angie Todoroki aka endeavor is such an interesting character I think he's very well written and very well crafted um is he a terrible person yes I do think he's a terrible person his arc for atonement is very interesting to see as throughout the series we understand the effects of his authoritarian parenting style towards his children mainly towards Shoto who is very open about the fact that he does not like his dad at all and he only uses his ice quirk despite the fact that he has like an ice and fire quirk and you know we learn about one thing that we do learn about endeavor is that he wants to surpass all might he wants to be the number one hero he wants to be the top dog and he wanted that desired it so much when he was a younger hero and there was a huge ambition in drive of his and when he did not get that he interested to a quirk marriage essentially an arranged marriage and he marries Ray who has an ice quirk because he wants to have children who have a fire and ice quirk to create the ultimate hero but because of this ambition this leads to a neglect in emotional support and familial love within the family and thus he pushes his children with very harsh and very tough um training methods to try and make them into the ultimate hero now as you what may well know as an m H a watcher okay uh he has Toya his first child who only has the firework and Toya wants so badly and so desperately to gate to keep his father's attention to keep his father's love and he's driven by the desire of his father's approval now he's driven to the desire to the point where he pushes himself to very dangerous limits and I'm reading some notes that I have on my computer screen just let you know and it's really sad to see this because his father is disappointed that he only has a fire quirk despite the fact that he is still talented there is still obviously potential with in Toyota there's obviously something with in Toyota that he can you know mold and mend and like build into a strong hero but because he is not the example child or the golden child as Shoto turns out to be he abandoned him the same way he abandoned for Yumi and Natsu which is very disappointing and it's really tough to watch this um because then Toya pushes himself and pushes his limits to the point where he sets the forest on fire behind the south and also sets himself on fire which is very sad to watch and it's really heartbreaking because for the most part in the show you know there is a bad guy you know there is an abusive dad but there is something underlying there's something there it's like you bad but there's something else there we don't know what it is and when we finally find out how Toya dies and what happens to Toya we'll find out that Toya isn't dead Toya is Dobby and I think that's such an interesting reveal to have the fact that there is a villain a villain that's been terrorizing the city the city that you are meant to protect this villain is your son that you thought died and you pushed him to the limit because you wanna be the boy hero you wanna be a top dog you only had children so that they would carry on your name and your legacy and do what you couldn't do and then when you got what you wanted and you weren't happy about it you decided to you want a redemption and then you find out that your son the son you've been mourning the son you've been trying to the son that you were crying over is been alive this whole time and he became a villain and he hated you so much he was ready to set it off he said a nomu after your ass bro he said a villain after your son the son his brother his own brother that he used to cry to his brother used to play with that's how much he hates you bro the abuse was terrible I shouldn't be laughing it's honestly awful but like to build a story to write a story to create a character like that it's crazy it's also crazy to me cause when I go back and like I reread the manga I can't believe I didn't see it because Toya is like such a powerful villain and just because his flames are blue you don't expect like you don't think anything of it because like they're playing characters in My Hero My Hero Academia that have very similar quirks you know there are only so many quirks that you can have so it's not like the first person to think oh every single kid who has a fire quirk is Endeavor's child that's not likely but he does kinda look like him but you can't really tell because Toya is like you know a little bandaged up you know what I mean I just found I just find Toya's story to be so interesting and then seeing that in comparison with Shoto the Golden Child because Shoto for longest time didn't wanna use his firework he didn't like his dad he didn't care about his dad and it wasn't until the sports festival and Midoriya is like use it it's your quirk like having a therapy session in the middle of battle ha ha that's what I love about me my Hero Academia come on now Midoriya I love him so much and seeing Midoriya push Shoto to use his quirk thus pushing him to grow and develop and become a more powerful hero and to really like hone in on his power understand that it is his own he makes it his own he doesn't worry about what his father thinks or the pressure his father put upon him he needs to become his own person and to see him change due to that is something that's amazing and so impactful and I love it other things I wanna add really quickly there are people who don't like Ray the mother because she entered into the Cork marriage listen if somebody enters into an arranged marriage they don't really have any other options and I understand that Ray neglected his her children and and everything and being a neglectful parent is also a form of abuse however we can acknowledge the fact that she was neglectful towards her children as she was also a victim of endeavors abuse physical and it is implied sexual as well okay so let's not go too hard on my girl right and also I see people who are mad at Fuyumi Fuyumi uh Shoto's older sister because she tries to have family dinners with them and I want you to understand something there is always the kid in the family that tries to build the bridge and build the gap between the children and the parents cause there are gonna be kids that don't talk to their parents for whatever reason for whatever they've dealt with in their childhood and there will be that one kid that does talk to their parents that does build their relationship that doesn't end it and wants everyone else to do it as well because they wanna be one big happy family for you me wanting to do that is does not make her a bad person it doesn't make her an abuse apologist she is also a victim of Endeavor's abuse because endeavor neglected her because she wasn't powerful because she didn't have a strong of a quirk as Toya did or as Shoto did he did not you know train her or hold her skills or probably even pay attention to her really and also for you me is a woman and oftenized women are sidelined in my Hero Academia so like I find it so ridiculous that people don't like her character and on Natsu I think Natsu is a great character I think it makes sense that he doesn't like his dad even though his dad killed the Nomu doesn't mean he has to forgive his daddy be like oh I'm gonna forget the fact that my dad was an abusive asshole and is the reason why my brother is dead cause he thought his dad was the reason his brother died for that long and also endeavour put that on himself as well but he still did the hero work he still went back to work he still did the thing he was doing like it didn't change anything you know you lose your son because of the ambition you put on your children and yet you still continue to do what you're doing so we don't learn is that what it is and I also wanna say in terms of Endeavor's redemption arc there are a lot of people that are so quick to forgive endeavor he's a fictional character I understand that but let's understand endeavor like he's a real person and this is a real life scenario if he never really wants redemption if he really wants to atone I feel like you need to step away from the hero work we need to step away from the agency we need to spend time with our kids okay we need to do some real work possibly talk to the psychologist you know what I mean like actually put in some effort to make this happen because it's gonna be a lot harder than that and I feel like it never thinks it is mine if I'm a great hero from a good hero if I die while working then my family will be happy and he feels like his family will be happy if he's dead if he's not there if he's not around and in my eye I feel like you can have that with you there it just takes work it just takes you not doing the same thing you were doing before because the things you were doing before did not work now so while we continue to do that you know what I mean anyways that is my analysis on the Todoroki family um if you liked it great follow me I'm honestly gonna keep making more videos with my Hero Academia because the show the anime is almost over the manga is wrapping up and I love it so much I think it's one of my favorite shows in anime so yeah hope you enjoyed it",

And we know the islands in one piece are the size of continents. This makes this attack much larger than it actually seems. Now, ace created an average star, and he lost to the black hole. Perfectly written. A star losing to the black hole. Perfectly written. What are stars made up out of? Giant balls of hot gas. Mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. There's actually saying nothing that ace can't create stars. It just supposed to have its own self of gravity, which it was actually shown to have. And on top of everything, Blackbeard actually calls it the sun. The man that ate the yummy yummy no meat. The man that possesses the black hole is acknowledging he's fighting something similar to the sun. You really can't debunk that this is a star. And you really can't debunk that ace's star level because he did create a star. Thanks to all the Naruto fans, we know you scale to your creation feats. So they're gonna stay consistent with their own logic and give this feat to ace from one piece.",

    "voice_to_text": "Do a job that pays the bills and use your hobbies to emotionally fulfill. I've been on TikTok since, like, early 2019. TikTok has always been for fun for me. It was never. I never thought of it as a job. 2019 to this past year. So December of 2023, I made maybe, oh, November of 2023, I maybe made 70 bucks on TikTok. It was a no means reliable for me just to quit my job. And throughout that time, I about had 20 k, 15, 20 k followers. I had a good amount of followers, but I was just like, I gotta work, you know, I gotta help, you know, providing everything. From 20. Too old. To be fair. 2019 to 2022, I was in college, so I didn't really, like, I didn't really need to work, uh, and pay off bills and everything. But from when I graduated, from 2022 to now, I was. I got bills to pay. I never really thought as content creation being my full time job. I know, you know, people hate the TikTok shop, but I've had other opportunities outside of the TikTok shop to actually make money with TikTok. And from December, I paid for my rent. December, January, and February just with being a TikTok content creator. And I never thought I would be able to do that. And with people like King Lion, my dude and d. And just other, you know, Tik Tokers I've seen, or I'm Connected with. I'm like, Yo, I could. I could actually do this, you know, cause I know I'm not built to work for people. I hate working for other people just cause we just don't match up. Don't get me wrong, I'm a hard worker, but um, I've had, you know, bosses, I was like, I'm not giving your vacation time, I'm not giving your PTO. Oh, why? If you don't like, really just. We don't match up. So right now I'm like, yo, if I can get this content creation thing rolling, like, I'm, I'm gonna. I guess I can see myself doing this for a living because it, it's, it's fun and I enjoy, genuinely enjoy it. All this to say, if you wanna become a content creator or if you wanna pursue any other dreams, just do it. Just do it. Don't care who's looking at you. Don't care who's, you know, making fun of you. When I first started TikTok, people were like, why are you making videos about anime? Why you dancing on the screen? Blah blah, blah. I was like, I don't. I just don't give a fuck. Honestly, just don't care. Once you get out of that, that mental block and just start posting videos, bro, you will build a following, you will build a community. You. You like. There's. There's nothing limiting you at all.",

Naruto is the biggest glazer in all of anime. Looking up at the sky, seeing a shooting star, having nothing but happy thoughts, and you start gripping your bed sheets thinking about another man is nuts. The craziest thing about Naruto is that if you go back and watch, the friend that was there for him the most isn't even Sasuke. It is Shikamaru, and it's not even close. While all the other kids in the village were laughing and ridiculing distant themselves from Naruto, Shikamaru was the only character since the beginning that was supporting Naruto all the way. Almost the entirety of Shikamaru's life, this man was groomed to be Naruto's advisor. It is absolutely insane when you think about it. Even since Asuma's death, the only level of TIP writing I think compares to Naruto writing Sasuke is Madara writing Hashirama so much that he merged part of his body with Hashirama's. This just inspired me to make an entirely new video on the biggest meat riders in anime history. Let me know if you guys want that video and comment down below who belongs on that list.",

I did a few different color versions, but I ended up liking the white lace the most. The official death note artwork is so gorgeous. They really missed out on so much opportunity. I get a more basic jumper as well. I just love double way designs with the two sides. The jumper is more like daily wear, too. The Shinigami have beautiful designs too. And wings on the back is a classic. Is very loosely, obviously death note merch, which I get is a problem, but it's inspired by Misa's outfits more directly. Blue jeans.

    "voice_to_text": "Please give us another voice actor for this time skip of Boruto, cause I do not need this cold ass version of Boruto sounding like Avatar Korra. So we actually already know how Boruto is gonna sound during the time skip and he sounds fine. I can't believe you went this far, Kawaki. Now don't get it twisted. I will call a spade a spade, and I will admit that his voice is high pitched for 16 year old male. But for reference, here's how I sounded at 16. He had to combine jutsu with the toads, which he did try to teach Naruto. He also had chakra ninja jutsu, and Naruto only had wind type chakra, so you wouldn't be able to learn the shit in the first place. The fact of the matter is, some dudes, including yours truly, are just simply born with a higher pitch voice. Is the way god made us man. I don't think there's anything wrong with Boruto having a higher pitch voice because it's something that can genuinely happen in real life. And I can't really speak for Naruto because I haven't reached my 30s yet, but you know, that's not unheard of either. We have a couple of famous people who have higher pitch voices as well, like Chris Tucker for example. And I'm about to whoop your old ass, man, cause I'm sick of playing games. You, me, everybody's ass around here. Him, Kaja, kaja! I'mma kick his ass! I'm Taking it, Kaja. Let me have it! Lee, no! Lee, no! Kaja!",

And y'all know how I feel about the frog rolls. Bro. Put him in the Naruto verse and they wipe the floor with every single person. Minato is not touching this dude. Not touching him? Not only would he not touch him because he's a low yeah, but he's also not touching him cause he massively outscale him in terms of spear. You kidding me? This is a no diff fight. Literally Caesar's clones is all that you need. You need one of Jesus clones to put Minato in the fucking ground bro, he's barely even city level. Fucking father out of here bro!

    "voice_to_text": "Do you not know if I have it in me to attend big name anime conventions anymore? So I have a couple of questions at the end, but don't worry, it's not gonna be like, oh, was it really that bad? No, I believe you. Because, um, I've been hearing every single year that these big name conventions are fucking ridiculously bad. Personally, I think it's because we live in an age now where parasocial relationships are so prevalent, and I think COVID had something to do with it. I, I am, I'm not particularly sure because I've only been to two cons, and I'm doing, um, another one, um, next month. Um, but I do believe that the reason that connect again is just gone out the window completely is because parasocial relationships is. Is one of them, and people just don't seem to give a fuck anymore. That's what I've seen. I mean, again, I've only been to two cons and they've been kind of small. Um, but I, I think it's just people just don't give a fuck anymore and they just want to get their own selfishness out there. And I feel like some people kind of thrive on a power dynamic as well. Um, it's just my, um, thoughts, but that's just the way I see it. I haven't experienced anything of what you've experienced, but I've, and what others have experienced. But I do feel for those that have went through shit like that. So this is where the questions come in. This one's for you. How, uh, what was your most positive experience at a con? Because it just seems like there's a lot of negative press when it comes around cons over the last few years, and I kinda want people to be a bit more positive about their experiences. So what was your, um, most positive experience, uh, at a con? And the second question is, and this is to everyone that sees this video. Um, what things about connect, again, can you tell me, as someone who's only been a two cons, what about it again, can you tell me, what. Can you advise me on? Um, just shit like that, you know what I mean? Um, and what experiences have. Of other people had like that? Yeah. Just to put it out there, what experiences have you had at these cons? Um, you can tag us in the video, you can, uh, put a comment down, whatever. Um, I just wanna know people's experiences because it seems like cons are getting more negative press and more negative experiences are coming out of them. Um, it. It's just my own research, really, but yeah. I'm sorry that you've had a really bad time."

    "voice_to_text": "Which anime antagonist to impact the main character the most. You see who we got, baby? Okay, so we all know the correct answer is Aizen, but when we look at this other list, when I look at the other list, like, I just don't see how they impacted their character is more than Aizen. Like, I. I can see the case for Makima, I guess, but characters like Kaido, characters like pain, not really any, like, long lasting effects on the main character. Like, instead of Kaido, I think you could replace him with Akainu, since he killed Luffy's brother and that caused him to go into a state of depression. Like, yeah, I think you can make a better case for. I can, you know, when it comes to pain, um, I would say replace him with Obito, because Obito caused was was the reason for Naruto's. Naruto's parents death, so I thought he would be a better picked other than pain for the other choices. Never gotten to my hero, never gonna JoJo's. I believe that guy's from Finland saga. Never gotten to that. Definitely can make a, um, an okay case. You know, she killed or he killed. Uh, one's a master, so that definitely left an impact on gone. So you can make case, but I think the correct choices. Freaking Isaac. Oh, yeah. Mahito. Mahito definitely was a trip. That dude was just on demon time when he came to Yugi. That man. That Man was just. That. Man was just crazy, bro"

First off, the one piece world is only three times bigger than our world. And our world, mind you, can only reach up to a magnitude of 9.5 in an earthquake. It is stated by professional scientists that it is impossible for the earthquakes to ever reach up to a magnitude of ten. Now, I'm not about to do the estimate for y'all. Y'all could do that yourself. the one piece world would not be able to reach up to a magnitude of 50, nor can Whitebeard ever get it up that high. Cause I want y'all to remember this. Whitebeard's ability is to create earthquakes. There is literally no statements of him being able to reach supernatural magnitudes and earthquakes. Now, like I said before, even if Whitebeard was to spam earthquakes, it would not destabilize the earth. And I'll tell you the little secret of why. Because if the earth was to destabilize, that means earthquakes would not be able to happen. Because earthquakes are basically mechanisms for the earth not to go boom. So all Whitebeard is doing is basically just causing that mechanism to occur rapidly. I also wanna say one more thing. People are gonna probably say, oh, well, the feat that Whitebeard showed is basically impossible in real life, science or physics. It's really Not every day that an earthquake occurs, small islands start to move. Which means earthquakes can cause islands to move. So how much you wanna bet, if someone could create earthquakes while being on said island, that they could pick up the small island, especially if tsunamis were to occur around it? I bet a lot of money that they could. Also, the one piece world is not as large as our son. Our son is 109 times bigger than our earth. Let's please stop saying that."

I've actually known several people who started only friends accounts, and many of them have regretted it severely. Um, several cases include, you know, it was, you know, stay at home mom or you know, single mom or whatever who just needs some extra money just like his father. Um, and so they started the only friends account on a whim and found out it was much more than just posting, you know, sexy bikini pictures or lingerie pictures. Um, they were kind of coerced into doing things they really didn't want to do that were pretty explicit. And, you know, they say, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet. Like I said, most of our moms, right. And kids are cruel. Well, a lot of stuff ended up getting leaked for some of them, and their kids were relentlessly bullied and tormented and their lives were made a living hell because of it. Um, I knew several, um, who. Yeah, their marriage ended, um, they lost their job, tons of other things. So something it was done on whim does have. You have consequences for other people other than yourself. And the worst part is they didn't make a lot of money doing it. They legitimately. Cause only friends takes a massive cut of it. And the sad part is, they thought, you know, it was a massive blow to Their ego, too, because they thought they were hot stuff. And a lot of people just weren't interested, you know?

    "voice_to_text": "So apparently there's an epidemic of people losing their relationships because of an anime character. No, no, no, you don't understand, because this is so real. My ex and I broke up for many reasons. But one of those reasons was because, um, I really love Levi Ackerman. Um, he's not real, but, um, my ex didn't look like Levi Ackerman. And because of that, he thought there was no way that I was attracted to him because he didn't look like Levi Ackerman. He didn't believe me that I was attracted to him. And secondly, my best friend and I both really enjoy anime. We love watching it together. We send edits back and forth. We share fanfictions. You know, the normal things that best friends do. Well, he was so insatiably jealous at us talking about fake characters that he would rather me. He asked me to not speak about my best friend or our conversations or our relationship. Like, he didn't want to see the text messages whenever he was around. He wanted to see nothing about her pop up on my phone because he was so jealous about how we spoke about fake people. It's insane."

And I love DVD because it has some of the coolest collabs I've seen so far in one of these types of games. Like, I don't know, too many games where I can run around and Merc my friends as Chucky all at the same time. Being able to hunt them down as a xenomorph. Straight up debone people while playing nemesis. What more do I need? To a certain extent I can understand because with every new killer that comes out, survivors are getting hold left and right as the killers keep growing stronger. A lot of people love Friday the 13th because at least you can do something against Jason, but in DBD all you can do is run, loop, and drop pallets. And even then it seems like the killers have all the advantage. Like if your juke game is not on 10,000 you're gonna hate this shit. I mean shit, they just added a new killer who's basically 4 killers in one. He can even block and pick up pallets. For a killer, this is a dream. For survivors, hell nah. But you see, as a resident killer man, I think that the struggles should give them some character. Cause all I wanna do is just hunt down the people I love with a psychotic teddy bear. Is that too much to ask? Come on, peeps, it's naughty time.",

So we're talking about if the straw hats were at Marine for, would things have gone differently? Absolutely not. They would have gone way worse. The question you have to ask here is, how strong were the Straw Hats? And who is the strongest Straw Hat on the crew at this point in time? It's obviously Luffy. It's always gonna be Luffy. And Luffy didn't stand a damn chance against the vast majority of people on the playing field of Marine Fort. So if we included all the rest of the Straw Hats, what would have really happened? First off, we obviously needed Marine Ford for Luffy's development. Everything that happened with ace help push Luffy to become stronger. This entire thing was to let Luffy know that, hey, bro, you are not strong enough for what you're going up against. When you get to the New World, it's a whole new level, man. These emperors are something different. If Luffy didn't stand a chance there, the rest of his team didn't. And honest to god, the same thing would have happened. Ace would have gotten god. But the problem is, all of the Straw Hats would have been caught up in the fight and wouldn't have been able to escape. The fact that Luffy was able to quickly escape on LAW ship was super, super lucky. But again, LAW wouldn't have been Able to get all the Straw Hats out, or they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own ship to get all the way out. There's just no chance they would have done any good work there. It. It would have been dark, so. Yeah. Um. Why weren't the Straw Hats there? Because they didn't need to be there. We needed the story to be able to move forward. If they were there, one piece would be over, and someone else would be king of the Pirates.",

    "voice_to_text": "People say that is Naruto taking those attacks. You guys are probably wondering why I'm making this video. Is because I'm your guys teacher. You guys are my students. He's saying because Naruto, after you got hit with the, you know, the trigames fucking thing, the gentle fist, that because its intent was to disrupt his chakra network, shut it down. That his ability to retaliate and his well being are still intact. With that same logic, and I'm gonna show you guys these death beams. If you get touched by them, their intent was to kill him. He says hit, it hits him and it does nothing. Definition of Goku. And he absorbed the attack with little or no effect on his ability to retaliate or well being. He fits both those fucking criterias. He was still able to retaliate and it did absolutely nothing to his well being. While for Naruto, it hurt his well being so fucking much that after that attack, he literally gets hit 12 or less times at the rest of the fight, and then he's out of fucking commission. And what way, shape or form is he tanking the attack? When he won, he didn't even take a lot of damage. Afterwards he was taking little. While Goku, when he was fighting Frieza was getting hit like 50, 60, 80, 100 times and he was still able to fight. He was getting hit by all these blasts and everything else. Dragon Ball characters Are literally getting hit like hundreds of times and they're like I can still keep going. Their ability to to retaliate and their well being is not really damaged all that much. While in Naruto he gets hit with that gentle fist, then he go gets hit 12 or less times and he's out of the fucking fight. Same with Sasuke. Sasuke actually got out of the fight multiple different times during that momoshiki fight. Sasuke almost died three times during that momoshiki fighting. Was saved and healed every single time. He is a glass cannon. So again, understand what fucking tanking means you dumb fucking morons. Retaliate or well being? If your well being is fucking hurt but you're able to still kind of retaliate. Like gaara versus Rock Lee. That is a prime example. Just cause you're able to retaliate does not mean that your well being was completely just not done. So I don't know why he thinks that. Because it wasn't shut down, that is well being wasn't fucking hurt. If my attack was intended to fucking kill you, and it literally brought you to the brink of death, but it did not kill you, does that mean since the intent did not work, that somehow you still take the attack? No, because you did not absorb little to no effect on your fucking well being. Smooth brain fucking idiots."

Okay, so without further ado, folks, I'm gonna do my top three favorite. Uh, sorry, saddest anime deaths. Started with number three. That one's gonna have to be Neji Hyuga from Naruto Shippuden. I remember I was literally bragging about how awesome I think that character is the morning before that manga came out, and I was talking about how awesome he is. His methos. His move set everything and open the manga and burst into tears. Right? I realized what I've been talking about, and it was just wrenching for me that. That's why that one so personal. Number two is going to have to be Jiraiya from Naruto Shippuden. Um, reading it. I did read the manga, and reading it, it was hard enough, man. It was. It was wrenching. But then to see it animated, it absolutely ripped my heart out. And number one is going to have to be Maze Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist. Um, if you know. You know, um. It was a gut punch to see an animated character so well done as a family man, and then for them to just murder him in front of us and have his daughter crying and screaming at Mommy, why are they throwing dirt on daddy? Oh my god, if you didn't cry at That scene. You're a monster"

    "voice_to_text": "You gotta stop telling people to start with attack on Titan. Like as a first starter anime. I'm a double down on this because she is absolutely right. She spoke no lies. When you introduce somebody into anime who's never seen anime before, do not start with attack on Titan. Because after they finish attack on Titan they're gonna think the next animes after are gonna be peak or ass peak as attack on Titan. Which is false. Hell, I'll even say this don't even start with the sinister six or aka the new gen animes as your first animes. Black Clover, Demon Slayer, Chainsaw Man, Fire Force, JJK, and My Hero Academia. Some of those animes are interchangeable depending on your opinions, but I know I would not tell somebody to start watching those as their first animes because a lot of it is bad shit. Wild, she mentioned Death Note as a first anime. I approve. I approve of that. This nigga had me weak the entire anime. Buddy was chilling the entire time with all the BS. Was going bro this man had me weak and I love Ryuk and the OG himself l this dude was fucking intelligent the entire anime. I love him so much. One thing she should have mentioned is everybody's taste in anime is like a movie. Movies have different genres, animes have different genres. So I always ask a person when they're coming into anime what genre of movie do you Like and if you can name me the genre movie then I can start. Maybe recommend the types of animes you might like. Another thing to mention is also the big three. Unless they're willing to watch 300+ episodes of an anime, let them do it. But don't recommend Naruto, Dragon Ball, one piece and all them other ones. Don't even mention those because they got a suit through that BS. Like how the OG anime watchers did back then. Another thing you had to realize is that not every newcomer to anime is gonna fuck with shonen. They're not, cause not everybody is for shonen. That's why it is important to ask the new person to anime what type of genre of movies do they prefer? Now, if they like romance movies, okay, you can recommend that. But if they ask something outside of romance movies, okay, well then you can introduce them to other forms of or other genres of anime that they might take a liking to. But that's just, you know. I would say a safe way of them not to abandon anime. Because a lot of new anime comers think that oh, it's all about screaming, fighting, blood and all that, all the crap. Which is not the case.",

And why wouldn't? Because you're talking about an extremely popular show in anime that currently, the manga, has sold over 70 million volumes. And that sequel series, The Hundred Year Quest, the series that you claim that no one is looking forward to. It's currently has 16 volumes and it's still going to this day. Barely. There are people who still give a shit about the series for it still being going all this time. But I digress. Why I find it so ironic is that you claim that no one else cares, that includes you, but yet you decide to make a minute long rant about an extreme popular series that you claim no one else cares. That's genuinely like saying no one cares about their shirt getting wet, but the moment you got your shirt wet you threw a hissy fit over it. Like, see how completely stupid that sounds? Before anyone asks, I legit don't care whether or not he likes fairy tale or not. If he doesn't like fairy tale, that's completely fine. If he doesn't like it, hundred percent. Okay, but genuinely, if you're gonna make a rant about an extremely popular series, don't make some stupid ass claim that no one cares about it. But you immediately contradict yourself by making a Video about a series that you claim that no one cared, including yourself.",

The only reason Sasuke beat Itachi. Cause Itachi said he could, bro. Because Itachi let him out of the good graces of his heart. Itachi said, here you go. Beat me so you can have my eyes, bro. Great, right? No, no shit, bro. I love Itachi, don't even get me wrong. But Sasuke. Come on, bro. All Sasuke did was cosplay as the lead singer of my Chemical Romance and get carried the entire show by other people, bro. If it wasn't for his brother letting him fucking win, he would be dead way early on. And this is what Killer Bee did to Sasuke. Imagine what fucking Zoro would do, bro. Oh, my God! Zoro then vowed to never lose again. And guess what? He never did, bro. What? Again? And you know what's gonna happen when these two fight again? Zorro's gonna beat him! And he's gonna beat him fair and square with his fucking swordsmanship! That's it! He's not gonna get no help from fucking Brother Itachi! He's not gonna get help from a random ass character in order to get him Somewhere he's not gonna get bailed out by plot armor. He's just gonna fucking do it, bro. Because he's him.

So by your logic Naruto is universal cause he put the meanest hands on a goddess that makes pocket dimensions for fun? And according to you, pocket dimensions are universes. So technically by your logic, Kaguya is multiversal because she created several different universes and Naruto was able to beat her, so he's multiversal as well. So you mean to tell me that based on your logic, Naruto is able to put the pause on Goku? I mean, your words, not mine. I'm not the one that said it.",

Bro, what the fuck are we talking about? That's not a punishment. He's not getting punished for what he's doing. That's what the whole fucking chapter was about. He's one of like the only people in the show who actually has a grounded moral compass. And the fact that he wants to do good for the world. He's throwing away everything that he is, everything that is made him good, in order to protect the jujutsu society who doesn't give a fuck about him besides his power. He made the plan, but he's talking about the fact that he has to become a monster in order to do so. That's a fucking punishment. And he's pissed when he's making the plan with Gojo. It is so clear that YouTube does not wanna do this, but he has to do it for the sake of the world. His parallels with Gojo in this chapter are absolutely nuts. How they are useless weapons for the jujutsu world and how they need to do what they need to do because of the power that they were given. Even Gojo talks about the fact that Yuta has more potential than Gojo does. More natural potential. And I think that you just gonna come back into his own body. But how is dying not a Fucking punishment bodies in half. He's literally on the surgery table. The only way he can keep himself alive is by transferring his consciousness into his teacher and making him more of a living weapon than he actually was. This is one of the cruelest things that gay gay has done in Jujutsu Kaisen period. You think Yuji was traumatized by watching everybody who he loves dying? Shibuya? Well, you just gonna be more traumatized by having to go into his teacher's body to defend the world against sukuna like he's Fucking Frankenstein. Yes. This shit is a punishment. Like what?

But it just takes a little bit of deep diving and reading to see what was really going on. Look at these emotions. Utah doesn't wanna use Gojo's body. But these Gojo fans. He's bigger one to try to make it seem like Utah does. He was willing to throw the whole plan away just because he didn't wanna see his sensei die. He didn't wanna have to resort to using his own body. Would rather create another plan in itself than try and go through when he has to. It isn't into a Hakari. And Maki and Kusukabe tell him to sit still. And Kashimo. He stays along with the plan. The only person who doesn't care is Yuji. And he doesn't know about the plan. Look at this emotion. Look at his face. He doesn't wanna do this. Maki also knows what he's gonna have to do. She's consoling him. They didn't wanna peep game though. See ya",

He ain't doing nothing but dropping truth bombs on this app, and you know you need it. But let me let y'all in on a secret. I agree with them. The reason that we don't like drinking with y'all is because y'all don't know how to drink. We came from a generation where when you drink, you didn't drink in access. You didn't drink to forget. You drink to have fun. This is a generation of people, my generation, who created fun. We created it out of thin air. You didn't have a ramp. You grabbed a center block and wood. You didn't feel like running, you put two wheels together, and you figured out how to make a bike. Okay? Like, this is what we did. Look, this is what he's talking about right here. Take a look at this. This is what I wore. Okay? This is what I wore. I was inosuke. I wore this all day. My neck is throbbing. Guess what? Alcohol is the medicine for that. You don't need Robitussin. You don't need Tylenol. You need drink. You know how much we paid for drink? Zero. We drink all night outside. Old school. Remember those days of partying in mall and movie parking lots? That was us.

My favorite part about tobirama is not the fact that he was a water style user predominantly and didn't create a overwhelming amount of water style jutsu. It's the fact that a lot of the jutsu that he made, or specifically to counter the Uchiha. He hated them boys so much that he went out of his way to invent moves just so he can counter theirs. I'm not gonna go too far into detail unless y'all want me to, but you know how the Uchiha are predominantly fire style chakra users. Their main element is fire fireball jutsu, all that fun stuff. They are a fire clan predominantly. And he was a water style user and he just decided to make the water dragon jutsu, who's just a big fucking water dragon when it's in the name. I know, shocking, right? Just to counter them and their fire style. And then not only that, but flying rising, right? You know why he created that? So he can counter their Sharingan. You know, the whole precognition thing. He was like, oh, you can't judge my next move if I am behind you instantaneously. There's like, you can't track me if I'm moving instantaneously. I'm just gonna go bop over there. You're gonna go over here, I'm gonna bop over there. You don't even know Where the hell I am anymore? Your Sharingan's useless against that, so just remember that Naruto couple other people got some of the most powerful jutsu, some of the most versatile weapons in their arsenal just because tobirama was a D1 hater. He hated them so much that he spent pretty much his entire life just figuring out new ways to fuck with them. If you want me to go into detail about all the stuff that Toby Rama invented, leave a comment or something. I don't know, I don't do the engagement thing. Just figured I'd try it.",

Like, their personal goal is, um, and also going home and, like, consuming a bunch of anime. And it's really cool to see. Um, it's cool that powerlifting in general has like, skyrocketed over the last, I would say, like, the last, like, 5, 6 years, I've seen it, like, just skyrocket because, um, the people who are kind of at the forefront of, of that and kind of like, the influencer lifestyle, they actually, like, seem cool and relatable. They're not just like, Jim Bros. Anymore. They're all into anime and things like that. So, yeah, if you go to Like your, you know, your 24 hour export gym or your, any of the other 24 hour joints.

    "voice_to_text": "Explain to me how Kaguya makes a truth seeker orb again. I got you. King lie! I want to do something that the Naruto fans are unable to do. Exactly! Explain how she's even able to create these things. An expansive Keke Mora. Uh. Truth seeker or that contains each and every nature. Wind, fire, lightning, water, shadow, and light. But we need the full context. How was she able to pull this off? Now this is what is important. It's not just the fact that this is how it's created, but it's how she was able to do it. This rude time space is mother's exclusive domain where she can directly extract Chakra from Shinobi trapped in the infinite Tsukiyomi. The Biju are now stable. Plus mother has even produced a truth seeker or. So the reason why she was able to create this true seeker or was because she took the chakra from all of the people from this infinite tsuki yogi. She was gathering their chakra so that she was able to create this. And before someone says she did not need them cause she already had all the nine Biju. If she had all the nine Biju, why did she have to take from the entire Shinobi alliance to create such a feat? If she's able to do this on her own five times over with all of her other dimensions that she had created. Which would make no sense narratively. If she's able to do It by herself with just ten tails Chakra. Creating five different universes or five different dimensions on her own. But now she needs the people of the Shinobi Alliance to create one. But she's able to create five on her own before. I hope this helps. King Lion. She's not able to do it on her own. She did need the entire Shinobi alliance in their chakra to give the crate such a feat. And not only this, she also needed Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, and Sakura as sacrifices to create this new dimension. That's why they were so afraid and needed to seal her away. Because they were going to become the sacrifice for the new dimension to even happen. Along with everybody else from the Shinobi alliance. So. Yes! King Lion. I got you! I'm a teacher! You're a teacher? We're teaching the students of Naruto. I hope this helps. You can spread this to anybody. Or just not. But. Hey! I got you! I'll do something the Naruto fans couldn't!",

Conversely, puts his now double agents orphan brother a few years later in a studio apartment. Have them grow up to be this very festered, troubled emo child that then later deserts the village to become a rogue ninja that almost destroys the world. Reason you're lucky.

I'm not gonna lie, and I'm probably gonna get hated on for this answer cause a lot of people are like, oh, there's so many more heartbreaking moments, but not fuck you! Is the moment in Dragon Ball Super when Master Roshi did his final Kamehameha in the tournament of power? Well, it's not really his final Kamehameha, but. Bro, I swear we were gonna lose Master Roshi forever. Forever. And there's gonna be all these people in the comments, are you really just reviving with the Dragon Ball? He already been revived with the Dragon Balls. How you gonna get him back? You can't. Ninjas reviving with the fucking the Meki and Dragon Ball. We already did that too. This one wasn't really heartbreaking, but it did make me cry. It was Irwin's final speech. Like, that shit hit me hard. Like, I was a good one, Irwin. I'll still die for you, motherfucker!",

Secondly, you choose whether you wanna be a pirate marine, or you just wanna explore the world and do whatever the fuck you want. But the big twist is when you're out there, you can obviously choose to eat a devil fruit if you find one, or just continue as you are. But if you do eat that devil fruit, you're stuck. Whatever power you get completely changes your character, customises your build. It'd be really interesting, um, you know, and nobody would know what the devil fruits were. They wouldn't be labelled or anything. You just have to take a chance. Obviously, the goal of the end game. Find the one piece.",

I think Yuha is a better villain than Aizen, so yeah. Disagree with that. Never really gotten a hunter x hunter. Skip that. Jujutsu Kaisen. They got maki. Um. I'm anime only, so right now I would disagree with that. I hear in the manga Mike Mikey get some pretty good character moment. So this probably a whole truth in the future, but as of right now. Uh. Uh. But Jujutsu Kaisen. Who would I pick? I'd probably pick. Um. Ghetto I guess. Or. Or Gojo. Yeah, or Gojo. Never got no attack on Titan Black Clover. Yummy. Hmm. Yeah, I'm not mad at that. Um. You can make a case for yummy. Or Marilyn Monroe like. So I think either One is fine. Next we got Dragon Ball Z with Vegeta. I definitely agree with there. I think Vegeta is one of the best written characters in Dragon Ball Z. Him or Piccolo. Like, I think that's a pretty easy case to make. And with my hero. Never really got into my hero. I think that's my hero. I don't know. Um, I. I really can't tell if that's my hero or not. Never got into my hero, so. Yeah. You guys tell me your thoughts in the comments.",

like going on a rant and Instagram stories being like this is my ideal con bag and I am so happy that I feel just justified um but mine has a few differences you can already see that I don't have that extra pouch on the front I don't have the like water bottle pouches but the main difference is mine is a backpack and as you can see uh I don't need the water bottle pouches on the side because I opted to have like a water bladder so I wanted to do that specifically cause I have a lot of dietary restrictions so the top of my bag just similar to Steff's if you haven't seen her video yet go back and watch it um but I'll be treating my top pouch is kind of like a lunch bag essentially cause I have to bring food with me to events and the water bladder will act as like an ice pack cause I'll have ice water in it but I also hate having to take off my bag to access my water bottle or carry my water bottle around cause I'm someone who's like constantly taking small sips um so I literally just on the backpack I put the hose I used one of those like badge reels like this is like a multi pack from the Dollar Tree um but yeah so that way I can just take a sip whether I'm holding my bag however I need to I can take a sip and I can let go and it go right back to where it is um so that's like one of the biggest differences in ours um but yeah is the fact that mine's a backpack but I use mine very similar really I have I think on one side see I'm very forgetful so I always keep a notebook with me so I can write things down because if I feel like I'm forgetting something I will usually just check the notebook because normally it's in there um I don't like the taste of water so um in normal water bottles I have like little flavor adder things pens um eyeglass wipe let's see what's inside I have like my hand sanitizer hanging off see I have Band Aids tide pen more flavor water things can you tell I'm getting ready for an event because I have so much to flavor my water with um but yeah my top pouch very similar I have a mesh bag my strap and like the little like divider I just have in here because the water bottle takes up pretty much the entire top but even with it being completely full there's still plenty of room um I don't have any food in here cause I don't need to yet I have like my meds um and I think there's just more flavor different flavor things in there so that's what's in my top pouch um I haven't fully stocked this for Phoenix Fan Fusion just yet but I still wanna show what this bag looks like and what's capable of and the fact that it does come in different colors like I wanted pink so I got mine in pink uh I have the like clear zipper pouch which seems like very good for like wet things so I do a lot of mermaiding so that is perfect um my top pouch is personal item so external batteries I've got sunscreen meds Chapstick things like that in my top pouch and then I also have like a cosplay maintenance my sewing kit is currently on the table cause I'm currently sewing um but I also have a few fun things in here um I have my like makeup wipes I don't tend to use makeup wipes but sometimes I get overstimulated and makeup needs to come off um I also have downy wrinkle release I wear a lot of natural fibers and that is a wonderful thing to have um I keep a couple different glues like fabric glues uh the Eileens okay to wash is probably my favorite another tide pen I'm very I'm prone to like getting small stains on me um I do a lot of I end up doing a lot of wig work at cons I will help people with their wigs so I have an entire little like roll for wig stuff I believe I have a video already up that shows this in detail if you're interested um I have I always keep like little doggy trash bags as like little extra small trash bags cause I have a tendency to accumulate just small pieces of trash so I'll just have that and I'll just fill it up throughout the day and then throw out one bag cause I'd rather not litter um these little personal fans are amazing I got this one for free um but I love that it's a carabiner cause then I can clip this to like my other backpack strap and I just have it readily accessible to me if it's hot so that'll probably be out and about the entire time at Phoenix Fan Fusion um but if I but let's I think that's pretty much everything that I have in here um I'm so glad I feel just justified in this being an ideal con bag um it is at like kind of like a fifty dollar price point on Amazon um but in my opinion it was worth it for me Steff found it worth it everyone's gonna be a little different so I understand if it doesn't work for you but if it does work for you let me know this is just oh so yeah just nail [tech] organizer bag on Amazon is kind of like the wording you wanna look up to find this kind of bag these did have like a nail polish insert in them but it's just a bit of foam you just pull it out but yeah thanks for watching",

If you've ever enjoyed anything I've made, please donate $1 to this Palestinian family. The link is in my bio and it will be down in the comments. I know you might think giving one dollar will not do anything in the long run, but it will get them one dollar closer to their 15,000 dollar goal. Okay, they are at 3,000. We can get them to 15,000.

Itachi didn't wanna kill Sasuke anyway. And plus on that, Itachi was sick, so Itachi would have died regardless if he fought Sasuke or not. Then after learning why Itachi did what he did, he was like, you know what? I'm gonna destroy the whole hidden leaf. Which is dumb, cause I would have had specific targets in mind. But shout out to that man, cause he did get his leg back on Danzo and he smoked Orochimaru. So shout out to that man. Didn't smack in the middle of the war, he shows up and was like, you know what? After this war, i'mma become hokage. When they won the war, he was like, you know what? I want everyone to hate me. I'mma take on the world's hatred. So i'mma kill Naruto. To start that.

    "voice_to_text": "Donc le plus grand d\u00e9faut de Oda, avant m\u00eame le d\u00e9coupage, c'est la narration. Moi personnellement je trouve One Piece le plus grand d\u00e9faut de Oda, c'est la narration. Waouh ! Et c'est 1 avis hein, mais je suis tellement pas d'accord ha ha. Donc pour remettre dans le contexte, Dono ici parle de la lenteur de One Piece et de certains chapitres, mais je trouve quand-m\u00eame que l\u00e0 tu fais des tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s grosses g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s hein. Parce que certes, bon, pour le chapitre 1000, entre mille-cent-treize et mille-cent-quatorze, certes c'est 1 peu lent pour rien, mais faire de tr\u00e8s grandes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s bas\u00e9 sur \u00e7a surtout One Piece, ah, je trouve \u00e7a tellement faux. Alors oui, One Piece c'est extr\u00eamement long. Par contre, c'est pas parce que c'est long que c'est long, je dirais m\u00eame que dans sa grande globalit\u00e9, mise \u00e0 part certaines exceptions, One Piece c'est pas lent, c'est pas lent, certes, \u00e7a prend son temps pour mettre en place certaines choses, expliquer des contextes, expliquer des enjeux, expliquer des personnages, des du pass\u00e9 de certains personnages. Mais c'est \u00e7a qui fait la force de One Piece. Donc \u00e7a, \u00e7a en fait quelque chose de long, mais pas quelque chose de long. Et heureusement que One Piece fait \u00e7a parce que c'est sa plus grande force. C'est pour \u00e7a que One Piece a le Lord le plus incroyable selon moi. En tout cas des mangas que moi j'ai lu et hum, et ceux de tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s Tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin. Gr\u00e2ce au fait que les arcs, ils commencent doucement, parce qu'on fait de la mise en place, parce qu'on explique le contexte, parce qu'on explique ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 avant les enjeux et cetera. Bah \u00e7a rend le monde de de One Piece organique en fait. Et t'as l'impression que quand tu fermes ton chapitre ou ton \u00e9pisode, bah le monde de One Piece, il continue \u00e0 vivre, m\u00eame si toi tu regardes pas. Et \u00e7a, pour le coup, y a pas beaucoup d'\u0153uvres au global hein, que ce soit manga, fiction, film ou ce que tu veux, qui peuvent se targuer de \u00e7a. Voil\u00e0, c'est que mon avis, je vous laisse me dire ce que vous en pensez en commentaire, moi j'suis out !",

If that's the case, then all ninja tools in the Naruto universe are broken as ever. Living fuck.

    "voice_to_text": "The straw Hats were never faster than light pre time skip. Yeah, bro was right! Okay, let's debunk this one real quick too. So the first point that I brought was that the first FTL feat we ever got from the straw Hats was in Akid, and that was Sanji's feet. Are we forgetting by a snake man, Luffy reacting to FTL? Keys up! And here's the next pan. What about Luffy blitzing Kizaru's clones? Or Luffy blitzing Kizaru's attack? Or kizaru himself? This all happened before Sanji's feet, by the way. Then he brought up this one and tried to downplay the speed feet. But as you can see, Zoro doesn't even move until the laser is fired. As you can see here, the laser is already in his face, and Zoro still dodges the laser. And by the way, this is a heavily fatigued Zoro. Now to his next point. He brought up this feed and said that Luffy was using observation arc to dodge Kuma's attack. As you can see, he dodges the initial attack while being off guarded. He wasn't paying any attention to come, and Luffy still dodges that. Now to his next claim. He brought up Santomaru's statement that says, oh, he used hockey! Okay, let me clear the misconception. Everybody thought that Luffy was using observation hockey here, but that's not it. As you can see, Santomaru makes the claim after he sees Luffy punching the Pacific star. Even the people are shocked. On how he won't show a Pacific. So he more than likely was using arm and my hockey instead of observation. And here's a question for you. How do you tell whether someone is using observation of your. How did Santa Monica come to that conclusion? How do you prove that? Is there a way to tell whether is someone using observation of your not? Has it ever been stated in the story or am I missing some? Um. Brother, you think that Whole Cake Island Snake Man is as fast as Rooftop Snake Man? I hate to burst your bubble, but that's not true. You see this Luffy right here? Base Luffy right here! He slams Whole Cake Island Snake Man! Luffy",

    "voice_to_text": "I disagree with the castle needing planetary AP or planetary, let's just say durability to withstand this. And the reason I say this is because something colliding into something else to break it isn't the same as earth exploding. So the moon colliding to destroy, colliding with earth to destroy earth isn't the same as exploding earth. In order to withstand the collision, essentially all the planet would need would be moon level chakra. And the reason I say that it would only need moon level chakra is because in this case, earth isn't exploding. If anything, kinda like the picture that you showed, the moon hitting earth would crack it and break it to a degree where the rest of the earth would fall apart. We have to take that into context. It's not like he's throwing the moon through the earth and it's gonna blow it up. Nothing like that. He just going to collide the two, and then, because of how gravity works and so on, um, the rest of the earth would end up falling apart. So there's a difference with that statement. I don't agree, because it wouldn't make sense for, let's say, toneri to cover his castle within planetary chakra, meaning he can exert that, but then not be able to just exert that force and blow up the planet itself. Because again, you know, you see, there's difference there. Right. Um, just wanted to point that I don't see this feet working, but Obviously, Naruto is planetary due to, like, Kaguya scaling and such like that. Um, yeah, I'll even put it simply like this. Toneri split the moon in half. So if he was able to, let's say, destroy a planet, he would have just split the planet in half and then, like, everything else within the last just, like, wouldn't have happened. Cause if toneri just wanted to do that, he would have just, like, snuck everybody and just slice the planet.",

    "voice_to_text": "Bro, I'm not gonna lie, I love this new AP scale. And from the whole Naruto community. Power scales, bro. I haven't debated officially in like, 2, 3 years, but this has been the normalized scaling for a long time now. This is nothing new. People have been saying this for a very long time. And I don't know why people are now coming to light about that. This is how it's been working and now complaining about it. I don't know. Um, everything that you said in there is completely fine. Um, I guess, like, the only reference that I'll mention is when you said that means Captain America should be planetary universal. That's fine with an AP, because everything that we're talking about is AP, not DC. Destructive capability. So this doesn't mean that, like, you know, Captain America can destroy universe, can destroy a planet. No, but this means that he's able to affect and hurt people that can do that. Therefore, that AP, he's able to. That force, he's able to go toe to toe with that person. So let's say Thor punched Captain America, and Thor is capable of destroying a planet, and he survived that punch. Right, because Captain America is able to hurt Thor, meaning that he can also take hits from Thor, which would scale him to that AP level, but not DC. There's a difference between those two factors, and you have to know that, or things get complicated as it Seems like you're making it. A lot of other people are just randomly making this on TikTok. It's funny."

    "voice_to_text": "Okay. I'm a little lost on where everything derived from. Essentially, I saw six and Troy kind of talk about this on X, but I never really paid mind to it because, I don't know, I thought Naruto being planetary just kind of, like, agreed upon by multiple people, but a lot of people don't understand power scaling, um, it seems like. So the people who are in confusion, nobody's saying Naruto can blow the planet. Planetary is in regards to AP, which is attack. Point C in DC is destructive capability. And in order to have, let's say, Kaguya, for example, right, how we get Naruto to planetary if Kaguya creating that truth seeking or. I say she was going to overwrite the dimension that they're already in, which is the size of a planet. And she's been stated multiple times to create different dimensions. So because she has that ability to overwrite, destroy, or create this new dimension that is size of planetary, that means that her AP has to match that, right? Her AP, which is, um, essentially being able to withstand that amount of energy. So if you're able to output that, that means you're able to withstand it being within you, unless you would just kind of, like, collapsing on yourself and you would die, essentially. Right. So your AP, bare minimum, always has to match your DC. But your DC or. No. Did I say that wrong? No. So your AP, if you have Planetary DC. You have to have planetary AP. You can have a higher AP but a lower DC. Right, so I wanted to clarify that. So because of the fact when we say Naruto is planetary, not referring to DC mean he can destroy a planet is that he's able to withstand and hurt people that can. So let's say if he was against Luffy. Right. I don't believe Luffy's planetary at all. That means that Luffy would have to be able to have at least damaged somebody planetary in order to inflict harm upon Naruto. Because if not, he'll just punch Naruto and they will have no damage. Right, because Naruto is able to withstand forces of that strength of that caliber, but he may not be able to destroy a planet himself. Um, just hopefully that clarifies it of why we say Naruto is planetary. Um, I don't know why this is going around, cause I thought like planetary was agreed upon term. Because first he was like universal, which is multiplanetary maybe.",

I do apologize. Now let's be serious for a second and don't give me none of that. Oh, it's infused with chakra, anything like that? It's. What? Do we see any. Anything, uh, anything on that sword that indicates that it's infused with chakra? Because as it's been seen canon and all that, there is aura around blades whenever there's chakra on it. So if we think Naruto's is a planet buster and can take planet busting attacks, why is he getting hurt with the sword? Not only that, but this goes on about another 30 seconds where the sword just keeps going in. No chakra, no anything like that. So I'm just. I'm curious. That's bro doesn't blow planets and he just consistently gets stabbed by swords. That's fucking crazy! Now, but this is the planetary King Naruto Bro. Don't forget it, don't forget it, don't forget.

Some people might say, dude, they're just drawings, they're not real. Yeah, it's a drawing of a 15 year old and a six year old. It's not funny. And you can't even use the whole humorous objective argument because if you actually think those minors are funny, something is wrong with you. Either you're immature or just a straight up p. Word. And if anybody comes in the comments of the video and goes calm down dude, it's not that serious. Do me a favor, if you follow me, unfollow me and shut up.",

They explain what's going on and I still don't understand how a simple, simple domain and how how a black flash could be used by everybody. But then nobody. But then the one person who only been using it for a little bit of time can do it. And then I love Boogie woogie, but I don't understand what's going on. This man got a toy on his arm X.

Blunt force, anger, and rage. That's not gonna do anything to Obito. He's gonna keep hitting Obito, and his attacks are gonna phase right through. And if you're asking how would Obito hurt the Hulk, he can just simply suck Hulk into the common dimension and leave him there. That's battlefield removal when con GG's.

A lot of people get this confused. That right there is the seriete. That's not the entirety of the Soul Society. The. The entirety of the Soul Society at that. And all the surrounding areas, like you see on that land, like right there, is the Serote. All the other parts is the entirety of the Soul Society. Plus, the Soul Society is a mirror image of the world of a living, which is the plant. So how is that small area covering the entire planet of the world of the living? Doesn't make sense. This is just the serote. Just the serote, not the entirety of the Soul Society. The entirety of the Soul Society is that area and all the land and the stars and everything in that area, which most people have said. Yeah, the serote is like continental country, country plus wherever you want to scale it to be based off of where you think the four gates are and how far that is, you know? And unlike ace, there's actual validity to what Yamamoto says when he says, I have the power of the sun. We actually see after effects, unlike age, which just says, yeah, I have the power of the sun. Oh, okay. Why? When you see any destruction, destruction beats. Where's the proof? There? There's No proof. Like we see effects of how Yamamoto is actually proving why he has the power of the sun, why he is star level. I mean, if he's able to withstand the sun, Yamamoto for a good period of time. He's able to hold that power back for a good period of time. I would say, yeah, of course. He star level. That power is enough to destroy the entirety of the Soul Society. Oh, absolutely. He star level. Absolutely. Let's try that. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are we doing right now? Aren't we. Aren't we trying to. Aren't we trying to take care of the Naruto fans? What's going on here? Maybe that was my fault. We got sidetracked for just a second. Let's. Let's. Let's stay on the Naruto fans right now. Let's just stay on the Naruto fans. I'm with you. I'm with you, man. Let's keep it going.",

Like bro, in his content he don't even talk about video games. None of his content video game. He's just doing that so he can get views and likes and clicks. That's it. He's not using common sense. Also for the people out there that keep saying why did he put a Japanese person in it? They did. She is a kunoichi. She's a female ninja. Hmm. For people that say y'all say is not a samurai, bro, samurai provide military service. Hmm. Like bro, you don't even play the game. You don't even make any sense about it. Because me, I play all the Satin Creek game. I was up there. And for people to use historical logic in this game, a satin crete never been historical logic. It's just a game. Y'all need to stop complaining and have fun. Because the real people that will complain about the game, who are fans of the game, will only complain about the price of the game or the gameplay. That's it. Us Asatin keep friends. Us Asatin Creep fans will only complain about The price or the gameplay. That's it. We do not care if they have a black guy or a ninja girl. We welcome that.

    "voice_to_text": "I still don't understand nothing and that they be explaining so much okay spoilers for the JJK Manga I still don't know what part people like this are are confused over if it was over narrative reasonings like maybe like the merger or why certain things are happening why we haven't gotten no borrow to come back why certain things have just happened the way they are if those are the questions I would understand cause a lot of them haven't been answered yet and a lot of it's probably just not going to be and potentially when the series ends we could lay criticism to some of these things how it's been like 30+ chapters in Kanjaku is just still out of the picture and it looks like that character very much has been concluded there is no more that to me that kinda sucks but the base idea of what a character's technique is and how that plays into everything I don't know what part of that's confusing that's what me caught me condescending I'm just I'm a little confused actually okay so you have someone like Sukuna right who has his curse technique which is shrine an epic sukuna who's probably the hardest to explain because he is strongest character in JJK a shrine has its domain which is malevolent shrine even has cleave and dismantle one of those is a short range attack that one's a long range attack that's kind of the simplest form to explain it so I was gonna read this ready default slash is dismantle allowing Sukuna to instantly slash apart his target into countless small cubes the other is cleave can be adjusted with cursed energy to cut down tougher opponents in one powerful slash someone like Sukuna has the most use usability of his kid he can do everything it's to the max he can do things like simple domains which act as a counter to when someone opens their domain you do a simple domain to just negate the effects of the short hit effect you might be asking what are domains what are like you know this is domain expansion what is that each person who is a you know wields curse energy and has a technique inside their soul they have an innate domain now if you remember from Season 1 when Yuji died we would go inside of Yuji and like going in his mind and then you would see Sukuna and it was going actually to Sukuna's in a domain which was the manifestation of shrine and that's where they were talking and the recent chapters that's kinda what happened with Megumi as well when Sukuna was getting pummeled and then Yuji goes spiritually inside of Sukuna uh he's able to talk to Megumi then you got things like uh binding vows and heavenly restrictions and the naming sounds confusing but upon birth if you know you have a heavenly restriction there's some sort of pet traitor off so for Toji he has zero cursed energy right meant he can't see or do anything with the sorcerer but instead he basically gets superhuman abilities and uses that skill set to then fight mikamaru can do cursed technique so it's like over long distances and he has a large pull of it and it was something like that that was like the ability but he couldn't basically go outside and his legs were broken and he was disfigured and couldn't do anything had to be in a bathtub and was in constant pain binding vows another thing all of binding bow is is if you've seen Fullmetal alchemist is the laws of equivalent exchange people are complaining that suk uh sukuna has like plot you know powers and everything cause of all these binding bows no when you are that powerful you can go you know what I'll trade that off to so I can do this like doing the world cutting slash right he made a binding vow but to so he could do it this one time without any I think was um hand components so you can just do it semantic like do with his voice and he could do it but the trade off was he now has to point and and use like three hands to do it just do the hand sign and then point which means if he loses an arm or he did he can't do it and this whole thing about black flashes black flash is one of the most simple concepts of all of JKK it's like when a sports person is operating at maximum maximum maximum efficiency it enter a state of the zone and you can't control that it's just yeah I'm in the zone cool the only exception is Yuji and at the moment it hasn't been fully explained and we're gonna get more information about it overall I'm still not sure like some of the details you might not understand but it's still you're most likely gonna have enough info to understand who's gonna win a fight and when or someone then loses or something happens you go I get caught because this ability went off or this person had that that count as this and that's not to say that JJK is the perfect example of how to explain something for me season 1 or just the first few chapters of the manga a lot of it comes across really heavy handed to explain such simple concepts something as simple as a grading system it's like oh you know if you do this and you're this in grade 4 and then grade 3 it's like cool the stronger you get the higher grade you have and the cursed levels are slightly lower which means a grade 1 should always be the grade 1 curse that's all it is but it made it out this like this whole thing like oh it seems confusing it's not think once the anime covers some of it and we get a much more clearer visual representation of what some things are I think the easiest way to think about everybody is treat it like a hero shooter treat it like Overwatch or or ballerin or something right but each character has a few more abilities and defensive stuff for that kid so you've got your your shooting gun right you shoot your gun pew pew pew pew pew like bastion right shoot his gun and then as you're alt you can turn into like a tank and artillery and do big damage right but you can only do it once per like 3 minutes in Overwatch or 4 minutes like whoa you got a left bumper ability which could self heal you which could be RCT but only some characters can do that your right bumper ability could be um I know another thing like a shigigami or whatever different characters are different things now imagine that you know some characters like Miwa or Kusakabe or Gojo they can do something to counter that person's ult so let's say Reaper goes into the middle of zone and goes to do his ult you just pop your simple domain and the short hit effect doesn't instantly kill you now let's say he does some damage you can still die but it's not an instant kill hope that helps it's been six minutes what do you happen",

No one can tell me that I didn't enjoy it. Nobody can tell me that I'm not a fan of Gintama. That's your opinion. You might think that it's better, you might think that I missed out, and that's fine. But you don't have to watch anything that you don't want. Wanna Watch is giving. Gatekeeper. It's giving. What is this, 2,002? Geez, why can't we just be happy that there are so many people watching and enjoying anime? And however you wanna watch it, watch it. You wanna watch one episode 100 times? If you wanna watch only the fights of an anime, that's fine. However you want to enjoy anime, that's fine. Because it's not about what other people think, it's not about this big group, is not about what any of us have to say. It's about what you like. And if you like it, I love it.",

Bro, I swear I've said this so many times and I've used that exact phrase glass cannon. And this is why I say that power scalers or power scalers who think like this have no idea what they're talking about, because they'll say like the old ways of figuring out which character is stronger are archaic and inaccurate, but they've made up all these rules that make it way more complicated than what it is. In my personal opinion, Naruto characters as a whole have very trash durability. And if you really wanna desect each fight that happened in Naruto that people wanna say that scale into universal, solar system, planetary, anything like that, then we can. And I guarantee you Naruto fans are gonna be wrong every time because all you guys do is ignore context, use statements over feats even though feats are clearly better than statements. But when you guys don't have statements, you run to the databook.",

Finding them, finding what they. What works for them and going into those fandoms. And you wanna know why? With this new age of dating and what not, especially in my generation, a lot of men are not likeable. A lot of men have figured out that in order to them be relationships, they need to be likeable. Women do not need men to survive in society anymore. We can have our own money on jobs, on lives, on cars, blah, blah, blah, bank accounts. You know what I'm saying?

It's not quite on the level of Baki, but I just enjoy it mostly for the action. I think Gojo is a good character and I've enjoyed the fights, but with my hero, even though I've kind of lost a little bit of love for it, I still really enjoyed that series. I was still really invested into that series. And on that note, what do y'all think about the ending? Because if I can be honest, I'm not loving it."

I am genuinely believing at this point that anybody who is denying Naruto is planetary is being intellectually dishonest. So I am going to explain it very slowly and very concisely. This guy admits that the ten tails is planetary. Madara becomes the jinchuriki of the ten tails. And then he gets killed, and Kaguya emerges. When Kaguya emerges, Naruto and Sasuke immediately become petrified because they can see that Kaguya is stronger than what Madara was doing. Then everybody, Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and Sakura go and fight Kaguya. Then Naruto damages Kaguya on multiple occasions, which would put him at a relative level of AP. Let me explain why. When we talk about AP, you need to be able to withstand the energy take to it takes to do the feats that you have that you do. So when Kaguya creates or is willing to destroy or is able to destroy dimensions with stars or other planets, basically a solar system level dimension, that means that she needs the energy or be able to withstand the energy it takes to then destroy that sad thing. And so when Naruto damages her, there is a relative level of energy being put into that punch that damages Kaguya. That would make Naruto's AP, or his attack potency. The energy put into that attack at The same relative level that Kaguya has. I'm sick and tired of people saying, oh, well, if I go up to this like, 200 pound, like, fucking bodybuilder guy and I shoot him, does that mean that I. That is not the same thing. Now, if you were to go up and punch and damage a 300 pound bodybuilder guy, you would have a relative level of AP that that guy has. So I don't understand what is going on here. There. And don't even get me started. Naruto. Then in Boruto, which he says that he doesn't think that they could be either of them right now, which is intellectual, dishonest, yet its finest. Naruto goes in the manga and hand to hand combat, beats the ever loving shit out of momoshiki, who is stated to be stronger than Kaguya. And then in baryon mode, goes in hand to hand combat, beats the shit out of Ishiki, who is stated to be the strongest old Sutsuki. So that means that Jigen is above Momoshiki, Kaguya, Madara and Obito, all of them. And Naruto in baryon mode beats the shit out of Ishiki. somebody please explain to me what you guys aren't understanding here. I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to restate this. Am I gonna have to pull up a fucking diagram and like, show it to you second grade style? I don't get it. You guys are. Hmm. It's pissing me off. Oh, please. Explain to me what you guys are on.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you have Planetary AP, you automatically have Planetary Derb. So. So go watch the rest of the video to, um. To see what this content creator was talking about. But he was saying that if you have planetary AP, you automatically have planetary durability. And that's because of Newton's third Law, which is if every action there is equal or opposite reaction or equal or opposite force. Right, and. And this is my problem with people who. This is why I don't necessarily get involved with the power scaling debates, but I just have to throw my two cents in on this, folks. Really? Like, first off, AP does not equal durability. And the reason why is because physics does not apply. It's not a one for one. The way it works in the real world and the way it works in fictional works. If physics worked the way it worked in real life, in these fictional works, right, characters moving at light speed, the minute they throw a punch at light speed, it would be completely vaporizing planets. Or if they decided to to move, you know, faster than the speed of sound, they will be creating shock waves that would literally be like blowing up everything. But that doesn't happen. Yet we claim these characters are light speed, etc, etc. So if we're gonna go with the logic that AP equals durability because Newton stir law, then we have to concede on the fact that some of These characters can't be faster than light and can't be faster than the speed of sound, because according to physics, if they were, certain things would be happening in these fictional works. And then this go, this content creator goes to say, unless proven otherwise, you know, it's an automatic thing. That's. That's false. The proof is that because physics isn't. Is because things aren't happening the way physics dictates that they would always happen. That's proof in another itself. So to sit here and, like, a nitpick on what we apply the, the physics logic to and what we don't apply the physics logic to, it to me, is just. Is too inconsistent. It's much more logical and much more reasonable to just say, you know what? Real world physics does not apply the same way that it applies in these fictional bodies of work. And with that being the case, there is no other option than then the fact that AP does not equal durability. And I highly challenge anybody who is, is on this. AP equals durability rent. I highly challenge them to apply that. Apply that logic because of Newton sir law. If that's your main defense, apply that logic to literally every other feet or every other way you measure a character's tear. And if you're. If that's how you feel, then you have to make concessions on literally every other aspect of these characters that you guys love. You would have to admit that Naruto isn't faster than speed of light or Luffy isn't the fastest speed of light, because according to physics, they're just not doing what the fuck they're supposed to be doing. And that's my two cents. Unless somebody wants to, you know, go back and forth. I don't really wanna go too. Too deep in it on it. Uh, but I could. I really could."

    "voice_to_text": "Somebody explain planetary to me in a way that actually uses logic. So a lot of you guys tagged me for obvious reasons. Wait. Peep the retwist. But essentially Naruto is planetary because of Newton's Third Law, which is for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. What this means is that whenever Naruto is able to match Kaguya or simply injure Kaguya fatally, Naruto is exerting the same amount of force that Kaguya is. And how much force is she able to exert? Well, Kaguya is able to make dimensions with potential planets and stars within them. This is where the term attack potency versus destructive capacity comes in, with attack potency being how much energy you're capable of using versus destructive capacity being how much energy you're capable of exerting in a single burst. But I do partially agree with his video. Let me explain. In his video he talks about how in Naruto the biggest thing they're destroying is mountain rages or small islands. And that compares nothing to the likes of planetary size spaces or anything that would promote the fact that they're on this level of power. But I do agree because unlike one piece or Bleach, Naruto doesn't have a lot of showings of destructive capacity feats. A lot of the things come from statements. Which is kind of ironic because the Naruto fan base will criticize one piece fans for using statements for characters like Whitebeard. Let me dumb it down For you. Even more so, they'll believe that Naruto is star level, despite the biggest feat being shown to us in series being Naruto destroying mountain rages or splitting the moon. But they can't believe that Whitebeard is planetary, even though it's stated multiple times when Whitebeard is shifting tectonic plates. And before I get called a one piece Glazer, I'm gonna go ahead and rep bleach. And if you follow my page you would know that I never do that. Because Naruto fans are just as biased with the bleach community as they are with the one piece one. And bleach are several statements about characters being able to destroy the Soul Society or the Donga or destroy the universe. And a lot of the times people look at those statements as hyperbolic or things that are just being over exaggerated. But when it comes to Naruto, they're never over exaggerated and they're just true. This is why I say when it comes to the Naruto community they're incredibly biased. Because if we just use showcases then one piece clears. And even in statements one piece clears.",

Remember that Demon Slayer movie that came out several months back? Yeah, that movie was basically a recap. And that episode you just showed the first episode they had shown towards the end of the movie, so we had already seen it. Plus we as fans know what they're about to do with Demon Slayer. Oh, they're going to milk it and they're gonna milk it dry. Just like attack on Titan. Probably not for the same length of time, but oh, they're going to milk it dry. Now don't get me wrong, Demon Slayer still has his fan base. I'm definitely a fan of this very short story. Because Demon Slayer at his core, manga wise, is a very short story. But it does have enough popularity to where they will milk it."

I know you don't even really know me like that, but we've stitched some videos. I love you guys content. But bro, what is this take? I genuinely need to know, and this is a question for everybody, not just the people I'm stitching. Like, do people not like Robin? I don't think I've met a single person who's gotten into one piece and says that Robin is a bad character or a character they don't like. And this take right here, bro, this hurt me, man. Like, Robin, like, after hearing her backstory in like, water 7 and his lobby, and then you say that you wish that they would have just let her go. Like, that's a wild, wild take. And really, I'm just coming in here to see if other people really agree with that. Like, I went through the comments and I didn't see too much of it, but I gotta ask my community and some other people. Like, is there anyone out there who genuinely hates Robin? I'm not opening up this discussion to throw hate your way. There is no shade to be thrown. These people, these are opinions. It's just anime. We ain't actually getting mad about it. But this is a wild, wild take, so Please let me know in the comments. Do you not fuck with Robin for some reason? Or like, is it generally accepted that she is just the best girl? Like what?"

    "voice_to_text": "Question of the anime variety do you think the overpowered MC trope has its place in anime? Go back and watch original video cause he makes some really good talking points about how the overpowered MC trope isn't really as well written anymore. Or well really ever. It has some situations, but it's just. It's a loss. It's a lot in anime to write overpowered MC trope. Well I wanna make my own points about this cause I feel like there are some characters who have their overpowered MC trope written with y'all. I have an example of this as well Sid. Now while you may disagree, Sid in eminence and shadow is an overpowered character done really well. Because the whole goal of the anime is that there are people who are not able to compete with him on a power level. But there are people who are sort of tarnishing his own name or the name of the name of his group. And they like, they don't tackle him head on, they find ways around him. They see, they show him as kind of a strategy. A really overpowered main character, don't get me wrong, but like, they don't. They show him as no power main character, but they also show that there's stuff he can't do with as well as quickly. Like if a group is tarnishing his name, he has to go out of his way to find them, and that might take a couple episodes. Also, another thing with him is that he isn't. He doesn't want to be the main character in his own show. He wants to be the side character, at least for Season 1. And that's something that he struggles with, is that he's kind of being pushed into the light while he wants to remain in the shadow. Pun intended. But that's just one example. I could. I have, like, a handful more of these, like again to. But I'm not going to for the sake of. I don't want this video to go to like 5 minutes long.",

    "voice_to_text": "hi I was one of the people at Philadelphia Fan Expo that weekend that this video uh debuted and I just wanna talk about it real quick you don't know me and I don't know you but my name is Crow and I've been cosplaying and going to conventions for about a decade now so uh you know it's kind of kind of have a knowledge of this stuff at this point for those who don't know the context of the clip at the beginning it basically was a fan stepping up to the mic when Justin Briner the dub voice actor for Deku of My Hero Academia was taking questions out his panel and they basically uh asked something that wasn't particularly cool typically new and young fans like to ask these types of questions where it's like oh acknowledging the weird part of the crazy parts or the odd or uncomfortable parts of fandom culture and shipping culture and trying to get a reaction or see how other people take it especially those who are heavily uh involved in production but also don't realize that those people may or may not necessarily be involved in the fandom as much as they think now from what you see in the video Justin responds as as pleasantly as he can he tries to that redirect the question um with with an nonchalant answer or be like oh how did we get here and and just be like he doesn't have an opinion he he doesn't try to be involved and then they they follow it up with mentioning a ship between a teenager and a child which is really gross and uncomfortable and you hear by the reaction of the audience and him it is just it's not it's not a good reaction it's not great Justin then follows this up after the con day is over on his Twitter says basically he doesn't want these questions anymore he doesn't want the involvement and he doesn't try to spotlight the my hero fandom either uh he tries to do this as an overall thing because it doesn't just happen in one place every fandom every show has that uncomfortable culture that people try to say ruins things or makes people just just they don't they don't claim it they avoid it this then leads to some discourse and discussion from those unaware of the context and overall makes it seem out of nowhere and of course the internet being the internet people start pointing fingers and overall it's just a bad time for everybody now Justin and the audience are completely in the right to be uncomfortable as they were and I'm not negating that in any sense of the word however what we need to understand is that these voice actors the showrunners these creators not everybody as involved as we think they are not everybody uh knows about the fandom or what what's going on in the fandom or what what people are talking about some people don't even know about the show that they're working on some people are just there to do their job and that's it obviously there are a few exceptions to this uh those that are active and involved and that's great we love to see it however we cannot continue to make the Assumption that this is okay or the norm to ask these sorts of things to people because it's not everybody and it's not basic Con etiquette on the other side the Congoer is facing a lot of backlash and criticism and while it's understandable we also have to remember this is a person and also somebody who is young not everybody that goes to cons especially those that are fresh to them are going to know basic Con etiquette especially something like this that is normalized when it shouldn't be quite honestly it is our responsibility for those who know better to teach them that this isn't the norm we have got to stop normalizing this type of behavior we shouldn't be yelling at them we shouldn't be ridiculing them we shouldn't be bullying them what we should be doing is tell them nicely that hey this isn't okay that maybe this wasn't the smartest thing to do don't do it again simple as that obviously they're young they don't know any better it was a mistake we are human we make mistakes especially especially as kids it's it's a learning curve even the VA states that he doesn't condone harassment or bullying of the Congoer it is not that hard to tell somebody that they did something wrong or made a mistake in a non aggressive manner and Justin although uncomfortable handled the situation as best and as calmly as he could and that's fantastic we as a community should be acting accordingly and we should also be continuing to acknowledge that hey let's not do this let's not put these people in these situations and continue to make them uncomfortable but also I know some conventions do this not all conventions unfortunately but some do we should have somebody that is a member of the convention staff monitoring and filtering these questions that pop up at these panels please con staff con runners like put somebody that knows the context of what is being talked about in these panels whether it's being run by a celebrity a voice actor a show runner a creator put somebody there for the panel if they have a Q&A portion to filter the questions because if we don't have somebody doing that questions like this will continue to get through and then we'll be here personally I think that's just gonna be more beneficial for everyone in the long run it'll be better for guests it'll be better for congoers it'll be better for events themselves that's just my two sons",

Someone tagged me in this one today and I definitely had to talk about it because I have one from my childhood that was one of my favorite entrances to this day. Now you can't tell me that you don't remember how goaded the opening scene to X2 was. Because this was how most Marvel fans to this day were introduced to Nightcrawler. This man's debut scene was him attacking the White House. Seeing this man jumping around and absolutely styling on the security was one of the coolest things you can see back in 2,003. Cause when you finally saw his face as a kid, this was one of the most haunting things that I could ever see. Bro, for real. Look creepy here. Him. Bro was out here breakdance fighting while teleporting. He was here, he was there. They couldn't keep up. And all these guys are behind this door trying to protect the president. All they hear is people getting their asses kicked. How nerve racking it must have been to hear this man crawling in the ceiling, then back to the door. And after gets mad quiet. The door swings open and there's nothing but black smoke. He just drops in and no diffs. The entire group. Honestly believe that this was the day I started liking monster character. Because Nightcrawler on this day stood on nothing but business. This was definitely one of the best.",

That's basically the club. Um, listen, let me first say I like Danny as a content creator. He's really entertaining. He's great. This is no disrespect to him, but maybe he shouldn't talk on my hero. Okay, but here's the thing. I don't blame him because this is something I've seen so many people shit on. People hate Hawks because he killed twice and like, treat it say he's like a villain. Okay, two things. Let's first establish he is a government sanctioned hero. He is not like someone like endeavor someone like freaking stars and sort. He's not like those people. He is a government agent that was trained from birth to basically be for the gut work for the government. So he 100% had the right to kill Hawks according to the government. You could say the government is corrupt, whatever, but by no, but the fact that the world accepts him is not surprising when that he is just doing his job. But the bigger, the bigger, the bigger issue. Twice was a villain. He was a terrorist who was genuinely the most dangerous person in the entire series. Had he made like, because he was no longer scared of making like a billion clones. He could literally make an infinite number of sugar Rockies. An infinite Number of togas. Infinite. Infinite number of dobbies. Like, do you know how did he was genuinely more dangerous than sugar Rocky? Use the single most dangerous character in the league of villains at the time. That Hawks killed him. Now, I know people say, oh, just incapacitate him. Yeah, sure, he could incapacitate him, but he tried to, like, just get him to stand down, and he wouldn't. He knew there was no way twice was going to stand down. And so say he tries incapacitate him, then Dobby comes in and attacks him. What if he. And that's, like, scuffle. He loses twice, and now he's back to square one. What if he gets, you know, by killing twice? He was. That was the only way for him to guarantee twice would not be a threat to the world in the future. It sucks. It's sad. And there's a reason he tried to give twice a chance. He truly liked twice and considered him a friend. But he had no other choice. And I get it. It's sad that twice died, but it's not Hawks's fault. At the end of the day, twice was a criminal and made his own decisions.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is Demon Slayer carried by its animation? I mean, the simple answer is no. In my opinion, Demon Slayer just can't be carried by animation. Don't get me wrong, the animation is very good, but I don't think is what makes the show enjoyable. You could have the worst storyline and the worst characters, the worst voice acting. And just because the animation is good, it doesn't mean people are gonna watch it. So first of all, is the voice acting the voice acting? Demon slayer sub all dub is fucking brilliant. And the people who think you know it is carried by animation, you gotta give it credit for that. The only reason why they don't like it is because at the end of every story, the end of every demon, there's some long fucking monologue about how he's actually a good guy or how he's redeemed himself or something. So it feels same after like 4 demons. The other thing to do is about the music design. The sound effect designs every sort of fight or battle leaving conversation. The sound is perfect. Whoever's a sound engineer on that is doing a wicked job. It's like a broad in Japan said. He said sound design is one of the most important things when creating a video. So when you create a TV show, anime or whatever, sound design can actually carry the scene. Freer nailed it as well. But I can understand what people are saying about Demon Slayer getting carried by animation. Also we gotta think of is the horny weebs who literally sit there and every time a Hashira comes up, they're like, oh, my God, she's so pretty. And if you seen the Soul Smith arc, then we all know, you know, the Hashira. And that just had the boobs out all the time. That was it. She was kinda cool, kinda useful, but that's all she did, right? Every sort of joke or gag was anything to do with that. So that's probably where most of the audience for Demon Slayer lies. So, yeah, I don't think it's carried by animation. I think it's like an amalgamation of things. Of why people think it's carried. But mainly it's got good voice acting, great sound design, the stories are great. But it does feel the same with the monologue bits. After every demon, there's a bunch of nerds who are sitting there bloody touching their ding dong over fake Hashira characters. And yeah, I mean, it just creates hype because of the budget it has.",

I have been watching Naruto damn near my entire life. I literally quit Naruto when it first came out. One America, one Cartoon Network, when they had the fucking countdown in the top right hand corner. He is not planetary, he's not star level, um, or any of that. Like, he has insane durability. We seen him get hit with attack that split the moon in half. Um, I know it was a hollow moon, so I guess it's not like the same massive as a regular moon. I don't know. I just know that he took attack that split the moon in half. But he has never, ever once, him or anybody else in the entire series show that they can be sure. Like a planet, universe, etc. I don't know where they're getting this from.",

You gotta be new on this app. Now I've debated Goku versus Superman a billion times and I'm. You already know I'm Superman. Never in a decade, in a day have I ever said Goku wasn't planetary. Like that's wild. We seen Piccolo destroy a whole fucking moon like. And we've seen Goku actually beat people who are planetary. Reason why you haven't seen Goku destroy a planet is cause he's a good guy. He doesn't need to unless there was a planet full of evil people. When you have statements from people like if Beerus and Goku keep fighting, they're going to destroy the universe and leave it in void. Bro, you're right, he's not planetary. He's fucking way past that. Also, Goku breathing in space has nothing to do with him being planetary at all."

    "voice_to_text": "good evening um why do people hate Blackbeard first of all I agree with a lot of the points you're making I think he is a really interesting character I genuinely really like him as a character and I think a lot of the hate just has to do with what he represents as the dark mirror to Luffy because as you pointed out you know when he first meets Luffy he is a really enigmatic character and we see how much alike while also not alike these two characters are these are both characters who will do anything for their dreams they will chase their dreams but their way that they go about building towards their dreams are completely different we see Luffy building a family he doesn't recruit people based on their strength he recruits them based on mutual love and mutual desires to chase a dream Blackbeard recruits based on strength you know he has the Titanic captains he has recruited the most deadly people from Impell down he is stealing devil fruits and giving them to his crew who was there before that to make them expressly stronger and I do think it's unfair to lay Ace's death at Blackbeard's feet although Blackbeard murdering one of his Nakama right a member of Whitebeard's crew where Blackbeard was is ultimately what LED ace to be chasing Blackbeard in the first place without that inciting incident ace never would have been in this position and so while it isn't expressly his fault it is Akanu who kills ace as you point out um the whole reason this war arc was kicked off was because of Blackbeard and I also think a lot of people really got attached to Whitebeard very quickly because Whitebeard represents this ultimate father figure in one piece which traditionally is an anime and a manga that doesn't show a lot of positive parental role models and that's all Whitebeard ever wanted to do was be a father and so you have this whole son killing his father kind of thing because everyone on Blackbeard's crew or sorry on Whitebeard's crew was one of Whitebeard sons that's what he referred to them as and that's ultimately what Blackbeard was when he murdered one of his brothers and then later went on to murder his dad and you serve his power by taking the devil fruit as for do Flamingo I think a lot of people do agree that do Flamingo is one of the worst villains in one piece and I mean that as a person he is awful legitimately a enslaving drug peddling tyrant who is caused for a lot of the strife on the grand line he has his hands in everyone's pockets he is you know promoting all of this horrible things but as a character he's so witty and he is so charismatic it's hard to not love him as a villain um kind of like what you're saying about Blackbeard I think a lot of people feel for Doflamingo while they might not harbor the same feelings for Blackbeard because we don't see nearly as much of him being this you know machination driven villain those can be just so fun to watch um to understand Doffy's backstory and how tragic it is and to see what made such an evil person we don't really have Blackbeard story there's a lot of missing pieces there and I think when we get it it's gonna be absolutely fascinating so I I might not have answered your question like you wanted um I don't hate Blackbeard um I do see him as a really strong insider within this narrative however he has incited a whole lot of what has gone on to be some of the most significant things in the entire narrative without Blackbeard killing a crew member and going on the run we wouldn't have had Sabayote through the Marine Ford uh the the summit war arc all of that would not have happened without blackbeards murder of a crewmate so I hope that that helps somewhat um like I said I do like Blackbeard and uh you know I appreciate your content"

Defending this point is really easy.   it   seems   Defending   this   point   is   really   easy How you would defend this point is   you   would   defend   this   point   is you would just simply tell somebody like King Lion   would   just   simply   tell   somebody   like   King   Lion or the other DC   the   other   DC Marvel fans that are a little confused at how Naruto's planetary.   fans   that   are   a   little   confused   at   how   Naruto's   planetary You obviously tell them your scales.   obviously   tell   them   your   scales And then if you tell them your scales and they're like, well,   then   if   you   tell   them   your   scales   and   they're   like   well where's the feat of Naruto destroying a planet?   the   feat   of   Naruto   destroying   a   planet Why would Naruto destroy the planet earth?   would   Naruto   destroy   the   planet   earth Why would Naruto, the one who's defending earth,   would   Naruto   the   one   who's   defending   earth destroy earth? What reason would he have to do that?   earth   What   reason   would   he   have   to   do   that Because of Naruto trying to defend the leaf village,   of   Naruto   trying   to   defend   the   leaf   village which is on earth. Why would he destroy the planet?   is   on   earth   Why   would   he   destroy   the   planet The village he's trying to defend is on like,   village   he's   trying   to   defend   is   on   like like, you feel me?   you   feel   me Does that make any sense? That's why   that   make   any   sense   That's   why going off of something like statements is very important   off   of   something   like   statements   is   very   important for shows like this   shows   like   this where people that are the heroes actually defend stuff.   people   that   are   the   heroes   actually   defend   stuff But of course, in Marvel and DC,   of   course   in   Marvel   and   DC where they have like 56,000 variations of the same earth,   they   have   like   56,000   variations   of   the   same   earth and then they have people just destroying earth   then   they   have   people   just   destroying   earth because the heroes there suck at doing their job   the   heroes   there   suck   at   doing   their   job and they need people to help them in every single fight.   they   need   people   to   help   them   in   every   single   fight You know, what's always convenient for me   know   what's   always   convenient   for   me is how everyone always sits here and jumps on every anime character   how   everyone   always   sits   here   and   jumps   on   every   anime   character for needing to jump a Villain   needing   to   jump   a   Villain and they have like one or two or three people with them   they   have   like   one   or   two   or   three   people   with   them but we have literally the Justice League jumping one dude   we   have   literally   the   Justice   League   jumping   one   dude and we're just like   we're   just   like Superman's actually relative   actually   relative Batman's actually relative   actually   relative Green Lantern's actually relative uh,   Lantern's   actually   relative   uh Martian Manhunter's actually relative like how,   Manhunter's   actually   relative   like   how how are you going to sit here and have that argument   are   you   going   to   sit   here   and   have   that   argument then go against the Naruto community with the same like   go   against   the   Naruto   community   with   the   same   like you feel me?

This is really a black weaves dream. But nah, this is dead ass a scam. Also serious shit cause it really gotta think about it. Here in America, we're not gonna act like East Asian parents are the biggest gatekeepers when it comes to black man dating their daughters. Bro, them niggas do not like us and y'all know that. Like their fathers really be yelling in the paint, blocking our shit. Their moms be Jeremy Lynn, crossing us up, still in our shit, shitting on us, defensive players of the years, hall of Fame gatekeepers. So you really expect Japanese niggas to want black man to come and impregnate their woman? Like, nah, that's dead ass breeding. Like come on now. The Japanese have a plan. Like Eisen. They about to do some unit 7 3 1 shit on us. Bro, do not fall for the trap. They really don't have all those blasian babies in Japan with no fathers, they're gonna be growing up like gon trying to become a hunter to find their dad. And they're gonna be ostracized like Naruto in the village in Japan. If I was a Japanese man, I'll dead ass be tobirama to all the blasian babies, bro. Imagine you plotting on your Asian baddie, your Asian chick that you like, just to find out that she got BBC and impregnated by a black man and that nigga left. Like, I'm treating all the blasians terribly bad. And what's going on in Japan and Korea? Like, y'all niggas can't pull y'all girls, bro. I have a population shortages, bro. Just risk up, bro. Y'all need to get trained by do Dennis, bro, cause this is getting ridiculous. And it's not like y'all women are ugly, y'all girls are bad, y'all got the K pop hotties that J pop idols. Like, y'all got bad women. Like, what's going on with y'all, bro? Y'all niggas need to get to risk training, bro. First I got the Oxford study shit where mid white niggas are taking y'all fine girls, and now you got this. Like, this is crazy disrespect, bro. Y'all gotta train.

You're telling me that Shanks pulled up on Kaido, beat him so convincingly he could show up to Marineford with no damage and still have energy to box Admirals? Nah, not because I don't think Shanks couldn't defeat Kaido, I just don't think Kaido would go down that easily. We're talking about king of the Beast Kaido, some of like top 3 durability in the verse. He would not go down that quickly. Because the other time we hear of Yonko fighting in this universe was Big Mom versus Kaido, a fight that lasted 3 days. What's more likely is Shanks pulled up to Kaido and said you wanna go to Marineford, you gotta get through me, and Kaido decided it wasn't worth it. If Shanks is on the same level as Big Mom and Kaido, which the Yonko title implies, that fight would have lasted ages. So much so that by the time Kaido defeated Shanks, everyone's gone home, Marineford is over, the situation's done. What Kaido would have gained from the situation was not worth the time and effort would have taken to fight another Yonko.",

Here is the tattoo to wanna break up with someone because they got a fake man, A cartoon man. Even if it was a real man, even if it was like Harry Styles, it's not like she got her coworker Bob tattooed on. This man said that he just tolerates her anime hobby and he thinks cartoons are for children, and yet he goes and throws a tantrum cause she got a little two dimensional man tattooed on her. If she got SpongeBob tattooed on her, would she be like, not on my. Now the daddy's home is a little cringy, but I mean, so are my tattoos. I have Onyx and a bubble tea. Who am I to speak? Um, unless someone came home with like a racism or like something maybe very sexually explicit or something. Like. Aside from that,"

Now that I've officially graduated, I wanted to share my Persona 5 inspired valedictorian speech. Here it goes: I'm honoured to have been chosen as a valedictorian of this year's graduating class. My name is Raven and I am a Secondary Education and English major with double minors in Art and Writing. In true English major fashion, on my graduation cap I've written a quote from one of my favourite characters of all time, \u201cI will carve my own path for myself.\u201d We've all likely encountered individuals who entrust others with their destinies to such an extent that they unconsciously relinquish some of their freedoms in the process. Perhaps, we've been in that position ourselves, seeking external guidance to fulfill others\u2019 ideas of happiness in the hope that that happiness will become our own. However, genuine growth and happiness emerge from following our inner compass and forging paths aligned with our deepest aspirations. I am the eldest daughter of immigrants. I am a first generation college student. I am an English major, even though English is not my first language. Despite encountering skepticism about my potential for success, I have remained steadfast in my self-belief and identity. Of course, there are times when relying on and trusting others is essential. I could not have overcome the numerous linguistic and societal barriers I faced because of my background alone. However, the pivotal decisions, born of my free will, forged a path I proudly tread alongside you all as fellow graduates. Trust is a precious gift\u2014to ourselves as much as others. Embracing challenges fosters growth, yet surrendering crucial decisions to external forces only hinders true happiness and self-pride. \u201cWhat's a life worth in a reality that was cooked up just to satisfy someone else?\u201d \u201cI say \u2018none.\u2019\u201d Your happiness and development rest solely in your hands. Carve your own path for yourself, drawing upon the skills and knowledge that have been infused in our education by our founders to shape a narrative you can be proud of. To anyone graduating this season, congratulations class of 2024!",

    "voice_to_text": "there are so many people that need help including this family the Aman family there's more context in the video go back and watch it but even if you feel like there is nothing you can do you have no money like me and you're unemployed and you you have no money do little that you can't do what you can what's whatever within your capability that is still at any capacity even if it seems insignificant even if it's just reposting even if it's just sharing even if it's just commenting and saving every video even if it's just hitting the button even if it's just talking with your family member because you cannot stand to be online that much do what you can it frustrates me that people come up with suggestions like the Block Party 2024 and though technically I think maybe the guy that started that did it for selfish reason it's going to be significant to the impact even if it's not the biggest significance and it's small but bigger than what what you know this little bits right because it all adds up there's varying levels of how small these significances but in the it can it can range right of course blocking a celebrity is not directly giving money two people in Haza right two people in Rafa but what it is doing is it's bothering and poking these celebrities who have money that could be that could be doing something about that because the celebrities don't want to work with us the celebrities do not care if people suffer they just see it as oh people suffer everyday no big deal because they're not suffer the minute that their funds get cut off though they get upset don't they they start to see some kind of suffering and they don't like it and they say that you should stop but why but why why would we stop we want you to use what you have that we gave you because we gave you it as the bottom peasant people we gave you it by garnering the attraction to your page etcetera etcetera talking about it it monetizes it for you and the fact that these celebrities that have money that their fans their supporters have given them so that they could be at the status that they are at they don't wanna give back to the people that are suffering or give for the people that are the fans to those who are suffering per request to help they would rather be about themselves and selfish even though a lot of not all but you know there's some there's some celebrities that are billionaires some are just multi just multi millionaires all oh my god only just and some are only nearly a millionaire but even so do you know how long it would take me to get to that status by doing it not whatever way that you did it just by doing it the right way these celebrities don't care it's about doing what you can though and the rest of us are down here at the bottom levels in poverty we know that and we're doing what we can even though we cannot afford it we're still doing what we can we're still the ones raising the funds more than the people who could give the most so bully the rich eat the rich and then enjoy your cake afterward because we are going to free Palestine we are going to free Sudan and we are going to free Congo it would take less time if the celebrities would just jump on board if the governments would just stop being the fucking pieces of shit that they are if our governments weren't interested in profit over people and actually wanted to help the people which they're supposed to do the sooner that everybody gets on board the sooner that havoc across the world will calm down in response to the unfairness of people dying and suffering and starving people getting kicked out of their own home for European centric white comfort and profit yep pretty much that free Palestine",

However, in this particular situation with Charlotte, he wasn\u2019t! I also forgot to mention that it was Charlotte\u2019s dad and brother who hired D to bring her back. Regardless, Charlotte didn\u2019t want to go back to her family. Both Charlotte and Meier loved each other and wanted to be with each other, and D started to realize this during his mission. If you\u2019ve seen Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, what do you think?

Daily by weekly, maybe every other day. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. There are so many options. I feel like we just did daily because it worked well for the format of network television. But now that we are kind of out of the era of network television, let's be honest. Is there a benefit to doing weekly as opposed to anything else? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

When I'm seeing men for the first time, they see this tattoo and they say, it's like she's branded by another man. When. When gon is, um, about 12, 13 years old, and he just sacrifices full potential just to be able to run a fade to, um. To seek revenge for his friend kite. Um. Yeah.

him   at   all like he made sure he stayed segregated from everybody else   he   made   sure   he   stayed   segregated   from   everybody   else probably because of his identity.   because   of   his

    "voice_to_text": "I'm convinced once you stop watching anime bro, it's almost impossible to get back into. Not gonna lie, a lot of people don't know this and how much I talk about anime on here and amongst my friends etc. You will never guess this but I went like 4 5 years without watching anime at all and I'm not gonna hold y'all. What this man saying is facts. Like once you stop just like watching anime, you just find other ways to spend your time. Like for entertainment, gaming, watching other shows movies. Yeah, it. It. It is a bit. You know, it. It is a bit crazy to say, but it's hard to get back into anime. And honestly the biggest reason is because a lot of animes, truth be told, just aren't good. I mean think about it. How many variety of shows do we really see people talking about that are already being mentioned by someone else? You rarely see a gym that's hidden these days cause it's just not that many good anime out.",

Okay, so I was with you just up until that part. Like, heavily, heavily disagree with you on that part. Like, we. We can't just ignore that Rudy is. Like, just last season in that. In that half season, he kidnapped two girls, tied them up and left them to starve for. For a broken statue of a girl he liked. Like, we. We're not gonna forget that. We're not gonna forget that. That happened just last season. He. He did that for a. A broken statue. Like, that's what Rudy's did. He is still a scumbag, just like he was in the first season. Like, nothing has changed between that. Nothing has changed. Now, if you bring up the novel. The novel, I hear Rudy's is even an even bigger scumbag than he is in the anime. Like, that's what I'm hearing, but I don't know. Now, keep in mind, still, the story in which I could sense a is still pretty interesting. I like that. I like the world there are even. Even putting the fact without Rudy is. I still find some weird moments with the characters in Michelle contents a. Or some of the stuff they be doing. Like. Like. Like other stuff that. That I won't get into. But as of today, as of this. As currently right now, In the anime, Rudess is still a scumbag. Rudess was out here ready to kill some random, random, random teen that might have bullied his little sister or that might have freaking. That might have been associated with that, not said anything, and he was ready to kill ill, a person for that. Like, and we're saying, like, he. He's changed a lot. He. He's changed a little. Little. The dude is still a scumbag. Okay, that. That has not changed. But yeah, those are my thoughts.

Why do so some of y'all care so much how we watch or consume these shows? Yeah, it does sound heliest and and is annoying. So leave them alone. It's that simple. Also, the all people, the all out there who have dyslexia, they can weed. Is just that how they process the win language is different from how you, you or I boss. That's it. So it takes them longer. So? So. So it would be in their best interest to watch the dub also. You know, for me, especially if it is a series I will watch multiple Summer Times, I'm gonna watch the dub so I can multitask.

And listen, no hate to this creator right here, just there's a lot of Gojo fans in this comment section. Gojo didn't know about the Flame Arrow. The first time it's used is after Gojo gets sealed. Second time it's used is against Maharaga, and Gojo is still sealed away. So let me ask you this. When Gojo says that sakuna was not going all out, why would he be talking about the Flame Arrow, something he knows nothing about? Same way how Jogo didn't know about the Flame Arrows, but sakuna just kind of pulled it out. Why would Gojo not be talking about Sakuna's Hainei reform body that he had access to the entirety of that fight? Multiple times. In that fight versus Gojo, if Sakuna pulled out that form, he could have won with amplification alone because Gojo was severely weakened."

I do rate, like, Tizzy a lot, but this one is way for me because, again, Black Clover became a jump. Gee, guy. They release every four months, I believe. So is it four months or every three months? Well, I think quarterly, so yeah, every three months. So, I mean, it go to say they've gone down in popularity. Sure, they'll reduce a bit. And. Okay, yes, not everyone's talking about Black Clover because JK releases weekly. You can't exactly compete with something that completely. That releases every week when you release every three months. So it's always gone down popularity. Where it fell off because the story is bad. Like, I feel like the way he was, like, talking about it was almost as if, like, oh, it just fell off because the manga. Manga. Shit. The manga still gas. It's just that JK releases weekly. My hero releases weekly. Um, Sakamoto Days is going crazy, and Blue Lock is coming back, so we just got Kaiser's backstory. So, I mean, it's tough and the. It's tough, but, like, they release every three months. Boruto releases monthly, and people still read that. So, I mean, I wouldn't say it's falling off. I would say, like, maybe a bit of the hype has gone down. Because, again, most people are just. Most people just go week to week to Week. Most people on TikTok scroll. Most people that read the manga, like, read the manga of TikTok, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But I mean to say that it's fell off is. That's harsh.",

But I really wanna talk about this as a big, big art nerd, so I don't necessarily disagree with storytelling can be greater than art, but I do believe art can enhance the storytelling in a way. Stick with me on. So I'm gonna use an example of maybe a couple. But like, let's look at, like, say, berserk. Berserk is like, such a dark and gritty series. Great. Well, the artwork matches that dark and grittiness alongside its story that is trying to tell makes it so much more gripping and why people really love that series. Or we can hop over to another series. Or let's take, say, like one piece. One piece has a like, more cartoony looking style, but then has like, others that look more serious looking and stuff. And the storytelling is super serious. But Luffy himself is like the character to bring the joy back into the world. Right, right. Like, ah. Like, this is why I'm such a fan of finding new art styles in manga and stuff. Cause I then have the question in my head pop up, what story are they trying to tell? What am I going to get through this art stuff? So yeah, that's kind of how my thought processes. This Is why I love finding new shows or manga that has a different art style and is not trying to copy somebody else or like, try and get like the same type of feeling. Like, you know how Shojo Manga or Shonen Manga have like, similar kind of looking stuff? This is why, like, finding new art styles, I'm just like, well, what story is going to happen here? Cause, like, because they like, incentuate like some scenes. Like, you know how there's some series that have like, more facial expressions and they're trying to really, like, talk more with the character faces or some of them are more with the body language on how they do it. This is why I like, I think art and storytelling have like, such a cohesion that it's important to understand, like, what the story is and how the art can tell it. That's what I love about it. But yeah, sometimes art style, not everything. Buddies thing and what not, or like, even the story, what not. So yeah, you do you and have a nice day. Thanks for stopping by."

He just wants to do better and show he's no longer that guy. And I think that's fantastic. The comments under this was saying he doesn't get a redemption or he gets an atonement arc. And I wish more characters got an atonement arc instead of just being redeemed. He also briefly gets compared to Ozai in this clip. And yeah, obviously some comments didn't agree with that part. Yes. He. How? Yeah, he's. He's Ozai. He's just a reflection of Ozai. The entire Todoroki family is just inspired by the royal family and Avatar. How we not connected these dots? Anyway, give us more atonement talks cause it's much more realistic.",

Um, the thought was there was this moment in Innie's lobby where, after chopper was. I turned to this monster and then turned back. He was incapable to fight. He could not move. And he said that he envies Luffy sometimes, because it always seems like Luffy knows exactly who he has to fight right from the beginning. And obviously, we know that Luffy just went in, he solo run that shit and went straight for Rob Lucci. He knew right from the beginning that is the person he has to fight. And I think that is very. Hmm. It's. It's very telling of who Luffy is. And I know a lot of people like to see him as an idiot, but he's not. He's a. He might be an idiot in a lot of things, but he is emotionally incredibly intelligent. And in this case, he knows exactly what he has to do. And what he has to do in that moment that he knew right from the beginning is that he's not the hero that saves Robin. He's the support. Which, yes, he is the MC of the series, but he doesn't act on it every time and. And or Oda doesn't make him act on it every time. Like, yes, he's still the MC, but for the majority of. In his Lobby, we see mainly the other characters fighting their single fights, and Luffy is literally until we see him at the end then fight Rob Luci. He's the support. He's the one that's going to on a solo run to try and keep Rob Luci a baby. Cause he knows if Rob Luci goes against the others, that's not good. That's a no no. So he knows he has to be the one to go after it. And he doesn't have to be the hero that saves Robin in the moment. The others will do that. And he needs to keep Rob Lucia Bay to let the others do the saving while he's supporting them by sticking with the plan of solo running it and sticking with his plan, not with the plan of the others and. And going for Rob Lucci right off the bat. And he truly. He truly knows where his place is and when. And that is incredibly. I think that that moment where chopper was like, he always knows exactly who to fight and what to do is very true. And it also, um, really reminded me of this moment in Jujutsu Kaisen, which obviously I have watched Jujutsu Kaisen before I have watched one piece, but we're during the Shibuya, Auguji realizes that he doesn't have to be the hero that saves Gojo. He just needs to be a supporting factor in helping the others and letting the others do the saving. And it's Even though he's, like, the MC of the series, that's, I like, very telling for the MC to realize that. That's not my point. And Luffy already has this emotional maturity to understand that. And Yuji, in that moment, developed that emotional immaturity to understand he doesn't need to be the hero. And I really like that. I really, really like that. And I think this little moment where chopper said he always knows what to do and when really, really showed that.",

Well, then it's a good thing that the point of his character is that he is not getting redemption. Yes, to us it is a redemption arc. Because we in our world see our character goes from bad to good. They have a redemption arc. But what endeavor is getting is not redemption. It. It is atonement. And he acknowledges this within the sea, where Koshi makes it very clear. Endeavor knows he cannot be forgiven. He knows the acts he has done are beyond forgiveness. And the point of Endeavor's character is not at all to be forgiven. Cause again, it is acknowledged within the series that he can't be forgiven. He is beyond forgiveness. But the point of his character is to show atonement. To show that someone who has done something terrible can continue to live on. And even if they're not forgiven, they can seek to be better and do better. Not to get forgiveness, but to make up for the past. To try to atone for their sins. And even if they're not forgiven, at least they're doing something to be better. And that's the point of Endeavor's character. That's why Horikoshi hasn't killed him off. Horikoshi has had plenty of opportunities where he could have killed him off, but he's still kicking. Because the point of his character is to live and to see the future and to help The future heroes be better. To make sure that there's never another endeavor. That's the point of this character. Not to be forgiven, but to atone and to help make the future better.",

There's literal consequences for how strong remember he is. You wanna watch anime with somebody just blowing up shit 24 7? Go watch wise man screen. Go watch Dragon Ball Z. It's called world building. You literally got like two or three seasons plus a movie and a Ovas, a Rimmer moving company pretty much kicking everybody else's shit. And you can't deal with like five or six episodes of them doing world building for the climax of this season? Again, this is not your typical use of card. There's literal consequences for how strong memory is. The country he's trying to make and the people around that country you can't handle world building?

Personally, I haven't watched NAR or one piece past like episode like 100 I think, and it is just personally too boring for me. I couldn't do it. Um, so I can't really say for sure, but the pain arc, the training exams, Sasuke retrieval arc, um, the war arc, um. Gaara versus Rock Lee, Obito versus Kakashi, Naruto versus Sasuke Part 1 and 2. So I'd like to pose a question to you guys. What point in one piece beats Naruto? Like, is there anything. Is there any reason for me to watch past like episode hundred? Like what?"

Excuse me, Justin Briner, I think the voice actor for Deku has been asking people hey, stop asking me about my ships! I don't want to ask! I don't want to answer these questions if they get inappropriate, it's gone too far. He's also has acts that those in the fandom or outside of fandom stop blaming the fandom for weird shit like this when I think he fails to realize that sadly 80, i'mma say 6 i'mma say 75% of my hero fandom are weirdos. Um, I don't know how Horikoshi can got the fandom to be how it is, but they're weirdos. But then again, Horikoshi Loki is a weirdo himself. Just a smidge. Um. You know. But I do think people should respect his wishes and not asking these questions anymore. I don't think none of the my hero fandom should ask this question to their VAs. You know, if the different fandom, sure, so be it. But stop asking the my hero cast what they think about ships. Stop doing it, stop doing it! Stop doing it! Like cuz you get shit like this and it's embarrassing. Like as a whole do you not feel embarrassed? Like I haven't been part of my hero fandom since I think season 3 of the anime and I don't claim them as part Of my fandom base. But it's like I feel embarrassed just thinking that this was once a fandom that I adore. It's just. It just went so downhill so quickly. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta do better cause this man is stressed.

    "voice_to_text": "Krillin was on earth. Would he have stopped Omni Man? Oh my goodness. How are people? Actually, you should well go watch the full video. He's on point. I don't know why people are arguing this or even putting up a fight about, but Krillin would smite Omni Man. That's just the truth. He is married to Android 18, and Android 18 does not fuck around. And I'm pretty sure she does not let Krillin be a bitch anymore. That's guaranteed. Now if you wanna make the argument that yam show would get beat by Omni man, go for it. No one gives a fuck about yam show. We all know yam just gonna lose. But you need to put respect on our boy's name, Krillin, because Krillin has shown his growth, his strength, and how powerful he actually is. Now. I don't know, I made an argument that, you know, Mike Tyson would decimate Jake Paul. I don't think it's gonna be to that extent, but Krillin definitely gonna put up a fucking fight and destroy Omni Man. I think Omni Man might get a good hit in or two, but nothing that's really gonna off balance Krillin. Honestly, it's like you got to take into consideration how much growth Krillin actually has. If you want to start off and say base level Krillin versus Omni Man, yeah, Omni Man's gonna win. There was no growth there. He's still young, he's still a coward, he's still not fully to His potential. But if you wanna say Super Krillin, then you're wrong. Super Krillins a whole new beast and a whole new person. He is grown. He showed his potential. So, I mean, yeah, if you wanna make the argument, the getting Krillin would get smited. Yeah, I mean, he would. You would ultimately die. I think you'd get a hit in there too. But Super Krillin. Super Krillin's not going down without a fight, and he's gonna win that battle. That's just how it is. Just because of his growth with all the characters that he's been with, it just shows and speaks for itself. Omni Man doesn't have that type of growth. He doesn't have that. He's just one thing. This power is just one thing. There is no growth from this man. It's just an alien dominating species. That I don't see them growing or exceeding a power level like they do in Dragon Ball Z. The biggest difference here is that you actually see the growth in Dragon Ball Z, where invincible, they're just there and they have a power level they need. There's no increase or decrease. It doesn't really show that to me as much as it does in Dragon Ball Z, where you can ultimately see a powers, a person's power growth. And they're. They're just. Their growth in general, it's. That's the big thing here is like, krilling grew to be something awesome, and Omni Man is just Omni Man."

What's your opinion on your ships? Oh, my god. How do we get here again, brother? Uh, it's the fact that this person was so confident to not only ask this question once, but twice at a different con with the same voice actor. And here's my thing. It makes it incredibly hard for me, as somebody who actually likes watching MHA, to proudly announce that I am an MHA fan, because some of you MHA fans in that fandom have totally ruined that anime and that fandom. Okay, I gonna keep it real. And yeah, every fandom has weirdo ship people, okay? Those weirdos. I ship weird things, all right? But to go to a con and actually ask the VA actor that question when all he does is he's there for a check, okay? He does the voice. He does the voice acting for a check, okay? He doesn't give a shit about the ships. Are you insane? Listen, as an anime fan, I also have ships too. Like, we live in our own delusion and fantasy, but some of y'all are little too delusional and living in a complete, like, fantasy. And Justin unfortunately, has to make public statements that he does not feel comfortable talking about ships. And it's getting out of hand with these Questions? Because that's all you guys ask when he's invited to these cons. Why can't y'all just be normal and ask him what it's like being a voice actor in the industry? Or, like, how much does he like something that's not about ships, okay? Something that. Please. Unfortunately, some of y'all like to teeter totter on the P E D O. Line, cause those are kids in that anime. I don't. I don't know why we try to schmexualize them, but it's getting a little bit out of hand, all right? And I need y'all to just take a chill pill. This is embarrassing. I. If I was that person, I would never show up to a con again. Don't ask those questions, because now you look weird. You look weird."

I'll get like 20 comments a day of people asking me where season 5? And I can never really give them the answer. Right? But now I can genuinely give you guys an answer. It's not a lie. This is real. Season 5 is in the works. They are making. They're still making DXD animes. So season 5 isn't the works for y'all boys. Is not. It's not a joke. This is real. So I can finally give your boys that, you know? I'm saying we've been. We've been waiting for a long time, man. I'm gonna bring a two tomorrow. Thanks for the support for all these years man.

Drake, if you wanna pay somebody, pay me. Because I will be a better friend to you and let you know to stop whatever you got planned in your head at any point. It seems like this man already thought about it. He's like 10 moves ahead of you. He's a mastermind. Leave it alone. But if you want to do this fight, I can tell you what you gonna need to win. Right? And please, everybody, tag Drake in this. Try to get this to his for you page. He's gonna need all the dragon balls. He's gonna need to recruit every single Avenger, including Thanos and the infinity rings. In order to change reality. He's gonna have to go back to the 90s, recruit the Thundercats, captain planet. And he has. He's gonna have to hit up the Magic School Bus just so he could get away at the end of the fight and even it. And maybe hard for you. Trust me when we say we understand. If you just lay your guns down, Drake. If you just stay down on the floor. You got beat bad enough, and we all. You're at the point where we feel so bad that we won't even judge you for losing the fight because he smacked you so hard. But if You decide to get up after this and still try to come, trust me when I say you're going to get extremely embarrassed. You're going to get hurt. It's. It's gonna be a bloodbath. And we, at this point, folks feel bad for you. And whoever's in your camp don't like you. If you haven't. You haven't picked it up already, the call is coming from in the house. I'm telling you, they don't like you. They selling your shit. I'm telling you, whoever's in your camp, they selling you up the river.

And before you're like no, you need a like, rebirth. No you don't. Isekai literally means just going to another world. It means being transferred to another world. So it would have to be like Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland. As a matter of fact, a lot of isekai series and a lot of anime series in general take reference to Alice in Wonderland, so it would be arguable to say, you know, one of those is actually. I'm gonna look it up. Which came first? Alice in Wonderland or? I looked it up. The godmother of anime is Alice in Wonderland. It's was written back in the 1800s. And of course there's probably other stories that you could talk about, like, you know, um, some Greek stories that could probably be considered Isaka. You know, like people going to the underworld to find a gal and, you know, walk forward and make sure not to look back or else she'll be stuck there forever. You know, stuff like that. But like, there have been so many series before the anime about the pedophile that gets reborn in another world after he gets hit by a truck. Because that's all that is, by the way. It's a pedophile that gets hit by a truck. I can't. I get the Like, they. They opened with that. I'm sorry. Yeah, but. Yeah. The true godfather of isekai is Alice in Wonderland, which was also written by a pedophile, so. Yeah, but. Yeah. Anyhow, argue about in the comments. I don't care.",

    "voice_to_text": "Kind of overwhelm the audience. You can burn people out, and that's not always the best approach. This creator is talking about one piece currently having an ongoing manga, anime, and live action series. It getting a anime remake might be a little bit too much and might burn out the audience for one piece. I disagree with this take because of one very specific reason. All of these sources for one piece are targeting a relatively different demographic. You've got people who are die hard anime fans. They've been watching the one piece anime since 1999, and they are watching it every single week. You also have people who are manga fans who prefer to consume this kind of content in a manga format. And on top of that, the live action just brought in a massive demographic that has been very averse to starting the anime or the manga because of how long they are. All of these formats do a fantastic job of telling this amazing story that we love to an audience that wouldn't normally consume it otherwise. I would say the number one barrier to get anybody into the one piece anime or manga is because it's too long and the pacing is rough. And for current anime and manga readers, it's way off the base for what they're used to consuming. So I think getting a remake gives one piece another amazing chance to get deep into the hearts of the newer anime and Manga fan base so do I think this is gonna cause burnout? No, another side of this is one piece fans or one piece fans. They're gonna consume it in all possible facets. Once I catch up on the one piece anime, I'm sure I'm gonna be jumping over the manga to consume more content. And I'm gonna watch season 2 of the live action the moment it drops cause I'm super excited about that too because again, I love one piece. And finally when they do remake the anime, I'm gonna be watching that as well. I'm hyped for it. I do not think this is gonna cause fatigue because I think the people who like one piece in their certain forms will continue consuming it that way. And this is just gonna grow the fan base even bigger.",

I really hope that this next chapter he has an awakening or whatever, but I still think he's sorry. Bro. The Kaiser Agenda will not be pushed while I'm here. We all know how it goes on. A character gets a flashback in anime. They either die or get a crazy power awaken. That niggas about to get a dual leg Kaiser Impact Bros about to go shot for shot with a soggy out of everybody in blue locker. I wanna see get power of the dude. I'm just waiting for Nagi. Bro. Nagi has been sorry for so long. Nagi used to be my favorite character too. Bro, I'm be honest. Bro. But he just got washed that last game. We're probably gonna see a Kaiser Awakening for sure do, but I'm here hoping for a Nagi awakening. If that next game that he plays he doesn't score something I'm gonna lose it.

    "voice_to_text": "online can't seem to decide on whether or not women fetishizing gay men is a bad thing so I am a gay man and I have a lot of things to say about this whole uh fujoshi situation so for those of you who don't know the term fujoshi is Japanese in origin it originates off of this Japanese forum website called 2channel um fujoshi itself is a pun on a Japanese term for a proper woman and it instead means \u201crotten woman\u201d and this is rotten in the sense of like the classical definition of rotten like decayed spoiled stuff like that and this was a term used largely by men to refer to women in fandom spaces um who would typically do things that they didn't like such as you know shipping characters in general or whatever else but notably it was not a term that exclusively referred to women who enjoyed the boys love genre and the reason that these women are called rotten specifically was because in Japanese society there is an expectation that in a woman's life at some point she will leave behind the things of uh the things of her childhood and such and uh you know begin to focus on adult life and being and like being the mother of the family and these women were called rotten because they had \u201cspoiled\u201d themselves by either making themselves quotes around this by \u201cmaking themselves undesirable to men\u201d  or, in the case of ones who were married, \u201cshaming their families and husbands\u201d and such and so uh this term was eventually reclaimed by women in these fandom spaces like uh oh you're saying that I'm rotten well I'll be as rotten as I want to be and they began self identifying as fujoshi and so uh what people in uh western spaces have done is take a derogatory term that was reclaimed by the people it was used against and using it as a derogatory term again so a lot of people are using the language of gay liberation to be misogynistic because fujoshi began as a misogynistic term and frankly which, of these sounds more homophobic to you? is it A: there are women who consume media about gay men and like it or B: gay men are endangered and need to be protected from the scary straight women like one of those sounds far more homophobic to me than the other additionally to ignore the effect that the anti fujoshi \u201cmovement\u201d I guess you'd say has had on gay trans men would be at best naive and at worst outright malicious like uh the amount of people who will say \u201coh,\u201d \u201cthese are just straight women\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026pretending to be gay men to infiltrate gay male spaces to get with gay men\u2026\u201d \u201cbecause they fetishize them.\u201d like, if you switch the genders around then like that's basically just classic transphobic rhetoric like there is no way around it and that's not to say that uh all anti fujoshi people are transphobes um there are definitely transphobic people mostly TERFs who who will pedal this uh pedal this narrative of straight women uh attempting to fetishize gay men and then there are people who otherwise like would not hold a lot of transphobic views hearing that and thinking \u201coh\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026I don't like gay men being fetishized\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026so I'm also against fujoshis\u201d and just agreeing that without any um are at agreeing with it at face value so the ultimate takeaway to this is that whenever you hear about a group of people um do your own research like look into them from sources that are not just TikTok videos uh yeah"

I'm talking about the fact that you will probably just quit TikTok altogether. I need people to understand this is not okay. And if you are ever called doing this, just know you'll be sent to psychiatry. Because, like, I'm fucking done with you. If any of my friends ever contributed to this kind of behaviour to the community, I will drop kick them like I did so many other fucking times, but 10 fold. Please understand, we do not want this.

    "voice_to_text": "Naruto and the show would have ended well, and it actually would have been higher than a 7 out of 10. Oh brother, this guy stinks. Listen bro, I have no idea why Naruto fans get so pressed when you say that the show is not a 10 out of 10. It is my opinion. My fucking opinion that the ending took the show from a 9 out of 10 to a 7 out of 10. And I will be explaining more of it right fucking now. Let's get into it. Remember, if any of y'all wanna fucking debate me on a take, join my discord. I will literally school every single one of y'all. Link is in bio. My main problem is that Kaguya's existence changed the entire history and lore of Naruto and changed all of it from cool parallels to a an asshole reincarnation. Without Kaguya there is no OSHA and Indra looking to seal her. And without those two there is no reincarnation leading to Naruto and Sasuke having the power to seal Kaguya. It took literally insanely written parallels between them, like these two on top of their fucking statues in the final valley to them all being reincarnated from aliens. Dog, you took the coolest power system known to fucking man with ninjutsu and turned it into a derivative of aliens. Everything is now a derivative of aliens. Which means that yes, the reincarnation was an asshole because it would not have existed if Kaguya didn't exist. Kishimoto wrote himself into a corner with Madara, and that's where Kaguya came in. She wasn't fucking foreshadowed. She's a derivative of an asshole because he wrote moderate so well. Again, without Kaguya, the reincarnation trope doesn't fucking exist. It's like spoon feeding you the parallels between them and calling you stupid. Parallels between them two and Hashirama and Madara were some of the most amazing parallels ever. But because they added Kaguya, now it makes it all about aliens and now it's spoonfini you calling you too stupid to fucking understand what was happening? And my gripe isn't really with the side characters. Yes, I would have liked to see Rock Lee have more screen time, but they also have some amazingly written side characters like Itachi and like Nagato. Without this garbage ending, the show is a 9 out of 10, at least for me. Brings it down to a 7 out of 10. And it's my fucking opinion. Literally cope about it bro. Aliens weren't foreshadowed. There was never any mention of aliens. Reincarnation wasn't foreshadowed. There was never any mention of reincarnation. The only thing that was there was the parallels between all of them. But then again, it was taken to a different level and made them reincarnations of fucking aliens. And connected through that thorough line. Which is dumb as fuck in my opinion. And again, if you have a problem with my takes or so you can debate me, join The discord. And I will school you in a debate straight up."

    "voice_to_text": "Infinity is simply just a space that you can increase and decrease. It would be for space. Yeah, so w mutual, by the way. Go follow him. But I just want to further add to this argument again. we know that Infinity works by slowing anything that approaches Gojo down to the point that it never actually reaches him. And we know that Gojo was able to train his infinity to work based off of purely reflex. So the second his mind senses something as dangerous, infinity activates to protect him from it. But wait a minute. Who else had a technique like that? Oh shit, right? It's almost like Gaara's sand did the same exact thing. Protected him the second his mind sensed danger, because it basically had a mind of its own. And rock Lee was able to outmaneuver his reflexes to the point that his sand couldn't even have enough time to sense the danger and react to it. So this reflex that senses danger and automatically protects the user can be out maneuvered. Okay, and if infinity also works based off of sensory and sensing danger, then if it's not already activated, it can be out maneuvered before it activates. On top of that, we know Gojo doesn't have unlimited energy, so he can't keep infinity on forever. And have already proven that you can break through Gojo's infinity with a high output attack that overwhelms his energy output. In other words, if you're hitting Gojo's infinity. With more energy than he's putting into the infinity, you can break through it. He has to amplify or put more cursed energy into his infinity to keep attacks out when they're stronger or bigger. For example, a normal punch is going to take a lot less energy from Gojo to block with infinity than the earth exploding or something. Obviously, you know, there's different scales. So not only can Infinity be broken through, but if it's not already activated, Gojo can be blitzed before he can even activate it, as we've seen before with characters like Gaara, who was blatantly able to out maneuver sand that could sense danger and protect Gaara automatically without his conscious will. So anyone as fast as Rock Lee or faster can just speed blitz before Infinity even gets activated, because Gaara, Sand, and Gojo's Infinity basically work the same way, they just do different things. So in the end, infinity is not infinite. Let's stop it.",

    "voice_to_text": "What's a video game that you know will never exist, but you would pay so much money to see happen? Let me cook a fairy tale game in the vein of Monster Hunter. So basically, instead of having the 14 different weapons, you'll have various different, like, magic attributes. You know, ice, fire, light, um, wherever the fuck Lucy had, the door one, um, you know, lightning, shadow or all that nonsense. And rather than fighting, like, monsters throughout the game, you'll be fighting the, um. Or you can still fight monsters, you know, like random monsters, just, um, NPC style things that you can program into the game, but also like, main, like, story point fights. They will be, um, villains, maybe even some heroes from the show. And as you beat the villains, you know, all the heroes, you unlock more types of magic or you unlock more powerful forms of the magic that you already have. And the reason I said in the style of Monster Hunter specifically is because that is a game that puts an emphasis on, like, team oriented gameplay. Like, there are certain missions where, I mean, you could solo them, but it's better and easier if you do as a team. And you're obviously one of the themes of fairy tales, friendship and, you know, teamwork and that sort of stuff. So just implement that into the game. And you could even implement, like, low accurate details of the show into the Game like, for example, if you have an ice maid who's maxed out, and he's unlocked Iced Shell, that can do serious damage to a strong enemy, and if it's a weak enemy, it one shots them. But it does come at a cost. Where, like, if you're implementing the. The cart system of one time, so where, you know, 3 carts in your teams. Basically like mission failed. Well, let's see, for balance, it takes 2 cards, you know, so basically you. You have one life left at the end of the um. At after using that move successfully. And of course, the more character you beat, the better drip you unlock as well.",

So you admitted with your whole chest that you never seen a single episode of bleach, you haven't read a single chapter of the manga, and you're talking all of this good shit? Oh, I'm sorry to tell you this, but the fact that you haven't even seen or read a chapter or episode kind of makes every single thing are you say no and void. Anything that comes out of your mouth about boo leaks means nothing. Because you haven't even seen it. Also, if you just did a tiny tiny tiny bit of wee socks you would have found that bleach actually inspired series such as Demon Whale Jujutsu, Kaisen Black Clover, and even even my hero was inspired in some way by bleaks. The four most popular new Genama can. Because you never even seen boo leaks. You wouldn't even recognize what is what. What exactly is police inspired in these series? Because you never even took the time to watch the series. Congratulations, you played yourself."

    "voice_to_text": "If Krillin was on earth, would he have stopped Omni Man? Oh my goodness, let's. Let's. No exaggeration, you would likely need at most Namics Saga Krillin if an absolute most android to sell Saga Krillin to defeat the likes of Omni Man. And the only reason I'm pushing that far into the series is for the speed, because we know that Omni Man's like best feats are his speed feats. Because strength wise, him and two other viltrumites were needed to destroy a destabilized planet, which puts him comfortably around like continental to multi continental in terms of power. But even if we highballed him and said that he could have destroyed a planet viltrum by himself and put him at planetary, that would still put him at like Raditz level. And that's crazy because by the Namek saga Krillin's power level was already like 50 times higher than Raditz. So me pushing to Namek Saga or further isn't to deal strength wise with Omni Man, it's more so to deal with his speed. Because speed is gonna be the only thing in Omni Man's favor up until a certain point in the Dragon Ball series. Because strength wise and durability wise he doesn't stand up to even Namik Saga or Android Saga Krillin in terms of power, let alone if we are using current Krillin like tournament of power or even Moral Arc or later Krillin. Ironically, Krillin flicks Omni Man's head off. Especially if this is like A bloodlusted thing where Krillin is for some reason going for the kill. Even Omni Man speed would be nothing compared to current Krillin. Even when he was sparring against base Goku and we knew base Goku was more than likely holding back. It doesn't matter how much he's holding back, that is still Goku. The fact that Krillin could even make a suppressed Goku fight back properly is a feat in itself. And let's just say for the sake of argument, we made their stats equal. I'd still bet on Krillin because he is a better fighter. So even an equal stats match up where everything is equalized. I'd still say Krillin because he just has the ability to fight properly, whereas Omni Man isn't as skilled of a fighter. But yeah, at any normal circumstance, anything past the Namek Saga's overkill.",

The action of thinking about something logical or in a sensible way. He explained the reasoning behind his decision at a media conference. He explained the reasoning behind this decision with his story. He explained this. He explained that to say the reasoning does not matter is Nolan void. Reasoning is basically explaining why it matters. Like, do you hear yourself? No, you don't. You're just a Dragon Ball hitter. I know, and that's why at the end of the day, they'll still be the go Goku, will still be the face of anime. The main MC, the best MC. It'll still be the number one anime in Japan and America. This is its history, which was created by this man. He created a legacy. This is gonna go on for generations. People are finna talk about his creation for generations. Whether you don't like Dragon Ball or not, it's still in your conversation, which is giving it attention. Thank you. All of this. Everything anime stems from this. Let's get that straight. Doesn't matter if they were repetitive or not. I don't think they're repetitive. And if it can be explained with a reasoning, you can't say the reasoning doesn't matter. The reasoning is what makes the matter. It's what makes it matter. What are you talking about? I got no respect for Dragon Ball haters? None whatsoever. You don't like the anime, don't watch it. Move on. Don't let it come out your mouth. Don't let it come into your thoughts. Just move on. Keep moving. Cause this shit ain't going anywhere anytime soon. Y'all know every time they come out with a new series, a new season or new game, they're breaking the internet. It's not Naruto with their copy and paste. It's not MHA with their cash grab greedy ass mentalities. It's dragon. All mother Fucking Z, Super. Doesn't matter. Dragon Ball as a franchise, they're the best. The GOAT. Father of anime, father of the Big Three. It's just me. Hell you talking about? Are tournaments not a viable way to test strength? Thank you. And if we want to say it's repetitive? Anyone who actually watches the show knows that the Cyberman and Cell Junior could not both detonate. Yeah, cyber man can attach themselves to anyone already. You're wrong. One is completely green and a whole different race. And the other is blue black with some gold and some dark blue. Again, whole different race. So, y'all ready? Down more than two points, by the way, but i'mma keep going. These things, we're actually strong. These things were actually scrapping. And it took Gohan raging to take these things out. These things. New commandment, y'all. Hmm? Would you look at that? These things came straight out of the cell like the dude said. And cyber man just Came from space. So, yeah, you're wrong. Keep sipping that hater, right? I'mma drink my water with you. And do what you do. There still be number one. There still be remaining. No matter how hard you hit. So see you later.",

I don't wanna be Naruto, I don't wanna be Ichigo, I don't wanna be Miles Morales. I don't be none of them. Because, yeah, you get the powers, yeah, you the MC. Diverse. But guess what you get with that? You get the sinister six, you get the Espada, you get the Akatsuki. And that shit sucks. Oh, you think. You think that's just in the comics? Naughty. Gonna get him in real life too. They call him Miles Morales NPC. They damn near calling Miles Morales at this point. So if somebody sees him on the street, they can go, oh, damn, that's Spider Man. Let's get him. No, I'm good. Say, keep that, I'm civilian. And listen, this is not to make light of him getting robbed. That shit sucks. However, you was making all that money getting all them galaxies on that sidewalk, and you thought DOC OC wasn't gonna pull up? You thought electro wasn't gonna come out the cut from a different timeline to give you a canon event? I don't know. That's all I'm saying. Just make me a side.

I just wanna let you guys know as an anime fan, it's been a joy to watch. It's bring me back to the days of 3 60 p Fucking Linkin Park AMVs off of YouTube or or Dragon Ball Z Amvs you download off a Limewire. It just amazing, amazing, amazing. Y'all are so goddamn talented. Extremely talented and I just wanna thank you. It doesn't matter if you don't like an anime or whatever you. You gotta admit, whatever the anime, the AMVs these people are making are fire. So thank you from me as an anime fan to you anime editors. Keep doing that shit cause this shit is fucking great. Side note can some of you motherfuckers do some goddamn bleach edits for the love of god? Especially to this song? Like bleach is so goddamn drippy. The song is drippy. It just goes together.

Il rappelle aussi que marie-joie s'est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 10.000m d'altitude, donc sur headline, et il se questionne sur la pertinence qu'il y a 1 phare aussi haut dans le ciel. Il nous donne sa th\u00e9orie selon laquelle les dragons c\u00e9lestes auraient plac\u00e9 1 phare \u00e0 cette altitude en pr\u00e9vision de la mont\u00e9e des eaux. Car oui, dans le dernier chapitre, et attention au spoil, Vega punk nous dit que le monde va sombrer sous les eaux, laissant penser que l'eau va continuer \u00e0 monter et peut-\u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 10.000m d'altitude, c'est-\u00e0-dire jusqu'\u00e0 redline. En vrai c'est 1 bonne th\u00e9orie, j'aime beaucoup. Par contre, moi en voyant \u00e7a, j'ai pens\u00e9 \u00e0 autre chose. Suite au dernier chapitre, je vous ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 de la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle peut-\u00eatre que 1 fois que l'eau sera mont\u00e9e, les dragons c\u00e9lestes partiront tout simplement vers la lune. Et moi je me pose la question, est-ce que ce phare, il serait pas l\u00e0 justement pour \u00e7a ? Qui nous dit que les dragons c\u00e9lestes ils ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 construit des bateaux volants pour faire des tests pour essayer d'aller jusqu'\u00e0 la lune ? Et donc du coup, bah ce phare qui est plac\u00e9 tout en haut de Red Line, il serait l\u00e0 pour guider les bateaux volants des dragons c\u00e9lestes ? C'est dingue, pour pas qu'ils se perdent au milieu des nuages et cetera. Ce serait pas fou les gars parce Que oui, 1 phare de base c'est l\u00e0 pour guider les bateaux pour pas qu'il se prenne des montagnes et cetera. Donc ce phare, s'il est plac\u00e9 l\u00e0, peut-\u00eatre que c'est pour aider les bateaux volants tout simplement. Bref voil\u00e0 les gars, je sais pas ce que vous pensez de ma petite th\u00e9orie, honn\u00eatement je la trouve pas mieux que celle de levarant, juste elle est diff\u00e9rente. Donc dites-moi ce que vous en pensez. Vous \u00eates plut\u00f4t team levarant ou team guiki ? Dans la bonne humeur et la bonne ambiance d'ailleurs allez follow le varan, il fait du contenu de qualit\u00e9 et d'ailleurs je sais pas si vous avez vu mais il a gagn\u00e9, euh. Le jeu du mon corveau l\u00e0 qui veut gagner des Berry ! Incroyable ! Ce mec est 1 monstre de connaissance en One Piece, bien plus que moi d'ailleurs ! Donc allez le follow",

First off, if I get even the slightest hint that an ally, or hell, even someone I met just once even has a hint of evil or a hint of becoming evil, I'm gonna do one of two things. Both involve my fist in their face. I'm either going to knock some sense into them or knock them six feet under. Whichever happens first. I am not dealing with a possible major threat, especially if they are like a lead supporting character, because that means their power would actually be a threat if they were allowed to actually go far. So either punch them repeatedly until they've just get those thoughts out of their head, or keep going until there's no possible chance they could become a threat because they're going to be buried and the next thing. I am not respecting one V ones. I don't care if you're even slightly stronger than me, or hell, even if we're equal in power, I am bringing every ally I have. Hell, I'll bring the damn sensei character and we're jumping you if you pose any sort of threat to the world. especially if you're a threat to multiple people or the world at large. We are not respecting one v ones. I am not pulling some modern JJK where they are just fighting 1 v 1 when most of The series, they jumped people. If you are a genuine threat, don't expect to be 1 v 1. And lastly, I'm gonna do kind of a. I guess you could say this is a disrespectful thing. I will say the name of one attack just to hit you with a different one. One, it catches you off guard. 2 it makes me less predictable. And 3, it's just gonna be something that most characters don't do. Oh, and on top of that, I'm not gonna just declare what attack I'm directly gonna be throwing. I'm not gonna be charging like a Kamehameha or a Rasengan. Because then they hear what is gonna be coming at them. I'm gonna leave them on their toes, not knowing what they're gonna get hit by. Or if I really wanna throw them off, say the name of the attack that they think they're gonna get hit by and try to prepare for that. When in reality, I have something entirely different being cooked up to throw right at them."
