    "voice_to_text": "so if you're pro life anti abortion anti planned Parenthood see even when they try to apologize it doesn't come off as genuine or it's just a bunch of bullshit that's the older millennial trying to apologize for the things he said when he was drunk in which he did say that he was pro choice and that's the reason why he was okay with unaliving mentally challenged people now all of a sudden he's not pro choice and he's only apologizing to people that are pro life anti abortion and anti Planned Parenthood his apology is a giant virtue signal at this point but what's funny to me is when people talk about like the sanctity of life that's all they care about is just the word life they don't care about everything that goes into the life the experiences the environment and all those thing they don't care that that child didn't ask to be born they didn't ask to be born in a poverty into a country into a religion into the parents that they have in the family search they don't get a choice in any of those things they're just thrust into life but when they try to do make choices for themselves about who they are and who they wanna be like trans issues then they're looked upon and called ridiculous or unmoral or trying to destroy the fabric of society always like to hear when these people talk about like well isn't just the experience of life worth it yeah for some people that are doing really good but you know there are a lot of people that unalive themselves ask those people how they felt because if their life was so bad that they decided to unalive themselves and continue living that speaks volumes about the experience of life right the fact that unaliving oneself is such a widespread thing I I can't give any weight to the experience of life argument and no I'm not trying to say it's okay just to have abortions willy nilly or whatever but the vast majority of reasons why people are anti abortion make no sense he also keeps referring to as murdering babies which is just a bunch of nonsense because the technical definition of what's inside the womb is not a baby it doesn't become a baby until it leaves the womb inside the womb it is considered a fetus yeah we have words with definitions for a reason it's the same argument y'all like to make about trans people it's like we have male and female for reason and definitions don't change yeah well in this case the definition of a fetus is a human life inside of a womb he likes to use the word babies because it's an appeal to emotion it's a logical fallacy the older millennial isn't sorry that he said those things he's sorry he got the backlash from saying those things because no matter how drunk I get I have never ever said the world would be a better place if we just unalived the mentally handicapped he's not sorry for that that dude honestly thought he was making some like philosophical broke point and people would support him and it turned out that they didn't so now he's backtracking if you don't know what a grifter is then you just saw one because I also remember him saying I don't give a shit what anybody thinks I'm gonna say what's on my and then he apologizes for what he thinks you know I've heard conservatives say people that do that are called weak and liberals because they don't stand on their convictions but I digress here the vast majority of abortions are not done because somebody wants to go on vacation but then again at the crux of this argument is the simple fact that conservatives are trying to tell people what to do with their bodies and using government force to do that because at the end of the day when we look at law and how personality is defined in the United States Constitution and how we practice all these things together because at the end of the day we don't treat them the fetuses like human beings we treat them like a fetus when we look at the Constitution and the laws and everything surrounding all of the stuff is a fetus unless in the case of like somebody who intentionally tries to unalive the mother and they knew that there was a fetus inside but for the most part doesn't have Social Security card can't get insurance on it can't register it for school or anything like that you can't there's nothing fetuses aren't separate from their mothers at that point you can't claim it on your taxes calling it a baby or thinking of it as like a a baby only advantages those who are anti abortion because like I said before it's an appeal to emotion it gets you to think about a baby outside of the womb and you trying to do harmful things to that but do you really wanna know how to get people to answer a question about whether fetuses or anything inside of a womb is like worth the life of one baby on the outside you ask them this hypothetical there is a lab that is on fire and in a petri dish there are hundreds of potential fetuses and then there is one crying baby which one do you save most people are gonna say the crying baby they don't care about whatever's in the petri dish and that's what type of response they're trying to get at when they call they the baby inside of the womb or say that you're murdering babies or whatever anyways the older man millennial isn't sorry he does not fucking care dude it's just another wannabe trash can at this point"

    "voice_to_text": "The Indiana Attorney General says that abortion reports should be public records. I have more on this story. You can go back and watch the last video if you want, like, the full info on what the Indiana attorney General is up to. But the short version is that he wants to bring back individual abortion reports and make them publicly available in the same way that birth or death certificates are. He's saying he needs them because that is how. Making those publicly available to third parties is how he figures out who to prosecute. So the new bit of news is that an Indiana anti abortion group, voices for life, is now suing the state. They're suing the. The state health department for the right to access people's abortion reports. They say that it's the right of private citizens to look through these reports to look for evidence of wrong doing that they can then turn over to the attorney general's office if they see something sketchy. What this means, essentially, is that they want to be able to comb through people's records. People's names wouldn't be in them, but there would be identifying information, especially if you're from a rural community. Um, they want to be able to comb through these reports, scour these reports, look for anything that they think that the AG can. Can use to target abortion providers and clinics. And by the way, they're not, um, finding stuff that is like, oh, my Gosh, this. This clinic put this person's health and life in danger. No, they're talking about. They, um, filed this report 12 hours late. They, um, you know, miss this small requirement that the licensing board in code, blah, blah, blah. Says, like, they're going after these little petty things, anything to make abortion providers lives miserable, right? And they are willing to completely, just. Just decimate our privacy in the process. So make sure to, um, check out the newsletter. The. The story is up there, but it's. It's bad."

But when he says, keep throwing them away. Because have you noticed that Planned Parenthoods are in the most poverty stricken parts in America? Like, for example, I live in Georgia, so there's Planned Parenthoods in downtown Atlanta. Okay, y'all realize that the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, is a relative to Charles Darwin, who invented Darwinism, survival of the fittest. She wanted to use eugenics to make a perfect race. So by making a perfect race, she, you know, created birth control, um, to make a perfect race, which, um, would take out, um, pretty much everybody that wasn't white. So survival of the fittest, um, if you had this trait, or this trait, or this trait, whatever it was, um, she was gonna use the idea of eugenics to create a perfect race. Um, so that's why when you see, um, Planned Parenthood, you see them in specific communities, um, and it's targeted. That's why. That's why there's so many Planned Parenthoods in, um, I guess you say more poverty stricken, um, cities and areas. Because Margaret Sanger wanted to create a perfect race. And by doing that, she was destroying every other race and allowing women to access free healthcare and free, free, um, maternal and, um, pregnancy care. No, she wants you to have an Abortion, that's why",

They dont even realize where they stand in the argument of a woman\u2019s right to choose. #politics #abortion #prochoice ",
    "voice_to_text": "I actually agree with these college kids that Palestinian children matter. He then, of course, goes on to make this abortion argument about how do they. Do they think that the children in the womb of Palestinian women also matter, right? Oh, sick burn. But here's the reality. Um, conservatives, or at least pro lifers, tend to make this argument. And it tells me that either they are pretending, which is possible, or that they don't actually understand what the pro choice argument is when it comes to, um, abortion. It is the right to make a choice. You don't have to have an abortion. No one is telling you you have to. It is the right as a human being for a woman to make her own choice. Ironically, the pro life argument is gotta have, you know, gotta have this kid no matter what. And I don't agree with it, but at least that's consistent with what the title that you use. Ironically, though, the vast majority of pro lifers are for exceptions, right? Therefore, exceptions of in the case of rape or incest, um, or, you know, possible death of the mother. I would argue, and people don't like to hear this, but I would argue those people are actually pro choice too. Because if you can make a choice in certain situations, then you're for choice. It doesn't mean that you always choose abortion. It just means that you make a choice other than keeping the Kid, in every single instance. So people who are like, I'm for exceptions, guess what? You're in the same fucking group as the people who you rail against. The problem is, you don't ever see any nuance in your argument. You only see it as those guys bad, us good. And that's the problem. We're not all cavemen. We can be smarter than that. But you're making terrible arguments. And sometimes you don't even know what side of the argument you're on or the side that you're arguing against, which is pathetic. And this guy, uh, that I stitch, um, just so people know his history, he used to work for the Trump administration, but he was fired because he's such a gambling addict that it made him a basically, um, an easy person to flip by a foreign asset. So they fired him because he couldn't stop, uh, betting all his money on a fucking pony or whatever. So this guy is not a moral center for anything. But again, people like him don't even know the argument that they're arguing against, nor do they barely know their side of it. Pathetic."
