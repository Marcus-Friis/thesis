Our GOAL should be that no child should ever have to worry about getting pregnant EVER and yet this white entitled woman, having proven that its \u201cpotentially not fatal\u201d does what exactly? Give more ammo to pedophiles? That being pro-life means that your child or teen or adult or any fucking adult who is harmed sexually is not important at all compared to the bundle of cells that they have in their bodies that they do not need nor want? Are y\u2019all fucking insane? The point of being pro-choice is the choice part, goddamnit. Children shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being parents when theyre still kids, and adults shouldn\u2019t be forced to have kids just because the state and the federal system deems their bodies as properties and places of child birth rather than a human being who is going to have to brunt the weight of life. This whole anti-abortion rethoric is sickening and lets not forget that there are people out there who need abortives just to live comfortably.  And what, were getting rid of condoms now too? You want more STD\u2019s to spread, children and adults to be harmed, and unwanted babies everywhere??? The state and federal system doesnt care about the damage that this is going to do to the people at all!!! Because I\u2019m not all that intelligent and knowledgeable about politics, but even I know that removing the option\u2026 is just going to cause more death, more famine, more people and children on the streets, and so so SO much WORSE!

So you think the Catholic teachings are against greed, gluttony, lust, envy, wrath, sloth, and rainbow flags? Yeah, you're truly fucking special. I also thought it's funny how he talked about the truth being of the utmost importance because the truth is the minority now, and then tied that to Catholicism. Yeah, Republicans will go to their grave swearing that Jesus existed without a single piece of evidence, but then when an obvious misogynist like Trump is accused of sexual misconduct, it's where is the proof? This might be a difficult thing to get your small little brain around, but just because you believe in something doesn't mean that it's the truth. Also, given those very believable accusations about you and the Mao cheerleader, I think it's borderline insanity to get up on stage and call Biden a hypocritical Catholic. Cause if you can't be Catholic and pro choice, you can't be Catholic and pro cock. But now if you are gonna criticize the Catholic Church, I would say the problem isn't priest taking photos with their dogs, but more so the systemic pedophilia. And that is a truth about your religion. There are articles, police reports, statistics, and of course we have these comments about women which are so outdated and traditional even addressing them is just Like, because if you want women to stay at home, which I'm sure many of them would be happy to do. Actually, maybe you need to speak to the men in the room and tell them to step up as providers. Because how the fuck do you expect women to be homemakers? Most of the men out here want them to split the Bill. Ah yeah, the baffling paradox of how women stay at home with no jobs, but also don't be a gold digger. I do think we should give Isabel her props though. Not for being a homemaker or a wife, but for her job as a full time beard.",

    "voice_to_text": "okay so that's Harrison butker for you Kansas City Chiefs NFL football player blah blah blah I don't care about what he plays how he plays I don't know wanna comment on his football talent but he thinks that it's appropriate to go on as a guest commencement speaker to a college where he has been invited and paid for to speak to tell the women sitting there who's getting the degrees that day that these degrees are basically meaningless and the true purpose lies in becoming wives and mothers so something did not seem quite right about him and the speech so I had to look him up and see what the issue was so I did find a couple of things firstly he got went to Georgiatech um for an industrial engineering degree and then he also played football for georgiatech so his degree was basically free the second thing was a more interesting thing that I found was his mother she is a radiation oncologist at Emory University and she has actually held that position for 36 years so this guy is literally dealing with some kind of mommy issues and projections and is taking it out on all the women and telling them that what they're doing is basically meaningless because they need to be more moms and wives rather than being you know kick ass career women Harrison take this out with your mom because looks like that's the source but I would also talk to all the women who sat through this despicable speech is like men like him like Harrison Butler they do not want women to be educated for a couple of reasons education provides enlightenment and it also provides empowerment it's very hard to oppress someone who has both because a person who is enlightened and empowered understands the financial literacy has financial literacy understands socioeconomic literacy and can see through issues and can actually find out solutions to them and can think critically they don't want any one of those for women because they want to control women and they want to have women beneath them they don't see them equal the other thing that is said that mothers and wives right men like him will always talk about women becoming mothers but they will never talk about men becoming fathers that's because motherhood is a really like a honey trap for women and they want to set it up as a honey trap for women so they can trap them for 15 20 years because women who have children they know how busy their lives get when they have children correct so that's what they want women to have like trap them in the honey trap for 15 20 years so that they cannot be empowered and so easy to oppress them that's exactly what he's saying there's no other hidden meaning they don't want you to have the knowledge education because that will be harder to oppress you and Harrison here's a little tidbit message uh tip from me who is an older woman way more educated than you and also more experienced in life than you the train you want these women to hop on has already left left the station long ago nobody's hopping on on that train with you women are already empowered well you are like 20 30 years a little bit late to this to to deliver the speech because women are no longer going to get influenced by uh misogynistic a hole like you I hope this helps",

    "voice_to_text": "If we go back to March 1982, and Senator Joe Biden was on the Senate Judiciary, he voted in favor of an abortion Bill, and that vote helped move that Bill out of committee. And the Bill was to state that abortion should be a state's rights issue. And the point that the older millennials trying to make here is that Joe Biden has changed his stance on abortion since 1982. And because US liberals aren't going, oh, Joe Biden, you are terrible for doing that, makes us hypocrites. Of course it doesn't make us hypocrites. It just points out the difference in the mindset of the conservative mind and the progressive mind. See, as a progressive, if you were to ask me this morning when I woke up, hey, Joe Biden voted on a Bill in 1982, which is now 42 years ago, that, uh, was about abortion. And what do you think Joe Biden stance on abortion was back in 1982? 39 year old Joe Biden, I would assume. I would say, well, you know, Joe Biden was 39 years old. Much younger, much more connected to the indoctrination he probably felt as a child. You know, 39 year old Roman Catholic Joe Biden, I would expect. In 1982, when the abortion issue was still kinda getting started and still navigating its way political, and what, what each side felt about it, I would assume that Roman Catholic Joe Biden in 1982, 42 years ago, would have been against Abortion. I assume that would be the case. And because I'm a progressive, I don't think that makes me a hypocrite. I actually expect people to change their beliefs on social issues as they go through adulthood and experience life and view the way things are. And taking tons of data, I expect them to analyze that data over the course of their life and change their minds about social issues. But in the mind of a conservative, the point of being a conservative is to, despite all the things that you observe, despite all the data that you analyze, it's actually to not analyze that data. That's why they say, you know, don't send your kid to college, they'll get indoctrinated. Because the whole purpose of the conservative political mindset is to go through life continuing to believe the same exact things that you socially believed when you came into adulthood, the same things that you were taught your whole life. The actual indoctrination needs to stay in effect. It doesn't need to be changed by all the things that you experience in life. And if you change the way you feel and you feel different 42 years later about a social issue, that makes you an inconsistent sellout if you're a conservative. So no, I'm not shocked that 39 year old Joe Biden was against abortion and that 81 Joe Biden is for a woman's right to choose. Because as a progressive, I believe the whole purpose of Life is to get better with age, not just stay the same miserable asshole."

    "voice_to_text": "so as we all know that the 6 weeks abortion ban in Florida just went into effect yesterday so before I talk about what I really wanna talk about I want to remind you all that the abortion measures will be on the ballot in November in Florida so please go out and vote and make your wise hard and make a change to this really draconian law that they just put in to effect now the rest of the video is actually for pro lifers and I'm only gonna talk to pro life for women because I really don't think men has any business telling us what to do with our uteruses as long as since we are not telling them what to do with their testicles so I don't think that even even count so pro life for women I want to just talk to you about what you just did having this draconian abortion ban in place in all these red states now including Florida and supporting these people who actually did that to us for starters I wanna mention that the banning abortion in these states and putting in criminalizing laws against medical care providers will only result and is resulting into these Obgyns and the care providers moving out of these states because nobody would want to work in a state where there is a constant fear of being criminalized for your you know the service you're providing so that you're gonna have less and less Obgyns to go to uh when you need them so don't you think that you will be pregnant at some point or you are going to need doctors you're not gonna get them that's what you did 20% chance of every pregnancy to result into a miscarriage I had one uh before my son and uh nothing that I did to cause it but you know what's gonna happen to you if you end up in that 20% group and have a miscarriage in these red states they're gonna arrest you first and ask you what you did to cause it lot of these times when miscarriages happen and you might need medical intervention to to actually remove all the fetal remaining uh to a procedure called DNC because lot of the times the body is unable to expel out all the fetal remaining and you need medical intervention you're not gonna get that you know what's gonna happen the remaining fetal remaining inside your body can get your body going to sepsis and eventually you're gonna die you know what else he did there's a chance that your pregnancy does not happen in your uterus and it happens in a fallopian tube and this this particular pregnancy is a nonviable pregnancy and it's called um ectopic pregnancy it's nonviable because the fetus cannot really grow in a fallopian tube it ends up with your fallopian tube being ruptured and the mother losing their tube if there is not timely medical intervention happening you don't think you can make it into that group ectopic pregnancies are very common it happens to a lot of people and you know what else is a possible the the possibility of that woman getting a second ectopic pregnancy increases after having the first one talk about the odds right you don't think you can make it into that group you know what else you did you might have a really like a smooth pregnancy up into the second trimester maybe up into the third trimester one out of 25 pregnancies end up having preeclampsia a condition in which the mother's blood pressure goes up to an extend that it can cause seizure it actually starts to cause organ damages like kidney damage and liver damage and you might end up losing those organs and the only process uh that can actually prevent you know like permanent damage to your body is medical intervention which is basically providing a C section removing the placenta and the baby you know what's gonna happen you're not gonna get out of that you don't think you can make it into that group it happened to me everything was fine up until like 38th week so you're not gonna get out of that you will not get any essential medical care when you are pregnant and you want that baby so bad you're not gonna get out of that you not only took away the abortion access from these women you took away essential medical care from yourself that's what you did I hope that helps congrats",

Do they think that the children in the womb of Palestinian women also matter, right? Oh, sick burn. But here's the reality. Um, conservatives, or at least pro lifers, tend to make this argument. And it tells me that either they are pretending, which is possible, or that they don't actually understand what the pro choice argument is when it comes to, um, abortion. It is the right to make a choice. You don't have to have an abortion. No one is telling you you have to. It is the right as a human being for a woman to make her own choice. Ironically, the pro life argument is gotta have, you know, gotta have this kid no matter what. And I don't agree with it, but at least that's consistent with what the title that you use. Ironically, though, the vast majority of pro lifers are for exceptions, right? Therefore, exceptions of in the case of rape or incest, um, or, you know, possible death of the mother. I would argue, and people don't like to hear this, but I would argue those people are actually pro choice too. Because if you can make a choice in certain situations, then you're for choice. It doesn't mean that you always choose abortion. It just means that you make a choice other than keeping the Kid, in every single instance. So people who are like, I'm for exceptions, guess what? You're in the same fucking group as the people who you rail against. The problem is, you don't ever see any nuance in your argument. You only see it as those guys bad, us good. And that's the problem. We're not all cavemen. We can be smarter than that. But you're making terrible arguments. And sometimes you don't even know what side of the argument you're on or the side that you're arguing against, which is pathetic. And this guy, uh, that I stitch, um, just so people know his history, he used to work for the Trump administration, but he was fired because he's such a gambling addict that it made him a basically, um, an easy person to flip by a foreign asset. So they fired him because he couldn't stop, uh, betting all his money on a fucking pony or whatever. So this guy is not a moral center for anything. But again, people like him don't even know the argument that they're arguing against, nor do they barely know their side of it. Pathetic.",
