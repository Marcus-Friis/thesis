This is weird. Also, making a sword first in Minecraft is kind of stupid. Like, um, getting a pickaxe or an axe is way more important. So it's impressive, but still needs a lot of work, so. Yeah.

I'm gonna give you the nuclear option. You got you. You will need it. Gen X is making you cry. Take exploiting the fact that you know, you, you. You didn't. Whatever. Alright, this is what you're gonna do. You gotta go to Google step by step instructions here. You're gonna click the little tab that says images and you're gonna type in in the search bar never ending story, eight tracks, swamp scene. You're gonna See, one certain image come up a lot. The one right near the shore. Kid pulling on a bridle of the horse. You're gonna find the highest quality of that image you can get. You're gonna download it to your phone or device. Then you are gonna make sure that is now your unlock screen. This won't harm you so long as you don't. This is the nuclear option. You do not ever handle the uranium. Do not watch the never ending story. However, if that image is your unlock screen and a Gen Xer is making you start to get the water works, you wanna shut that shit down. If you wanna go nuclear, and you are going nuclear, unlock your phone and then turn it around and point it at him like he was holding up a cross to a vampire. After that, you should run. Because when they done crying, they're coming for you. But you now have a nuke in your back pocket. Use it with distraction. They're gonna kill me for telling you that. That's the. I feel the number my bounty hunter count like it just went up. But I do believe in a fair fight. Oh, so fucked. You know, before I made this movie, I cried. Or this movie before I made this video, I cried. Yeah, that shit will kick Gen X right in the fucking dick. But like I said, after that fucking run.",

    "voice_to_text": "but imagine how tired we are I don't think anybody in the history of the entire world has ever used the phrase boys will be boys to defend any negative actions performed by boys and even if they did nobody accepts that as a proper argument against what they've done or an excuse or anything so for you to just say oh this happens a lot is really weird because I can say I've seen a lot of people say I'm just a girl to explain their own dumb actions which is the same context in which boys will be boys is used but I've seen the I'm just a girl be used way more than I've ever seen boys will be boys so it seems pretty appropriate that people would be more tired of the former phrase than the latter you know"

    "voice_to_text": "Pink! Yeah, pink! Let's feast. So the Minecraft movie is coming out soon, and this video I think shows how much Jack Black and Jason Momoa are a perfect idea to cast together. They seem to have very similar energy. I don't know how I feel about the Minecraft movie yet, but this is giving me high hopes. But I also had high hopes for the Avatar show and that did not pan out. With all the amazing video game movies that came out recently, I think this hopefully will do really good. Especially since they got Jack Black who is really good at video or he likes video games a lot. And Jason Momoa who is just like very funny. And I feel like he would be good in a Minecraft movie or an action movie, but video games nonetheless.",

And I realized that there was a better way. So I was giving them the, um, like a hint, and they were like, okay, cool. And they said, I've probably been playing Minecraft for longer than you've been alive. And one kid said, well, how long have you been alive for? And I said, for 21 years. That's double digits. And he looked at me like I was a fossil. And then I realized I was not kidding. Let's say I've been playing Minecraft for 11 to 12 years. That is older than that kid was probably even an idea.",
