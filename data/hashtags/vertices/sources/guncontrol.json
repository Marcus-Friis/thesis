    "voice_to_text": "so here's the update on the ghost gun lawsuits eight months later here's a ghost gun lawsuit update the city of Baltimore secured a 1.2 million dollar settlement against a ghost gun manufacturer now as a reminder ghost guns are materials that are sold as parts that can then be assembled to create a firearm but they don't count as firearms when it comes to the purchase and sale of them because in their initial forms they're not so they can't be regulated in the way that firearms are regulated but they can have the same results firearms do this lawsuit was against Polymer 80 which is the leading manufacturer of ghost Gun the lawsuit basically accused Polymer 80 of deliberately circumventing gun regulations law knowing that they could sell these things that can be assembled into fully functioning firearms without having to conduct the background checks that purchases of firearms require the city also argued that the sale of these ghost guns fueled gun violence in the city of Baltimore now giving the city $1.2 million was not the only part of this settlement the settlement also prohibits Polymer 80 from advertising for or selling ghost guns in the state of Maryland it also requires them to prevent dealers in neighboring states from selling to residents of the state of Maryland that one I'm not totally sure how the state is going to enforce and if they have the authority to because that could possibly qualify as interstate commerce which as a state they don't have the right to regulate that's federal government issue and this woman also agrees that Palmer 80 will provide quarterly reports for the ghost gun sales in those neighboring states to the state of Maryland",
