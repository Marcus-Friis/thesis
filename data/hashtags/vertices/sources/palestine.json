Franchement, en dehors de toutes id\u00e9es politiques, enfin bref, de tout ce que vous voulez, l\u00e0 on parle d'enfants qui se font bombarder, qui perdent leurs parents, qui perdent tout ce qu'ils aiment et qui se retrouvent tout seul, euh, sous leur maison qui est d\u00e9truite.

Bien \u00e9videmment qu'il y a des victimes des 2 c\u00f4t\u00e9s, mais l\u00e0 clairement il y a des gens qui ont 1 petit peu moins de chance que d'autres, c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire.

You wouldn't think, would you, that he has justified putting Gaza under complete, under complete siege. That is abstained on one cease via vote and sabotaged another. That he refuses to support an arms embargo on Israel. And that is being instrumental in amplifying and perpetuating a deceptive myth, uh, that of Israel's mass displacement and extermination of the Palestinian people as an act of self defence. That has been used to shroud these war crimes and crimes against humanity in assemblance of legitimacy. Which has in turn been used to manufacture the consent of the public for these and other reasons. Kirstama's pretended concern in the face of the massacre of displaced Palestinians in a refugee camp in Rafa. This functions essentially as political grooming. It is intended to condition or manipulate the public by presenting a false political persona of him in contrast to his true nature. In order to entrap the public in a continued relationship with the right wing war mongering Labour Party. A release of retaining their votes from election time in July.",

He actually reached out to me on Instagram to try to get the word out about his gofundme, um, because he is trying to evacuate his family of 13 people. I think the fact that he reached out to me on Instagram really says something. Me only having like 530 followers, not having a huge following just shows how very desperate he is.

Wages are so stagnant that people can hardly afford groceries; Target recently (basically) admitted that, \"yeah, we inflated our prices for funsies\" and now they're deflating them because of all the complaints about people being unable to afford shit. And this is what you're talking about? THIS is the most important thing you think you could possibly talk about at this point in time?! There are families in Gaza that don't exist anymore! There are entire genealogical pools that have been *wiped off the face of the earth*. There are people in Rafa begging for help. We are watching the wholesale destruction, slaughter and eradication of an entire people group; but you think strangers' genitals and which bathrooms they should use is the most important thing we can be fucking discussing right now?! What rock do you live under? What do you smoke? What do you drink? Because I would love some. I would love to be so detached and delusional and completely unaware of the world around me, so that I can be just as oblivious and focus on things that don't matter, just like you. I would love that! But no, instead, I wake up every day thinking about Palestine and how I'm unable to fucking help anybody because I'm broke, how all of my money has to go to rent, otherwise I will end up homeless. My thoughts are consumed about the deteriorating life of every American in this country, and how we are just watching a genocide happen in full goddamn view of everyone and God,  and you are sitting on your butt, in your bathroom, with your 4 inch baby pink acrylics, talking about genitals!! I think what hurts me the most is that there are so many people just like you, who literally don't give a darn about how the average American is this close to homelessness with every paycheck, and how there's entire families just gone, off the face of the planet. I hate you, but in a way I envy you. I envy the fact that you can hear all of this shit going on, hear about the misery and the frustrations and the unhappiness, and still be wholly consumed by whether or not somebody has a weenie. I don't know how.. but somehow I envy that.",

Hamas is only one faction (from the culture of Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region) of Israel's closest enemies that wanna completely wipe them out Israel simply wants to remove them from power and before people start spewing the Hamas propaganda one has to consider how much the Palestinian people have suffered under the hand of Hamas Yes we want the safety of children but it won't happen until Hamas is gone",

If you're a Mafia boss and your foot soldiers get arrested and you happen to be next, you should be arrested, no question. You're the swamp. But even without that, reality is this. The USA still has The Hague Invasion Act. It doesn't actually need any new laws, because at the end of the day, they could always use all available means to go and get their people back once they've been arrested before trial, or even during it, or even after it. Because the terms of Afghanistan at Lindsey Graham was talking about with the initial set of circumstances that put The Hague Invasion Act on the table and made it law. Because some US personnel were then put under the control of commanding officers from other nations, including the UK, with the view to carrying out security operations in Afghanistan. What they were worried about was that war crimes might be ordered by the senior officers of those commanding nations, whereas Afghanistan, USA, the UK or any others. So what they didn't want to do is that war crimes would be ordered, they would then be carried out, and they didn't then want to be tried for it. That was actually the original basis from which this came about. Since then, of course, as the law was progressing through the American law making system, the results were that it kind of expanded. Its rematch included elected Officials. And that's where this becomes a threat to them. But the reality is they should still be tried on war crimes. If war crimes have been committed and they've been complicit in that, you're an accomplice. End of story. Obviously, what he's fearful of here is being held to account at all.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm just trying to get some clarity okay I'm gonna try and give the Alphonse angle here as best I can for me this is a very simple decision Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden let me tell you guys why most people who have reached the conclusion that they're not gonna vote for Joe Biden primarily I'd say about 60% of people who changed their vote away from Joe Biden is because of the war between Israel and Palestine specifically Gaza  completely understand what's going on in Gaza is an atrocity it is genocide there's no other way to put it and the fact that the United States is supporting Israel in this madness is outrageous and I don't blame anyone for choosing that to be their single issue voter deal deal breaker I get it but here is where I kind of come into complication when Donald Trump was president now I want you guys to think about this when Trump was president he moved our embassy to Jerusalem to do nothing more than antagonize the people of Palestine right to prove a symbolic point that Jerusalem belongs to Israel if you listen to the rhetoric of the Republican Party present time and I believe it is a reflection of how Donald Trump thinks all you hear the Republican Party say is support Israel without question we must throw all the support give them all the military aid financial aid at our disposal so that they can defeat the enemy in Gaza there is no one that I've heard thus far in the Republican Party that has tried to be a voice of reason as it relates to Israel and Gaza that to me lets me know Donald Trump would not just support Israel in their actions but in bolding them at least the Democrat Party if we just look at it from a bare minimum standpoint at least in the Democrat Party there are voices powerful voices that are calling out US support of Israel and the need to withdraw when Joe Biden spoke at Morehouse just a few days ago he said himself that he is working on a ceasefire granted a little too late an action should have been taken far sooner but I can at the bare minimum if I'm just grasping for things here respect that at the bare minimum this administration can recognise the wrong that is being committed I'm not saying that they moved as quick as they needed to but at least they recognise I don't believe that what happened with Donald Trump Donald Trump is the definition of I'm gonna dig my heels into the sand and I'm gonna dare you to move me he loves opposition and the amount of opposition to Israel that is growing in the United States would only push Donald Trump to support them more I guarantee it something else to think about and this is more on a domestic front overnight the Supreme Court turned women into second class citizens it happened because we had Donald Trump in office for four years and he had the opportunity to put not one not two but three conservatives on a Supreme Court that fulfilled the Republican Party's wet dream of overturning Roe v Wade really think about that do you really wanna give that man an opportunity to add another and another and another you never know what could happen tomorrow to any of these Supreme Court justices do you really wanna give a man like Donald Trump that opportunity do you really wanna give the Republicans as a whole an opportunity to push policies such as Project 2025 that would literally roll back the years that people like Martin Luther King Malcolm X and so many others fought for us to have greater freedoms project 2025 would roll that back overnight do you really wanna give the Republican Party that type of control and power and opportunity really think about this young voters Joe Biden tried to cancel student loan debt a lot of you guys when it didn't fall through blamed him when you should have been blaming the Supreme Court why because it is a super majority of conservatives on the Supreme Court who ruled that Joe Biden trying to overturn our cancel student debt was unconstitutional you put Donald Trump back in office kiss it all goodbye at least Joe Biden now is making incremental cancellations of student debt Donald Trump would do none of the aboves so my point here is yes what's going on in Gaza is terrible and US support for Israel is out of line and I don't stand behind it at all however I'll take that reluctantly because I fully understand the latter would make that vary issue 10 times worse and also ding us here in the United States over the head this is a man Donald Trump who said that on his first day of office he'd be a dictator that's not something the leader of the free world should be joking about a man who just recently released a campaign ad that had the words that we have not seen since the days of World War Two in Germany let that sink in let that really sink in at the type of person we're dealing with here and sure you guys can vote for a third party candidate but let's keep it a buck let's keep it a hundred here R F k has no viable path to the White House and sitting out out of an election what are you doing like what are you actually doing protesting protesting how by not voting you're not hurting anybody but yourself these president's former presidents are gonna go off and make millions you not voting ain't hurting nobody but yourself and that's the how fun thing on that",

So that video just popped up on my feed, and the creator's not somebody who's known for, you know, their own is or accuracy, getting basic things right. But I was like, oh, maybe this is interesting. It's a book I'd never heard of. It's a book from 1695. He says, um, about the demography of Palestine. Um, and it said that the majority of the population of Palestine in 1695 was Jewish. There was only one city with a small Muslim population. Novelist sham. It's like, oh, never heard of this. It's interesting. So I did, like, you know, about half an hour of research, and he got the. He got everything wrong. Um, so the first thing is that he got the name of the author wrong. Um, the name he gave is the Latinization of the author's name. The author's name is actually Adrian Relon. He was Dutch. Might be pronouncing it wrong, but it's R E L A N D. Um, and I found a book about Audrina Milan called The Oriented Utrecht. And the main thing to know about Milan is that he never traveled beyond the borders of his home country. Um, so he. He didn't go to Palestine. He never been there. Apparently he'd never even been to France. And then I found a abstract of an article by an Israeli scholar, About him. Zur Shalev. Shalev. Note that Ralan's influential Palestinian ex monumentist Veteribus Illustrata was based solely on the evidence offered by ancient sources. And then I was like, wait a minute. Palestine in the. The turn of the 18th century was under Ottoman control, under control of a Muslim empire. And the Ottomans took it over from the mom looks, which is another Muslim empire. So how are there no Muslim. So then I looked at Bernard Lewis and Edmund Cohen's population and revenue in the towns of Palestine in the 16th century. It's amazing the things that you can find just by googling. At least until Google destroy search, which apparently is gonna happen really soon. And they note not one of the six towns of Palestine in the 16th century was exclusively Muslim. Uh, but there were minorities that lagged far behind the Muslims. Jerusalem had the most substantial minority population, followed closely by Gaza, actually. So, yeah, there you have it. Fact checking, it's always fun. He won't respond to this, by the way. He'll just be like, you're obsessed with me, that's why you're fact checking me. Then he'll just. He'll just move on to some other BS. But anyway.",

Only 5 of the immediate family members at the moment. A lot of rehab family members are sick, and they need support and medical support, and they need to evacuate safety from Gaza. So if you can share, donate, anything with that page, even just go follow Tamzim and start reposting her videos. Literally anything helps. Truly, no family should have to be going through what these families are going through right now. And remember, it's gone to the point that we can't look the other way just because we're privileged enough to do so. So please, just repost, share, like, comment. Anything you can do helps.",

We're talking about siblings with the same father that was a part of, essentially a holocaust, and only one of their kids speaks out about it.

This is also why your algorithm refuses to push for videos like this over videos regarding Israel being spoken of in a positive light. This is also why protestors are hiding their face, as Israel and Israeli Lobbyists have had a habit of doxxing the identities of anyone who speaks poorly of them. #thisjustin #tmyk #taxationistheftt #israel #palestine #alleyesonrafah #fypage #fyp\u30b7\u309aviral #react #alleyesonrafah\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 ",

He talks about Israel being booed off stage, being unfair to the artist, and she can't do anything about the bombings in Palestine. Meanwhile, I am. I'm telling you that she is still supporting it, and she is still on this European stage, happy, waving her flag, while this flag symbolizes a country that commit Genesis. Now, a lot of people say that she is 20 years old, she doesn't know what she's doing. I am 20 years old. I know exactly what happens in Gaza. I wouldn't support this country in any way, shape or form. Meanwhile, she is going on state, waving her flag with a smile. Not only that, but Israel had a petition against them signed by a bunch of former EOC members and contestants to not compete because Russia didn't compete either. And what did the EOC say? We are not a political, political competition. We do not do politics. And what is Israel's response to that? They write a political propaganda song about October 7th, calling it October Rain, with the EBU telling them several times to not only change the title, but also a bunch of lyrics. So what is. What is the argument about that? I bet that now you will argue, but she didn't write the song, she. She just performed it. She just performed it, which in it alone is Already pretty bad, but let's, let's, let's, let's ignore that she probably didn't write the song and just performed it. But let's, let's look at her harassing other contestants with her team. For example, photographing Bambi Thuk after they explicitly told Israel to not photograph them in any shape or form. Or photographing and posting the door of Greek contestant marinazari into their Instagram story with a marking tag. And let's not ignore the whole just Klein situation where after yours, Klein wasn't allowed to perform, an Israeli team member was harassing him for not performing. Mocking him or her mocking the audience for booing at her. Like the the Israeli contestant mocking the audience for booing and. And making fun of the whole situation. let's talk about her not being allowed to talk to other competitors because the Israeli government was fearing that if she talks to too many of the contestants, she might change her mind about her whole political stand, which in it alone is a. Is, is, is a hard statement. Or let's not talk about the whole thing with Israeli supporters using several credit cards to vote hundreds of times in different, in different countries in support for Israel. So I don't, I, I am not for booing any Jewish artist off stage, but if this Jewish artist is waving an Israeli flag, makes fun of other contestants, makes fun of the audience, makes fun of the people, and it's just such an asshole. To be around. I think. I think we're allowed to boo at her at any age.",

If Democrats actually cared about defeating Donald Trump, they would force him to get a ceasefire by using the full powers of the presidency (like HW, Carter and Reagan did) and then force him to step down as the candidate to have a contested convention so they can nominate a pro-ceasefire/progressive candidate to unite the base. But Liberals and Democrats continue to support and prop up Biden as he still allows a literal g*nocide continue to unalive Palestinains every single day. Its 2016 all over again, except even worse.

Its the year 2024-how do people still think this way?  And then, theres our american government just sending the people doing the bombing our money that they take from us.  #artists4ceasefire your redins are really making my job easier, love spotting it on the celebs!  #doyourpart #gaza #palestine #ceasefirenow ",
    "voice_to_text": "if we want to influence celebrities to speak out on Gaza her video makes it make so much sense so if you're anything like me you don't really know what's going on over there I really had no idea all that was going on in Gaza until the whole block party started and everybody started blocking celebrities and then the Hayley Bailey thing happens that's what really sparked my interest in what the fuck is going on and why is everybody so mad I don't watch the news I don't watch any kind of like world news I watch TikTok and that's it because I don't in my mind I can't do anything about it so I'm not gonna fuck with it okay well that's kind of like we can't do that no and I am in no way an influencer but I do have 12,000 followers which is more than like most of the surrounding towns have in population so in my mind I'm like oh shit maybe I should say something about this because in my mind I'm thinking I'm nobody um it does not matter what I have to say about it but at this point I'm seeing all these people bashing celebrities and people that have a platform for not speaking about it and I'm like okay I have a platform it may only be 12,000 people you know but I still have a fucking platform that I worked really hard for by the now being a mother what this lady said makes so much sense because I have really tried to re parent myself so that I can parent my children the correct way which is helping them learn how to be normal human and in that process I have Learned that beating kids um taking stuff away you know all the negative reinforcement that all the corporal punishment that we were raised it doesn't work I mean some of it might but not really it doesn't really teach them how to be grown UPS how to manage the stress how to not make those mistakes and what she says is you reward good behaviour which is I am all about when you are doing nothing but pointing out everything that's wrong or everything that the celebrity or person or kid or whatever is doing wrong that's not going to make them want to do right that just makes them feel less than and make someone crawl in a hole and not do what you want them to do so I did a quick Google search of celebrities who have supported Gaza or who have donated or spoke out something to that effect because I think it's better to shine a light on the people that are doing something instead of just forcing people to speak about it or block them that's kinda like a double edged sword like they'll speak on it yeah just like Haley did her little apology thing but did she mean it do they mean it do they really want to help or are they just doing it because you're forcing them to you're forcing their hands so like to me that's not if somebody was like let me give you $20 I know you you look like you need $20 I wanna help you let me give you $20 okay I would feel one way if somebody was like here's this $20 the world's forcing me to give it to you here's the $20 I get it it's still gonna be helpful and I get it but it's like you're doing it out of spite practical I understand how scary it is to get on the internet and voice your opinion when there are other people that could possibly not agree with your opinion believe me I fucking I have an entire the Kelsey show it has over 8 800 posts I have posted and most of them are about my event and at first it was very scary to start posting about them so when people were getting mad at celebrities I'm like I feel not how they feel but I understand why they're not talking about it but at the same time I'm like maybe you should grow a backbone and not worry about the bag so much and maybe spread the word because at this point I I've done the research now it's not fucking good and people do need the word does need to be spread and these celebrities have ungodly amounts of money to help the people it should not be on us the normal people of the world who have barely enough to get by to try to support these families when these celebrities are out there just living their fucking best life on their yachts and fucking private planes and giving a dollar or two or making a simple fucking post I get that that that's good I'm glad people are doing that but fucking syndrome so I made an entire list of all the celebrities that I found online that actually have started donating and have been outspoken about it and they are supporting and calling for ceasefire wearing the so since this video is already 4 minutes and 30 seconds of to me just fucking bitching and ranting I love it I'm gonna go ahead and start a whole series of celebrities who have donated to goth or spoken about because I think people just want the celebrities and the influencers to do their influencing job and spread the word and I get that so I'm gonna start a whole series of celebrities who do support Gaza and do make the the noise and do all the thing maybe that will get more track and maybe that will get the people who aren't you know saying something to do something",

    "voice_to_text": "So I posted a comment on this video about um my artist that I'm obviously supporting and now my favourite because they actually stand up for the cause and they they use their platforms to raise awareness and to create awareness and to to help to hopefully change the way governments and western powers are going about handling and managing what is happening in Palestine and one of the comments I received one of the I would I won't don't wanna call it ignorant ignorant comment but it's just it just shows people's level of thinking in saying that um if you send these celebrities or ask them to go out to these areas and fight they won't do it now I'm just thinking it's such a waste of a comment because even if they what is it what are you achieving by making that kind of comment what what do you achieve through saying that oh well they won't fight if they get asked to go out there no one would who would want to willingly put themselves in that situation to fight for a cause when the powers that be I'm not even willing to do the same thing like obviously if it was me I based on what I believe I would happily go and fight because I would much rather know that I am doing something to help better society and willing to die for the sake of bettering society but what's the cost of it what is what is the cost of my sacrifice if the people that are not involved in that conflict are not gonna change their outlook are not gonna change their opinions and this again it's coming from having grown up in a western society where as a Muslim life already is I don't wanna call it difficult but it's already so challenging because there's a stigma behind everything that you do the way you pray the way the way you dress the way you cover yourself the the what you recite the things that you do there's there's a stigma behind it albeit it it may not always be negative but people always think that it doesn't conform it's not it's not exactly right you know it's not exactly the ideals of what society deems now we as a society are now standing together and saying well the companies that are supporting this kind of agenda this kind of narrative we have as as a community and now have the opportunity as a international community have the opportunity to hold them accountable we have the opportunity now to actually make global changes because that is the power of social media that is the power of being connected through the internet uh over you know leaps and bounds across different countries and continents so when someone makes this kind of comment I'm just sitting here thinking you can clearly see you've you've never had to deal with struggle in your life and the only struggle that you know is either financial or to some to some extent it's maybe a spiritual or psychological struggle but you've never been in a position where every single one of your family members have fought or had to endure suffering for the sake of your life being better now all we asking is for you to have the same energy that you that these celebrities are having promote the same energy put make a list of the celebrities we should be supporting we should be advocating for we should be um pushing to hear their voices over others I mean I love this whole idea of the blackout or the other blackout um the trend I love it because we finally as a community acting to hold celebrities accountable and to hold people with influence accountable whether it ruins your livelihood or not is not my problem cause at the end of the day what you stand for in this life would deem what you stand for what you get repaid for in the afterlife based on what I believe so your celebrities like Justin Bieber um Hailey Bieber uh Kim Kardashian um Black Eyed Peas whatever all these all these artists that are not saying anything all these celebrities that are not saying anything why are they so quiet what is their agenda be about why why is it so difficult for them to actually say the things that need to be said and to stand why is why is it easy for Kehlani to sit there and say that the weekend um who are there so many others people I mean keep people have commented so many other names that I can't even mention cause I don't even I don't even firstly I maybe I'm ignorant I don't know their names but there are so many that are standing in the course of what is right and why are we sitting here saying oh but if they if they not sent there they won't fight or if if you ask them to go and fight they won't go what is the point I mean let's use our platforms for what it's intended for let's use the platform to spread awareness and to create them I mean the more we saturate the market with videos of support the more people have to listen to it so I don't understand why people have to make comments like that because it's counterproductive it's counterintuitive we we're here to change people's mindsets not to in not to get people to start conflict for no reason so you know peace to whoever but you know use your platform for what it meant for don't be stupid",

    "voice_to_text": "as we're going into an election cycle it's really important for us to understand how these things are sustained from one presidency into another presidency from one decade into another decade one generation into another generation and why voting in the presidential elections is simply not enough to ensure that the continued and ongoing support for Israel stops this is bigger than a single president while yes the president may be the most powerful person on the planet um they are inheriting a system that was created generations before they got there and understanding how those systems operate is critical to truly and effectively dismantling them so that we can never repeat this I'm using example here um and I really hope that it is not experienced or perceived as dismissive or flippant because I'm pulling from children's literature so think about the Harry Potter series also I feel like we should add JK Rowling to the block list um I might just do it for shits and giggles okay so the Harry Potter series right when Voldemort rises to power it was because of this already present historical sentiment and fear of the muggle world by the wizarding world right and it was a legitimate invalid fear right like I don't wanna dismiss the wizarding fear of the Muggles they were persecuted um and that LED the wizarding world to become extremely isolated and very insular which made it possible for these really extreme and damaging ideologies to faster and grow um strong enough and pervasive enough and insidious enough that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and had an entire plan of genocide against Muggles um and then Harry Potter does his whole heroes journey thing Hermione Granger is the real hero all along all the things happen right seven books later we get a glimpse into what the future is like and it hasn't actually changed there's this podcast I listen to I really recommend it um called witch please it's too um literature professors at a university in Canada and they go through the entire series like every single chapter and provide this really great analysis using all of this like super smart people stuff and literature theory and like things that like I don't necessarily like understand at that level um and one of the things that they talk about is that the underlying ideologies that created these systems like the Ministry of magic and the RS and the pedagogical approach in the Hogwarts system which is just horrifically abusive um and the prison system of Azkaban and like just like like what the fuck who where is the adult in charge of the wizarding world kind of thing you know what I mean that I think a lot of us like muggles at this moment in time can really relate to the ideologies that LED to the creation of those did not end when Harry defeated Voldemort and they continued as Harry and Hermione and Ron and Ginny and Luna and Neville became adults and then inherited those systems what they chose to do with those systems moving forward we don't really know you know like that's the world of fanfic um but the last glimpse that we got of them they were the same systems and that's the cycle that we are going to find ourselves caught in if we don't look at those underlying ideologies and the ways in which they have been institutionalized and legitimized through our legislation through our education system through our law enforcement system and our criminal justice system through our media and our literature and our religions and our neighborhoods and communities and businesses right like they are embedded in all of these things and so in order to really stand a chance at never again actually being never again one of the things we are going to have to really really grapple with is the how and why of every single decision that we make as Americans because from the moment of our inception as a country blood was on our hands this country is built on the genocide and destruction of Turtle Island it is built on the enslavement of African peoples and we continue to reap the benefits of those horrific crimes against entire civilizations until we grapple with those very foundations on which this country has been founded we will continue to fund and support and legitimize things like the Zionist project",

    "voice_to_text": "A massive congratulations to Nemo for winning Eurovision. The song and the performance, epic. So well deserved. But what they're singing here is dizzy by Ollie Alexander. And you can hear it. Such a good song. Because it is such a good song. When I first heard it, I thought, wow, this could be a winner. But as we know yesterday, it got zero points in the popular vote, which was not deserved. But I do believe it's because of the raunchness of that performance. I was watching with my mum and she was like, well, they're quite athletic, but what are they wearing? And you can't get away from that visual and really listen to the song. I think the sound was also a bit weird. Um, so I do feel bad for Ollie. Um, he's very talented. I love. I love his performances generally. So, yeah. Um, is Eurovision political? I think it's become political in. In the widest scheme of things, but my top 3 actually were top 4, so the better songs do win. Ukraine slipped in there. I think that's political. It's an okay song. Israel being number five, uh, after getting nearly all of the top points in the popular vote, to me, is shocking and surprising. The song was okay, it's very Lorraine, but not my favourite. Um, so I think that's political. And I'm not gonna go more into that, but, yeah. Free Palestine.",

They are scared of losing followers and their precious money. They had years to speak about it and decided to wait for block out. Rich do not care about us or Gaza. Block and cancel them."

No bueno!\u201d I think the worst one I've seen is from that HaleyBaylee person who I've never heard of until now when I - I'm learning she's like\u202610 million well, it\u2019s decreasing \ud83d\ude0f  I'm so sorry - she made like an \u201capology video\u201d if you wanna call it that she made a video just talking and in it she's like, \u201cI'm a normal person\u201d it's like mmkay\u2026 you're not. but I think the thing that stood out to me was her saying like, she wasn't educated on what's happening in Palestine what's - the, the current \ud83d\udca3 that's been happening since October 2023 she's like, \u201cI had no idea\u2026 don't blame me!\u201d it's like, we're on the same app. I cannot go one day without seeing at least 10 videos of if not just people speaking out about what is happening and the horrible way that the US government is going about it \ud83d\ude44 or like actual footage of people in Rafah like children crying because they can't find their family or people without limbs\ud83e\uddb5\ud83d\udcaa because they've been \ud83d\udca5 off how the \ud83e\udd2c  am I seeing it and you're not?!? what?!? anyway, Haley Bailey if that's your name (it\u2019s not lol whoops) that's a dumb name umm get your head out of your \ud83c\udf51  alright, bye guys \ud83d\ude03",

Firstly, you cannot say that you are not educated enough on a situation which is being reports done daily. And as a content creator, you're online 24 7, therefore you would have access to this information. Secondly, you do know what's going on because you said earlier in the video that you know that people are dying because of what's going on, but you're not explicitly saying what's going on. This is why people like Hailey Bailey, Sabrina Basum, true girl, Chris Olsen, they just annoy me because they're more just billboards for these people to elevate their platforms on and don't actually have their own opinions to say. And in a situation which involves a genocide and an ethnic cleansing of our whole country, you choose to stay mute, you choose to stay mutual, because you wanna keep all your deals, which we get. But people are not going to like that in this day and age. Fair advice. Maybe you should use your 10 million followers to influence and share news on what's going on in Palestine and why it's all completely wrong.

I've always felt like the need to discuss propaganda because we see it every day, you know, in our schools and our streets, on TV. My senior thesis in college was actually on the impact of Nazi propaganda being inserted into the German education system and the effects of that. Um, pretty interesting to see that the marks had gone down since the Nazi, um, infiltration of the German Republic. And also, classroom behavior was reported to be much worse under the Nazi regime. I feel like she's a politician for god knows how long, probably since the prehistoric age, but she should know that propaganda is not education. Like there is a difference here. Propaganda is not supposed to inform, it is supposed to make people feel. It's supposed to bring out the emotion. And what is being posted on TikTok is not necessarily harmful propaganda. It is propaganda in the fact that it is displaying the conditions of what is going on in Rafa and Gaza and how the people are dealing with this over there and how would they are suffering. Do not stop reposting those videos, please. Free Palestine!",

Just because I've been really scared to watch that kind of media and to enlighten myself about these things. So I am sorry for that. Please check out, past the hat, Operation Olive Branch. Uh, check out, uh, Aaron Hattermeyer. Hattermore. I don't know her name exactly, but please check her out. She has a lot of wonderful information, um, that you can learn more about. And I hope it serves you well. If you can donate, please donate. If you can't, just repost these things and, um, have a wonderful day.",

I don't know about that you're really informed about that you're really informed on how to take someone else's content and put it on your platform and influence because you have the following if you take an idea from someone else with your amount of followers your 10 million you just posted a video about your 10 million you can influence your way up the likes ladder the influencer ladder the status ladder and get the invite to the met or the met pre party or I don't care whatever but to come on here and ask for forgiveness plead for forgiveness look sad cry but not cry I'm tired we're all tired of the influencers the celebrities the personalities who want to feign ignorance I don't know what's going on I don't know what's happening I just wanted the Met Gala but I don't know what's happening in the world what did you say dispute, world affairs, crisis, you can't even call it what it is um you can't say \ud83c\udf49  you can't say \ud83c\udf49  you can't say gen0c!d3 you can't talk about uh and this figure probably isn't accurate and I googled it because I know how to research uh doesn't take rocket science to look at Google at least which is under reported at least 35,000 people at least and I know the percentage figure is from like February but in February it was 70% of that figure which obviously is not accurate anymore it's probably closer to eighty, women and children women and children k!ll3d, mord3red almost 80,000 inj ur3d okay while you were practicing your Marie Antoinette uh lip sync while the media's gaze was fixed on the Met Gala and celebrating the costumes and the 75,000 dollar seats Ra4a was being seized an area where they are receiving humanitarian aid humanitarian aid you have at this point b!d3n and Canada rethinking rethinking giving  which again is is the bare minimum less than the bare minimum but you you don't know what's going on let's be so for real you are chronically online like a lot of celebrities and a lot of influencers yada yada yada I would be shocked if your for you page did not at least have one or two videos the campus pr0. T3$+ it's all over the news it's everywhere you'd have to literally close your eyes and stick your fingers in your ears and scream to not know what's going on which I wouldn't put it past you but don't come on here and say celebrities need to sit down and let the more educated speak and the the part that I stitched just because I have a following just because I have a following because you and every other person on here which blows my mind will come on here and use your audience for everything everything you'll get on close I'm your friend we're besties here's the latest this here's the latest this click my link vote for me here follow me here you will use your audience for a lot you will influence your audience especially for things that you do not know about but god forbid god forbid you use your platform for even the bare minimum advertising for a family fundraising literally condemning what's happening I don't want your tears I don't want your your apology do better do better do better like do the do the bare minimum but this is pathetic actually pathetic over here reading your cue cards I'm I'm just a person okay and you could be doing something about it the bee better company probably said this more eloquently than I did but I genuinely hope genuinely hope that from now on you and everybody else that has stayed mum or worse has applauded what's happening gets blocked gets forgotten and gets left behind you should be absolutely ashamed because of this apology and your actions because that video is still up let them you you don't mind cashing in on that you don't mind celebrating your 10 million or whatever followers you're not sorry you're not sorry so I genuinely hope that you become nothing to anyone",

    "voice_to_text": "I would give anything for us to stop misquoting what happened to Kitty, because the thing is, people actually did call 9 1 1 for her the first time she was attacked. At least one father and son duo did call 9 1 1. And remember, this was in 19, like 64, before there was an actual 9 1 1 number. This was back when you had to call your local police precinct and identify yourself to the police. Right? So this father and son duo did call 9 1 1, and by the time they called, she had stopped being attacked. Her attacker moved and got away, so they reported it as if the attack was over and as if she was fine. Meanwhile, she had crawled away inside a building, and so police didn't really come out to check cause it sounded like the attack was over. And again we talked about the bystander effect is if there's a group of people all looking at each other and going, I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not gonna do anything. And the Kitty Jeannouise murder was a series of isolated people at 3:00am, who may or may not have been awake, may or may not have heard what was happening, and who just may not have been aware of what was happening and might not have known to call for help given what was going on. And I really don't think that we should be using the bystander effect. As kind of a reason to explain what is or is not happening. Like regarding response in Gaza, this is more of, like a collective action problem. It's more of a misinformation and disinformation problem. Like, people know what's happening, and people are acting. So, like, even now with Gaza, it's not that we're all standing around looking at each other. This is a problem that is due to poor coordination. It is a lack of communication laterally among ourselves. And it's an inability to coordinate upwards with the people who are actually responsible for fixing the problem. Just like it was with Kitty Cheney's, right? Like, 1964, there was no 9 1 1 to call. And even if you did call, it was really difficult for you to have all the facts, all the information, and to actually report to the police. Hey, this woman's being attacked. Oh, she crawled into a building. Oh, god, the guy came back! He's attacking her again. You don't have all the information to report. And even if you do, there's no guarantee that the people who you call are going to responsive. And you're certainly not going to your neighbors and calling your neighbors and getting them on board. Right? Like, we're all just individuals acting individually. That's the problem. That's why it's hard to get things done. It's because of the lack of lateral communication. It's the fact that we're not acting as a group, not that we are acting as A group and then choosing not to do anything"

I wanna say a couple things before I go on a huge rant in this video, because first off, I just woke up like an hour ago, so all this is not like, done or whatever. No flaming. Um, secondly, I have to do like an all in one take because, um, tik toks having this weird bug and it will cut out all the audio in like the second half or like if you make multiple parts of a video. So I'm just gonna do all one cause I want everyone to hear this. Um, never did ever cross my mind that I had to critique someone as true. But the reason why she's getting, you know, grilled online as of right now is because she went on this podcast. Mind you, she's pro Palestinian. You know, Spread Awareness, donated, the works. Um, but she gets on this podcast with Brittany Broski. And I already made a video talking about Brittany Broski and how hypocritical she is already, but it's just interesting to see drew go on this podcast with someone who literally did not give a flying fuck about talking about Palestine. Literally went on Instagram bitching about it. But all that aside, um, drew, especially in this one person's comments. Um, she stitched Drew's podcast video talking about how are you gonna be pro Palestinian, but get on a podcast with Miss Hypocrite herself. And so drew was in the comment section, which is like number one. Like, you probably shouldn't have, but she was in her comments basically talking about, like, her own achievements about what she is done from the pro Palestinian movement. But that's like, you know, besides the point. And another thing that I seen her comment was the fact that, like, she can't hold her like, white friends to these said consequences or what not, and how she's forgiven Britney Broski and educated her. But the problem is, is like, that's not your job. Like, she didn't do anything to you specifically. She did. She fucked up major with everyone in the process, the pro Palestinian movement. So why do you feel the need that like, just because you forgiven her, everyone else has to fucking forgive her? And you get to go on this podcast and be all fucking buddy buddy with someone who literally didn't care in the first place. So people obviously on the right side of the argument was talking about. People are grilling you because of the fact that you went on this podcast and gave Brittany Broski a platform. You, as a pro Palestinian content creator, gave Brittany Broski, person who literally could have just went through her day and not even said anything about it. You gave her a platform in which you uplift her and see her as this like, oh, Yeah, she's good now, but again, like, at the end of the day, she would have literally never said anything if people didn't press her for it. And that's just. That's just bullshit. Um, it's for Drew's. As herself and her personality and how she comes up really strong and confrontational about people that she doesn't like. It's. It's weird that you don't have the same energy for someone, like, pretty risky. It's. It's disappointing, to say the least.",

Um, and it wasn't it a fundraiser for genocide Joe? And then when she didn't like what people were saying, she was like, I'm quitting. And, like, now she's back, and she sees that Kim K. Lost 3 million followers. Now it's Operation Olive Branch. And, yes, I'm excited because she has, like, 26 million followers, and it's like, that's the reach we need. It also showcases our power, because celebrities are nothing, absolutely nothing without us. But, like, she was already getting on my damn nerves. So I feel like, thank you, Elizabeth Lizzo, um, for finally, I guess, making a video that we actually wanna see, but also, at the same time, too little, too late, bitch. Anywhere at Met Gala.

That is a good thing that we, as of people, can say, this is bad and actually we don't want it to happen.

    "voice_to_text": "A major new poll released by Axio shows that college students don't really care about the protests that are ongoing on campuses. A survey over 12 college students show that the conflict in the Middle East was only cared about by 13% of those survey. These numbers aren't really surprising at all. This movement is a mess. Part of what is causing the problem is this movement is surprisingly ineffective at using social media. Instead of using it to raise sympathy for their cause, it's mainly being used to give the movement itself a false impression of how popular this movement is, and then to bully people who question the movement itself. This kind of echo chamber. You can maintain the belief that it's everyone else that's failing, when really it's the movement itself that's failing on every level. But rather than dwell on the failures, let's talk about solutions. The goal of any movement like this is to raise awareness and sympathy for your cause and to turn that sympathy into action. Problem with taking direct actions like encampments, destroying property, disrupting civic life, and then making hostage like demands to get you to stop, is you push more people away than you pull in. Actions themselves create fear and anger, which are both antithetical to sympathy and can inadvertently create sympathy for the opposing cause. There's another approach called a dilemma action, which is an indirect, non aggressive form of protest where the goal is to provoke a dilemma. For the opposition, where they look absurd no matter how they respond. For example, in 1982, in response to Soviet propaganda, Polish citizens started taking their televisions for walks, and wheelbarrows and strollers during the Soviet news hours. This created a situation where the government would have to arrest people for walking their television, which would then be covered in the news itself, creating the dilemma. Not only would it look absurd, but they'd have to explain why people were walking their televisions, exposing their own propaganda and spreading the message of the protesters. For them, cause of that dilemma, the government didn't do anything, which conceded ground to the Polish resistance movement, enabling them to broaden support for resisting the Soviet system. George Washington University recently used this technique against the protesters, when they hung a huge American flag in the backdrop of the protests. And the contrast put the protesters in a really negative way, while maintaining the integrity of the university. As standing up for the rights of all. Which increase their support to resist the protesters. The reason this work is because of your movement is only focus on what you're going to do and how you can express your English to your audience. It becomes self absorbed. I think we're seeing a lot of that, which is why they become blind. How antisocial this movement has become. But if you're thinking in terms of a dilemma action, you're thinking of your social movement as a Social interaction between you, your opposition, and most importantly, the rest of society. Society is the audience. They are the people you're trying to convince. They are the ones holding the sympathy that you need. But here's the question. How do you do that? What does a dilemma action look like for this movement? Let's hear some suggestions in the comments.",

I will not be looking at anything to do with it for obvious reason. And I do agree that any artists that are involved in Eurovision right now should be boycotting it as well, but that's not gonna happen. So hear me out. At least an artist that is going on here is using their platform, is using these conferences to go. This right here, this is bull. This isn't fair. They have asked me to change this. I think the fact that someone is going on that platform that will be seen by so many people and hopefully influence whether or not they're gonna be viewing Eurovision, it's very much a double edged sword.

Xana I I apologize if that's not how you pronounce your name they have an entire \ud83d\udd17 they have like an entire thing in their bio dedicated to helping people back in Gaza so please support. I'm probably going to have my account removed for this but honestly this is more important than any following the people need your help we have been saying for days now all eyes on Rafah, this is the moment that we have been warning about because power supplies has been cut off sooner; \ud83d\udca3ing has been more apparent than ever; aid has been significantly reduced already for this moment they are saying that they have people ready to protect these people that is not true do not believe anything state media is telling you especially when they're on the side of the oppressor Or the colonizers cause I find that colonizers will always support their own and the colonised will support their own so listen to the people of \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 their stories their links support them any way you can because this is the moment that we have been dreading and that moment is sadly here we had, I imagine, we all had a feeling it will come eventually just didn\u2019t know when \u2014 that moment is now so please, help any way you can. All eyes on Rafah go back and watch their video cause they are talking about their friend and their family that is evacuated I know the money on these donations seems like a lot but that is because other governments in other countries are trying to profit off of the suffering of innocent people and these people need out so they're paying it because they have no other choice it's either pay extortionate amount of money and get to safety or be stuck so they\u2019re finding help anyway they can and that comes from people like us.  Cause unfortunately our governments aren't going to do anything so we the people have to keep protesting; keep boycotting; anything that will hit is not real to support the victims of the \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 um but yeah just support the people anyway you can please",

Um, so we already know that the American taxpayers money is going um, funding the ammunition bombs in Gaza. Um, and of all the things that I have kept Palestinians in my heart, of all of the pain they're experiencing, a specific type of pain that I never considered. Because honestly, it's just, it's still kind of unfathomable to me that such a scenario even exist in real life. It's extremely dystopian. Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine.

You know in countries that Westerners look at as Muslim there are Christians there too and  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 just means \"God is great\" or \"Praised is God\" or \"Blessed is God\"  (depending on context/ dialect/ scripture or even Aramaic phrases included in Arabic dialects) It depends on whether someone is saying that to praise God in the context of Islam or to praise God in the context of Christianity you will never know unless you know that person specifically and it is racist to assume someone who looks Arab saying \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 is automatically a Muslim that could be arguably an anti-Semitic view considering Arabs are Abrahamic descendants of Ishmael now for Christians across the United States I want you to know we in the messianic community stand with you besides rallying for jury nullification in jury trials and appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court if they try to bring people up on charges for it; while citing the First Amendment believing in the New Testament and believing Yeshua Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected from the dead is a branch of Judaism I would go all the way up to the international levels to advocate for any person who claims they are a Jewish convert even Palestinians who have trouble immigrating to Israel over any suspected Christian prejudice this branch of Judaism is speaking of is Messianic Judaism hello I'm a Messianic Jew I consider myself the same as a gospel believing Christian because I believe in the unmerited Grace that Yeshua Jesus gave us in accordance with Ephesians 2:8 in fact Christian and Messianic both have the same meaning and word root Christian means to Christen as with oil Messianic comes from the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 which means to annoint as with oil this word is one in the same our history as messianic Jews was firmly established almost 2,000 years ago in foundation during the time that the authors of the New Testament were alive fifty one days after our Messiah died on the day of the Passover sacrifice (John 19:14) people from every nation under the heaven were present in Jerusalem (Acts 2, 51 days after Yeshia died) to receive the Spirit of God that is the spirit of the Messiah who came and died for our sins on the day of Pentecost which is the Jewish festival of Shavuot by which converts and physical Jews became a part of the messianic faith and this receiving on the Spirit accordance with Acts 2:5 and Acts 2:11 I'm a messianic Jew who does not support the integration of heavy rabbinics into the doctrine of faith and encourage those who call themselves messianics or Christians to read the book of Galatians and also Matthew 23 and Jeremiah 23 to see what I'm talking about At a leadership level we are responsible to examine those doctrines and see if they are relevant to scripture but if they are not relevant with scripture and confuses the context of scripture in accordance with the Jewish Tenach (Torah, Prophets, Writings) and Jeremiah 8:8 and Jeremiah chapter 23 they are not from God and we do not count them now regardless of race or one status with conversion in an Orthodox synagogue or how they define a Jew race and ethnic status does not matter to us although we do not replace the nation of Israel I will make that clear this is not replacement theology and we do NOT embrace that we do not embrace that as someone who literally lives at the furthest reaches from Jerusalem in the world, literally the ends of the earth I believe even if someone lives so far away from Jerusalem or ethnically different than a Jew or Middle Easterner if they accept Yeshua as the Messiah they too are taking it to our faith and are given the same spiritual blessing of being delivered out from sin and from the confinements of sin of this earth the same way that Jews were taken out from the confinements in the land of Egypt we are Messianic we as messianic Jews keep the appointed times of Leviticus 23 practice physical circumcision and the dietary laws however we know that even as Moses received The 10 commandments on Mount Sinai it is also said in the same instance in Hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 -He makes unmerited Grace- Exodus chapter 20:6 \"He makes unmerited Grace to those who love him and keep his commandments\" Deuteronomy 6:4 - 8 tells us to love God with everything that we are John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God our commandment is to love and keep the word of God all 66 books as Messianic Jews Christians are grafted in and we are one in the same (Galatians 3:29) we came into the faith the same way the Christians did (Ethnic Jews who embrace the gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) - such as myself) as sojourners lost and the noble memorial of the price Yeshua (Jesus) paid for our sins delivered us out equally we are all strangers no one is better than the other because of his ethnicity. In the 37 chapter of Ezekiel, one of the infamous prophets of old Ezekiel, was taken out to a valley of dry bones by the hand of God and told to preach to an impossible situation and tell the dry bones that God's Spirit will come into them and they will live Ezekiel 37:4 - 6 so the dry bones became his flesh that is the nation of Israel coming together in 1948 but there was no breath in the bones (Ezekiel 37:8) so Ezekiel prophesied regarding the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) as he was commanded by God to say to the Spirit of god (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) come from the four winds (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) [Holy] Spirit and breathe upon the slain so that they may live (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) in the same chapter (Ezekiel 37) so let us speak the word of God and let us all come and look to the one that was pierced (Zechariah 12:10) for the transgressions of all mankind  that was set before us by the One who created us God knew man would make mistakes and that our greatest defeat is our own sin and it was necessary for Yeshua the Messiah to die we all pierced him as humanity (because our own sin is our greatest defeat) and anyone that believes in Him will not perish (John 3:16) but have everlasting life (John 3:16) John 3:16. We eulogize the price that was paid for our own sin as one eulogizes upon a firstborn upon an only child Zachariah 12:10 (and John 19:34 - 37) we remember our going out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05df \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of confinements of this earth and its wickedness on our own (by our own choice) just as the children of Israel were delivered out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of Egypt all the days of our life as it's written in Deuteronomy 16:3 in Hebrew let us rise up from this valley of dry bones as spoken by the prophets of old in the Spirit of god and in salvation as one every time someone comes to the Lord he rises up in a vastly and joins a powerful army that will not be defeated and more and more people will rise out of this valley of dry bones unto the coming of the Messiah himself.

    "voice_to_text": "And because like.. What if you're just minding your own business and then like.. the members of enhypen just walk in ? Euhhhhh I thought about this..before. I think.. Ummm..I genuinely don't know. I feel like I would be.. Knowing myself I'd probably be like.. Like.. in shock ! Cause I'm not a lucky person dude ! Things like this will never happen to me. And no, that\u2019s not just what I like, I'm just.. (I\u2019m not sure what I said here, but this is what I heard, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense \ud83d\ude2d) I- Let's just say.. I think I'm very unlucky.. to the point where I say I'm cursed. Let's just say that. Okay..so if that were to happen to me\u2026 It will be like God telling me\u2026(aish - meaning: Ah shit) it would be like.. Dude just..ahem, I don\u2019t wanna say it out loud. But..like I would..I really\u2026 Okay, I went through the comments under that..video, that I'm stitching right now. Anddd, it sounds like no one would really approach them, out of respect. Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay."

You have to watch this. Just watch. Uh, hi there. Um, I'm trying to report, um, my kid is not able to get into the library. They are, um, bombarding him and not allowing him to get into the library, citing the need for some wristbands. Did you see a late issue wristbands to people? I don't have any information on that if they did. Okay, so what. What should he do? Because he can't enter the library, he can't enter his classes. So whoever he's speaking to right there, that saying that they need responses, he not able to ask them any information. They said. They said because he's Jewish, he cannot enter that area and that they won't issue him a visit. That wasn't. That wasn't a university thing. That's probably the protesters that are out there. Right. So are the protesters allowed to not allow a student who pays tuition access to their class in the library? Uh, no, they're not allowed, but unfortunately, they have kind of taken over that little area right there. Um, but is there any other entrance that your son can enter through? No, they are barricading every area for him to get into. And, you know, with all due respect, why is that even tolerated? Like, why should a Jewish kid Have to go to another entrance. I don't know if I'm gonna say it's tolerated, but unfortunately the police are not intervening with that right now. You can go and watch the rest of that video. I will tag the creator of the video, but I am flabbergasted that this is even happening in 2,024. It's very clear to me that this administration in these schools and these far left crazy psychopaths. Psychopaths aren't gonna do anything about this. In fact, they encourage this. What is it going to take to put an end to it? How does the majority who doesn't tolerate this putting into it",

I hate. Like, you understand that to be pro Palestine is not necessarily to be pro Hamas. And that's not even me saying, okay, I'm condemning Hamas, because you always have to look at the why for any situation. Why did Hamas do what it like? Why is it doing what it's doing? Why ask yourself that? And if you can't figure out a reason, that means that you're either in denial or you just completely ignorant, and therefore you shouldn't be speaking on nothing. Just saying, this is what's going on on my campus right now in California. UCLA, quote, unquote, number one public university. Are you serious? Really? UCLA? Really?",
