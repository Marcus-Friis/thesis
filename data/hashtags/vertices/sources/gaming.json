Elden Ring does, in fact, have a narrative, and it doesn't matter how you wanted to find it. Plot, premise, story, character, arts, whatever. Elden Ring Scott and there are people in the comment sections who are like oh, but you need lower videos to understand it. And they don't realize how that statement is contradictory. Because in order for those lure videos to exist, that must mean that Elvin Ring must have a competent enough narrative that can be followed if you just explore and read item descriptions, basically. Elvin Ring does, in fact, have a narrative. You just have to be willing to engage with it.",

So I have a couple of questions at the end, but don't worry, it's not gonna be like, oh, was it really that bad? No, I believe you. Because, um, I've been hearing every single year that these big name conventions are fucking ridiculously bad. Personally, I think it's because we live in an age now where parasocial relationships are so prevalent, and I think COVID had something to do with it. I, I am, I'm not particularly sure because I've only been to two cons, and I'm doing, um, another one, um, next month. Um, but I do believe that the reason that connect again is just gone out the window completely is because parasocial relationships is. Is one of them, and people just don't seem to give a fuck anymore. That's what I've seen. I mean, again, I've only been to two cons and they've been kind of small. Um, but I, I think it's just people just don't give a fuck anymore and they just want to get their own selfishness out there. And I feel like some people kind of thrive on a power dynamic as well. Um, it's just my, um, thoughts, but that's just the way I see it. I haven't experienced anything of what you've experienced, but I've, and what others have experienced. But I do feel for those that have went through shit like that. So this is where the questions come in. This one's for you. How, uh, what was your most positive experience at a con? Because it just seems like there's a lot of negative press when it comes around cons over the last few years, and I kinda want people to be a bit more positive about their experiences. So what was your, um, most positive experience, uh, at a con? And the second question is, and this is to everyone that sees this video. Um, what things about connect, again, can you tell me, as someone who's only been a two cons, what about it again, can you tell me, what. Can you advise me on? Um, just shit like that, you know what I mean? Um, and what experiences have. Of other people had like that? Yeah. Just to put it out there, what experiences have you had at these cons? Um, you can tag us in the video, you can, uh, put a comment down, whatever. Um, I just wanna know people's experiences because it seems like cons are getting more negative press and more negative experiences are coming out of them. Um, it.

    "voice_to_text": "It's got a fantastic community. One of the greatest examples that you may have seen recently on short form content was Heaven Studio, which was a custom Rhythm Heaven level maker. Okay, never mind. Nintendo shut it down four days ago. Okay, I guess I should talk about this if you're a fan like me of Rhythm Heaven levels. Heaven Studio is the open source, community LED program that is pushing the charge in the Rhythm Heaven community by creating a custom level maker that is built from the ground up. And I think to hear that Nintendo would put a takedown notice on this project is not very surprising. However, in Heaven Studios, they do believe this to be a false takedown. As in, basically a takedown troll is what we're assuming this is. But I'm not gonna tell you, the viewer, one way or another, what it is because I don't know. What I can do is at least read the information that Heaven Studio has shared on their Twitter our itch dot Io page. I suffered a copyright takedown. However, we have reason to believe that this is a copyright abuser and are working to slowly remedy the situation. And then since this tweet later this week, they posted that they have officially submitted an appeal. they go into a couple reasons why they're skeptical of the takedown. The only two cents I'll add to this is that Rhythm Heaven is not for sale on Any Nintendo platform right now. Not even as like a Switch Online or anything like that. Now listen, I completely understand the fan game rhetoric with especially Nintendo properties because Nintendo strikes down a lot of content. Honestly, the only way I feel Nintendo would care about Heaven Studio is if they're planning a rerelease or a new Rhythm Heaven game entirely. Which is a very sticky situation because as a Rhythm Heaven fan, I think any Rhythm Heaven fan would love to see a new game. You also would hate to see Nintendo just completely slip the rug under the community to do so? I feel like when it comes to Nintendo or the community, I would choose to side with the community. It is what it is. While the download is missing from H dot I O, you can still download Heaven Studio from the Get Hub page. I recommend downloading the nightly Bill to get the latest updates. And I'm still really looking forward to the honeydew release of Heaven Studio, which is gonna combine all the latest updates. Yeah, honestly I really didn't care about this. Nothing. But I felt it was necessary to kind of set the record a little bit straight. But what are your thoughts on the situation? Let me know in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "These games don't have narratives. They do. They're just not narratives that you can have your mind about. They have not. They know the fact that you. Woo! Nerd fight! Let's go! So did y'all read that? So a narrative is something that is narrated. The way that this person is describing narrative seems to be they want just the story to have a particular arc, objective, etc. No matter what way you look at it, the game's god narrative, the story is very clearly a descendant of Queen America. A tarnished. A nameless tarnished of no renowned, uh, spermed by the Grace of gold, returns to the lands between to claim the Elden ring, because that's your birthright as a tarnished. You were banished from the Elden, the lands between. Whenever Queen America fucking did all that shit. Um, and then you die and are returned. It's Fucking Valhalla, basically. And you then enter into a world that has been plunged into war. A five way war, I think, for maybe more ways, for centuries. Right. And there's all these. And all the demigods have had their own tails, which have LED them to this stalemate that they're a part of. You then become the thread that unravels this fabric of war by one by one, uh, claiming power, claiming shards of the Elden ring, and, uh, ending the war on your terms, becoming the Elden Lord. Right. Um, you do this via making friends, but also, um, exploring Finding relics of power. Um, and eventually your blacksmith friend forges you a weapon that can kill a god, which is what you've been going toward this entire time. Because to become l Lord, you have to burn the urge tree and kill the god inside. Um, and I mean, that's just surface level. Like, that's not even any extra lore about the lands between, how the lands between came. Came about. You could get all of that just from doing main boss fights and not reading items. So I don't even understand your point that, like, there's not a narrative. The narrative is you, as the main character, come in and finish this war that you did not start. Um, because you have the ability to do so by fucking ghost lady who gives you torrent, giving you the power to convert runes into strength. Like, all of these are very clear plot points along the way that form this narrative for you to become elven Lord. So, like, what's your. What's your point? Like, what is your point, really?"

    "voice_to_text": "so I recently discovered that I guess there are two different ways to play the Sims the first way is the way she's playing it in this video I'm stitching and the second way is the way that he wants to play it in this video I saw a different video the other day where a guy was talking about how some Sims player somewhere won the in-game lottery the odds of winning that are supposed to be somewhat realistic to winning it in real life in that video he was saying that it takes the fun away from the game because there's no incentive to go to work or do anything but the way that my wife and I play it is the way that this second guy wants to play it in the video I'm stitching where you want to cause as much chaos and mayhem as possible and be an evil god so are there really that many people out there who just try to be realistic? and model their real life in the Sims? cause I thought most people play it the way that my wife and I play it where you just wanna be an evil god",

Yasuke uh if you don't know or have very limited knowledge on him I want you to put aside any sort of preconceived notions you have right now and hear me out Yasuke was a mercenary from East Africa some would say either Mozambique or Sudan who was in the employ of jesuit missionaries when he first arrived in Japan after being in Japan he was made a samurai he was in Oda Nobunaga's court all this sort of thing a lot of the debate surrounding him is surrounding the fact that people think he wasn't the samurai for some reason which I couldn't understand why the man literally he wore armor marched into battle used you know a sword and a spear and all this shit he was afforded all of the luxuries and benefits of being a member of the samurai class despite the fact that he was a foreigner if that doesn't make him or samurai I don't know what will okay the bulk of the conversation has been focused on him when in fact it should be focused on the other protagonist and I find it very strange that all of the people complaining about historical accuracy and what not seem to leave Naoe out of the conversation when in fact she's technically more historically inaccurate than Yasuke is primarily because the fact that Yasuke is a real fucking person okay but Naoe is a little different now you saw from the last image I used and from this image right here that you know now is wearing this blue outfit with the hood and that's all well and good Shinobi wore blue in order to blend in with the night sky when they were on rooftops you know and they were very you know good at camouflage and disguise in that sort of thing but assassins clad and black running around murdering people calling themselves Shinobi is just not an accurate depiction of what actual Shinobi were like alright and Naoe is not a very accurate Shinobi one because she's a woman now I don't mean to sound sexist okay but Kunoichi female ninjas were very rare you'd think that they were common based on how common they seem to be we seen a lot of fictional depictions of them characters like uh the girls from dead are Alive or Yuffie Kisaragi  in Final Fantasy 7 but Kunoichi were not as common as you think now real Kunoichi like most Shinobi were experts at gathering intelligence right but Kunoichi right were also experts at infiltration by method of disguise because Kunoichi were women they would often disguise themselves as let's say sex workers or as travelling shrine maidens and priestesses that sort of thing in order to get wherever they need to be and not stand out because that is a central tenet of what ninjas did was not standing out so that they could collect as much enemy intelligence as they could and though kudoishi were real we do know that they existed they were not very common because of that they've been very heavily mythologized as all ninjas have but Kunoichi more so a lot of the people have been running around crying about historical accuracy and what not only do it when it pertains to Yasuke because Yasuke is black these people see a Japanese woman running around doing things that ninjas don't do and they don't see a problem with it because Naoe is Japanese Yasuke however is a black man who is a real person by the way and is a real samurai and they have to go ape shit it's a very unfortunate that I don't feel as though I should have to say this but don't listen to people raging on the internet don't listen to people who have accounts that were created like less than a week ago saying well I'm Japanese and I don't like Yasuke don't believe most of the hype you see about this a lot of people are making a very big deal about this game and it's probably gonna be super mediocre I don't know it's a Fucking Ubisoft game in 2,024 I don't have high expectations you know for it but despite that there really shouldn't be this big of a controversy but because it is a western game made by Westerners starring a black person it's gotta be a fucking discussion",

Holy shit. Secondly, to say that there's no way a from software game could could make somebody cry. I just want you to. I just want you to. Google. 15 seconds on Google. Type in dark souls lore video. You think body isn't gonna show up? Good thing one of the most popular from software creators doesn't have, I don't know, an entire series about how emotionally attached and how heartbreaking the Dark Souls series is. Just. I hate that on the internet these days, you could just have any, any person walk onto a podcast and talk about something like they're an authority on it when they can't even bring themselves to do 15 seconds of research. I'm not saying this dude has to like Elden Ring or the from soft games. He doesn't. But you know, don't come on here and be like, oh, but here's why they suck.

Secondly, you choose whether you wanna be a pirate marine, or you just wanna explore the world and do whatever the fuck you want. But the big twist is when you're out there, you can obviously choose to eat a devil fruit if you find one, or just continue as you are. But if you do eat that devil fruit, you're stuck. Whatever power you get completely changes your character, customises your build. It'd be really interesting, um, you know, and nobody would know what the devil fruits were. They wouldn't be labelled or anything. You just have to take a chance. Obviously, the goal of the end game. Find the one piece."

    "voice_to_text": "I wanna address this specific point he made in this video because I think it's a really good point that a lot of people are glossing over and they shouldn't be because being a samurai is literally the exact opposite of being an assassin I've been watching nuance evaporate from the Assassin's Creed series for well over a decade now and I don't think they're gonna explore this theme in any serious way in Assassin's Creed Shadows but you know what game will that's right baby ghost of Tsushima the dichotomy of being a samurai while being an assassin is a main theme of this video game it's talked about it's explored it plays a significant part in the story and by the end it winds up having significant consequences for Jin Sakai and everyone around him not only that but the game alters the weather system based on whether you decide to play more like a samurai or like an assassin so if you play like a samurai the game tends to be more sunny and bright but if you play like an assassin it's always cloudy and raining and thundering the fact that it goes so far to explore this theme is one of the things that makes this video game so great because both playstyles are equally enjoyable and you can decide to do each one but there is kind of a consequence for being more of an assassin than a samurai that's the whole point and it pains me to say that I don't think Ubisoft is gonna delve into this issue in any serious way they're just gonna gloss it over like they gloss a lot of stuff over in these games and they're gonna hope that the simple delivery of an Assassin's Creed game in this particular time period in this particular place will be enough to carry it over the finish line so I would say instead of waiting until November 15th to buy the mediocre Assassin's Creed game that we all know shadows is going to be that you go out and you buy ghost of Tsushima now because it's out on PS five and on PS four and on PC and I can guarantee you it's gonna be a better game and it's gonna be made with more love than Ubisoft has made any game since Assassin's Creed 2"

    "voice_to_text": "Think desperately needs a sequel, but for some reason we'll never get Persona 3. Hear me out. And spoiler warnings if you've never played Persona 3. Persona 4 and 5 both got sequels. Persona 4 sequel comes in Persona 4 Arena and Persona 5 sequel comes in Persona 5 Strikers and Persona 5 Tactica. Persona 3, on the other hand, never got a sequel and all we got was a little snippet of what could be because of Persona 4 Arena. Again, here comes the spoilers if you not play Persona 3. Well, I would suggest clicking off the end of Persona 3. The main character dies, but doesn't die. He sacrifices his soul to be able to seal away Nick's to prevent the end of the world. And without his soul, without his spirit, his body dies. The answer is basically the other characters in the party coming to terms with the fact that they cannot save him, that he is destined to become the seal for Nicks, because if they bring him out of that, then Nicks will come back in persona for Arena. Specifically Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Elizabeth is one of the main characters in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and she's on a journey to be able to save the main character from his fate. Because due to the events of Persona 3, specifically Persona 3 F E S. And Persona 3 Reload, Elizabeth was able to become in touch with humanity and become to show Affection towards the main character and because of that she wants to save him. She had joined the events of Persona 4 Arena Ultimates in hopes of being able to do just that, but was not able to, so she continues to search for her answer to be able to save him. Thus were left with an open plot hole that is not finished. Give me a Persona 3 sequel."

    "voice_to_text": "I've waited to see what the, how the MUD, how far the discourse was gonna get for Assassin's Creed Shadow before giving my opinion. I'm in the middle. I really am in the middle because I've heard both sides of the argument, and I'm gonna give off my initial impressions. I heard the leaks way before they ever dropped the trailer. But even when I heard the leaks, I was like, is it gonna be us again or is it gonna be another character? Are they gonna make a new character? Like, that was my initial, like, mindset. But freaking it was the idea that, um. I didn't know it was gonna be Yasuki. The fact that it is Yasuki, I actually don't mind it. And I think the way, based off he looks in that trailer, he looks dope. And it's a good idea to actually separate the two systems, similar to how syndicate at it. We get the warrior fantasy, which you're gonna get with Yasuke as samurai. We get that, gonna get the ninja fantasy with. I'm gonna butcher her name again. Nawi. Nawi, Nawi. You're gonna get the Shinobi fantasy with her. However, there's the problem a little bit, because if it was anybody else writing the story, if it was rocksteady writing the story, Sucker Punch Rocky while I'm writing the story, even Rockstar writing the story, I would have loved it. Cause I. I have a feeling they won't ruin the characters. I think They'll make them great. If Assassin's Creed Shadow would have come out in any other air age, people would be loving this game. They would have been so hyped to be playing as a Black Samurai. Cause, and yes, I know people are saying oh well, he maybe wasn't really a samurai. He was given the name of retainer. And samurai didn't just mean fighting. Samurai means servant. I hope you most of you know, and I love samurai culture, but not everybody who got was given the sword and all that stuff. Got to be a samurai in combat and all that stuff. And also so long as Yasuki doesn't let anybody live that he kills while he's playing. Also, it's fiction, doesn't really matter. But you know, as long as he doesn't have any kill, you know, there's no saying that he technically couldn't have killed these people, but regardless of the point, that's not the problem. The problem is it's Ubisoft. That's the problem people are having with it. They're saying it's Ubisoft, we don't trust this.

    "voice_to_text": "I watched the YouTube video and when these statements were made, I got annoyed.  Because first of all, all of this is fake. It's a story.  It might be based in history, but it's made up. Now, the other thing that bothered me,  is he's saying like, \"There's no real situation where a woman  can beat up three guys in an alley.\" Except maybe, if that woman is trained  to deal with multiple combatants like, I don't know, an Assassin. Especially if those multiple combatants are historically, if the other games are to go off of, not going to be that well trained. Strength does not matter if you can't apply it in a meaningful way. And if you're not trained, you're not gonna be able to apply strength in a meaningful way. Thirdly, these are games where we fight literal gods and look for magic items from the garden of Eden. I don't understand why suddenly people are asking for realism. Also, If you put a man in a 3 on 1 fight, even he's gonna have trouble. Gender has nothing to do with it. like It has more to do with the fact that  three guys are ganging up on one person. Anyone's gonna have trouble with that. Except maybe, I don't know, if they're trained to deal with it. Now, You might say, \"That's what I meant. Anybody would have trouble.\" No, that's not what you meant. Because if that's what you meant, You wouldn't have spent the next few minutes of your video talking about how biology means that men are stronger than women. \"It's biologically a fact.\" You meant that only women would have this trouble, because that's the direction you took with it. I don't know where the sexism came from, maybe it's just rage bait. Maybe you're just trying to farm. Because I know you like to farm. But come on, man. You know that this is kind of disingenuous.",

I always thought he's the homeless version of Penguin Zero. Like genuinely I don't understand how this guy gotten popular in the first place. Is it just me? I just don't fucking get it. This man, no joke said the idea of a black samurai is the same as a female assassin. It's stupid. Does this guy know about Konoichi's existing in the 16th century? That this game is based upon their real life female assassins in Japan? Like does the guy think that Konuigi is just a term came from Naruto? That just mean concern how he thinks other series like Naruto. But anyways, his reason why it's stupid in his eyes because he can never picture a woman taking on three minute once. Even though in the trailer has shown you that the woman in question that he's talking about couldn't take on three minute once. With brute force. Hence why she is an assassin. She takes them out still fully. And even then it's fucking fiction. Who the fuck cares? So focusing on the war on the real issues when it comes to Assassin's Creed Shadow game. You know, ridiculous pricing when it comes to deluxe editions and hiding certain missions behind a paywall. The real issues that the main character is black and the other characters are female assassin even though there are characters based off of real life. Fucking people. Anyone who's complaining about the main leads right now, you guys are losers. Okay, you. I'm sorry, but you guys are fucking losers.",

That's how these people act. There's just no realism, man. There's no realism anymore, bro. A woman could never take down three armed men. What are you talking about? That could never work. Like, what? What? And then my favorite line ever that they always say is, bro, I'm just trying to have an escape from reality. Having black people and women makes you escape from reality? You don't wanna see them no more? That's too much for you? I'm sick of seeing these people in real life, man. I need an escape. Why are they here? That's how y'all sound. You know how crazy that is?",

Like, and all honestly, the only reason why this bullshit is a controversy is just cause fucking Yasuke is black. Like everyone, everyone knows, everyone's doing the whole while hmm. I feels a white guy or people are complaining and it's just. It's stupid. It's stupid in all honesty. Like, they sit here and say all Assassin's Creed is about historical accuracies. That shit hasn't fucking been about historical accuracies. Like you play as like fucking Viking and you interact with Odin and shit. You're telling me this is about historical accuracy? Like, in all honesty, the only reason why it's a problem is cause fucking Yasuke is black. Dude worked under the great unifier of Japan, so it's not like he wasn't a real person. And on top of that, you know what I mean? It doesn't. It doesn't matter. It's a fucking Assassin's Creed game. People have been shitting on Assassin's Creed games for fucking god knows since when. Since the fucking series itself has gone down. Downhill? This has nothing to do with what I think the game is gonna. You know, how it's gonna do in sales. Cause people are gonna fucking complain. Especially the shitty keyboard warriors on fucking Twitter. But like damn, it's just cause the dude's black. Like if it was a white guy, everyone, no one would fucking bat an eye in All honesty, like. But you have the people sitting here trying to downplay his role in history. You have people trying to just be racist and then they use the whole, oh, well, um, black people, they call it, they. They call it, um, a cultural appropriation as soon as that someone wraps or has braided hair. But when, when they're inserted into any type of other culture, it's, it's, it's not. It's okay. Like, you have the dudes fucking saying shit like that when they know damn well most black culture is fucking consumed practically everywhere and that really only people with fucking Twitter fingers give that much of a shit about someone having crappy ass braids. I guess just stupid people need to fucking do better and not cry over this bullshit cause it's just a black person in fucking video game. Get the fuck over it. We exist. We've always existed. Fucking Africans have been in Japan. It's been documented. There's all fucking. People are everywhere. People spread everywhere like it doesn't fucking matter.",

Do you have any idea how much money I've saved by gaming? Now, I'm gonna show you my hours played on the new FIFA. Yeah, 352 hours. Now, some of you might call me unique, but hear me out. Let's say every time you go out with the boys, yeah, you spend around 15, 20 pound minimum in this economy. You go restaurant, you might go Sheesh, Lounge to do whatever you man doing it. Now, let's say you multiply the amount you'd spend versus the amount of hours I've spent on this game. That total to \u00a37,040. Now, you can call gaming childish all you want, yeah, but I've managed to save seven grand alone from playing FIFA. Just FIFA this year. I'm not even accounting for any other games that I played. So when you think about, in an economy where people are already struggling for money, having a console, staying home and just playing games is literally saving you money. So I will never understand the approach. Oh, if you're over 25, you need to stop gaming. The bro. Dumbest thing I've ever heard."

You should make your own, uh, that's completely separate from anything we've seen before. Your own color, your own weapon, your own sword that can customize over time. Maybe some big bad is taking over the world, and all the Power Rangers that we know from all the TV shows have been defeated or captured. And it's up to the players, the new Rangers, to, you know, unite, do missions together, and stop this alien threat. No.2, a Marvel versus DC fighting game. Need I say more?

And you decide to do that on a social media app, TikTok, which a lot of people claim are for children. When are you gonna grow out of that? Gamers traverse space and time. They wage wars, fight battles, create and write their own stories. You like to play golf? Grown ass men playing with balls. But I'm not here to criticize. Video games are a multi billion dollar industry, just like the sports men like to play or watch. Instead of being condescending to gamers across the world, why not stick to your cat videos?",

    "voice_to_text": "And you're gaming. You gotta grow up. See, here's the thing. Today is my birthday. I just turned 43. And guess what? I still game. I have other hobbies, too, that some people would say I gotta grow up. Like, I build Gundam. And where is it? I build Lego and I collect Lego. When it comes to telling a person that because of their age, they should or shouldn't be doing something, it's a little rude. And because of that, that makes me just wanna game even more, you know? Um, I just. A few years ago, really, I got back into gaming. PC gaming, specifically. I was always a console gamer. And as you get older, you start a career and you make more money, and you're smarter with money than you were when you were a kid. Sometimes when you're a kid, you have no money. And you're able to afford the things that you couldn't afford when you were a kid, but you still have those same interests. So that means that as an adult, a married adult who owns my home and works and has a child, I'm gonna have some free time. So what am I supposed to do with that free time? Am I supposed to find something to do that I don't enjoy? Is that what you're saying? Like, just sit on my couch with my thumb up my ass? Is. Is. Is that what you're saying? You can't do yard work? Every day. Can't work on your car every day. The can't work 24 7. I mean, I guess you could, but that'll kill you. But we all have different interests and we have hobbies. And most of us, at some point throughout the day or throughout the week, will have downtime. And with that downtime, we're gonna do something that we enjoy. We're not just gonna sit around and do absolutely nothing. For me, that's building Gundam. Building and collecting Lego and gaming. I'm not gonna knock your hobbies because of your age or in general, unless it's something illegal. My hobbies aren't illegal to me. My hobbies are fun. So don't go around telling me that just because I'm over the age of 25 that I shouldn't be gaming. I mean, that's just one of the most ridiculous internet argument. That's the same internet argument as girls shouldn't be gamers. And in 2024, I can't believe it that still a thing, but it is. There are people out there that don't like girls that game, that don't think girls should be gamers. So get off your high horse and quit telling other people how to live their lives. Have a good day.",

He's like, the perfect type of character to tell, again, a fish out of water story and at the exact same time, give us something that resembles what we would imagine somebody who became a samurai that was in Japanese to begin with would go through. And there's just so many interesting things that could happen to Yasuke, so many different avenues, stories to be told, and he honestly is far more interesting, in my opinion, than just a. Just a regular guy that is from Japan. And if you want that narrative, they've gave you a shinobi. They gave you a shinobi. I feel like if it was just a random African man that wasn't Yasuke, that would be where I would be okay drawing the line a little bit. Like, what? Who is this random guy? Why can't we just get it, you know, somebody that was there. But this guy's documented history. Like, Oda Nobunaga was so intrigued by this man, he. He made him a samurai retainer. He made. He made him a samurai retainer, and he definitely had him in combat. There is combat that has been documented. For Yasuke, the fact that everyone's trying to gloss over it.

I mean, I give it to you, the probably aren't that many cases of documented female shinobi. But just because they're documented doesn't mean it didn't exist.

You know, I was about to, like, freaking just, like, go against everything that he was saying in this video, but then I was like, wait a second, he's right. Like, I fought against or not fought, but argued against so many people who were like, oh, you should play more indie games, stop playing these mainstream games. No, I like these mainstream games just like I like indie games. You can like both. And then the whole console Wars thing. Like, people assume that because I have a bunch of PlayStation stuff, they assume that I don't like Xbox and I'm a PlayStation fanboy. Bitch. No, like, no, for your information, I'm an Xbox Game Pass partner. Hello? Stop making Assumption. And then the people who use playing on the hardest difficulty as a bragging right. Good for you. I'm glad that you were able to beat it on the difficulty that you know that you beat it on. Like, I don't have time to sit here and, like, perfectly master a souls born game. I don't have time for that. I got way too many things in my life to sit down and just play that one game over and over again. Instead, I'm gonna play games that I can play through relatively quickly and enjoy and have a good time. I don't like getting frustrated. I Don't think most people like getting frustrated, except you sadistic people who consider. The only thing I will say about his last comment regarding the female content creators and. And this is. This is just. This doesn't apply to all female content creators and all female gamers and all that stuff, because I have a lot of female content creator and gamer friends, so I don't put them in this category. But the only issue I have is the whole gamer girl mentality thing. Like, you. You market yourselves, and this is. This is going to the content creators. You Mark yourselves as, like, a gamer girl, and I. I understand that, right? I get it. You do it to get views and get people joining your streams and all that stuff. You get your Sims. Right, that. I understand that. But that. That it tends to make, like, a stereotype that a lot of people don't see past. And I. I don't like that. I don't. I don't agree with that. But you do you. I don't care. It's not gonna affect me none. But I'm just saying, like, it paints a bad image sometimes, because then other people and other men and all that stuff will look at female content creators who are gamers in that way, and they're not that way. So, yeah, other than that, you play whatever you want, you enjoy whatever you want. I don't care.",

You say that unity had a dual protagonist, which is wrong. You call Yasuke Yusuke. You call a shinobi a sonobi. Then you go on to say that Yasuke is one of the most well documented people in Japanese history. So how can they make a video game that has him as one of them playable characters? I've never seen somebody be more wrong in my life. Yasuke is up there with Shakespeare as one of the most least documented people in history. All we know about Yasuke is that he was a 6 foot black man that showed up on a ship in the mid 1600s. In that he later became became a sword bearer. That is all we know. Now, sure, they made Yasuke into a samurai for this game, but it's Ubisoft. Give them a little creative freedom. They created the Assassin's Creed games, they can change the profession of what Yasuke was.",

Uh,   Uh his fingers are moving, but they're not moving.   fingers   are   moving   but   they're   not   moving He's not aggressive. He's not jumping everywhere.   not   aggressive   He's   not   jumping   everywhere Here's another great example.   another   great   example This is an actual gaming competition.   is   an   actual   gaming   competition Those two guys are competing against each other and it's intense,   two   guys   are   competing   against   each   other   and   it's   intense as you can see. But notice how they are calm,   you   can   see   But   notice   how   they   are   calm chilled. Yeah,   Yeah they're playing hard against each other,   playing   hard   against   each   other but they're not jumping around.   they're   not   jumping   around They're not moving around.   not   moving   around This guy was about to score,   guy   was   about   to   score but notice it was just subtle.   notice   it   was   just   subtle Like, you know,   you   know he didn't jump around and do all theatrics.   didn't   jump   around   and   do   all   theatrics Very subtle, but very intense.   subtle   but   very   intense I'm sure on their set, their shooting set,   sure   on   their   set   their   shooting   set there's one or two gamers and they can easily point out that mmm guys,   one   or   two   gamers   and   they   can   easily   point   out   that   mmm   guys it's not that aggressive.   not   that   aggressive But I know it's cause they want to make it dramatic and to like   I   know   it's   cause   they   want   to   make   it   dramatic   and   to   like give that vibe of the action and the,   that   vibe   of   the   action   and   the you know, the intensity of the game.   know   the   intensity   of   the   game But yeah, I just pick it up.   yeah   I   just   pick   it   up"

Yeah, so my first playthrough of fallout, uh, unfortunately, um, when I was playing through it and getting down to the nitty gritty and finding out about good old Shawnee boy, this is what my girlfriend at the time decided to start paying attention to the game. She wasn't around for the boogeyman stories, but all she saw was the beginning of the game, where I lost my son. And then she saw, all the sudden, I have a chance to be back with them again. And so I was forced to side with the institute. And that's the only time I have ever sided with the institute. Ever. Because they're evil. That's it. I was forced. My hand was forced on my first ever playthrough."

But instead you decided to break a hole in your desk and put the stand through it instead of taking it off, which, by the way, you just need to lift this little thing up there and then pull the monitor off, and then it'd be laying on the table, so it wouldn't even be high height, so then it would. No, why don't. Don't do this. Why did you do this? You literally broke a hole in your desk. And I don't even wanna know how you broke a hole in your desk, cause that look like a pretty strong wooden desk as well. Like, how. How are you managing to break a hole in your desk?

    "voice_to_text": "Them are licensed to you, not sold. I've only been saying this forever. Physical media. Buy and support physical media. When you buy and support physical media, they will make more physical media. Generally speaking. I don't know if you notice this, but games that don't get physical releases are games that typically the company isn't sure that it's gonna sell well. Which is also kind of like a catch 22, because if it they did release it as a physical media, then people like me would be more inclined to buy it. But I get it. It does cost more to develop physical copies of games. But at the same time, never once have they decided to lower the price of digital games to say, hey, you know, it's cheaper if you buy it digitally. So what you're paying for a digital copy is the same amount that I'm paying for a physical copy, and I get to have the game. And before anybody says, oh, but you have the physical game, but it's not actually on there. No, it is. I've tested out every single one of my physical PS five games, a bunch of my PS four games, and guess what? The games are actually on here. That wasn't all the PS five games I have. I have a lot more than that. Now, granted, you'll be playing the game on the day one build if you don't update it, but it is playable. It is there. And how did I test this? Well, I disconnected my PS five from the internet and I installed the games and I played them. If anybody's watching this, I urge you, please, please, please support physical media. We already see a lot of these games go and disappear, and without emulation, they would be gone forever. The Wii library, the, the DS library, the 3 DS library, all gone without emulation. I, I did that cause my computer's over there where my physical games, they're not going away. I have them. I can play them whenever I feel like.",

Also, don't mind the headset. If you've been following me for a while, you already know this thing is falling. Think about it, 2K. We all know how 2K operates. They don't like us at all. Picture an open world 2K game, right? Call it 2K Worlds. You can run around with your friends, do whatever you want. But when you enter whatever facility you're going to, it turns into that. For example, NBA. There's NBA facility, it turns into NBA 2K. When you go in there, your friends can enter there too. WWE. Enter the WWE facility, turns into WWE 2. It would take a lot of work, which is why we're never gonna get it, cause 2K doesn't like to. But I think it'd be a really dope concept if you could do that with your friends and you could all have a good time. And the epic sports game. Bro, it's never gonna happen.",

A game that I would love to see that it never exist is an open world zombie game, but a simulation of the world. So taking for example, get Google Images, Google Maps to simulate every road in the. In. In the world, and you have. You get the feeling of an actual zombie apocalypse. So not every house has to have access, but, you know, you can raise some of the houses for supplies. But if a zombie apocalypse ever happened, we could play a game that we could simulate to actually know what the zombie apocalypse would feel like. You don't need special special effects zombies like, you just need classic Giorgio Romero zombie. Slow, steady paced. One bite, you're done. Um, but obviously fit around the world. So in certain countries you don't have guns. Here in UK we don't have guns, but we can always get like swords and machetes or even like drive cars to run them over. That would be a game that I think would go quite popular because people would be building their own camp or building their own base around a certain area of where they know is comfortable. And if you really wanted to expand it, do it so people can play online. People can go and explore someone else's area of the world, you know, Make it so the world has actually gone into a zombie apocalypse and see how it would go from there. I think that would go. I think that would. That would do really well.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is nobody likes people having to move or potentially losing their job. I love Tim, I like his videos a lot. He's one of my mutuals on this platform. But I think you're really off base with this one, man. Because of the fact that Xbox has been doing poorly, we should be okay with the fact they disclose these, these few studios. We should be okay with the fact that hundreds, if not a couple thousand people might be losing their jobs. Xbox as a brand is performing poorly. Hi Fi Rush was a critical darling. Everybody who played that game loved it. Sure, Redfall wasn't great, but it was arcane Austin's only ever miss. And it can be said that the management decisions were the reason that game was made in the first place. So when do we stop giving these companies a pass? When do we stop giving Phil Spencer in the entire C suite a pass? Because I'm not okay with a multi billion dollar company having a bad quarter and that meaning that hundreds of people lose their jobs. Hundreds of people that make 50, 60, 70, a hundred thousand dollars a year. Where Phil Spencer and the entire C suite are making millions. How about just a 10% pay cut for the people who make decisions? I guarantee that would save Microsoft more money than cutting all these studios. And I don't wanna hear it doesn't work like that, because it can work like That, and it should work like that",

But like I said, he holds the world record and I've been trying to beat it. I'm sorry, my boy, but it is going in. That record is mine. Today. The past couple days, I just been warming up, I've been prolonging it. I've been just trolling the chat today. I think it's 46 or 51 it. Bro, we going for an hour today. An hour? Overtime in heat. You think I'm playing? Pull up to the live today and if you're ever in my chat and you wanna run a heat seeker with me, I'm currently looking for somebody who can run a lot of heat seeker. Like daily or like at least every few days or just constantly around the same time. You know, I'm saying four or five, six o'clock. You know, I'm saying you got to be available. So if you want to run some heating with me, let me know down in the comments. Hit my DMs, let me know. I always read on my DMs, so hit me up.",

I genuinely don't know Balder's Gate I know you like very slow  steady paced  action RPG games you can handle some slower stuff you like to really delve into things  if you like Ellen Ring I know you wanna play stuff  that lets you go at your own pace really explore at your will I know you're not gonna play something like  persona but again that's a broad Assumption I might not be correct about this type of stuff just cause you played Red Dead  and that's your favourite game does not mean  you haven't played  smaller titles and even if I do have that thought I'm not trying to gatekeep  from those people I'm just trying to say  you shouldn't be afraid to explore something new try some weirder games  even if that is  a popular title that you've only heard of if you like Red Dead play Metal Gear Solid 5 if you haven't you don't really need to know the story just try it  we have game passes  on both consoles now with  numerous things just give some new stuff a try  if you're not really familiar with a new game that's all that video is trying  to encourage you to do was it mean  yeah I don't regret it though I regret the ghost of tsushima hate  even though no one really cared",

If I could get this Warhammer game, I don't care if I couldn't play any others for the rest of my life. And what I want is an Adeptus Mechanicus themed extraction shooter. It could even pair with the game Mechanicus itself. The Arc Mechanicus you live on has been tasked to go and find out what happened to a human colony that disappeared. You land on this world, only to find all the colonists destroyed and Necrons active on the planet. Something happens to where you cannot return to your arc mechanicus and can only retreat to certain safe zones. You would go into raids on this planet looking for loot, uh, you would fight Necrons, you would fight other Adeptus mechanicus elements that are also on the planet. You would take all of this stuff back to your safe zone, your hideout, uh, and you would build up a life until you'd be a to be rescued by the Arc Mechanicus. The potential for really cool NPC is the potential to delve deeper into the Adeptus Mechanicus lure is all there. And you could call it simply escape from Tomb World.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is the majority of the gameplay. Where is New Vegas? So this is what I mean precisely when I say, Bethesda Fallout fans don't actually like fallout. Um, because you don't want a fallout game. You want a looter shooter where everything is right next to each other, and you get that boom, boom, boom, and then bang, and then, oh, look at. Look at that. Oh, Todd Howard says, looky, looky. You don't actually wanna fall out, kid, and that's fine. You know what? That's fine. But I think it's really telling. It's really telling that your response to playing the game for a little bit was, oh, New Vegas fans must be on something, because, dude, I haven't even been to New Vegas yet. Like, I've been playing for, like, five hours, and, like, the game still wants me to explore stuff. I'm over that. I should be doing the boom, boom, boom, boom, booms. I should be doing the big boom booms. And listen, I like Fallout 4. I played dozens of hours of Fallout 4. Um, I think it's by far, gameplay wise, the best game. You're right. Gameplay wise, Fallout 4 is the best game. It is the least like a fallout game. I don't play fallout for the boo, boo, boo, boo, boom. Look, I have to walk 30 seconds to get from Salem to Concord, because that's how. That's how things work. Everything in Massachusetts is right next to each other. Like 30 steps away. For some reason, I play it for the story and the exploration and the RPG elements. And if you don't like that, that's fine. But I think it's really telling that you walked into the game going, this game's gonna suck. Because fallout New Vegas fans like it. Maybe look into that feeling, because that's really, really bizarre if your feeling is that a majority of fallout fans like this. So I think it sucks, and I'm not even gonna give the game a chance. I'm gonna walk into the game and bitch about how much it sucks. Maybe that's a you thing, my dude."

And they've downloaded it. They've made videos against it saying oh my God, don't play held I have this terrible game made, leaving bad reviews when the game actually looks pretty sick and I wanna play meanwhile. They've got a TikTok account, they've got a Facebook account, they've got an Instagram account, they've got a. A Windows account, they've got an Emma, they've got a outlook, they've got a Gmail, they've got a YouTube. Um, what else would they got? They probably got a LinkedIn. Ha ha ha. You know what I mean. Take the spread across the world and all these different social medias, but as soon as they have to make a PlayStation account. Wait, I'm not doing what I'm told! I. I. I want to play the game I originally bought on steam without making a PlayStation account. All we do is moan. It's insane. The amount of entitlement the PC players have thinking they're the master race at this point is ridiculous. Fancy crying because you have to make a PlayStation account? Who gives a shit? It's free. You have 40 another social media accounts. What's the big issue? I think now people are just looking for the chance to moan and create clips and fucking put stuff up on social Media like, for instance, most of these fuckers, you won't make a PlayStation accounts have a Facebook. And that's. And that's not. Accounts getting thrown everywhere around the world, sold to everybody. So, you know, quit being. I'm not gonna say it in case you get banned. Stop crying over nothing.",

Sony is about to single handedly kill hell divers two. That's crazy. So basically anybody that plays Hell Divers to on PC and doesn't own a PlayStation or doesn't have a PSN account, you're about to be locked out of that game even if you paid for it. Which brings me to another subject. With one of their last updates on PSN, they updated the terms of service and everything. And the license agreement. They say that the games are licensed to you, not sold. You do not own the games you pay for. Looks like I'm about to move right back to getting physical copies. I should have never stopped. I mean, I didn't stop, it's just getting games off of PSN was more. I ain't gonna lie, downloading the games was more convenient than anything else. For years I've been saying Xbox need to start winning again cause PlayStation got their heads up their asses. It almost looks like PC is the place to go now. What y'all think?

    "voice_to_text": "5. System are licensed to you, not sold. Well, here we go. Um, this has been a standard thing since like the 16 bit era or as long software has been a thing. It's standard software licensing agreement, dude. Uh, it's nothing new, it's nothing nefarious. That's how it's always been worded. No one ever pays any attention to it. Um, no one ever. It forces it. Um, but yes, that's correct. When you buy a CD or like a displace or physical game cartridge, whatever, you're not buying the software. You don't own the software. You. You own a license to use the software. The people that made the software own the software. They are licensing it to you. They are letting you use their software that they created. That's the legal terms of it. Always has been. Always has been, never been any different. Um, so I like this whole idea of like, oh, I buy a physical game cause I want to own it. It was never true. You never owned your physical game. The only thing is that, you know, the companies don't enforce this licence thing and don't revoke licences from anyone that owns physical game. They just don't. So you, you pretty much as good as own it, right? You, you, you as good as own it. You just don't technically legally own it, right? Sony's not. Look, the guy in the video says, uh. Uh, Sony's following the footsteps of Ubisoft. Ubisoft's not Following the footsteps of anyone? Sony's not following the footsteps of anyone. This has always been a thing. This was kind of stuff that used to read in instruction manuals back in the 16 bit era and probably before that. Um, yeah, I. I mean, I. I know there's a stereotypical thing where people don't read, um, terms and licensing agreements and all that, um, but, like, I've seen this go viral few times recently where people are, you know, trying to champion physical games, then, like, don't buy digital because of this. It's like that. That's the same shit you. Same shit you agreed to, same shit when you put in your physical game and he asked you do terms and conditions. That's a win there on pretty much every game you own. Like, not. Not pretty much literally every game that you know, that you own. So, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. You read one license in agreement that was given to you by Sony themselves, and it has the same stuff that's on every game. When you accept the terms and licensing conditions. When you first blew up a game, um, they used to be in instruction manuals. The reason why they're now in the game is because games don't really come with instruction manuals anymore. So you have to accept before you start the game. Yeah. Anyway, how's the brain?",

And obviously go watch his video if you haven't, but the toxicity in the gaming community is out of control now with games like call of Duty, Overwatch, League of legends. That stuff is to be expected. Right, but I have seen an outrageous amount of toxicity in even offline single player games now. He was talking about Final Fantasy. Now I can't speak on Final Fantasy myself, but for me it's the last of us too. The last of us has to be one of the most toxic communities I have ever been a part of, and this is spanning across many social media sites. I honestly don't think I've ever met people more hateful than in The Last of us fandom, and it's sad to see because it is one of my favorite video game franchises. In The Last of Us two is in my top three favorite games of all time. And I am all for debating with people about it and just talking about it, but with this game in particular, I feel like I'm constantly met with toxic behavior. What I can't seem to understand is the fact that a lot of these people that do have toxic behavior in certain types of fandoms, they don't even seem like they're fans at all. So why are you here, like, spewing hate about something that you Don't even like. Like, did you ever think to maybe just go enjoy something? It's just weird as fuck. Besides the one fandom that I named, what are fandoms that you're a part of that have just toxic people in it? Let me know in the comments.",

Dudes talks about how gaming is boring but all you play is the quad stack. Then yeah you suck. But like that's not most. Most people that play those games are generally happy. Secondly, like the majority of the GTA 2K audience. Like they've never heard of Ghost. Assumption they only know The Last of us maybe because of the movies. They only know Red Dead because it's GTA adjacent. But like, they don't know those games so I don't know what you're talking about. Thirdly, like you got a lot of nerve talking down on somebody for they taste. And then you bring up Persona 3 and Persona 4 is like the measure of true culture. Oh really? You like the most popular RPG of the PS two era? Like that's his basic of a preference? You just switch to a different popular genre. Less popular genre. NGS3, Resident Evil, Vice City. Those were all dumb popular games in their era. It's just that that era was 18 years ago. They don't give you no strikes. Like play what you want and stop judging people.",

    "voice_to_text": "what's a video game that you know will never exist but you would pay so much money to see happen what is up people I know it's been a minute since I've been on here but I saw this and I had to chime in because um pretty much I have not only the idea but I pretty much have the entire game like pretty much on one paper so anybody from Namco Bandai or anybody else who you know wants to develop this idea hit me up not asking for much money ha I am gonna ask for money but not much of it I pretty much just wanna get my foot in a video game uh video game creation world but yeah with that being said pretty much the video game that I am in picturing is uh pretty much a Naruto based game but not a Naruto fighter game like we currently have in like Naruto Strikers anything like that but if you remember all the way back in the Xbox 3 60 days we had a Naruto game that was called rise to Ninja and in that you had to actually hold the triggers and then use the analog sticks to actually put in the uh direction so that you can perform hand signs so I want something like that but as far as the narrative the game isn't synerged around Naruto the game will actually be centered around a character or a ninja that you create now this ninja is gonna be born and one of the lesser villages that is you know in the world of Naruto and pretty much he is going to uh just go around the world and the same time that Naruto does his journeys you'll hear about you know things that he's doing but you never really directly interact with them you'll pretty much be doing things behind the scenes and things like that and eventually game could possibly beat up to a uh an all out role with your character that you created and Naruto maybe Sasuke Sakura or you know just a different people in the main story so yeah like I said I have this entire video game on paper um powers abilities uh narrative all of that like it's down on paper I just don't have the ability to create a video game right now because I don't have time but if you know somebody who has time or know somebody who has the connections and they wanna see something like that work hit me up we can make we can make something happen",

    "voice_to_text": "so I put a lot of thought of this and I think I got the right formula if you hear me out in Avatar game RPG stuff with the format of Mass Effect 2 and attack on Titan 2 the Video Game why do I pick these two I'll explain attack on Titan 2 was such a great game where like you played your own character and somehow you were somehow incorporate into the real story without having to go through like every other thing that other characters have you truly felt like you were your own person and you gradually went up the ranks to become a full fledged scout that get into Erwi small circle  Mass Effect 2 also did the same thing it said you have more freedom of travel open game world you can go to any planet that you wanted truly and as the game came to a close you felt like the people that you included we all became family by the end know that you knew their story you gained their loyalty and it truly felt that you two were a team by the end of the game both these games have something in common that the fact is that while you were getting to know these characters you also got their stories you weren't you learnt what they liked what they don't like reasons they had difficulties and all that and depending if you did their personal missions to get their loyalty you definitely got an insight of their characters and their backstory so how do we start this story first we create our character then we select which nation our character comes from now you can also switch if you're a Bender or non Bender and for non benders you can select what weapon you would prefer which would be a sword a staff a spear anything even hell even a bow and arrow and depending on which nation you are it depends on how your story starts for instance if you're in the Earth Nation you are either gonna start your character in omashu or you're gonna start your character in Boston say Reason 4 because those are two major cities that the endgame usually visits or not usually visits but they're the ones where a lot of plot takes place if you're in the Fire Nation you are most likely a citizen or soldier now I'm kind of iffy on the soldier part because honestly I really don't know how I'm gonna like create the age gauge and all that so you can either be like you know between 15 or 17 oh hell maybe as low as 12 because honestly let's be real it feels kind of weird that if you create an adult character and he's travelling around with a bunch of kids so I know let me know what y'all think about the age rage thing moving on and if you're in the water nation you're most likely gonna start in the same village as Saka and Katara I would say you could choose to be in the Air Nation in this game but you be 100 years past tense and as the game goes on you meet various characters of these which depending on which nation you're in you might meet these some of these characters sooner rather than later now this is where the attack on Titan format comes in and attack on Titan you were able to have up to four if I remember correctly three to four people on your team so there's a five man squad now while the other characters are non playable they were still able to act on their own so they can take down their enemies all that even with some in some certain situations you could even do co op video game moves or even co op finishing moves and all that or hell they can even come in for assist if you're in Dane way I categorise it is with support characters it's either you could do a finishing move healing move or an assist or defend characters like a Tara she can either help you with an assist or healing characters like Aang can work as defensive characters or support characters like Toph Zuko or Sokka can work as support or even co op finishing move and then characters that you have like Boomy Iro John John hell maybe even where's he at where's he at Master Pot soccer's teacher I don't know why I can't pronounce his name or remember right now they are one shot catchers when you summon them they one shot a character but the fact is you can only use them like at once once a time maybe a dirt maybe a time limit has to be but here's the thing there are one shot and they are the characters who take the longest to each round now I relate to Mass Effect 2 the way I was saying to attack on Titan you can learn the characters and this also helps for people who never watched the series or even read the books you can learn about each character's history you don't have to but it would be helpful if you knew their history about like how like you know what made them them for instance when you join the game there's a part where you're not on a mission and you guys saddle up you can go around the little area get in get a little camp talk about their history night you can learn about angs how his culture got genocide you can learn about Katara or Sokka and how their mom was killed and as the story goes on and more characters coming to play when you're not on missions the campsite more characters come in you can talk to them optional you can talk to them learn about their history and all that and honestly it helps like to build relationships you know this is what makes relationships is what makes the coordination a lot stronger so if you don't talk to this person very well the coordination their attack damage is not gonna be up that way for instance if you talk to Sokka more than you do Zuko Sokka is gonna get more damage points whenever you summon him for an assist and if you do it with Zuko talk to him what do you do Sokka is vice versa talk to every character until your infinity is maxed out and you guys can do top damage and again back to Mass Effect 2 remember in book 3 how everyone but talk at their solo mission with zoo you can go on third party with them you know develop the relationship between them you see sometimes again a lot of people don't still don't trust you go at this point so you can help you know build that relationship to him so y'all's coordination goes back together but just because you're a part of the main store now doesn't mean you go on every quest as like with the ang when he went on the spirit he went on that spiritual journey I'm just gonna call it a journey he went on that journey with the Sea Line you're with the rest of the group you don't go with him on so while you're there searching for him and all that you gear up for the war and all that and you can either go with Sokka and Sookie and Toph on there or you can go help Zuko and Katara with their mission and then once you done with either or you can go help Aang with his mission now we all know that Aang did not need help with his duel with Oza I mean he kind of did because you know if he didn't get the Avatar state he would have been past tense but you know you get to the point where you're fighting with Ozai and then all of a sudden we get the moment when he gets his Avatar bring back and it's just lights out from there and then by the end of the game you stand alongside your friends as Zuko is appointed to Fire Lord the war is over and you are all having tea and uncle I roshop so guys what do you think about my take on this let me know in the comments and till next time"

Now those of you follow me for a little bit, fair play to you will know that my whole journey is based on exactly what he just said. Nobody is gaming wrong, nobody is gaming incorrectly. Their own gaming journey is their own. But you're missing out if you're not playing the older generation of games. He articulates perfectly what I've been saying. You can play your yearly release titles all you want, you can play your own games all you want, have you on play them. But you're missing out on a whole heap of history and a sense of gaming and playing games if you don't go back and play older generations to experience them for the first time, or to understand where your favourite games came from or to understand how they were made. Gaming history opens your eyes so much. And the joy of it is you can go back to these. Especially as an older person that wasn't around during the time when Halo came out, or the Hyper Amalga Solid when it first came out, or when Pokemon Yellow first came out, or when anything on the snares or the N64 when it first came out. You weren't around for that time period. Going back to as an older person, you might have a better Appreciation for it and you might be able to sort of gauge or reignite your love for gaming based on that experience. One quick example Paper Mario in a Thousand Year Door. I never played this until 2023 and my god I was not a Mario guy. I didn't have Mario on 64 when I was a child. But this I could appreciate much, much much much more because I got the GameCube in 2021 and actually I felt better about it cause I had a better holistic approach to gaming and it changed my mindset on gaming. It's an amazing time. This is morning rambling now, but I just wanted to get on quickly and highlight this video. Please go watch it, please go share it. Please go appreciate. If I can give it a trophy I would. Amazing."

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, what's a video game that would have been perfect had it not been for that one? Now, there are probably several video games that would fall into this category, but the one that comes to mind the most for me is this game right here. Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island. And everything about this game is great except for one thing, and I bet you can guess what it is. That's right, it's baby Mario crying over and over and over again until you rescue him back. Otherwise, this game is pretty dang solid. I love the artwork in this game. Just the whole vibe of the game is awesome. But when it comes to Mario crying, oh my gosh, I lose it. Now, I'm sure I'm probably gonna receive some flack over this because this game is kind of popular with certain people, but this is my opinion, and everybody has their opinion on what they like and what they don't like.",
