    "voice_to_text": "so when I was in high school I liked a guy and this guy like went to school outside of my school district so he went to a high school in a neighboring school district and the neighboring school district also wasn't even that close so let's say there's like my school district and like three neighboring school districts he wasn't like the neighboring school district of the neighboring school district he wasn't anywhere nearby me and his sister was in my grade and she was really good friends with one of my friends who was also a part of the neighboring school district that was anywhere nearby me and my friend was on the soccer team with this girl now I did not know this girl but I like kind of wanted to know this girl just because like her older brother was my crush and somehow in delulu land I convinced myself that becoming friends with her through our mutual friend would make me friends with this guy and then her brother would just fall in love with me I don't know if the the logic was convoluted  it really was anyway so his sister was on private and I like followed her on Instagram I think because of our mutual friend she let me follow her she followed me back whatever her Instagram through her Instagram I found her brother's like common username that he used on all platforms and I found his Instagram it was private so I found his Twitter and I'm I'm like not exaggerating when I say that I probably spent hours looking through this man's Twitter like probably hours maybe multiple different days different sessions like time periods that were extended time periods where I was going through this man's Twitter profile just like kind of get more information about him just to start with right anyway I found out where he went to school it was no surprise I knew cause his sister went to the same school I found out where he worked and I would and I found out like kind of vaguely when he worked and I would go to his job during his shift with my friends and we would kind of like sit in like Kiki while he was working never served us never hosted us never saw us never made eye contact not even one time and I was doing like all of this I did all of this hardcore stalking just to sit at his job while he was working for him to not have any idea of who I was he probably he no not even probably he certainly did not even know my name you know anything about me I was just obsessed it was one sidedly and I don't know what it is like I feel like something about girls when you get that one sided crush when you get that first taste it's like the obsession like this girl was saying in her video the obsession is so real cause I was at this boy's job with my friends and I didn't even drive in ninth grade my parents had to drop me off at his job",

    "voice_to_text": "in support of setting standards for your kid why don't we get ready together or talk about our strict as a child who grew up in a household where everybody considered my parents to be strict I have this happened to this conversation because I used to get picked on laughed at for how strict my parents were and obviously didn't care because I enjoyed the things that they like made us do or required us to do um but looking back now as a 29 year old I'm so thankful I did not think of it at the moment but i'mma talk to you guys about some of the things that my parents had us doing growing up and I grew up in a two parent black household my parents have been married for 35+ years I have an older brother younger sister and a middle child they had all of us doing the same so similar to what this creator had posted we were not allowed to watch TV during the week I distinctly remember us not being able to watch TV you did your homework you went outside you had extracurricular activities as we got older no TV and I'm a 90s baby I was born 95 my brother's born 93 my sister's born 98 so we all kinda group in the same era where we do not have access to all of this elaborate technology that kids have today so not only that but I don't know if you guys grew up with the jumpstart programs it was like a rabbit or some kind of an animal on top of these like workbooks for school the schools would sell or you know encourage parents to purchase for the summer vacation and every single year my parents purchased them for us we were required to do an activity out of the book every single day so we would not lose all that we had Learned during school year this is the funniest one y'all as a punishment I remember I think it was for my 10th birthday I got an attitude or something so if you believe it I would get in trouble for having smart mouth like that was hell in trouble so one of my punishments it was for my birthday I was not allowed to have a party I wasn't getting no presents no cake no nothing they were still gonna take me out to dinner because it was a family thing so they weren't gonna deprive the family of an Audi because of my attitude but I had to read the autobiography of George Washington Carver and then write a book report on it and that was my punishment for my birthday for being sassy and it took me all day to do that report and my mom was like nope tell me about the book write the report I need the click notes all that up whatever I need all of it the activities that my siblings that I participated in I did ballet and dance growing up I was also varsity cheerleader in high school and then went on to be part of the dance team our dance team went to New York and high school went to Broadway shows we took all types of like classically trained classes those are the things that I was involved in on top of playing the clarinet and the piano I played piano for 11 years I played clarinet for six years um my school district would have like district band region band all those things I was getting first year y'all like a complete music nerd my black siblings played soccer European football okay both of them played soccer both of them played travel soccer my brother made some type of elite youth team I wanna say middle school early early high school time and got invited to go play in Sweden for some type of a tournament for youth teams and he went my sister played travel ball and she also made ODP which is Olympic development so she was on those types of teams so much to the point where she was offered a full ride scholarship to play soccer women soccer at UNC Chapel Hill as a black girl so people that too my parents did not purchase cable so growing up I didn't have access like everyone's like oh I grew up watching at 1:06 in Parguta no me and my brother and sister did not like my parents were not buying cable so the only time we could actually watch these cable style TV shows for kids like Disney Channel etc so they all used to come on um regular TV Saturday mornings on ABC kids we were allowed to watch TV Friday evening afternoon so my favorite shows were Arthur and cyberspace and sometimes Dragon Tales I'll get watch that but even from those shows you're still learning something and then we would get up on Saturday morning and watch ABC kids watch all the Disney Channel cable shows just be in the know what's happening and then we'd have to go outside and play like it wasn't us sitting around scrolling doing nothing sitting on your butt then to top all that off I also think about um the education my parents gave us with like taking care of our bodies and our health and our fitness no they weren't the most perfect by any means but I look at like the way that I live my life now and the things that they instilled on us and I'm so appreciative because I work in fitness a lot of adults don't know how to eat healthy they don't know how to exercise they don't know how to do anything because again a standard wasn't set for them because they're parents gardens etcetera didn't have a standard for themselves the cycle continues so you see why it is important to set strict rules for your kids and teach them things they can use as a later adult we always had a vegetable for a meal a fruit or a vegetable and or both depending on if it was like a breakfast or something we were not sitting around eating a whole bunch of processed snacks you get a Debbie cake or something for lunch and that's it it wasn't just me sitting around snacking around eating all throughout the day especially on the weekend and the funniest part 2 we weren't allowed to drink like fruit juices sodas we could have 8 ounces of juice at dinner time and my sister used to literally drink that juice so hard mom was like once you're done with that you get water the rest of the night so like she used to have to take my sister's cup and put it in the middle of the table so she wouldn't drink all her juice and then not eat her dinner so her juice was like her treat after dinner but we'll be sipping real slow eating dinner cause it was like once you finish like 8 ounces that's it you're not getting any more going back to the Jump Start for kids summer booklet we had a couple babysitters growing up and my mom literally would tell them like make sure they do an assignment don't let them go outside and play until an assignment is done and our babysitters listen cause my mom was paying them and made us do these assignments and if you didn't do the assignment and do it with some thought and care when mama came home from work in the summertime you're gonna have to erase it and do it all over again right we were also if you're from Columbia South Carolina you know how really dope the um downtown library was once upon a time it's now kind of been taken over by people experiencing homelessness but that's beside the point we used to go to that library all the time and do the reading programs where you would get like free McDonald's or a free ice cream cone or something for reading a certain level the library also used to have storytelling and puppet shows we would go down there and pick out books um we did the accelerated reading in school where you would get certain points for reading different books you could get to purchase something from the stores like that was the generation that I grew up in and that stuff is so important and kids honestly and truly need all that again like if god blesses me to be a mother at some point in my life I'm going to raise my children in that same way because literally I have so many tools and skill sets and just like a knowledge of ways to be and exist as an adult that I wouldn't have had had my parents not push those experiences um and have these quote unquote trick rules like it's not strict kids need to be guided it's like a puppy you gotta train it right ugh but I love that I love that more more uh millennial babies tapping what was y'all's family's rules cause like it's insane to me i used to get picked on for that kind of stuff but like look at me now thank you mister and missus parker i'm a dad shout out to y'all",

    "voice_to_text": "every single time I have surgery I start beating the shit out of everybody in my sight after I wake up okay story time because this is literally me so when I was 22 um I had my very first anesthesia or procedure thankfully I never needed it as a kid so I never knew how I did with anesthesia or anything so when I was 22 I flew to Mexico so I can get plastic surgery now I asked to be awake I asked for local anesthesia so local meaning that they only numb or put anesthesia in the area that they're going to be operating on so prior to working on me the doctor asked me how do you normally do with anesthesia and I'm like to be honest I don't know I've never had anesthesia so he's like okay that's fine you know whatever we'll just do local like you're fine so looking back on it I probably should have got general because even though I was under anesthesia they were working on my ears I got an autoplasty I was literally able to feel and smell everything I feel I was able to hear and smell everything cause they're working right on your ears like your hearing bones are right here so I was literally able to like hear the cutting hear the lasers I was able to smell my flesh burning off whatever anyway sometime during the surgery during the operation I start to feel everything going on right so like I guess anesthesia is wearing off I'm feeling everything and I'm quiet cause you know I'm like little shy girl like I don't wanna interrupt them while they're operating on me so that you know what i'mma tough it out right I know I'm not supposed to be feeling this but I mean I'm I'm not gonna say nothing like why am I gonna interrupt them I'm not gonna be rude right so you know I guess they end up seeing that I'm making faces cause they're working right above me so they're seeing like that I'm squinting and then I'm kinda like you know making faces and the doctor stops and he looks at me and he asks me in Spanish he's like does it hurt and I'm like yeah it actually really freaking hurts and then like his eyes widened the nurse's eyes widened and I can just see them like looking above me looking at each other like oh my god so he's like it's not supposed to happen like that's not supposed to hurt I'm sorry we'll put more whatever right I I'm like dude it's not a big deal what I mean it was a big deal cause it freaking hurt but like me being nice and whatever I was kinda like it's not a big deal like he has a fine right so anyway that was my experience with local anesthesia um fast forward like 2 3 years I'm now 24 and I have to get an endoscopy done so I get that done here in the US and prior to going into the procedure room um the nurse asked me the nurse was actually really rude but the nurse asked me she's like how do you normally do with anesthesia with like being put to sleep and I was like well I've never been put to sleep before but I've had local anesthesia and local anesthesia you know it's worn off on me before not sure if I needed more if it was just me like I don't know but this is what happens with local she proceeds to like cut me off and she's like I'm not talking about local anesthesia like I'm talking about general like have you ever been put to sleep and I was like okay ma'am like so whatever since you're talking about general no I've never been put to sleep right so she's like okay whatever so we get into the procedure room for that and I am telling everyone I'm like hey just to let you know I've never been put to sleep I'm a little nervous and they're like no you'll do fine like whatever it's okay and I was like okay sounds good right they reassured me so for those of you that don't know an endoscopy is when they stick a camera down your um down your your throat and into your stomach you know whatever they do all that so uh they have me laying on my side so that I'm like laying on this arm I'm laying on my side and they put like a block in my mouth so that way they have access to my throat so they put the block in my mouth they end up like I guess giving me the anesthesia I end up knocking out um then I'm like dead knocked out cold so anyway during the procedure I guess I thought it was a dream until they ended up confirming later on but I was dreaming that I had woke up and I'm up in the procedure room right and I'm like looking around and I'm like well this is uncomfortable so I start to grab the camera that's in my mouth and I tried pulling it out like I'm pulling out the camera and um the nurses were behind me cause I was laying on my side I was fighting them like I was pushing them cause they were trying to grab me back and tell me to calm down and I was like uh no so I'm pushing them back I'm fighting them I'm trying to pull the camera out of my mouth the doctor that's like doing the actual procedure that has the cameras like holding onto the camera for dear life and then I guess we have like a it was like a student doctor something just like shadowing and observing he was trying to like grab my shoulders and say like calm down it's okay whatever and I'm literally like I mean I couldn't talk there was a camera down my throat but in my head I'm just like I gotta get out of here like why is there a camera down my throat so we're here pulling it they're over here fighting me I'm pushing them whatever they end up knocking me out with some more drugs and you know I ended up being fine and that's cause I got that good stuff let me tell you like I ended up seeing the report and what they gave me it was that good stuff so I don't know how the hell but anyway um yeah I end up waking in the recovery room everything is fine I ended up asking the nurse because I thought it was a dream like I said to end up asking the nurse I was like hey was everything okay with my procedure and she's like well this should not happen you fought us a little bit but like whatever it's fine and again I shouldn't believe her cause I'm like look like I felt like it was a big deal like I was really pushing the nurses like I got a hold of my camera was pulling it like I feel like it wasn't a big you know to me it wasn't a big deal so like I think I was just dreaming tell me why like a couple days a week later when I ended up getting a report of my endoscopy like my results I end up seeing like it was stated there that I was resisting that I was fighting them like everything was on that damn report and I was like oh well now I know that when it comes to like sedation anesthesia like it it's not I I gotta warn them that like I either become very violent or it just ends up wearing off and it's it's interesting because I actually do already have a couple more procedures lined up within the next couple months of the next couple years so we'll see how that goes but that's my story I either fight you or I am in pain",

    "voice_to_text": "spent 10 years in prison been out a few year and I got to unfortunately live if she is not lying y'all my name is Melissa I am 10 years sober from IV heroin and when I was in my addiction I was in and out of prison they called me a frequent flyer I would do a year here six months there nine months there three months you know whatever the case maybe all in all from the age of 15 years old to 24 I did about five years altogether and I'm telling you the stench that would come from some of these women is so god awful but I noticed when it was more pungent if you will first of all if you do not follow Jen Jen Gomez she is freaking amazing she's funny she did 10 years in prison and she tells stories and like certain things I have been going down the rabbit hole of her page and her best friend tree pages her best friend trees page like they're so funny I absolutely love them so if you guys have not followed them go over to her page follow her support her find her friend they're both amazing so anyway I have noticed so when you're in prison and you don't have money on the books when you don't have somebody from the outside putting money on your phone money on your books whatever the case may be you're considered indigent so when you are indigent and you can't buy soap you can't buy food you can't buy deodorant you can't buy any of that they give you Bob Barker soap Bob Barker toothbrush Bob Barker everything y'all from your shoes to your toothpaste to your toothbrush to the deodorant that doesn't freaking work and I have noticed that the ones who are indigent and use the Bob Barker soap is when that fishy smell is the worst you can walk in that shower room and be like oh my god what the hell is going on and who the fuck what the fuck kind of fish market opened up in here okay because it's freaking bad it's horrific I don't think I've ever smelled a smell that comes close to that okay and I've I've just noticed that when people are indigent and they're using the Bob Barker soap is when it's the worst now don't get it twisted you do have people who are not indigent that do get commentary that do buy deodorant and soap and all that who are still rank who are still dirty ass bitches and still smell like fish but in my experience which you know everybody's experience in prison is a little bit different like you still get people that stink bad really freaking bad um but because the other thing that I've noticed is if you don't have good hygiene on the outs nine out of 10 times you're not gonna have good hygiene when you come in um my hygiene was good because even through my addiction the worst thing that I went through was homelessness and like not having somewhere to wash my clothes so I would still find a way to like wash my ass but I wouldn't brush my hair I wouldn't wash my clothes but as far as like body hygiene I still found a way somehow some way even if it was literally asking a random fucking person if I could use their shower as crazy as that sounds times were so different back then um but anyway so I just wanted to stitch her video because she's so right it is a real thing and you really get the smell and see people's nasty shit when you're in prison so if y'all like this story let me know if y'all have any questions let me know don't forget to save this and follow me and I'll catch you in the next one love y'all oh don't forget to go follow Jen Jen and her friend they're freaking so funny and amazing I love their pages I love their stories and I think everybody should follow them love y'all",

He's like, oh, it's in the grill bit at the top. Open the grill door. Don't mind the oven. Have been on for 20, 25 minutes.

This is, um, during a high school football game. Friday Night Lights. Except for we were just the kids on the side, but it was a better game. Totally worked. Quarterback had no idea I was on his blind side, man. I was full sprint. I was running as fast as I could. I lit that boy up, and he forgot to fall. He just didn't move. We just stood kind of like. Eventually he came to the ground, but it was, like, two or three check. It was enough for me to be, like, only liked it. I'm gonna get him. And then you're like, oh, why is he standing still? I'm.

    "voice_to_text": "who was the elementary school teacher who had beef with you for no reason I'm not even gonna attempt to say that I remember my elementary school teachers I only remember three of my elementary school teachers but that's only cause I loved them well two of them I loved one of them I only remember because I could not say her name and I only called her teacher but that's beside the point I had the worst high school teacher oh my oh my goodness this this woman this lady this matron I do not understand why she hated me so much she just did so it was my sophomore year of high school and so I had taken computer science the year before with my friends and then two of my friends from that original computer science class the three of us decided to take advanced computer science so we were all the three of us just went and we literally got accepted going into advanced computer science and it was like a really big deal but anyways first day comes around I literally I literally I don't know what such a problem what what problem she had with me like not to really like I I like I don't know how to say this without sounding like a such a teacher's pet but like literally all the teachers loved me I was like such a good student but like I don't know it I don't know how to say that without sounding like a freaking teacher's pet except for one of my I'm not even gonna lie for one of my classes I definitely 100% was a teacher's pet I'm not even gonna lie but this class like I literally just don't understand why she has such a problem with me it's not even like I was a bad student or anything like I literally just tried my best but I also tried to be respectful to teachers that's why like I was always labelled a teacher's pet because I was respectful and people just like messing with teachers I guess anyway so first day of school comes around and like me and my three friends are in the class and um we're literally sitting on the opposite side of where the door is so the door like over here we're on the other side of the door against the windows and so she's going through like the attendance list and all that she gets to my name and she screams it I literally like jump out of my seat and like my friends laugh at me like oh what the hell like she's yelling your name whatever what like I lowkey just chopped it up to like oh my name is last on the list because my first name starts with the Z and my last name starts with the W and typically I'm always called last but it was kind of it was really weird like I was just like ah ha ha like oh she screamed my name whatever but it was kinda like okay and then she did it a second time she just like she finished attendance she screamed my name again and I like look at her and she's like go close the door miss girl there's literally a kid sitting right next to the door why do I and I'm literally the furthest from the door I'm all the way on the opposite side like my friends are closer to the door than I am so I literally like I'm like okay and I get up and go all the way to the other side of the class not that it was like a big class or anything but it's kinda like it's quiet and everyone's looking at me because I'm literally walking from one side of the class to the other closing the door and walking back to my seat like what do you mean and like from there she would like always just solely pick on me and I'm very much like the type of student well I was because she kinda low key hit all my confidence but I slowly like I was always the kind of student who like if I really did not understand something like it didn't click in my brain I would ask questions but I was like also like I was conscious enough to be like oh if other people don't understand this I'm gonna wait until she's done with her lecture or whatever and then I'll ask my questions so she can come work with me one on one cause all the other people like understand it but even then like she'd come and help me and I've asked the question quietly cause like everyone else is like typing on the computers tryna code and all this stuff like make a game or whatever we were supposed to do and she comes to me and she loudly talks about how do you not understand this I literally explain this the answer is like this the Miss Girl help me understand I don't need the answers I don't need you yelling at me I need help to understand the concept so I know what I'm doing but at some point I like I literally just gave up on asking her and like my friends tried helping me it like as much as they tried like I just could not for some reason I couldn't grasp the concepts because of the way she would talk and like literally I would literally go home and like have nightmares or whatever like even daydream nightmares of like this woman literally scheming like she was able to get into my brain whatever and like be like oh she won't understand if I teach it this way so I'm gonna teach it this way so everybody else knows what she's what I what I'm teaching but she's the only one who doesn't oh my gosh she like literally drove me up the wall so at some points my friends and I would like literally copy off each other or we would like if we have like individual assignments or whatever cause you know nobody really does individual assignments most of it I don't know but like with those kind of projects it was more like nobody really did individual assignments cause it's computer science everyone's helping each other so my friends and I would like split it into parts like oh you do the first part you do the middle part you do the last part we put it all together the code works so we would like once in a while do that stuff and my friends would always like my friends would always help me because I was the one who struggled the most in the class but I loved computer science like I literally my uncle was in computer science my dad is an it I loved the idea of like working with computers everything about it and in my original freshman year computer science class I was literally amazing I passed that class with 150% I was amazing but this class was literally the worst for me I could not understand the classes I couldn't grasp anything so my friends and I would literally work together and we'd have the exact same code and everything but Miss Girl literally had like such a problem with it but only with me like my the US3 me and my friends would have the exact same code I'm the only one who would get picked out for cheating first of all I'm not cheating cause we're literally helping each other work on it and we will try to explain to each other oh like this is why this is this like okay we're literally helping and if we are cheating why am I the only one getting called out for it like it's not even like me and my friends were the only people in this class copying off each other or working together or cheating literally everyone was forming little groups and doing the exact same thing that we were doing so this wasn't even like a oh it was only us three doing this like oh my god we were scheming we were cheating how dare we it was literally the whole class but she only had a problem with me and would only pick me out and like it got to the point where I literally to this day I do not like computer science like anytime I'm like have to do something remotely computer science it gets me like it I don't know what the heck and not computer science like tech in general but like I mean like when it comes to coding cause like I do understand some concepts like literally do remember how to do some of the coding but the idea of like actually going through with it like just I can't like computer science at a point was literally my dream major that was the career like I wanted to do something with the computer science degree but I just at this point I can't I tried to back in college I tried to go back in computer science but all I could remember was how it felt like being in our class and being so degraded and feeling like I was not smart enough to really do anything like her the way she she would like treat me made me feel like I was not gonna be capable of doing anything with my life but like she it it ruined computer science for me and my god I do not wish that for anyone I do not why know why she had such a problem with me but oh my god oh and I literally just remembered I literally ended up dropping out of her class halfway through the semester because I could not deal with being around some a teacher like that like I don't understand like I literally do work with kids I work at a Kumon center and I know as much bad stigma there is around Kumon I don't I honestly don't feel like that's considered in my come on center because it's not that bad like my students literally love me and they always come in with happy smiles and I'm not just saying that like just to be like oh my god like whatever but I just don't understand like why a teacher of all people would like degrade someone so badly to the point where like it just pushes them out of the class like you're not helping you're making someone feel worse about themselves like to the point where like it it's such a big deal that I couldn't even make it like a career possibility because of how much it truly affected me like just her caused so much trauma for me like what do you what do you mean you're a teacher you're supposed to be teaching the next generation and like I know there is like a huge problem with students being so disrespectful but I wasn't one of those students so I don't understand why I was the one being picked on but anyways",

    "voice_to_text": "I love this video so much I just wanna say thank you to the beautiful creator for making this video being so vulnerable and real with us now there is one key component that I wanna highlight as to why I believe she was successful in being able to wear her natural hair despite the emotional and and physical labour that she had to go through that morning this is something that many of us especially girls but we have natural hair or not can um relate to you know you've planned this hairstyle you'll go you've done your twist you're thinking your twist out is gonna be popping your hair's gonna be looking nice you take it out and it completely flops like it is so frustrating and annoying when it doesn't turn out how you desire those in that moment where your hairstyle flops usually fight or flight kicks in and you're just like you know what nah I'm done I'm not going out or I'm gonna wear head scarf I'm gonna put on a wig because I can't go out like this and the fact that despite you know the hardships haha of that morning she still went out like I am so proud of her and the comments that she received as well like all the compliments are just just perfect in the comments I've saw how some people gonna mention that you know our hair like you know 4C hair is meant for locs like it's perfect for locs um now personally um now there are few directions I can go with this but let's just stick with the fact that she mentioned never um learning how to style her natural hair so this is her learning process she's not yet this massive pro that knows what she's doing with her hair and for that I really do wanna commend her um learning how to drive for the first time when you learn how to make something new it doesn't always uh turn out perfect if perfection is always the goal um we will always fall short of that and we may never even start or even attempt because yeah it's just an unrealistic standard but her hair is not meant for locs if she does not want to wear locs in that sense you could she could choose to wear them if she wants them but that's not the style she's going for she's going for the stick back bun that she did this reminds me of when I went natural um I had relaxed hair and I wanted to get a big chop and my hair just so refused she's like hmm I'm not cutting your hair I'm not cutting your hair and then I was just like obviously like oh I really wanna cut my hair and then the person next to me was like what did she do what does she wanna do and they were like oh she wants to cut her hair and she's like ah why do you wanna cut your hair cause I wanna be natural they're like hmm that rough hair you don't have tough hair you want we even scratch your hand like why do you wanna you have such nice hair your hair is long your hair is nice but I was like I was so adamant on the fact that I really wanted to go natural it was to the point she refused I had to even leave the chair because I was just sitting there like a log I ended up crying I was with my sister that am I making the right um decision you know like shaving my head this was a big thing this was 10 years ago um and it was only by the persuasion of her husband that was like come on now this is what the customer wants and then they I'm actually paying you to do this haha and so yeah then she finally just cut my hair and just chopped it off I think it's somewhere on my page anyway if you scroll scroll scroll um yeah you'll see the video but this just highlights the fact that you can receive such hurtful comments from people with the exact same hair type and texture same country brother and sister you know from the very communities that we come from can say some of the most harmful things to you because even when I went natural it would be like people that I knew people that were close to me that would kind of look at me you know side eye big big side eye because when I first shaved all my hair off it's not looking like maybe how it does now and how and and when we do tend to glorify in a steam natural hair when it's thick long and luscious it was choppy and it was short but I loved it so much in that state and this leads me on to what I believe was um the determining factor in her success and that is her mindset your mindset will take you so far in life period but also if you're having a hard time on your natural hair journey and you're looking externally to fix that what hair product can I use to grow my hair what oil do I need to use what conditioner what product or um you know I don't have the jeans for long hair my 4c hair could never I can't wear my natural hair out until it reaches um my waist till I get waist length hair mmm mmm I can't wear it out nah my hair I can't do wash and goes with my hair yeah you can't wear your hair out too much cause you have to have to wear protective style like you have to wear protective style uh what am I gonna do to my hair um for my birthday cause yeah I can't wear my natural hair out to my to that event you know uh like I wish my natural hair was thicker there are so many things that we think about natural hair and say about natural hair um that just aren't true or just really limit us these are called like limiting beliefs and the mindset that we need to have when it comes to having natural hair is a growth mindset one that embraces learning and is inspired by others rather than compares themselves and says oh I could never do that it's more like oh how rather than saying I can't for myself I have been natural for the last 10 years for the last seven years I've worn only my natural hair so I haven't worn extensions or wigs or and I don't typically do protective styles in the traditional sense I'll put twists in my hair because I like how they look so I use um my own hair to do mini twist or mini braids but just cause I really think they're super super pretty but your hair can grow and thrive without you braiding it like hair grows in general so um I wanna encourage you if you're listening and you do have natural hair that your hair grows your hair can grow your hair is beautiful there's nothing wrong with you there's nothing wrong with your hair your hair is not ugly your hair suits you yes it may be difficult right now it may be frustrating because you don't know exactly what to do with your hair or you feel quite uncomfortable insecure wearing your hair but it doesn't always have to be your story your story can change any moment and this is deeper than hair this is also life your life and your story can change at any moment all you have to do is make a conscious decision to say do you know what I do not want to continue going as I'm going I want to break the status quo don't wanna complain I don't wanna be stagnant now if you're somebody that wants to work on embracing your natural hair wearing it feeling more confident calm cool and collected and I just wanna say this we as black women spend so much more money on hair products than any other group of people and I am very convinced that our brain the our brain and mind has been taken up by thoughts of what am I going to do with my hair like our hair is a big big part of our lives and what would it feel like to just is just hair as beautiful and listen I love hair so much and I love natural hair so much but the end of the day it is not a life hmm are bigger than our hair you know we can be free we can be expressive in our head that's not what I'm saying we can be free and expressive in our hair which is the goal not to feel shame and restricted by our hair so listen I can talk and I love natural so much but if you would love to work with me and explore this further feel free to leave a comment saying I'm interested or you can check out my bio that will take you to the course that I have specifically designed to get you the mindset you need in order to embrace your natural hair if you have any questions let me know right bye",

    "voice_to_text": "What is the lie that you told as a kid that was so bad that you thought your childhood was over? So when I was about 7 years old, me and my mom were over her best friend's house. Her best friend and her husband were meth dealers. Now, also at this time, me and my mom were poor, like, and I had a little brother. To the time, we were like, very poor. So, like, I was always like, stealing money, borrowing money, like, the whole nine yards for my mom, like, for us to eat. So one day, like, the meth, like, plug, plug, like the whatever. I don't know. I really don't know who this dude was, but he came over with like, a lot of money. So a drug deal. My mom was like, okay, Ava, go like, in the living room, play your game. So I go in the living room, he comes in the living room and like, they're hanging out. So I go in the other room, I come back. Water, money on the counter. Like, counter, like, table thing by the door. Couches on the couch. Actually, yeah, it was on top of the couch, next to like, this countertop thing. And I walk out, I'm like, no one's out here. And I'm like, damn, no one's gonna notice if I take some of that. So I took some. Like, seven year old me. Yes, I took some meth money. They could Have been fitting all that. Like, who knows? But I took it. I took like a water, took like five or six hundred dollars. And me and my mom leave. And I have it like in my, literally in my pants like, cause I'm a kid. And I'm like, I'm like, alright, like, we're set for like a minute. Like, we're gonna eat good. And when we get home, our apartment in my. Stacy, like, my mom's friend is calling my mom like, freaking like, where's this money? Where's this money? Where the fuck is this money at? Did Ava take it? What happened? Like the. What happened? Did you fucking take it? Like, they're fighting. Like, their friendship went down the drain damn near because of this. We went back over there, my mom was like, we're going back over there to help them find this money. And I was like, I had done hit it in my pillowcase, like, literally hit it up in my pillow. I was like, fuck. Like, I have to stick to this. Like, if I. If they find out, like, I'm lit. Like, what the fuck am I gonna do? So we go back there, we're searching on, like, looking under this couch, under this like, desk thing. Like, I'm looking like, I really don't know, I don't know. My mom and Stacy are like fighting and I'm like, oh my god. So we leave. And that was the last time that I Ever remember really going over there? But I did get away with it. I, like, my mom was like, oh, my god. Like, we need money to eat. I was like, here's $20 I had for my birthday. Or, oh, grandma gave me $20. Fucking $500 later. Blue.",

    "voice_to_text": "this is actually part two of this story I tried to stitch this video with my first video and TikTok kicked it out for whatever reason so here we go part two so you'll just need to go back to the video that says Ghost Story if you wanna hear the first I seriously feel like such an old person on here haha alright kids gather around it's time for part 2 okay so my friends and I would continuously um probably to an unhealthy level go back to this Mar family ranch to this haunted ranch mansion place and over the course of I don't know maybe four months five months who can really say because I was partying so hard at the time but we would go back there a lot and um over the course of that time we found out that at one point yes it was my family ranch but it was also a pentecostal Christian commune and I ain't got no beef with pentecostal Christians do your thing but I feel like there was something more nefarious going on there um often I would go into the house of my friends and I would see the ghosts of these women terrified running down the halls turned super cold I would see the children crying and running and eventually I saw three large dark entities that were sort of harassing them in this perpetual loop within the space as I mentioned in the video before this um one of my friends who probably end up seeing this uh she had recollections of living in that space in the past and having two children that were still stuck there their spirits still stuck there and honestly now that I think about this I'm getting goosebumps so hard um one of my missions here on this planet is to help ghosts cross over to get home to heaven who have lost their way did it really all just start right there I think it did I might cry so this one time my one friend will call him a and this other woman I just told you about we'll call her E we went into the house um and we were walking around and kind of just vibing I don't remember anything super spooky happening that time except for when we were leaving when we got close to the front door my friend a who had never like really even had a spiritual experience I mean all experiences are technically spiritual but he never had something sort of unbelievable happen and he was walking out the front door and he heard get out whispered in his ear I've never seen a man fucking jump that high and run that fast about anywhere so funny and I remember now watching him one of my little fairy friend helpers this little purple light followed him out so then this other night these real tough guys um I'm not really close to any of them anymore I wouldn't even call them friends um maybe one of them uh but these real tough guys were like we're gonna go to the haunted place let's fucking go check it out and we get there and one of them upon Cena it's evening time it's night time and one of them upon seeing is like nope not doing it haha he just sat in the car I'm like alright bro and then I went inside with this other guy we'll call him Jay real tough guy right we go inside he's got a camcorder because he wants to capture whatever we see on film and so we're walking down one of those really long hallways I mentioned in the last video where there's bedrooms and bathrooms on the other side and I saw you know felt the um coldness and saw the seven women ghosts in the closet well we're walking down this hall and he actually it's one of those old camcorders from back in my day and um he like flipped the screen so that the the screen was like a blue light that could like light the hallway we were walking down the hallway and I saw one of the ghosts of the women and all the women sort of had a similar look they were wearing like old plain dresses maybe of the 1800s early 1900s and long hair and so the kind of all had the similar look and I saw one of them look at me and rush towards me and like passed through my body with like ice water feeling and then we heard this sound like a freaking like a giant gong being hammered as loud as it could be coming from the wall next to us and again I've never seen a tough guy run so fucking fast fucking he just turned and ran as fast as he could and I was like bro you just left me alone in here in the dark so I had to fucking navigate out of the house in the dark and yeah that was super fun so one of the final times that I went there um I went there with A&E again I felt something come over me I'm getting goosebumps again I felt something come over me and at the time I thought maybe my spirit guide Helen at the time was taking over my body in retrospect looking back I don't think that's what it was I think Helen was at the highest light and beings of the highest light don't need a body like they don't need to come into your body um that's what demons do so something came over me and I went into this trance like place and I got out of my car and started walking toward that front door that entryway um that I'd mentioned before where the Great Hall is like right behind it and my friend a said that he saw a little purple light following me into the house so there's like some sort of guardian fairy spirit going on with the situation but like something followed me in and I remember raising my hands up and like calling the women and the children and helping them to go to heaven somehow like it's kind of a blur because I was again going through such a rough period of my life I was like partying all the time I was a fucking mess I was looking for love in all the wrong places but still like this part of me this this part of me that knew like my mission was so much beyond partying my spirit knew like something had to happen so I was shown that seven women and four children crossed over and then one or two of the dark entities repented and found the light and also went home and one of them stayed behind and was super fucking pissed so shortly after that um they tore it down like some construction company tore that place down and some other buildings off in the distance and they built a fucking Suburban track and I was like this is not a good idea but that's what happened and um I never really went back there after that but something did happen with that dark entity um maybe two years later a year later and I will share that so maybe a year or two later I was spending the night with my really good friend we'll call him Z um and I had just told him the story of this haunted experience and we were going to sleep that night we slept in the same bed we were like super tight and really really good friends like soul like soulmates in a way right he was super psychic too he is super psychic too very tapped him and so we had been like making art and drawing and we put one of the drawings we did on the wall or like pressed against the wall on the dresser and we went to sleep so I woke up to the sound of that drawing like swishing and going down onto the ground and so did he and then something grabbed my ankle and started to yank me out of bed and he pulled me back into bed and cast that shit out and now that I think about it few years after that something possessed me um I was fully possessed on one drunken stupid night I've been dating this guy and he slapped me across the face and where he was staying was right down the street from my frenzy and so I ran over there and as I ran I got really sick to my stomach and then something took over me when I was at his house and I think it might have been the same being anyways my buddy Z was like a badass and cast it out and called my spirit back and really powerful stuff um as I'm tuning in right now I feel like yeah that being was sent into the void so bye um anyways thanks for listening love you I'd love to hear your ghost stories too alright mwah",

    "voice_to_text": "so the year is 2,006 um I feel like my dad may had just gone out of jail or was home for some time so you know it was a good idea for me to go visit him so he lived in Stanford Connecticut where that house belongs to my great grandmother um my great grandfather served in an army and all those different things as well the house was a fall it was like a multi family house and had upstairs downstairs and it had different kind of like apartments but they made it into one if you know you know so I newly just got into the space of my space and all those different things at that time I was 12 years old by the way in 2006 so one night I was on MySpace and you know at that time computers wasn't a everyday thing in everyone house you know you seen somebody with a computer you thought they was rich you know whatever situation is so I ended up going on my space I was up there all night it's now in the wee hours of the morning which we call the witching hour and um I'm now getting a little sleepy let me go in my dad room and lay down mind you in my family things already happened a lot of spiritual things was going on I have one experience as well my grandmother seeing a hand running by her foot and all different types of stuff but we'll get into that another time so as I'm on the computer I decide to turn off the monitor so I oh actually I I put the computer on sleep which turns off the monitor so now it's a black screen I don't learn about black screens until I get much older about them being portals as I am looking at through the black screen I see this figure near the bathroom I mean I know near the kitchen kitchen was behind me I didn't really know what to say or what to do so I was kinda like damn should I run downstairs with my cousin Jasmine and all of them at where they lived in the lower levels of the house or should I run towards my um great aunt room cause her room was towards the back as well so I decided to just get up and run and originally I was gonna run downstairs when I got up to run this the the the figure ran past me and I felt this very cold almost webby like feeling from the energy running past me at this point I hold ass to my great aunt's room I come in a room she like oh you okay and I say yeah kinda sleeping here you know she thought nothing of it she was like hey come sleep so I slept in her room and stuff like that ironically the next day when I wake up in horizon I can hear her and my cousin talking about the experience last night and you know before I get too far ahead I did tell her that I've seen something like some type of figure so that's why she was always coming around like it was normal like a normal day for them so ironically like I said I heard um my cousin hers talking which is her granddaughter and I wake up exactly on a point where you're talking about where she was like oh such a such scene um you know a ghost last night our our our cousin or whatever the situation is where I forgot what she you know the the word and repeatedly what she said and that kind of like shook the core of my experiences going here because I just thought about that experience where I'm like oh shit I'm turning the the damn monitor off and this big thing this big figure is standing at the doorway of the kitchen I don't know what to do a whole ass it runs past me it feels so cold and so Misty and webby like and people probably that had those same experiences were like you know validate that you know it was just a lot but I have so many other experiences I'm a medium I I see a lot I know a lot I I pick up on a lot so ghosts and all those different things is not something that's new to me but hope you enjoy that",

I don't wanna judge, but until you rise up, girl, I'm gonna have to cast judgement. And I'm gonna have to just make up my own storyline as to why you've done what you've done. Because what else can I do? And I'm invested. I'm invested at this point. Because firstly, we need to roll out this part two. Because how do we. How do we go from one person to six? And also go back and listen to his story time? Because this also kinda gives me like a lesson in myself. Things that are done in lust don't seem to work out romantically long term. He caught a serious wine at Carney. I thought, yes. Wifey material. When you lead with lost, you end up heartbroken. I know it cause I've been there, girl. I'm only one month free of a breakup. But I started off in lust. I'm telling you now, it's not the way to go. It's not the way to go. I'll be up in there doing more story times. And I don't wanna. I don't. I'm tired.",

    "voice_to_text": "so when I was about 14 I went to go visit my grandma in Florida Florida has always been a spiritual place for me ever since I started visiting there when I was like 12 or so so honestly if anywhere this were to happen it would be Florida at this time of my life I was really getting into Wicca and like empathy and declares and psychic abilities in general I was really starting to understand that humans have the access to psychic abilities and this really fascinated my 14 year old brain my grandma's house was always a little bit creepy to me she just moved to a new house in Florida this year and I was sort of like okay um it's a little weird in here but whatever it's probably just my nerves I would hear weird sounds sometimes I felt like I was hearing footsteps but I would talk to my grandma the next day and she said nobody went over to that side of the house in the night I would sometimes feel like I could see figures out of the corner of my eye but I just played it all off as it was just me the final straw was when I woke up in the middle of the night one night bear in mind it was 3:00am and ever since I was a little kid I've always been super antsy about being awake at this time because the energy is just so much I was sharing a bed with my sister in my grandma's house in Florida and she was fast asleep snoring I looked over to the left to like the bedside table that was by her side of the bed and the rosary that normally was like hanging off of the lamp on that side started to sway left and right and I remember I was like okay there's no fan on um the AC isn't blowing on strongly like what is going on and remember it's 3:00am so I'm literally already pissing my pants then I heard footsteps in the hallway so clearly and the closet door of that room started to make like a sound it was like a sort of like a creaking sound like something was moving in it but not like moving around a lot like something was just standing there and it was freaking because of the weight on the floorboard if that makes any sense I look back over to the Moving Rosary because I was so freaked out and I was about to go turn on the lights and literally as I was like okay I'm turning on the lights a candle turned on that was on that same like nightstand it had like a lamp a picture a candles the rosary some other stuff the candle created a flame it turned on I candles don't turn on so I absolutely started to lose my shit my first instinct was to wake up my sister even though she was a lot younger than me just to see if she also saw what I was seeing as I start to wake up my sister the candle went back out excuse me moral of the story I turn on the lights I basically stayed up until the next day I told my grandma and she said that she had collected a bunch of antique tea kettles from an estate sale and that ever since she got them she did notice some weird things were happening my grandma is super into the spiritual world and Christian and honestly I just would have liked a warning so I would like to hear your ghost story now as well and I have plenty of others if you'd like to hear them",

This in the context of the story that we're about to tell you. But I'm gonna give you a small breakdown. Imagine young love, a 21 year old and 23 year old, you know what I'm saying? Being together, got their own spot, making good money, you know what I'm saying? Enjoying each other, being in great love. And then out of the blue, you know what I'm saying? After making plans about having a baby and getting pregnant, he jumps up and said, hey, I don't want the baby. She's like, Yo, I've already done ultrasound, I already heard the heartbeat. I'm already connected with this baby. I'm not giving this baby up. He like, cool, no problem. I'm out. He leaves, right? Sometime later, you come home from. And I'm saying, from a long day or whatever, and you see him in the. In the apartment, cooking. And you like, alright, cool. Nothing too crazy. And then I'm saying, y'all make food, have dinner, watch a movie, fall asleep or whatever situation may be. And you wake up in the middle of the night, you know, I'm saying to go use the bathroom, you know, things like that happens. And you see his phone, you like, okay, you swap out cases on the phone so that he still thinks that His phone is next to him if he choose to wake up. So you in the bathroom, you know, I'm saying, you urinate, you wash your hands, then you turn on the sink and start looking through the phone. You see, you talking to women, whatever. It ain't no big deal. Nothing crazy, nothing that would make you go, oh, my god, you doing wrong by me? Then you go, you find a group called Gang Bang. And then that group, Gang Bang, somebody says, y'all came up positive. And two other homeboys say, yeah, I came up positive, too. And then they find out that boys that you've known your whole life, since I've been kids, have been sliding on each other, and they all have come up positive for STD. The big one, the buck o'hona. Okay, the marijuana. All right? And now you in the bathroom, vomiting all over the place and don't know what to do with yourself. Girl, it makes all sense on why he behaving the way he does. Best thing you can do is hope that you can take prep and make sure that you're not positive and that baby ain't positive. And cut that man off and get full custody. And keep it pushing.

But let me preface this by saying that my mom passed from COVID three years ago, and it was the most horrific and traumatic thing that I'd ever gone through. And three years later, I still grieve her very hard, more than usual from time to time. And yesterday was one of those days. I was just missing her so much. And when I do, I just talk to her out loud, like, as if she was here, but in reality, I'm, like, talking by myself. And after, like, an hour of crying, I was basically editing a TikTok video. And if you ever edited any TikTok videos and you've used, like, the subtitles, it's basically auto generated, and it's automatic. It'll just pop up to whatever you're saying. But basically, I put on the automated subtitles. And the last part of my video, I never said any of those things. But let me just show you. So proud of you. It's okay that this happened to you. It's okay that he fucked you over, because ultimately, he. Just think about that. This is happening for you and not to you. You're already looking back at this in one",

So when I was younger, I had this serious mental condition where, like, I couldn't stop talking. I was always talking. So basically, during a standardized test, me and my friend were sending messages back and forth, like, with little notepads. And so we get called by the teacher, and the teacher picks up the note, and it's basically me and her talking about a guy we had a crush on. And so she was like, this is inappropriate. You're, like, two years old. Why are you talking about guys? She sent us to the principal's office. She literally takes these papers, like, that we're passing back and forth, makes photo copies of them, and she's like, bring them home to your parents. Have your parents sign this so your parents know what you guys are talking about. I was like, oh, okay. So this is how I go down. This is how my story ends. Basically, I go home, and I'm thinking of my master plan. I'm like, easy peasy lemon squeeze. I'll just take my dad's, like, signature from a field trip form, and I'll just forge right over it. That's easy. Go in next day, and I headed to my principal, and I was like, oh, my dad saw this. She's like, Your dad signed this? I was like, actually, my mom signed it. Like, my dad wasn't home, so my mom forced my dad's signature. She's like, okay, let's call your mom to confirm that. Why would I say that? I have no idea. I have no idea. She has my mom on speakerphone. I'm sitting there and I'm like, okay. Calls my mom. My mom's like, what letter are you talking about? We didn't see a letter. You know what? Actually, we will both come to the school. My mom and dad left their job to come to the school. When your parents leave their job to come to school, you already know. You already know, I hope. Okay, so my parents got to the school, we're all having a meeting in the principal's office, obviously talking about how it's inappropriate and how I shouldn't be, you know, passing notes during class. And then she asks my parents at the end of the meeting, would you like to take her home early, or would you like her to spend the rest of the day at school? Why would you ask my parents that question? All you have to know is I made it here today to tell you the story. But that was the longest ride home, and, um, I. I'm. I'm just very happy I survived.

So, I was just trying to get through this period of time. right well A nephrologist, and this nephrologist was such a good doctor and very kind with his patients. Super mean to nurses. Why?  think he had a complex. anyway um We were doing shift change and the nephrologist was unhappy about how intake and output (fluid counts) turned out for last 24 hours. That would have been night shift and I hadn't even finished getting report. He just starts yelling about whatever and nothing that I had control over. Anyway , while he's yelling at me and I can't get a half a word in um I start feeling really nauseated so I sit down and I'm like pale suddenly and I throw up in the trash can right there at the nurse's station, in front of this doctor. And he starts *This is when I saw just a flicker of humanity in this person.,,* He starts barking orders at everybody like \"Get her a cold wet washcloth!\" \"Where's the blood pressure cuff??\" \"You check her blood pressure!\" blah blah blah \"You heck her blood sugar!\" like we did this whole thing for me and then when it was over and he was gone my co workers were all like \"You're pregnant!\" aren't you and I was like no whatever",

I went to colonize school, and, like, one of the things they first teach you is, like, soups, like, stocks and sauces, right? And when it comes to classification of soups, if I can tell you that it screams supremacy. It was, this is Escoffier, the fucking godfather, whatever the fuck that means. Of culinary's classification. Here it goes. Clear soups, puree's, coolies, bisque's, blue taste, cream soups, special soups, vegetable soups, and foreign soups. And when I was learning that, like, we can't call it foreign. We're gonna call it ethnic. You wanna know what an ethnic soup was? French Canadian pea soup. They considered that foreign. And who would? The other soups, they didn't even pay mine. There was nothing for FA. Pretty much comes down to the fact that whatever is gonna be considered the right way to do things usually is what the people in power are doing. Now, the best way I've ever seen the said is that when Jacques Papain. Fuck the homie. Jacques Papain was talking about how he did things in the kitchen, he's like, this is my way. There are many other ways to do things. This is my way. And usually that's how I go about life. This is the way I do it. There's many other ways to do things right? And, uh.

thought was unhealed unhealable depression was actually chronic shame chronic shame can feel like unhealable depression it can represent itself it can present itself as unhealable depression let me say that again chronic shame can present itself as unhealable depression this video is for my younger self this video is for 14 year old me and for anybody else who could be experiencing this is there anything that you have done in the past five six 10 years five six months that after you did that thing a mistake you made maybe you put your foot in your mouth a lot and say things that you don't mean or maybe you um I don't know embarrass yourself in public or did something or maybe you got the wrong person mad let's say you have someone in your family who's narcissistic and abusive and you piss them off and you and now you are just every single day you are just in fear every single day you feel like something bad is gonna happen you just feel like this deep deep deep deep burning pain in your stomach that's where I felt mine when I had this situation I'm actually currently dealing with it at now but the situation that to me 14 year old me dealt with the first time that I had unhealable depression that was actually internalized shame was when I was 14 and the mistake that I made was my parents when I was 10 came brought me to the room and told me that my the guy that I had a crush on at the time was childhood friend had sa'd his um not really it wasn't really sa'd but it was like it was it was kind of it wasn't that wasn't consensual obviously it wasn't consensual they were kids um but he sa'd um sort of his um sibling his younger's girl sibling they've been in a sexually sexually inappropriate relationship for that age sexually inappropriate relationship they were siblings as well so incest basically they were not they were not biologically related or legally related actually because they were foster care kids but yeah it was basically it was incest anyways um they told me that I was not allowed to ever tell this one girlfriend of ours this one group mutual girlfriend of ours cause this guy was in my childhood friend group um that I was not able to I'm not allowed to tell her because she was too young to understand cause she's a few years younger than me I was 10 years old remember I was 10 years old when I heard this so this girl was 8 years old and they told me not to tell her her parents it was it was under it was because her parents told my parents to tell me that I could not tell her um and they told me basically under threat of death like literally like they were gonna kill me but like that's what they would say like under threat of death um major exile punishment literally like I was basically exiled from my friend group um years later when this girl decided that she really needed to know what happened she really need to know what this guy did that made it so like I like the whole like she knew that something was up um and she started asking an adult like I told her she lied to me and told me that her mom had finally told her what happened so I said okay and she really wanted to know what happened she really wanted to know so I told her after like I said before she lied to me and said that she already knew what happened she went home and told her parents that what I told her I got major trouble this is one of the most traumatic things that ever happened to me in my life um I still to this day have not really told anybody outside this friend group knows what happened or that this happened um I made several friends since then I have not really talked about what has ever happened it was very traumatic experience for me it was the first time in my life that I became overly majorly suicidal and and had major depression every single day I got up and I felt like there was nothing left for me to live for it was a very very hard experience for me soon as my parents found out that I told this girl what happened like I said it was under threat of death under threat of literally losing all my friends that I told her she lied to her parents and said that I just told her voluntarily that she never asked that she never tried to get me to talk to her about it or she never told that nobody ever knew that she lied to me and said that she knew about it when she didn't I was basically exiled from the friend group so I had to go to church every week though and see this see all my friends hang out with each other I had this rule where I had to like stay like in a couple of feet away from my parent whenever I was hanging out with these friends these like those were my childhood friend group so any event that we went to anything that got invited together I was not really able to hang out with my friends I was not able to bond with them I was not able to hang out with them or do anything with them and um that kind of basically ruined my friendships it ruined my friendships it ruined my I ruined my social life it ruined it literally ruined my social life I had no other friends outside my friend group all my other friends had friends outside of that friend group I did not um so yeah it ruined my social life it ruined my perception of relationships it ruined a lot of things it ruined my perception of the church because apparently when you do something wrong in the church you get exiled basically and you do not get forgiven you do not get pardoned for your sins or whatever um this is my church this is my family friend group it was a very small church so everybody knew that something had happened it was not my business was not kept to itself like my business was not private it was embarrassing it was mortifying it was degrading it was lonely it was horrible it was awful and it was all all happened because this guy decided to being a sexually inappropriate relationship with the sister when we were kids so basically all this comes down to it wasn't even my fault that all this happened because it should never have happened in the first place I should never have had to keep that big dirty of a secret forever I shouldn't have had been hanging out with these people because there should not have been I should not have been in a situation to be in a place where I could easily get stuck in a horrible situation like that where I had literally no friends um yeah and then and then and then Covid happened and I never saw all those people ever again I to this day have not seen any of those people the people in that friend group yeah I talked to them on phone I started texting them got back in touch with them after years of being extremely hurt by the whole situation extremely did not want anything to do with any of these people did not want anything to do with any of them because of what happened I do not feel like I was their friend I didn't I was mad I was mad I wasn't I wasn't mad at any of them though I was mad at myself I thought that I was a danger to society basically because I said that one secret that I was supposed to keep or whatever I around that time in my life I had got this ball there's a ball of shame and guilt that was inside my I could feel it in my stomach I thought I had an ulcer I thought I was gonna get an ulcer because of my stomach continually felt icky I could not eat I could not do anything I could not do anything without feeling guilty every single thing I did even something I didn't do that was wrong I felt guilty I was carrying the shame in this guilt with me every single day every single week for months and months and months and months all through Covid I felt this guilt it did not go away this ball of shame and guilt did not go away until I was almost seventeen until I was almost 17 this ball of shaming guilt did not go away this happened this thing happened when I was thirteen four took four years four years for the shame and the guilt to go away because not one adult that was involved in the situation ever sat down with me and asked me how I felt about the situation not one person ever sat down with me and listen to me about how sorry I was not one adult came and searched me out they told me that I needed to come to them and apologize for what happened you realize this whole situation happened because your son did something wrong and their daughter the other family's daughter did something wrong there were so many people involved in the situation that did things wrong did not do the right thing but the only person that got in trouble or got major life trauma from the situation was me and I do take credit and I did apologize for the fact that I did wrong that I did not keep the secret like I promised to but I promise you to keep that secret when I was 10 I was supposed to go to the grave with that secret basically I do not know why it needed to be a secret to be honest I generally do not know why it needs to be a secret because I think that essay and um sex offenders and anybody who does any of that stuff I don't think that it should be kept in the dark because why why it was a very scarlet letter scene where I had the scarlet Letter branded on me that I that I knew what happened and he got to go around with nobody knowing what he had done but nobody knowing but I had to told the guilt of in the secret and the dark secret of knowing that he had done this and during this whole time this guy had a crush on me and all my friends didn't know cause I wasn't supposed to tell them didn't know what this guy had done so they didn't know that I didn't like him anymore so they shipped us made us made us feel like we were like we were together for the whole time but what I'm getting to is I had felt ball of guilt and shame for four years and I thought I had depression I was so depressed it became depression the shame and the guilt and the loneliness and the hurt and the betrayal and the burden of having to be the only one who was in trouble the only one that got called out for my sins and what I did wrong caused me to have depression uncurable depression I mean I didn't go on antidepressants or anything until recently that did not go away I felt guilty and felt ashamed every single waking day every single waking moment of my life from the day that that girl came went home and told her parents I told them about the secret to the time and to the day I was 17 in a few months I finally just one day it went away one day I healed and it went away but I had this ball of guilt and shame that would not go away so sometimes depression is not just depression sometimes it's guilt and it's shame for things that you may have done or things that you were never forgiven for or for things that you were falsely accused of it doesn't matter but shame can present itself as depression",

I'm not him, but I have a story about the time I thought I went crazy in sixth grade. Okay, so it's right after lunch. And after lunch every day, you had to go into this courtyard that was built into the middle of the school, like, cause the lunchroom was in the basement. And you would go out into this courtyard, right? And then there was this alleyway that went out to the general public, okay? And if you didn't find a group of kids to talk to, you're kind of out skirts. You'd be alone, either, like on a wall or something. But I went and I hung out in that little alleyway, okay? I was all alone, all right? And I turn to my right, and this little white face with black marks all over it is looking at me and just goes. And I'm like, what the heck is that? And it was a clown, right? Like Cirque du Soleil type clown. Then they start clowning, doing all these little weird dances, going side to side, disappearing, okay? Doing like the whole like, oh, I'm gonna go down to the basement, okay? Type deal. And then I yell, guys! Clowns! And everyone turns and there's nothing there. I thought I lost my freaking mind. So I go to the nurse's office and like, hey, I think my medications off I think I'm hallucinating. I'm seeing clowns, and they're like, oh, sweetie, you're not losing your mind. There's gonna be a little assembly later, and they got, like, circus olay clowns, so, yeah, you can go back to class. You didn't lose your mind. They're fucking with me. Stupid clowns.",

I grew up with a lesbian mum who was very honest with me about everything. Obviously, I knew her point of view. I knew why she didn't tell him. Growing up, I never really questioned it. Um, I had no interest in the subject, really, which I got a lot of shit for, especially from adults. Things changed around the time that I was 24 (23*) years old. I was at uni, I was finishing up my degree, and I had to do a final project, um, for my theatre degree. And I thought, what's better time than now? I've got some funds, um, I can make it into story. And I guess that was my way of coping with it. So when I was 24, I went to find him. I had my filmmaker friend with me, and as I was there, I created an online performance, I called it. So I was vlogging, I was blogging, I was live streaming, and people were watching me live try and find my father. So not only did I find my father, I was being graded as I was in the process of doing so. Even though things didn't work out well, I still have a lot to look back on. I've got all that material. Um, I eventually made it into a stage show. Um, this was years ago. I'm 31 now. Um, I think I was 24 back then. I did see my father again on another trip after that. Um, I no longer speak to him. We don't speak. He doesn't speak to me. Um, neither does the family over there. And, uh. Yeah, that's how things are. Even if I wanted a different outcome, I don't regret it.",

    "voice_to_text": "give me the tea what's the drama what's happening in your life I wanna know  okay Janet I got you I got some tea I got some drama buckle up though okay my name is Dom I'm an astrocartographer here on TikTok I hope you all find your best locations for moving and or travelling according to your astrology right well we're in the process of moving if you can't tell by the tape noises coming from the kitchen we reserved a budget truck rental like three months ago okay here's the receipts now since making the reservation I felt like something was going to happen and so did my wife okay so we see the email last night and the date has changed we have to leave the 28th the movers are coming on the 28th right they moved the reservation to 11:00am on the 28th when originally it was reserved for the 27th at 11:00am a day before so first thing this morning I'm calling I'm like what happened and why did this happen and how are we rectifying the problem because I'm locked into a certain price point I'm good to go in my mind okay and I swear I spoke to like a million not actually I'm a Sagittarius let me exaggerate a little bit but at least five budget employees and they're all like sorry it's a busy weekend we don't have anything else for you and eh the system didn't recognise that that was a holiday so it has to be the 28th so I walk myself into location where I was supposed to pick up the truck and I'm like how did this happen can you do anything she also winds up speaking to like the dispatch person and like literally so rude like the guys like let me guess you have so and so there and I'm like and she makes the comment well even if you had come on the 28th at 11:00am there would have been a truck for you anyway so I don't know why they moved it to this time because I guess it was just some good faith and wishes that there was gonna be a truck here so I'm like I don't know what I'm gonna do like I have delusional Sagittarius optimism delusional I can always find the lesson or say this is happening for a reason sometimes to like a Looney Tunes amount and degree okay but I was I was starting to lose a little hope on this I was I called Penske 5 thousand dollars for a rental truck 5,000 so what I Learned was Penske wants money they don't care about their customers because last year when I needed a Penske truck great company last year I got one for pretty cheap actually cause they needed trucks at a certain location and well just worked out that way super lucky I speak to out of my 2 3 calls to penskee one employee who goes well can you drive to Nebraska can I drive to Nebraska I have to move in two days do you think I can drive to Nebraska for a truck that's like almost three grand no I can't drive to Nebraska and then I speak to U Haul now don't get me wrong I know people rag on U Haul okay and this isn't sponsored but U Haul after you hear this if you wanna set something up I'm totally here for it I call you all like I see they have availability and I call certain location this man was sent from the angels like my little angels sent this man his name is Aaron okay I love him and he goes I will price match whatever budget told you because this is such a terrible situation just come in and I'll see what I can do I'm like cool I get back in the car okay and I go over to U Haul where I also meet Veronica who is awesome and within 30 minutes the man price matches what budget drop the ball on and would not fix or help me with and I go to pick up the truck with my wife it was insane absolutely insane that's when I Learned U Haul values the customer they actually cared they cared that I was on my last leg like having a mental breakdown and wasn't gonna be able to do this cross country move like we have the mover set up in both locations the cleaners okay the hotels that you can't just like rearrange all of that so the point of this is screw budget don't look with them because chances are we've read this on Reddit 50% of the time they're not gonna have your truck okay henski you're greedy okay this whole we can't price match in Colorado thing you could you could have you could have made an exception you could have don't understand and you all you are the heroes Aaron and Veronica at Long Mount Storage I wanted to drop that here for anyone who might be within the area in Colorado amazing and you can get all your your supplies there too if you don't wanna go to The Home Depot I didn't know that until it was too late but that's for another time astralchographically speaking I understand why this happened and I should have looked into it ahead of time I should have it seemed like something that I I I shouldn't have to think about but clearly I should have because the budget area was affected by my Pluto and moon which have creates a lot of instability because they're both water so I should have known better and my wife's Mars and we've Learned Mars is just as chaotic and unpredictable unfortunately with the local space and long mile storage is closer to my wife's Venus which has a lucky aspect and effect and it's very protective and beneficial and is a little bit more neutral on mine it's just more so specifically moon which isn't as terrible as Pluto and moon because I did feel like I forged like a genuine emotional connection with these beautiful souls and I'm so for the rest of my life will be grateful to them so why am I even telling you this because if you're moving right now a lot of people are please for the for the love of all that is holy go with you all okay they actually care about you they genuinely do and the other two they really don't so I hope this story help somebody and my frustration and anger from the day and however many people I yelled at I hope this goes viral um I just hope this helps someone because that should never happen to anybody like do better you don't set people up to fail when they're about to do a cross country move you just don't",

    "voice_to_text": "so I'm gonna roll some cigarettes and tell you about one of the saddest dreams that I've ever had that I thought was real uh when I woke up and then after thinking about it more uh wished it was and then wished it wasn't and now I still don't freaking know uh it breaks a little bit from the spirit of this because I know it didn't happen but here we are so when I was like a few years back I had this dream where I was I'm rolling cigarettes I was going to the hospital to visit a friend who had had a surgery done or something and I was the ride home so I had to like spend some time I had to show up with them at the hospital to prove I was real and I had to uh just kill some time until the surgery was over which could take a while so I'm just wandering around and I go into like I think like I might as well do something good with my time so I go to the children's cancer ward that happens to be at the hospital we went to and I see this kid who's getting chemo and he's just there alone all the other kids have like their families with them and everything with this kid is sitting there alone so I just sat down started talking to him I started asking him about like this toy* car I had he couldn't really play with it because he was all like wired up and he is just like very somber but like also very much a kid he has answers to all my questions he's enthusiastic but his energy levels just tanked and I'm just like chatting with him and I'm just like oh this is awful and I'm like uh I end up like getting up as he's getting like unhooked up and everything and I started talking to who I find out is his social worker and I find out that this is this kid's name is Tommy and he was he had leukemia and my time there was like the only visitor he has had outside of like the system in a really long time um basically now because he's under special medical custodianship he's basically like  living in the hospital and he's being like watched by doctors and nurses and like all these in this like sterile environment and like his social worker keeps trying to do what she can but the best she can do is get money for his treatments and petition fruitlessly for potential guardians but nobody wants to take care of a cancer kid so he just ends up like being stuck there without any help or support or guidance and I'm just like holy shit like when can I come back and so I start coming back and seeing Tommy and like I have these like incredible like real time dreams sometimes so I like leave I have like my own life I come back like a couple days later and like I hang out with him and like we're playing with this toys and we're talking he's like still not feeling great because the chemo really like took it out of him for like a few days uh he gets up to throw up a couple of times he's like bald as Mr Clean and I am just like there like I'm just hanging out I'm a little awkward but like I like this kid doesn't have anyone and I just feel fucking awful because I had so much free time at the in those days so I was just there like hanging out with them and I just kept going back I just kept going back and I just like my heart was breaking every single time and I start to realize that like I I've always wanted to be a mom and then I realized that I couldn't uh for a number of reasons and like you know some of which being my mental health some of them being my physical health some of them being just the physical inability for me to have a child and like then there's just my like poverty but then and those moments like when I was spending all that time with Tommy I realized that like he didn't he shouldn't have been alone um he didn't fucking deserve that so and and like I I knew that I I didn't have enough in my life but for myself but I could for him and I start talking to my family I start like looking for a better job I like find my own place that I can afford that's got an extra room I have become friends with the social worker she like put some good words for me like I'm going through like the paperwork finding all the fees like I'm getting somebody to help me like fill it all out I'm like going through all of these steps I'm not telling Tommy any of it because I don't want his get his hopes up and I figure I would wait until it was an actual viable option that he could actually like come home to a family even if it's just me and my cat so speak of the devil once I end up like finally getting everything together I have one last visit with Tommy before I have to go sign all the paperwork in front of a judge or whatever and like I tell him like Tommy I'll I'm sorry I can't stay very long this time but I'm gonna be coming back uh tomorrow and I've got some great news for you so I go home I um I do everything I'm supposed to do I um I signed everything and then I came back the next day and they were cleaning up his room because he he passed away like right before I would have been able to take him out I know he wasn't real I woke up just fu  ing sobbing but like I don't really have anything else I can say I don't know where that dream came from I don't know why I had it it felt like it taken place over the course of months like I remember all of it he was 5 years old I feel like I could have been a good mom I know in reality there's no way but like it just didn't feel like any of it was like worth it anymore like I spent all this time bettering myself like for this kid but uh when I woke up like it felt like my life didn't have meaning anymore and it took a sec like maybe like a day I don't know like I still remember the whole dream um before I felt like I like knew that I was living a life for myself and I had a life with my cat and I had friends and I had all these things that were real that had actually happened that I was taking care of and like were priorities for me and that this like dream that was like probably less than like a few hours knowing remcycles that had like created this new reality for me like could not like replace that in any way fk there have been few things in my actual life that were that painful so this is a very different vibe than my other dream but both of them were about as real and like this one was much longer and much brighter and also so much darker and I don't know how long it's gonna stick with me I had this dream like three years ago and every now and then I bring it up almost as like a joke or whatever but then when I tell people the whole story like this like it's hard for me not to cry and I fail to understand how I can have this depth of emotion for a character in a story that my subconscious mind came up with I know this dream wasn't real but it feels real so I think it kind of fits into this prompt here",

    "voice_to_text": "Give me the tea. What's the drama? Absolutely. So my parents got separated in November of 2021. And at that point, my mom went and kind of did her own thing, lived with us for a while, then ended up moving out. But me and my dad were in my house like normal. And at one point, my dad looked at me and said, hey, would you mind if I started dating? And I go, no, that wouldn't bother me at all. I want you to be happy. As one would. So he started dating, and the trend was concerning. The trend was half is his age, so it was okay. For a little while. He was kind of dating, playing around. And then I started coming home to specifically Korean women in my house, and different ones every couple weeks. So he had this one girlfriend for a while. She was here illegally. 37, he's 55 at this point, and had two kids. And within six months of them dating, he's like, we're getting married. And I'm like, okay, probably not. You probably shouldn't do that. And by around January, he's like, okay, I don't think she's attracted to me. And, like, maybe she's using you for your money, for citizenship, so. And stuff with that lady. I go on a weekend trip, come back, he goes, we broke up, but I have a new girlfriend now. What do you mean? So I kind of don't see her. Don't Know who she is. For a while, I'm kind of taken aback by the whole situation. Obviously a little uncomfortable. Um, but this one's, like, looks a lot younger, and I'm like, okay, so this is, like, a year, a little over a year ago. January, February. And the months go on. She comes over a couple times, but he's spending weekends away in, like, Orange County, which is, like, two hours away. And eventually, summer comes around, I graduate high school, and things are getting suspicious. And I talked to my mom, who has a boyfriend at this point, and he's cool or cool. And I talked to my mom, like, I'm worried that he's thinking about getting married again, because obviously, it happened really quick the last time. And she's like, I'm suspicious. They already are. I go, oh, without telling me? Without telling his only child. And so I look through his office, I snoop through his office, and I find, like, a documents, like, in a folder from, like, some department. And first thing I see is, oh, she's 23. She is five years older than me. He's 56, she's 23, and they're married.",

I hope you're prepared, because the competition is on. Baby Girl, you slayed in the editing department. But I promise, what I don't have an editing, I make up for in flavor. Are you ready? I think I found a new target, and my sights are set to win. In all seriousness, though, I love that you made a response to my video. I definitely think you might have one up to me. But I'm a really sore loser, and I can't wait to see where this takes us. Put your big girl panties on, because I'm coming for you, girl. I'm coming for you. Bye.",

    "voice_to_text": "I want you to think back to 2012 and 2013 I'm avoiding my homework and I wanted to talk about where I was in 2012 because it's kind of mind boggling to think about this like 12 year cycle that the astrology girlies are talking about because wow in 2012 I had graduated from college in 2010 it took me until mid 2012 early 2012 to be able to move out on my own uh I had finally gotten a job in early 2011 uh but I had still been living with my mom um and I finally got up the courage to leave and to finally be like no I am starting out on my own and again my mother and I were very enmeshed so it was like a big deal that I was leaving but I digress anyway 2012 March of 2012 I am turning 24 um and I moved to this tiny little apartment in East Boston and you guys it was so weird and like kind of it was definitely like shouldn't have been an apartment I was getting ripped off but it was fine uh I lived there from March and April and in June of that year I remember I went to go visit my friend Tracy who lives out on the West Coast who lives in LA and I had never been to LA so I went and I flew out to visit Tracy at the beginning of June so exactly 12 years ago to like right now I and when I came back I had bed bugs and because I knew that this place this apartment that I lived in was like for sure the reason why I had bed bugs I was just like I gotta move I gotta go like if you've not had bed bugs count yourself lucky because it is one of the most traumatizing ridiculous things that I have ever experienced I still have feelings um anyway my landlord was horrible and because the because he was like well you probably brought them back from your trip and I was like mmm honey no like I the this is probably just been building up I don't know whatever it was a mess he refused to pay for the extermination so I had to pay out of pocket to get somebody to come in and do like the heat treatment because it's the only thing that you can do to get bed bugs out I don't know it was insane um I was miserable that was the time I first started taking any kind of anti anxiety medication because I was a wreck so that was in June of 2012 I immediately moved out of that apartment and moved back in with my mother then had to kind of commute back and forth into Boston for work from like suburbs of Boston where my mom was living at the time and it was just miserable finally in September of 2012 my best friend from college Brian had an open room in his apartment in Cambridge Somerville area and I was like sure like I'm gonna move in so I moved into this teeny tiny room but I was so happy because I was away from my mom I was on my own again sort of even though I had roommates like I just felt like okay I can breathe again and then October is when I met my ex and we were together for almost nine years so like the trajectory of 2012 being summer trip to California bed bugs after like leaving home and having my own apartment and then going into this new complete new phase of life where I was in a couple for the first time in my life like the things that have happened since then the domino effect of that moment in time from June of 2012 is mind blowing to me and I just can feel like I feel like we're at that time again like I am such a different person than I was in 2012 and I think it's interesting that I'm turning I turned 36 this year because it's the completion of three 12 year cycles right uh I don't know I just it really got me thinking and excited for this like next 12 year cycle because I really do in my heart believe that like this year for me is that catalyst for this next 12 year cycle and looking back at what the catalyst was for that last 12 year cycle it's just it's so interesting so I don't know I rambled a lot but again I'm avoiding my homework so here we are",

I'm only 15 years old. I'm probably 14 when this happened, though. So, like, I'm over here trying my hardest to stay awake, but, like, brother, the librarian that's talking about the book, she sound like that dude from, um, what's it called? Charlie Brown? Just straight yapping. Like, she's like. She's like, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. So then I finally, like, my head finally hit the same, bro.

Like, we were just hanging out because at the time, I didn't have a car, and I wanted to go places and hang out with people. We're sitting in the car on the way to the movies. You know, I feel like it's very common for men and women to hang out and be friends and not be romantically interested in each other whatsoever. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. So we're going to. On our way to the movies, and this man goes. He looks at me and he's like, you know, I could never date you or bring you home to my parents. Like, okay, this is it. A date. He was like, yeah, because you're black. No. This man was not even 30 yet, almost balding, and I'm not interested in you, my guy. Like, how dare you? I never hung out with him again.",

This is the second video I'm gonna make, and hopefully the last one, because I've told a lot of really weird lies when I was younger, but this one is probably the one that almost got me in, like, actual serious trouble, like, with the law. So, yeah. Let me tell you about when I was about 6 or 7, my family rented a house on the Jersey Shore for a little bit. And, you know, this house had a lot of, like, toys and things. So I was looking around, and I found a fake gun. Okay? This fake gun was extremely realistic looking, like it was one of those old fashioned ones, you know what I mean? And basically, I decided, let me play with this in the front lawn. So I did. I was playing with it in the front lawn and, you know, just being a kid. And this is where it gets fun. So apparently somebody had called the cops on me. I was inside my house. I mean, it wasn't my house, but I was inside the house at that point. And we get it. There was a knock at the door. It was the police, okay? And we were like, we had reports of a kid playing with a gun. Actually, we had, like, six reports. Like, it was so bad. And My sister was there. She's like, four at this point, okay? Gave about. She's like four or something, okay? And I, like, my parents looked at me first, okay? And I just went. I pointed out my sister, and my sister was the one who got interviewed by the cop. And I never told them until, like, years later, I finally told them. And we laugh about it to this day.",

My sisters didn't even tell me they found out it was happening, and they, like, secretly, like, went in and, like, handled it. But, yeah, that happened.

Story time on how the guy was talking to got caught up because his ex now said, girlfriend saw my TikTok. This is for you, boo. My number one. You thought this wasn't going as a story time? Let me make this video as big as your apology should have been. Okay? Thank you. And, oh, girl, I ain't got no beef with you. Swear to God, Bible, no beef, pinky. So y'all met old boy on a random day, right? Chop it up. He get my number, I get his number. Now we talking about some. Okay, let's go on our first date. Next day, we go on the first date, right? Go mini golfing, having a great time. We chemistry is bonding, right? Boom! Skis. After the first day, I ended up going to his house the first night. Didn't do nothing, but ended up being over there for the next some consecutive three to four days. Mind you, my idea was not to go over there. That was his idea. So I'm saying, like, I ain't no little twat. Oh, god. Like, if you got me coming over here, I'm just gonna chill. We can be chilling. We gonna be vibing. And that's what we did. Chilled vibe. Went on multiple dates, went out, did whatever we do as people that do that. Talk. Then he Got towards the end of the week, and then his family came in town. So I went away for two days, back to my house, came back two days after that. My job. While his family's in town, I'm still seeing him. Like, we see each other every day. So I come back, spend the night. Next morning, he goes to bring his family to the airport, right? So he come back or whatever, and he just start giggling, like, out of nowhere. And I'm trying to figure out, like, why is this nigga giggling? This nigga talking about. Somehow his ex saw my TikTok and recognize the background. I said, oh, okay. Well, I mean, like, I don't get what the problem is. My job. Him and his ex have been together. Were together for four years. I know. I should have ran. I should have ran. I know, I know, I know, I know. I should have ran, y'all. But listen, this nigga was giving too much green flag. I couldn't just leave. So as we sitting there, I'm asking questions about her like this. I didn't like, what did she say on the phone? Look. Look. Like what was said? He get a call from a number I never seen pop up on your phone before. She talking about some, let me get my earrings back. What was said to me that she said on the phone. So at this point in time, I'm there, she's downstairs, Called him, asked him to come downstairs. Okay, part two.",

And every day I would just sit outside and watch the hummingbirds for hours. At one point, I had this genius thought in my mind that, um, I should try to get really close to the hummingbirds. Maybe I could get so close that, like, one would, like, land on my finger or let me pet it or whatever. I was a kid, so I had unrealistic standards. And apparently, I wished I was Snow White. So, anyway, so I started, like, all the way at the end of the house. And just, like, as the time went by and the hummingbird was sitting at the theater, I would literally just, like, inch my way closer and closer and closer to the feeder. And eventually, of course, the hummingbirds would get scared and fly away. Well, one time, I ended up getting so close, I was directly underneath the hummingbird feeder, and the hummingbird was on the hummingbird feeder. And at this point, I cannot make this shit up. I swear to god, like, something's wrong with my life. But I look up at the hummingbird, and the hummingbird pees in my eye. Yep. Hummingbird peed in my eye, and then it flew away. So, yeah. Moral of the story. Um, don't try to sneak up on a hummingbird. Or you might get peed on in your eyeball",

I am a firm believer that everything does happen for a reason, and even tragic events like that. Because maybe not on this time. Their time, their body. Because don't forget, when you pass away, your soul will just go into another body. That person that time they were over with, with somebody else that just got born or somebody else that just got reborn. It went to their body, and they have to live their life now. You're probably like, yo, this dude is fucking crazy. But, no, it's the fucking truth. You never wondered why you meet people and they feel like, oh, my god, they feel like home, or, oh, my god, I've known you before. Oh, man. This end up because y'all met each other in the past life, meeting each other again in this life. It don't even gotta be, like, in, like, a love version. This could be any type of form of relationship or any type of form of bonding with a certain theme. You never caught yourself so fascinated with something you never seen before, but you know you want it. That's because you lifted before. Let me know if you want a part three.",

When I passed away for that short amount of time, I remember crying just like that, trying to go back into my body. And wherever I was at, it stink. So I'm not saying I was in hell. I didn't see no gate to fire, but it was like a long, sandy road. And I never really believed in god, you know, because the stuff that I was going through at the time, you know. But I remember feeling so lost and so, like, weird. But I remember just crying and crying because I was like, man, I didn't get to see my son. Till this day, I don't even have a son. For what reason I said that, I don't know. But I remember telling god, you know, if I gotta stay here, then I gotta stay here. Some punch me, my sternum bow right back into my body. And the ambulance like, yo, he's alive! He's alive! He's alive! But what I'm getting at about this video is that that person might be crying because they don't know that they passed away yet. That's why they said if you pass and you sleep, you passed away the most peaceful way. But when you pass away unexpectedly like that, you will have to come back and live the same life and pick up where you left off. To your close",

    "voice_to_text": "What is the lie that you told as a kid that was so bad that you thought your childhood was over? Okay, so I was, like, in first or second grade, I think, when this happened. And I was out at recess at school, and I was crying about something, cause I think some, like, girls in the class were, like, being mean to me or teasing me about something. And so I was crying, like, at the playset. And, like, my friends came over and they were like, oh, my God, Kennedy, what's wrong? Why are you crying? Like, is everything okay? Okay. And I was, like, super embarrassed to be crying at school. So instead of just being like, oh, I'm crying cause some kids are mean to me, I went and told them that I was crying because my dad was in a horrible car crash the night before and broke all the bones in his body. Because, you know, that makes sense. So they were like, oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Like, I hope he's okay. And I was like, yeah, I'm just, like, really upset about it, you know? So then, like, fast forward to, like, later that night. I'm at home with my parents, and I'm sitting in our living room. My dad, who's obviously fine, is, like, doing the laundry, like, ironing or whatever. My mom sitting in the living room with us, and our phone rings. And so my mom goes, Answers the phone, like, whatever. I'm just sitting there watching TV, and I just hear her go, like, hey, what's going on? And no, no, everything's fine. You heard what? And I'm, like, looking over at her some, like, oh, god. Like, am I about to get in trouble? And I hear this. No, Jordan's fine. He's standing here doing the laundry right now. And then I'm like, okay, this. It's happening. Like, we found out. So I'm, like, slinking slowly off the couch to, like, be as discreet as possible before I go, like, run upstairs to my room. And my mom just, like, looks over at me, and she's like, she said what? And so I'm like, okay, we're done here. And she's like, no, everything's fine. I'll talk to you later. So she hangs up. I book it for my room, and all I can hear is Kennedy Elizabeth. And, yeah, that, I think, was probably, like, the worst lie that I ever told when I was little. And then after that, my friends never believed me about anything. I vividly remember being in show and tell the next year, and I was so excited because my mom was pregnant at the time with my baby brother. And for show and tell, I brought, like, his ultrasound, and I was like, oh, yeah, my mom's pregnant. This is my baby brother. And, like, one of my friends was like, I don't believe you. Like, how could I Trust you? After that lie you told about your father? So I was like, you know, my little, like, proof of ultrasound, like. Okay, sorry.",

We would get notifications like this from the rocking chair moving in her room around one a m. And one day it happened like three times in a row. And we would always watch the monitor and never felt evil. None of, like, my mom intuition was going off. There were no red flags. It was always just this subtle little movement in the rocking chair. But she would sit up in her crib and she would look over at the rocking chair. And sometimes she would wave, or sometimes she'd have, like, a little giggle. And then she would lay back down and go to sleep. One night she wakes up and we noticed that she wakes up. She sits up very peacefully, and she grabs her blanket. She's like, almost playing peekaboo. And the rocking chairs moving. And she's looking at the rocking chair, and out of nowhere she just starts singing Happy Birthday and, like, clapping her hands and singing Happy Birthday. The next day, I double checked, and it was my grandfather's birthday two days later. So I was sure that it was him. And it's still kind Of freaks me out, but it's also kind of cool.",

So I was freshly single, um, just got out of a domestic violence, super toxic relationship. So I was definitely not in a rush to get in a relationship. I was having my options open and I was just doing me at the time. I met a guy, he slid my inbox and, you know, I was under the impression that he was a good guy, a hard working man, a single father of one. And long story short, I end up getting pregnant by him. So it's like, soon as I told him I was pregnant, it was like, lights on, lights off. He started giving me cold shoulder and treating me all weird. Like, what? I ain't got no kids before this child, by the way. So I just noticed, like, a drastic change in him, right? So fast forward. Midway through my pregnancy, one of my friends peaked this girl story and she posted him on her story. Mind you, she's pregnant too, and she have the little dirt song. It's all love playing and posting all these pictures of him. Fast forward again. I look at her bio. The initials of her future baby has his same last name, the initial. Fast forward again. We praying about the same man. This is midway through my pregnancy, by the way. And not only that, I end up calling the Girl, to, like, put stuff together. She confirmed that she's pregnant by him, and she told me that he's married on top of that. Y'all let me know if y'all want a part 2, cause they get even more juicy than this, I swear.",

hated you moment but like but I'm pretty sure she hated when anyone paid me any attention when we were younger she would be really promiscuous and act like she was like putting out all the time even though she wasn't when we got older it would be like her showing her boobs to everybody and when she became a mom she started breastfeeding right she would often just like spray people in the middle of bars with her tiddie milk like you know what I'm saying if a guy would try to talk to me when we were adults and I was still single she would tell them the story of how she put a gobstopper up my nose when we were like 10 years old one time we got kicked out of an exotic dance club because she was trying to steal all the attention from the dancers but the time that's most prominent in my mind is this one time it was the last real interaction we had together yes we were friends for way too fuqqn long since we were 8 years old till we were in our mid 20s I've since unlearned and I'm so much better now but I'm just saying it took a long time but I finally made it there obviously we've already graduated high school she's moved away got married started family I've gotten married started family whatever she went on to have several children and was far away from us all the time but would visit in the summer here in Texas I actually got a pretty decent job in finance which turned out to be a horrible horrible place to work and I started my band before the rona took over everything I was trying to make a name for myself with my beautiful grunge band I was the lead singer of she used to talk shit about my dreams she used to talk shit about the fact that I was spending so much time with my band she would tell me that I posted too much on social media now look at me you know anyway so this is the time when my band was still going strong and before the rona she was home for the summer and it was close to her birthday so we were all out having a birthday Celebration for I myself was already deep in my own unlearning journey so I was just like I don't know how to end this friendship but i'mma do it soon you know what I mean because she was awful and i'mma tell you why so along with having a band I was also a fucking karaoke queen okay before I met Slappa (hubz) I was doing karaoke like five or six days a week okay because I was such a karaoke queen and I am me I made friends with a lot of people a lot of acquaintances a lot of bar managers so that I could probably get my band into these places to play right and all those people knew without a shadow of a doubt that I had pipes okay so she's having her birthday at this one place and I need to make contact with the manager anyway it's been a long time since I've talked to him last time I saw that dude he told me that he was going through some hard times and just drove his (ford) raptor through his garage door so I wanted to see how he was and also get my fucking foot in the door right so I meet her there there's a lot of our old friends there from high school I see someone that I've shared the stage with so I walk over and I'm like hey dude how are you how are you doing today we're getting caught up we're telling stories we're talking about upcoming shows maybe talking about collabing because we both like each other's voices and then here she comes hey you are so black did you know you're black hey did you know she was black did you know you're talking to a black person so my fellow musician is just like and he fucking nopes tf outta there he was like I'm not gonna be a part of this okay but she's like yelling so the manager comes out the same manager that I was about to talk to about having my band play there and he's like yo yo yo wtf is going on and he looks at me because we have a past history so I'm just like hey I I don't know but if you need me to I will definitely like pay my tab and we can just gtfo if you need me to he was like no no no you're good you're good but keep an eye on that you know what I'm saying I was like so done cleaning up her messes keeping her safe all the time when she always caused me harm I knew she was safe I knew she had people around her and she was safe but I was fucking done so I paid my tab and I walked tf out and she did not call me I unfriended her all over everything waiting for her to message me call me talk to me anything nothing years go by she shoots me a message in like 2017 2018 kinda time frame she's like oh my gosh you look great I see you're really successful on social media that same social media that she used to talk shit to me about I was still rolling successful with my band at that time because it was before Rona she was like oh my gosh your dad would be so proud of you and I was just like how fucking you fucking you you don't get to bring up my dad okay I was pissed but all I said to her was like thanks for reaching out bye and then I fucking blocked her like I should have all those years ago she never wanted to see me successful and I wasn't gonna let her into my life now that I was so fuck her and fuck all those people like that ha ha",

And let me tell you why. And one long message, no pauses in between. Only because I remember it in such great detail. Let me tell you about a time that a black person brought an animal to an event, and it ruined the whole thing, all right? So, boom. Look, I remember going to a funeral when I was a little bit younger, right? I said a little bit as if I wasn't a whole toddler. But anyway, that seems to hear nor there. So I do remember one of the rules that they had was for, like, the first 20 minutes or something, there wasn't gonna be any children or any animals or anything like that. Just family members and very, very, very close friends are gonna go in, look at body, do some things, whatever. I don't know what it was. I do remember me and some other kids were sitting in the back, and we had this one relative. It was, like, honor something. Uh, she had brought her dog because her and her dog, my aunt, she had, like, depression, some other stuff, but basically, this was a service animal, so she had to bring this dog in with her. This dog was very well known for being misbehaving. Like, you couldn't take Him to any family functions whatsoever. If you had a cookout, he taking plates off the table. If you had a wedding, this man was over here biting gowns, humping bridesmaids, like, just out of control stuff. He was a level 10 crash out for sure. But anyway, they get in there, and by the time it gets to her turn, she goes up, and she's looking down at this older person that all of us so much admired and loved, and we miss. There was people boohorn in the first three rows and everything. And she did not have a leash on this dog. This dog was just free roaming around. So she goes, she sits in her seat, and what do you know, she's looking around. Where is. I'm. I don't remember the dog's name, so we're gonna call him scrappy. She's just like, where is scrappy? Scrappy? Oh, my god. I've lost my dog. I'm scared. Scrappy was a Belgian Malinois. He decided to jump into the casket unnoticed. Nobody saw this happen. I don't know how. Jumped into the casket. Laid in the casket, bro. Went down to where the feet were in the casket. I do remember at one point, they shut the casket, so they. We didn't. Drove all. All the way to the burial site and everything. This dog didn't make a pee wee. They over here giving words and whatever they do at the end before they bury the body, and somebody Hears a bark inside the casket. They open up the casket, and scrappy is licking somebody dead Grandpa in the face. Yeah. So scrappy licking his man on the face, and everybody pulls him out, and they're getting mad at her like, we told you not to bring any pets. And I'm like, uh, technically, you can't stop him. He's undefeated. He's a ruthless person. But, yeah, um, white people aren't the only ones that do it. It's everybody.",

    "voice_to_text": "Girl, where do I start? I had this relationship for about two years, give or take. And me and god was tussling the entire relationship, like, from start to finish. Like, god was telling me, bitch, you need to stop fucking with this motherfucker. And I just didn't listen. And of course, I can't blame anybody but myself. Accountability is key. But anyways, I had this relationship where shit was rocky from the beginning. And I'm talking about things that just didn't make sense. Like, this person, I'm responding, me getting upset, and then just, like, constantly trying to turn it on me phone, constantly on D&D when. When we were together, like, just a lot of weird shit. And also, they didn't post me on social media. Should. A big, big red flag right there. Person cheated on me right around my birthday, went on a whole trip with somebody else. Like, god really was beating my ass in this relationship, I swear to you. So after we broke up, we took about 4 months without talking. Like, I went no contact completely. And, you know, I fell into my temptations of wanting to be toxic. So, of course, I fell in my. Meanwhile, they never stopped hitting me up. I fell into their trap for the last time, and we started talking. Months later, we ended up going on a trip together. Mind you, we were with my family. Like, my family to them. Like, we was broken. Up, which we was. But then I popped up to this family vacation with this motherfucker, and everybody was like, okay, we gonna mind our business. They ain't question me or nothing. One thing about my family is they always support me. And that's. That's a toxic trait of this, because sometimes just don't support me, you gotta slap me upside my head. But besides that. So we went on this trip together, and, you know, we were sleeping in the same bed, in the same room, whatever. And this said person, this was around when monkey pox was out. And at the time, the amount of knowledge we had was that it was a sexually transmitted thing. You know, that disease that came from monkeys that they get. You get blisters and it's itchy or whatever. Yeah, well, towards the end of the relationship, this girl was getting, like, blistered things, and she kept saying that it was itchy. I thought it was mosquito bites. Like, I didn't believe in that. She. She couldn't sleep, like, the last night cause she's like, oh, my god, I have, uh, monkey pox. And I'm like, girl, no, you don't. Go to hell. And it's like, she was so mad that I didn't believe her. But it's like, girl, I've been sleeping in the same bed as you every day, and I don't have shit. What the fuck is wrong with you? Those are mosquito bites. Fast forward when we land in New York, this girl goes to get tested. Was it not monkey pox? Like when I tell you, when I read that text, my jaw dropped. That was God's way. Like, all right, bitch, you won't wake up, or i'mma make you wake up, cause Lord.",

I think they call it bandos nowadays, but it's basically a house where drug users go to do drug using stuff. And we cleaned out so that we had somewhere to chill. Listen, before you judge, I grew up in Cheetah Mill, right? And when I was a teenager, we didn't have money and we didn't have smartphones. We just went to chill. It was raining really bad. We found an abandoned house, we thought, let's go in, see what's happening. And it went pretty silent, let me tell you. Honestly, it was an absolute health and safety hazard. Like now, as an adult and a parent, I just think, why? Why? There was used needles everywhere. There was quite possibly human feces. There was all sorts. There was all sorts. Those places that the rappers rap about nowadays. Damn. We kept it classy though. We put our little bit of pocket money together that we had. We went to the pound shop, we bought brushes, we bought bags, we bought cleaning stuff and we made that crack house into a homely crack house. Would we come back the next day to more needles? Yes, we would. Would we clean it back up? Yes, we would. And this is why I need counselling",

I was obviously very mad about this, and I confided with one of my close teachers, and I told her about him calling me the N word and how it's, like, making me upset. She ended up going to the AP and telling the AP on me, afraid that I was going to do something to the boy. So I got in trouble, not the boy. Moving on. We graduate high school, I thought I would never see that boy again. One day, I opened my apartment door. The dude is in my kitchen. Jordan was in my kitchen. I was just frozen. I couldn't do anything. I'm a speechless, like, what is this dude doing here? It was literally like my nightmare. Was in my kitchen. When he saw me, he wanted to give me a hug. He's a crystal high. He apparently became friends with my roommate, and that's why he was in my kitchen. I was literally shocked and speechless, and only thing I could say was, like, get out of my apartment. Some time goes by, and he's, like, hanging out more with my roommate. And then later on, he confesses to my roommate that he's in love with me. He tells my roommate that he thinks I'm also in love with him because I'm Always so mean to him. He thinks I'm just playing what's not clicking, Rick? Long story short, he ended up disappearing. I think that boy had a chemical imbalance. I'm not even playing. And I ended up getting my lick back on that high school teacher. Don't worry. But that's for another video.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I actually have a really weird two part story for this one first I remember being I don't know maybe three or four about toddler age and I do have memories that go all the way back to me being like 18 months old and I think that's because I was always being yelled at and and so like traumatized from that that it just all these things stuck with me and I was playing something in some corner of the house and I brought my mom a paper and I'm like hey I need a drawing of a boy and in my three or four year old brain I wanted like a stick figure with pants on it I that that's what I wanted I don't know what exactly I was playing but I know I needed the drawing of a boy and I was expecting a really simple drawing of a boy and so my mom starts drawing this sort of hyper realistic full body picture of a boy and I just looked over and in my toddler brain I'm like that's not what I was asking for and so I I was like that's supposed to be a boy and I I remember this so clearly like she drew half the head she drew like the arms with all the little curves on it down the body she was on the foot when I said that and she crumpled up the paper threw it across the room slammed the pencil down on the table and told me to fuck off again like three or four years old then with my dad there are so many things I remember he was watching something on TV I was probably eight to ten years old at that point and it was this Native American woman and she was spinning around chanting and it just looked so ridiculous to me as a kid like I started hysterically laughing and that made him so mad to be laughing at whatever you know dumb little show he was watching music video whatever it was that he marched up the stairs to my room turned my TV that was like inside my closet around and ripped the cords out of it I remember slamming the truck door shut one time and I didn't mean to slam it it was like we were on an angle and I tried to close it normal but it slammed got my head chopped off for that he forgot to pick me up at school one day and so the school wouldn't let me cross the street by myself to go home and walk home in the second grade and so he comes driving down the alley after everybody's left the school and I have to like run across in the alley and I'm like creeping through looking behind my back like you know are the are the principal police coming after me for breaking the rules and I got screamed up for that there was a time when my trash can in my room he came up to change it and the bag was dipped down um you know just on one side dipped down a little bit not like a bunch of gross stuff piled on top of it or anything cause I didn't have food or anything in my room it would have just been like paper products um from crafting or whatever and he got so mad that there was a dip in the bag and it wasn't perfectly around the edges that he kicked the trash can with all the trash in it across my room and oh my gosh there's so many I only meant to tell one story but my favorite one of his tantrums was when I borrowed his Scissors and again I was probably around 8 to 10 years old at this point and I put them in the second drawer of his desk instead of the top drawer of his desk because I legitimately forgot which drawer they were in and I thought I put them in the right drawer well I don't know a day or so later I hear him muttering to himself and he would always mutter like conspiracy against me where the hell is it where did they put it where did they hide it like as an adult that's so crazy but as a kid that was my day to day life and so I ended up coming in there cause I hear him getting upset and it's my job to de escalate his emotions as a kid again 8 to 10 years old about and I'm just like oh here I can fix this really easy there in this drawer right here I open it I show him I guess that gave him a narcissistic injury and made him feel dumb for not checking any of the other drawers because instead of just being like oh thank you crisis averted or oh hey be more conscious of where you put this next time you know there were gentle ways to handle that no he decides to reach out grab that drawer that the Scissors were in rip it out of the desk and throw it across the room into the wall I was terrorized for my entire childhood and now my parents are so confused why they can't come to the wedding and it's a closed ceremony on Saturday oh my gosh as soon as I hit stop had one more go into my head about my dad so I was 10 or 11 years old I was just starting to learn how to cook for myself so excited making myself eggs and I take the skillet off of the hot coils on the stove and they they turn red when they're hot okay it's not like a secret so I take it over to the sink where all the dishes are so I can get a plate put my eggs on the plate whatever my dad walks into the kitchen with his popcorn bowl sets it onto the red hot coil coils and immediately melts the bottom of that popcorn bowl out and starts screaming at me because he didn't look at what he was doing and he also kicked my dollhouse for the same reason because he walked into my room with his head up his ass you know nose in the clouds stepped on a piece of furniture for the dollhouse that I was painting that was you know in its own little zone on the floor where you could easily see it if you were just looking at your feet in the slightest bit he steps on that breaks it so I'm already upset and he gets mad that he steps on it and kicks my dollhouse and he wonders why I hate him",

Go research foster care. You don't have an option. They give you a child, they give you money. Adoption, you have an option. You literally get to look through a book of kids and pick the fucking one you want. So the real question is, why did you pass all them white kids up and choose to have a black child, when in reality, y'all don't even like niggas? Listen into the end of his fucking video. He somehow. They don't have to. They haven't been raised in all this ignorance and stuff. Really? White people racist as fuck, yet they Learned everything from niggas. If that's not ignorance at his finest.

    "voice_to_text": "Children. I got a question. Why are there so many black children that need to be adopted? A second question is. You know what? This video is just hilarious to me cause let, let's go to the bottom line of it. When it comes to adoption, you choose the child. This is not foster care. When it comes to adoption, you literally go through a list of children and you choose your children. Okay? The problem is most of these white people who adopt young black kids have some kind of underlining fucking reason. They feel bad about what they ancestors did. They wanna raise them to be somebody other than thug. They feel like, hey, maybe if they're raised with white people, they might do better than if they raised black people. But half the time is not out the kindness of their motherfucking heart, okay? And then he goes on to say, oh well, if they love them. And something about they aren't old enough to un to do all this ignorant shit and everything else and was like, what? And then he's some awesome. He don't see color, bro. If you don't see color, why the fuck is you not picking people that look like you? I mean. And then let's not go into the fact that there's no respect for the black culture. I've seen videos yet which is funny. One today where this little boy, 14, black, and he was adopted by some white people. And they tried to tell him that he was no longer being able to play on the basketball team if he didn't cut off his hair, which he had nice little braids to the back. Talking about he looks like a thug. I don't see y'all say that to a white dude when he got his hair braided. I don't see you say that to the white girl when she got her hair braided. But soon as one of us got our hair braided, it's a problem. Just like when we go to weaves. Y'all got all this shit to say about black women wearing weaves. White women were just. Just smudge. They be wearing extensions all the time. You think this bitch got long hair? She got a Bob. Stop playing. Just because it was meant for her and you can't really tell, don't mean she not doing it. You have no respect. No respect. And you expect us to feel safe with you having our children? All them white kids at the adoption agency, you flip through all them damn books and you decide, haha, a nigga I can groom right here. Fuck out of here. I mean, I even seen a case where this lady, she had adopted all of these kids, you know, even got a few out of foster care. Raised one little, little black boys. Actually, I think he might have been the only black kid there. Raised the black boy up until he Was 16. And then she started fucking him. Told all the other kids, hey, this is your daddy now. And this has been several cases where this has happened. First off, ill secondly, take that bitch to do. And thirdly, if y'all don't see color, why is there so much motherfucking racism still in the world? You don't see color? Okay, then we the same color right? Now. Treat me as such.",

    "voice_to_text": "Owners who didn't want kids and didn't still didn't want kids. I'm gonna start by saying that somebody who's 30 and hasn't want kids since they were twelve. Age doesn't really change anything if that's not the reason you don't want kids. Secondly, I like to ask myself three questions when people ask me that question. Are they my doctor? More specifically, are they my gynecologist? And lastly, are they the person I'm procreating with? If the answer to one of these questions isn't yes, I'm not answering their fucking question. People feel really entitled to your reproductive system when you have a uterus, and it's really none of their fucking business. What if the reason you don't wanna have kids is because you're already infertile? What if the reason you don't wanna have kids is cause you were abused? The reason you don't wanna have kids is because we live in a capitalistic hellscape. The reason you don't have kids is because we don't have health care for all. What if the reason you don't have kids is you don't want them to suffer, but people don't wanna talk about that anyways. It's okay to tell those people to fuck off. I found the best thing to do is make them just as uncomfortable as they make you. Oh, and my final option, and my personal favorite, especially if they're strangers, is to tell them that I made a deal with the devil. That I give them my first Born child. And I'm certainly not gonna have a child to give to the devil. That'd be so wrong that one normally shuts them up.",

    "voice_to_text": "So today I met my first non girls girl. And yikes, that was scary. Story time. So Saturday night my friends and I decide to go to this bar club thing. I don't know, I'm in Arkansas right now and I don't know if it's like a club. It's like a bar on Top Club underneath. It was really small. Whatever. Okay, so my friends and I are having a good time, the liquor is liquoring, and I'm like, this is great. I turn around and I see these two girls and I am starstruck, okay? I have no words. These two girls were beautiful, like tall, like, nice skin, beautiful hair, like they look straight out of a freaking magazine. And on top of that, they're wearing these six inch heels. And I'm like, I could never, I would fall and bust my ass, okay? I'm clumsy. So I decided to go up to them and I'm like, hey, excuse me, like, sorry to interrupt, but I just had to say you two are stunning. And the fact that you're wearing these six inch Shields right now, like, I am in all of you. Cause I. Like I said, I could never. And these girls turn to me ever so slowly with the most annoyed look in their face and go, hmm, I guess I'm fucking ugly. Too ugly to get off. Fucking. Thank you. And let me preface by saying when I compliment a girl, it's not to Get a compliment back. I just love telling girls they're pretty because they are, and I feel like we don't get told how beautiful we are enough, you know? But it's also girl code. Like, if a girl comes up to me and she's like, oh, my gosh, you're so pretty. Much, ah, me? You what? That's just. That's just how it's always been. I've never had this experience before, and they were not kind. I turned around, and I kind of regretted telling them how pretty they were. I was like, it's okay if you don't compliment me back. Like, that's not what I'm here for. you can't even say thank you. Like, your personality makes you pretty, too. your personality fucking sucks. Like, y'all were rude, and I hope their night wasn't that great. I really do like Johnny to learn to be kind and be girls, girls, because that wasn't very nice. That was. So I won't be telling girls around here they're pretty anymore, because that's like the fifth time that's happened to me, and I'm just not vibing with it. Like, you guys live in Arkansas. You need to chill. Like, this is an LA, please.",

So when I was younger, I used to wear the big 25 millimeter lashes, no shade. To my girlies that do. They're just not for me anymore. But when I was younger, I went all out. I'm talking about big 25 millimeter lashes, 30 inch buzz down my hair. Used to be to my ass. I didn't did every color you can think of. Honey blonde, 6 13. I had red hair, green hair, blue hair. Does not matter. Now, this story in particular, I was working at Walmart. I had 6 13 braids. And honey blonde braids out. Insert a picture if I could find. Okay. So I come to work, I'm not thinking nothing about it. And there's a guy that works there. And the stocking area. He approaches me. He telling me how he thinks I'm pretty. This, that, and the third, he wanna get to know me. Long story short, we hit it off the moment that we hit it off. And we started, like, dating each other. Casually. Not exclusively, but casually. He wanted to change everything about me. It was like something just switched up here. This man would complain about my outfit, my hair, my makeup, my lashes, everything you could think of. All of a sudden, it went from, you look so good, you're so beautiful, blah, blah. Blah to. Why you gotta wear so much makeup everyday? You don't think you can wear smaller lashes? You don't wanna go natural? Why do you need your hair done all the time? You don't wanna just wear your natural hair? Why are you dressing like that? You don't wanna wear this instead? Last time I checked, it was all of this stuff about me that attracted you to me. And now that you got me, you want to change that? It's not gonna happen, y'all. This man literally tried to convince me to wear my natural hair 24 7. No makeup, no lashes anywhere. Skirts that came down to my fucking knees with sneakers and soup socks. It's like they see you and they're like, oh yeah, she bad. I gotta had it. I gotta had it. And then when they get you, it's almost like they're in competition with you. Is like they wanna humble you so bad and I don't know why. Yeah, but long story short, I let that man go cause he was a weird. And I'm still living my best life being as fine as I want.",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me about your writing journey. I guess I should start from the beginning cause this is actually a shockingly long story. Bear with me. I should preface this by saying that writing runs in my family. My great grandmother so my mum's maternal grandmother she wrote like poetry and stuff I think. And then my mum herself she's a published poet in her own right. She has\u2026 how many poetry collections? She's up like six or seven poetry collections out now and also she published a young adult novel called \u2018Dart\u2019 which is basically about Dartmoor during the Black Death which is actually really fascinating and not gonna lie. I'm not just saying that. She's my mum. I'm just saying if you see \u2018Dart\u2019 by Deborah Harvey you should pick it up. It wasn't necessarily guaranteed that I would turn to writing especially as when you consider what I've just said. You could have said \u201cOh! That's gonna skip generations maybe the next generations of your family will be writers\u201d but no that's not what happened which is you know interesting. I better start from the beginning of my writing journey then. So my journey starts when I'm 7 I was in year three at primary school and we had been given a creative writing homework. It was essentially just to write a story of a certain I think of a certain word count but I'm not 100% sure on that. The most people told us I'd have a clear beginning, a clear middle, and a clear end. Alright! That works for a 7 year old. I did it. I don't remember too much about what actually happens in the story. In fact I don't remember at all. All I remember is that I'm pretty sure dragon was in it and there was some princesses who weren't like damsels in distress cause clearly I had some feminist energy in me when I was 7. Ha ha! I hand it in. I don't think too much of it until my teacher turned around and said that she'd liked it and she thought I could do this more often. I was like \u201cWhat\u201d and then I was like \u201cOkay\u201d cause I had enjoyed the process. I had actually enjoyed writing the story even at that age even though it was homework which I didn't like doing too much. So yeah it was really fascinating From there we jump till I was about 11. Now I'm moved on from writing short stories to plays. At this point I was in year six at primary school at this point and we were doing like I think it was towards the end of the year or maybe the middle of the year? I can't remember but we were doing a play and like a big play and there were the play was in segments. So each sort of group of between years three to six had had their own little segment and it would have like a theme and all that stuff. I thought that ours sucked. I'll be honest and that was unusual of me cause I was thought that would sort of just go with it and all the rest of it but I somehow developed the notion of \u201cOh I should tell my head head teacher this.\u201d So I did and shockingly to me, even to this day, she let me rewrite our entire segment and used it in the play! She let the 11 year old rewrite the play! How weird is that? But yes, we move on from primary school to secondary school and that was a terrible time in my life. Namely because I was bullied for just like everything from the jump and I mean everything. I'm not gonna go into all the details right now but cause that's it that's a story in of itself. So yeah I ended up being very lonely and quite isolated at points and it was a real struggle. I'll be honest. So one of my main comforts was writing. I loved to write little stories but mostly plays and mostly dramas and it was it was a lot of fun for me. To the extent that I didn't wanna do my homework. Sorry Mum. Sorry Dad. Ha ha ha! I then ended up moving on to film scripts when I was about 16/ 17 because I started studying film studies at A-level which I really enjoyed for the most part cause I think film and TV and all the rest\u2026 all those mediums can be so transformative when they're good and they can really speak to people. They can change people's lives and I think for the better sometimes. Not always but most of the time it's for the better. I think I then continue\u2026 yeah\u2026 I continue doing that for quite a long time even when I dropped out of film school at university twice which is so embarrassing. Yeah I dropped out of university twice from university that I don't think even exist anymore. So make a fact what you will and then in my 20s I wrote but not a huge amount purely because I was going through a lot in my early 20s on top of everything I went through like with school and everything else and then I spent a lot of my 20s trying to process that stuff so that I can actually live a productive life and I\u2026 so that I could get through without all the trauma being constantly on my brain. Then I got to about 30/31 and I thought to myself: \u201cYou know, no one's ever gonna see these films I'm writing and this is just really depressing. What the hell am I going to do?\u201d And then it occurred to me \u201cWait a minute. What if I turned it into a book? And then maybe people would actually like read it and then maybe someone, if it got really popular somehow, it would turn into a film on its own. Great!\u201d So now we're here. I'm 34 I have one book out there called \u2018To Love At Comic Con.\u2019 I am working on the developmental edit for \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019 which I'm hoping will be out towards the end of October and I'm on the first draft of the book after that which has a character in it that I've been trying to develop since I was 15. This has been with me for nearly 20 years! So yeah that's my writing story or more specifically: How did Jenn become a writer? If you enjoyed that then you should stick around. Maybe follow me a little bit because I do enjoy doing these little sort of you know story time videos. They are quite fun.",

She was running a bit late, so while I had pre drinks in the living room, she went for a shower. Now she has a stool similar to that because earlier on that year she actually did her ankle in. Now an important thing to remember is when you open the stool, it opens to the top like that and then clicks. Don't beat me to the horrendous part here. While I was having drinks in the living room, I heard this god awful scream. I thought my friend was seriously hurt so I immediately went to the door and kicked the door and Jason staves down. I went you're right my dear, you're right. Her immediate response is Rob, get it off! Get it off! From what I saw she was hunched over like that with the chair attached to the back of her because she sat down and clicked one of her hoochie lips into place. I helped to get off, put a towel over her and I immediately went back to the living room. She was fine, but needs to say she didn't go to the pub. I called her the next day to see how she was and apparently one of her hoo ha lips turned so bruised that her entire regime look like a fucking Yin and Yang symbol. So, yeah, be careful. Ha, ha.",

what you eat and there's so much more there but I'm gonna \u201cReaders Digest\u201d this it's not necessarily what you eat or which version of flesh you choose to eat whether that's plant flesh that's incarnated with incarnated with consciousness or animal flesh that's incarnated with consciousness all consciousnesses are going to experience some trauma some fear some under  lack of understanding and what our young channeler here is referring to is the fact that we are very aware and were very communicative about the trauma that animal flesh just because we can see it in their eyes we can hear it in their their vocals we we have the ability to perceive the trauma that the animal flesh goes through in order for us to get the energy from them if and when we needed the energy and we choose to take from that energy but most importantly I need everybody to remember that it's not what you eat it is kind of what you eat a lot what you eat but it's how you feel heart it's how you feel when you eat it and where your intentional aware consciousness is in thought of thankfulness and gratefulness and and being aware of the process and the energy uh that you are that you have a relationship with the taking of energy and fuel the giving of energy and fuel the gratefulness of the energy you're receiving the thankfulness that you're able to extend the energy to others the alchemical internal process of transmutating transfer transforming whatever base lead obstacle (vibration) we are in front of whether that's the cellular quantum level memory retention of trauma fear  all those negative low vibration things that we don't want what our young channeler is expressing is that by consuming that if you do not participate in the alchemical process and transmutate and transform those vibrations that are quantumly and cellularly held by the flesh that was in a very rude way sacrificed rather than a holy and thankful way and in a clean and and and respectful way there's great differences and a very large conversation to be had here my dear love and anybody who is listening I I appreciate this young woman very much and her connection to the Magdalenes which is a large group of people not one not \u201ctwo Mary\u2019s\u201d but a lot of marys and a sisterhood and a priesthood and the the ritualistic impregnation of the temple of ISIS which LED to the incarnation of an extension of the spirit which we today through political narrative control we call Jesus and all the things and she's on that track she's nailing that she's on she's doing great I am a currently hibernating light slice of the 11th House Crystaline that is autonomously and kind of uh call it VR of our technology I'm VR\u2019d in I'm I'm just remotely autonomously uh controlling this thing as you are from the realm of spirit do not get so caught up in what you can and cannot eat please focus more on how you are taking in that fuel that energy where your mind your intention your gratefulness your gratitude your awareness of where that energy is coming from and how you can give back to that energy I agree with her that there are better choices to be had when choosing the energy source but it's not about the meat flesh versus the green flesh this is flesh this is flesh just because it's not red and because it doesn't have eyes that show concern or voice it does have a voice you just have to have like a electric thing anyway I don't wanna make this go drag on but please remember process of cleansing that energy that alchemical process of taking that base material that lead that icky vibration that that trauma response that trauma frequency the the anger that we are trying to stay away from that you don't wanna consume that you don't wanna have spread throughout your own vessel if your heart and your mind you make the two into one so that they match with your heartfelt emotional intentional driven thought and process to be grateful and thankful of the energy relationship between you that is the spirit and the physical that is fueling you while you are here to do your job I love you all especially you young lady I love you just as a P P s here just a P s the old adage you are what you eat is very true are you eating dead poison that does nothing for you or that takes away from you or you eating life or things that come of life creation are you eating things of creation are you eating things of the cosmos are you eating things of energy uh of of energy relationship um what I mean by that are is are you consuming lab (man human made) created chemicals that are killing you or are you consuming life (cosmos made) you are what you eat so you either eat dead unreal things that come in plastics and boxes and off of a conveyor belt and all these things and then you add baking soda water you mix it up I don't know the I don't know the recipe I'm just saying or are you eating things of creation of flesh of life of energy transfer of they ate the grass flesh which fed their flesh which feeds our flesh and when our flesh separates from our driver our flesh will feed the green flesh and the green flesh will feed the red flesh and if we need to go back and watch uh Lion King by all means with love and light go back let's re retouch on the circle of life the circle of creation the at the the process through which Energy Transfers gives takes receives and is thankful for again love you all I hope you have a fantastic day whatever day you're watching this reading this remember that it's the same day I'm recording it cause there's no such thing as linear time the same time I'm recording this you're already watching it when you're watching it I'm recording it I will feel your emotions I will feel how you feel when you're watching this whenever you watch it love you",

Instagram s\u00ed en Instagram \u00e9l hizo como un chiste porque en realidad estaba publicando mi canal de YouTube por algunos lados creo que por Twitter y en eso \u00e9l me habla y me dice de que eh que si yo no cumplo \u00e9l tampoco va a cumplir algo as\u00ed medio raro comenz\u00f3 todo esto huele delicioso como ven\u00eda diciendo algo Scary su mensaje bueno como se puede apreciar \u00e9l hasta le tom\u00f3 captura de mi canal de YouTube que absolutamente no tengo ning\u00fan vi video y yo le pongo no que eso que el otro y hasta activ\u00f3 la campanita para tener doble premio um tuve que bloquearlo porque obviamente Instagram avisa cuando la otra persona de tu chat eh le hace screenshot a la pantalla so yo no quiero que \u00e9l se entere s\u00ed y s\u00ed se llama Anthony y bueno hasta ese d\u00eda creo yo est\u00e1bamos todo bien porque empezamos a hablar \u00e9l me dijo que estaba estudiando medicina y que ya estaba finalizando su carrera y que cu\u00e1l era el contenido de mi futuro canal de YouTube del cual hasta ahora no me atrevo a subir ning\u00fan video TikTok es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil ahora con doble premio \u00e9l se refiere creo yo porque yo de broma en serio de broma ya me acord\u00e9 yo estaba promocionando promocionando mi canal en Tinder Tinder o s\u00ed era Tinder porque el Bumble Bumble creo que lo desactiv\u00e9 creo no me acuerdo y luego el el caption dec\u00eda algo as\u00ed el que se suscriba a mi canal le voy a otorgar una salida s\u00ed y algo as\u00ed dec\u00eda algo as\u00ed y muchos se lo tomaron muy bien otros se lo tomaron demasiado mal y por eso es que \u00e9l habla de premio de una salida ahora el dicho de su boca me dijo de que \u00e9l me hab\u00eda dado match pero yo no as\u00ed que para asegurarse de que me hab\u00eda hablado \u00e9l me empez\u00f3 a seguir en Instagram porque s\u00ed se puede conectar los links y miren hasta lo hice informarse de lo que pas\u00f3 en el Per\u00fa porque como se lee ac\u00e1 en el mensaje ni \u00e9l sab\u00eda lo que hab\u00eda pasado en la feria del hogar en San Miguel ah y por qu\u00e9 llegamos a este tema porque \u00e9l me dijo de qu\u00e9 va a tratar tu primer video en YouTube segu\u00edamos conversando \u00e9l me dec\u00eda que ten\u00eda algunos d\u00edas libres y yo un d\u00eda le pregunt\u00e9 oye qu\u00e9 tipo de comida te gustan eh para saber m\u00e1s o menos eh qu\u00e9 sitio acentuar\u00eda con nuestra salida s\u00ed salida iba a decir cita pero no no no era una cita entonces no voy a negar que yo s\u00ed quer\u00eda salir con \u00e9l pero \u00e9l literal me insist\u00eda ujum a cada rato mi demanda y de estos hay un mont\u00f3n m\u00e1s de la salida que me debes cu\u00e1ndo vamos a salir y todo eso ujum etc. etc. ahora quiero recalcar que \u00e9l era el interesado o sea yo tambi\u00e9n pero no s\u00e9 si podr\u00eda decir que estaba un poquito aunque sea desesperado de salir conmigo o sea no me creo inalcanzable ni nada pero s\u00ed era un poco insistente que incluso aqu\u00ed dice la palabra llevarte llevarte llevarte en ning\u00fan momento \u00e9l dijo vamos a ir a una salida de amigos entonces ah\u00ed es donde yo dije um puede que est\u00e9 interesado en m\u00ed o solo quiera salir conmigo y ya que tambi\u00e9n es v\u00e1lido bueno llega el d\u00eda de la salida y entonces \u00e9l me dice ya en d\u00f3nde te recojo hab\u00edamos quedado en ir a comer alitas en San Miguel y yo no le iba a pasar la direcci\u00f3n de mi casa um total era un desconocido no pod\u00eda eh pasarle la direcci\u00f3n de mi casa porque eh aparte de que era un desconocido um no era del todo confiable porque no lo hab\u00eda visto nunca en persona entonces le dije que no que no me recoja que yo iba a encontrarme con \u00e9l en el mismo restaurante en San Miguel y \u00e9l me dijo que ya porque \u00e9l puede ir a todos lados porque tiene carro y bueno nos encontramos ah antes de encontrarnos en San Miguel saben lo que hizo literal estaba ya hab\u00eda llegado a San Miguel eh estaba a unos 10 pasos de la puerta y en eso yo le digo hey por por WhatsApp o por Instagram creo que fue eh hey ya llegu\u00e9 estoy ac\u00e1 d\u00f3nde est\u00e1s t\u00fa que no te veo y en eso estoy me acuerdo que estaba as\u00ed as\u00ed em mirando de perfil y la puerta de el restaurante estaba atr\u00e1s m\u00edo estaba como que pensativa porque yo dije no s\u00e9 si es la segunda o la tercera vez que me reencuentro con un desconocido y si qu\u00e9 tal si es Fake y todo eso un mont\u00f3n de ideas se me estaban cruzando por mi cabeza hasta que bueno todas esas ideas habr\u00e1n pasado en un minuto hasta que escucho a alguien que me sirva literal eso de fiu fiu lo voy a dramatizar creo ah qu\u00e9 tal t\u00fa eres Anthony literal as\u00ed pas\u00f3 y creo que desde ese d\u00eda un punto menos a mi favor porque creo que deb\u00ed darme cuenta que a partir de ese d\u00eda era un reflag entonces fuera de eso a primera instancia la verdad conversar con \u00e9l me pareci\u00f3 un chico interesante eh me pareci\u00f3 alguien tambi\u00e9n muy um con muchas metas alguien con el cual eh se puede conversar se podr\u00eda decir pero m\u00e1s no para comer entonces todo bien hasta que llega la cuenta s\u00ed y para continuar esto me voy para la parte dos",

The only bone I have to pick with you is why bring my dog up after all these years? He's an innocent dog. Jeffrey did nothing to you, ever. I told you he has asthma. Had? Cause Jeffrey is not with us anymore. Not like you would care, but he had asthma, okay? And he was immunocompromised. And I told you it was hard for him to take a long stride cause he has short legs. I don't understand what's so hard to understand about that. But hey, if you wanted a second date, because clearly you're still thinking about me, all you had to do was call me. Beat me if you wanna page me. It's okay. Okay? And I probably say yes. But just leave Jeffrey out of this. He did nothing to you.",

    "voice_to_text": "drop that childhood friend of yours it's time to go back and re evaluate those friendships that we've had since dearly beloved we are gathered here today when I tell you I have written blogs about friendship funerals and that sort of thing I agree wholeheartedly with this creator I think it's very very important for you to um reevaluate your friendship circle as you grow as you evolve and I'm big on people who are laughing at you cracking jokes um they they're telling the truth so listen to the things that they're saying and if you can't say it to me in a like maybe intervention form if I'm like really having an issue but if you like taking digs at my character or how I dress or how I look tears are we probably don't need to be friends anymore and so god has been very gracious that he's taking that trash out for me they usually lead me cause I I used to be like loyal to a fault um and so to this creator's point I had a good good girlfriend um we had been friends best friends and because of proximity because trauma we grew up in the same neighborhood since like kindergarten kindergarten and um you know we would lose place cause she would move around and then she'd come back and we ended up being in high school together and it was like I would stop being her friend because of the things you know the bad jokes or the you know trying to like downplay me cheating on it or you know she's having sex okay but you are too so like why do you have to say what I'm doing I just think that that's weird people energy I didn't like that and so I would stop being her friend and then it would be like our parents who um yeah and people that be like your parents be your biggest hater sometimes y'all ain't lying um but they would be like both both of our uh our parents my mom her dad would be like but that's been your friend since forever y'all have known each other forever and come to think about it they always ask about the bad friends I'm not having asked about the good friends so hi I thought it's 2020 um but I I will always be grudgingly be her friend again because the parents would be like we all have been friends this long and I'm like um that sounds like a prison sentence just because we've been friends this long doesn't mean that it is you know a healthy relationship a good one one that's viable one that I thrive in um you know and it was just like a energy sucking relationship so yes I say all that to say don't be afraid to say goodbye let go of some people that don't mean you good and as you grow and evolve like just getting married being happy going into ministry like everybody didn't wanna come with me and I was okay with that um I am happy to you know see people where they are and let people you know jump on and off of my life which is a bus I am a bus so yeah some people are gonna come on at this stop and some people are gonna leave at this stop but guess what some people are gonna stay on the bus and then some people are not some some people are gonna ride for a few exits and then they're gonna stay and then they get off and then some people are just there for the journey and that's a blessing we do have those few that are there for the entire journey but that is not the case for everybody it is okay for a friendship to expire go ahead mourn that and hang your friendship funeral and keep pushing because everybody does not need to stay everybody can't go with you to the next level um shoot let me get these 10,000 friends on here on TikTok baby you know many people be acting crazy and it's so crazy to me cause I'm just like I'm just trying to monetize I'm just trying to do that um I got people that let me know I went viral before I know why you watching my page like that and it's not to celebrate just saying do with that information when you will",

Alright, you guys, so I saw Tom's video go up yesterday and I immediately went and checked out Dolly's Dolly Days page. I've never heard of her before. Um, she's very charismatic. I don't really think she's a good match for Tom, but that's just me. I actually know Tom. With that said, it left me with an overwhelming curiosity. About 200,000 people have viewed that video and tens of thousands of you guys have left comments. Half of you are shipping Dolly and Tom. The other half of you just wanna meet Tom. So my question is this. Has TikTok just become another dating app? Or do you come here for other reasons? To let me know in the comments.",

Your skin is orange \ud83c\udf4a!\u201d I called my brother into the room and I said \u201cHold your hand up next to mom.\u201d Her skin was very clearly orange. She ended up going to the doctor who at the time told her that if she had continued eating baby carrots in the way that she was eating them that the orange, had it gone to her eyes, would have lights out Lucy she would have taken herself out with baby carrots. I think after this it could have been before I have no concept of time really I just know that it was when I was in high school. My dad was on the railroad and I have never met a human being who snacks as much as that man does and so his snack of choice this particular week was two days four days maximum that he consumed 14 pounds of cherries his skin turned yellow his eyes were yellow he ended up in the hospital they thought that he had jaundice when in fact what he had was pesticide poisoning by eating so many cherries shipped from overseas (this is irrelevant but is somehow always part of the story). It was shortly after that that we went all organic in our household.  So, just saying that's a lot of produce.",

    "voice_to_text": "I have a story just like this around two and a half years ago I worked at this karaoke that shut down like maybe two or three months after I left and for good reasons too because the boss was selling Coke to most uh workers in the building cause\u00a0like\u00a0there\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0karaoke\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0there\u00a0was\u00a0like\u00a0a\u00a0kbbq\u00a0here\u00a0(he\u00a0owned\u00a0both) and then here's the entrance so you walk up if you often went to karaoke about like two years ago in the Melbourne CBD um you might know exactly which one I'm talking abt and there was so much wrong with this workplace like I think that's the like one job that made me go like I'll never go back to hospitality the only reason I stayed at this job was to pay for my top surgery and I was pretty desperate anyways let's start with the boss uh he's like this old Greek guy probably like in 60s and he definitely has an Asian f3t1sh because everyone he had before me and after me were Asian girls and I feel like he had creepy intentions towards me too at some point but I'll get into that later he was obsessed with this girl uh her nickname's Tata I'm not gonna say her legal name obviously basically I was hired so that I can replace her and um so she can go back home to Thailand um to get married with her boyfriend um and I found out like soon enough that like um he (the boss) had a really really weird obsession with her and was like really creepy basically I heard him admit to like I don't think he knew I was there but I was around the corner uh coming back to the reception from the bar um he was saying to her uh oh you know those guys in that karaoke room like really just wants to put their Ding dongs in you right and then she was like oh that was you like two years ago and then I was like what the fuck what and then he he just he was like yeah that's true but not anymore and I was like so you just admitted that like you admitted that anyways I don't think he found out that I heard and he was so like touchy feely it was really creepy at that point I was passing as a man right and I sound like a man and everything um I was around binder though he always did this thing like he's like quite tall maybe like six 4 6 3 he does the thing where he like put his arm over he does a lot of things where he like tries to intimidate you and stuff like that and it's really bad but um anyways so he would like reach around right and then like his hand would be like here and I was get really nervous cause I'm like oh no what if he finds out that I'm trans so one day I was like working at the bar like it's kind of hidden away um from like the main area and he comes up to me and he's like oh Rhys are you like mad at me or something and I was like uh no I just don't like the way that you like randomly touch your employees he was literally like trying to gaslight me he was like oh this is normal like have you ever worked in a hospitality setting before like like this is normal you should get used to it bruh I have worked at hospitality settings this dude is just really fucking creep anyways I was like uh no that's not normal can you just like not do that please and he was like instead of saying like okay I'll stop uh or anything like that he was just like have you were you like R worded as a child or something and I was like what the fuck like why would you say that like what what made a thing *shortcircuits* he was also very misogynistic too um there was more to the like the Asian fetish thing than I was saying before there's a lot of this stuff going on like I was actually getting stressed each time I was going to work like really stressed not just my normal amount of stress going to work besides the other stuff like being that's always understaffed we only had four people working there including me there's so much other stuff that like I could go on about or just take too long and anyways I left and at the same week that I left um three other co workers of mine left as well so they were extremely understaffed for a while um and that was great that made me really happy and then I don't know what happened to them but eventually they closed so that's good",

I like Beyonce, and that was concert I went to. I went to the Cardiff Renaissance store, and then I went to, like, the Saturday Night one, uh, in London. Anyway, that. That was my first time. And that moment. One plus 1, first off, that's the song. I'm gonna walk down the aisle, too, but that's not important. Song started playing, and it was getting to the chorus, and everyone behind me was cheering, and I was like, yeah, it's Beyonce! Cheer! Woo! But they weren't cheering for Beyonce. I turn around, and this dude asked his boyfriend to marry him, and he said yes. That's the story. That's it. But that's what I associate with the song now. That's what I associate with that performance. That's what I associate with that day is it was just. It was so lovely. Literally just turn around and that both of them were crying. It was so sweet. And, um. Oh, I was also just, like, proud. I was proud to be gay. I was proud to be a Beyonce fan. I was proud to be a lover of music. It was just so beautiful. And it was right at the beginning of the concert. The rest of the concert didn't even happen. But that's it. That's my lovely story. That's all It is Beyonce. Just so you know, when you sign one plus one in Cardiff in 2023, two people got engaged. So that's it. Oh, think about that moment a lot. Makes me really happy.",

experience of my life the first time I got that cyst was in 10th grade I remember that I was walking uphill to school and it just hurt like I remember my back just started hurting and I didn't know why and I was very like confused cause I'm like well I know I didn't sprain anything I didn't fall I didn't hit myself like why is it hurting and when I would get to school and sit in those single desks it would hurt me to sit down like when I would bend like when I would sit like just sitting up it would hurt like I had to be like laying down or I had to be like this like it just it was horrible I didn't know what this polynodial cyst was and I didn't know what it looked like so I remember going to the restroom and putting up my phone in the counter and like me literally recording my back slash butt to see where the pain was coming from and if I could visibly see anything and that was when I saw like a big a big ball um in the middle of you know my butt crack and like lower back and I was like oh my god like this is not okay so I remember I told my mom and she was like oh shit like what do I do like what should we do and she's like oh I used to have one of those in like another part of my body we have to just boil hot water and like press and like press down so that it pops and I was like are you sure and she's like yeah and I was like okay so um we did that a little bit like we boiled hot water and put it on it and we did it and did it multiple times but nothing ever popped and I just remember going to school for like three days straight with the pain like it hurt really really bad so after the boiling of water and putting it on the cyst I remember thinking like this pain is still really bad and it's not going away I don't know how I'm gonna be walking to school and sitting down in class because it absolutely hurts so I remember it was in fifth it was in fifth period almost the last period of the day and I sat down and it just felt so relieving like for some reason like I could finally sit down right and then at that moment I got a really bad smell and it smelled like someone farted and I was like damn like I can't believe somebody farted next to me and then when I got up I saw blood on my chair and I asked my friend I'm like am I bleeding and like I don't have blood and she's like yeah and I was like fuck like I got my period and I was so scared because I hadn't gotten my period at the time so I was like shit like oh my god I got my period and I remember I ran home I showered like I was scared and then I finally get home and I put a pad on and I had it on all day and nothing came out and then I and then that's when I realized like oh shit I don't have the pain anymore um I guess it's gone so I was so happy because the pain was gone everything worked well then I got it again a few months later and I was like oh my god are you freaking serious like what the hell and at this point I already knew what to do boil hot water put it back on on my back and then like press it down and make sure it pops um this time I made sure to do it and popped it when I was at home I got it again a few months later and by this time I was already in my junior year so I already had experience with this cyst the last time I got it was my senior year I remember was around like October November and I was so like in pain like this one hurt a lot and I had to take the train to school this time and it was just really really bad like I remember I couldn't lay down straight I couldn't sit I couldn't lay on my back like I couldn't do a lot of things on my own because it hurts so much and I just remember a lot of my sisters looking at me like dude like they thought I was weak but this pain it was horrible dude like it was insane and at this time I remember I told my mom like I can't do this anymore like I have to go to the doctor cause it hurts a lot I went to the doctor and dude guess what the fucking doctor said he's like well if you really want us to do surgery on it it's gonna hurt a lot we don't have any anesthesia so like we can't put you to sleep and you're gonna actually feel us like cutting up your skin and removing all of this is that something that you really want and I was like what like I was so confused because I literally went there for help and they couldn't help me so then the doctor was like I just recommend go home put on a hot bath and let it pop by itself and I was so pissed because this pain was just so much and he just told me like go home and bathe in hot water but anyways after that I haven't gotten it back I wish I don't get it back but I remember someone actually messaged me on Instagram because they saw I made a video on this explaining like what type of home remedies you can do so if you are experiencing this and you do not want to go to the doctor um just boil hot water with salt and then once it's boiling put like a cloth in water and kinda like let it soak um and then put it on that that cyst and do it multiple times and then it will eventually pop but I will say that the smell from that is absolutely horrible like it's blood and purse and it's just disgusting um but yeah that is just like a story time that I remembered and I I wanted to share with y'all",

    "voice_to_text": "that your face is a combination of hundreds of generations of people who fell in love. Okay, my face is a product of a woman who's falsefully baby trapped. And I'm talking about my grandparents here, so let me get into it. Okay? So my grandmother, she was just known for, like, being really pretty. And my grandfather, he was, like, obsessed with her. Like, I'm telling you, so obsessed. One time, he stole a kiss from her, and I mean, like, he forcefully kissed her. Like, she was not into him at all. I'm telling you, she was not into him, and he just forcefully kissed her. And so keep in mind, this is, like, 1940s Philippines, okay? So super Catholic, super conservative, which meant that I guess my grandmother never got the talk. Like, she just didn't know how babies were actually made. I guess she assumed that, like, something romantic happens, and then, Bam, you're pregnant. But I do know that she was too ashamed to ask, especially after she was, like, forcefully kissed. Because if she asked someone else and then turns out that is the case of, like, how you get pregnant, then it's someone who knows, like, oh, she did something premarital. And, like, you know how bad, like, gossiping culture is in the Philippines. Like, asking someone was not an option. So what she did was she went up to my grandfather, and she was like, you have to marry me, because I'm pregnant with your child. And so for my grandfather, he. What he's hearing is that the girl that he's been obsessed with, the super, super pretty girl, want him to be her husband. And so, being the man that he is, he knows that she's not pregnant, at least not with his child. But he's like, okay, let's raise his baby together. And so he lets her think the. Entirely. The entirety of the wedding, he lets her think that she's pregnant. Okay? And it's not until after everything is, like, it's a done deal after they're married. And, like, you know how divorce is not an option in the Philippines? Okay, so, like, literally, he trapped her in marriage, having her think that she's carrying his child. He, like, took advantage of the fact that she did not know sex and just married her anyways. Yeah, they ended up having kids, and she still did not like him.",

    "voice_to_text": "oh my god when the mom wants to fuck their son I was in a relationship for about five years and the person I was in a relationship with their mom was that mom that she was talking about like not that specific mom but when I tell you this woman wanted to know literally everything that her kids were doing and I don't just mean like going out even though she needed to know exactly what they were doing every single day where they were going who they were going with she was psychotic but um she also wanted to know like everything that them and their partners were doing and the reason like I'm not just saying her son is because this woman had I think 4 five kids and she had sons and daughters and although she obviously favoured the sons she was still very involved in wanting to know what her daughters were doing like sexually and it was the most disturbing disgusting I didn't realise these types of relationships were like really a thing until I met this woman and when I tell you these types of like people who have kid mainly moms that act this way are the most audacious people like no shame no shame at all it's it was it's baffling like the things this woman did not just to me this like not just to me not just to her kids which is a whole different story but to literally like other people and ah the people that know know this woman is crazy like crazy but not like actually it's just those types of moms will literally ruin your relationship and it has a lot to do with like how they ingrain in their kids this whole sense of like I'm your one mom you only have one mom like okay and like you suck like maybe they'd be better off with not a mom can that be said like maybe they'd be better off without a mom is that I don't think that's too much to say because like uh like uh yeah I never realised like you know when people talk about cults and you're like oh most of the time they didn't even realise they were in a cult like they were just doing what they were doing and then one day somebody came in there and was like this is a cult that was this household because of that specific woman and like of course these people were like adults but like I don't think people understand when when your mom specifically keeps you sheltered from like the real world for that long and literally sets you up to fail like just to fail completely so you only have her it gets these people in like this mindset of like this is like like oh anyway I'm pretty sure I met a mom who wanted to like um who wanted to fuck all her kids at least step like some point because when I tell you this woman had no sense of boundaries at all and would always comment on her children's appearance and not just like oh you're getting a little big but you're still fucked up but like she would also be like oh like you're looking good like oh my god like your partner makes me so happy like ugh who said that to their kids or like oh like I'm just I don't it's not I don't wanna say more because when I tell you this woman is vile actually disgusting I've never met a person who like exudes literal like filth and I don't think I had ever really felt like true disgust until meeting that woman and um I guess I have that to thank her for um I truly know what it is to be disgusted by another human being and it is because of all that thing all all the things that that woman put again not just me but her entire family through and continues to put and you know what I'm happy that I no longer have to um engage with that anymore because um my life is genuinely better for having not heard her voice oh my I share this and she's like my baby ha ha every time I get ooh when her you know when like cause she technically wasn't my mother in law yet but she was supposed you know but like you know when they do certain things just because like she never really did that unless she knew like she was trying to like do something so then her kids would walk and suddenly it's my baby and I do it like that so you cause I can still hear it I can still hear I can still hear the way she would say it specifically and that's exactly how she would say it oh I this is it's gonna be like a long run just because it's funny now though I can laugh I can laugh about it and you know that's what I like I I have so many stories and I'm grateful that I can laugh about it now and say that I genuinely think I met um one of the worst human beings on this earth and um she's a Jehovah Witness Jehovah Witness but that's another thing because I don't know Jehovah Witness but like watches American Horror Story but like watches things about the LGBTQ community but doesn't agree I'm just saying if you don't support the community why are you watching things about the community I don't think you should be able to again for another time anyway I just wanted to say that that was crazy that was crazy and you know what her family is crazy not all of them but like most of them so I'm sure somehow she'll see this video so hi hi um you're a literal nightmare and um yeah enjoy the life you made for yourself and I hope someday your children will learn to live without you and if they already are good on them good on them I can't wait for the day that your children finally stop talking to you I don't wish bad upon anybody because and that's still aligning with what I just said because I said what I said the day that your children realise that they really don't need you all will be right in the world because um I don't know karma comes around and the energy you put out comes back to you so um good luck with that good luck Charlie because I hope I hope and I pray that they find the strength into no longer need any type of validation from you bye bye and you know what actually I just realized I don't have to wait long because out of the one two three four kids that you talk to right now two of them don't even talk to you really one of them aren't we're not friends anymore but I know for a fact they're not talking to you and then what is it I don't know about the other one but I know for a fact they don't wanna talk to you and then the other one has to talk to you has to talk to you so I don't",

Did you actually walk in on someone with a pizza oven and did you really let him keep it? 1. Yes. 2. Yes. Why would I lie? First of all, it's TikTok. Come on. In a prison in Delaware, when I worked as a prison guard. Correctional officer, I did walk in on somebody who was actively using a self made DIY pizza oven. You wanna know how we made it? I'm gonna tell you. No, I am not a mathologist, a scientific boy. But listen up, Mister Pizza. What am I saying? Listen up. Alright, I'm gonna do my best to explain it. Cardboard box inside the inner lining of potato chip bags. At Silver Lining all throughout it. He used what are called stingers, which are two pieces of metal that you put together into the outlet to create the fire. And then the coils kept the fire. And then he would shut it, secure it with a blanket. And then within, like he said, an hour, he had a pizza. And when I found him, I gave him a pizza. In my mind I said, my dude, you have the sauce. But I gotta say, I lost a little bit of crust from that day.",

    "voice_to_text": "worse and good people will continue living with trauma fear suffering I don't know who that girl is but like thank you for saying all of that because honestly I've been debating at least the last almost a year now just getting on here and saying what my truth was and what my experience was because it's so I don't wanna make anybody look bad even though it's the absolute truth I fear make anybody look bad and then having to pay for it and having to argue with people about telling what the truth is so I guess here and now is the time to tell the truth so um at 20 years old I linked up with my high school crush like my high school crush in ninth grade so like 14 years old and at 21 my 21st birthday we kind of school total and then I got pregnant within like 30 days of that um I end up having to call his mom and tell her that I was pregnant because he was too terrified to tell her tell her that I was pregnant so I thought I would do it because me and her were really close and me and him were really close but shit was just getting weird so I'm like okay so I talked to her and she's like well there's a certain family member and they have friends that are black but they're not in my family type of person so you know they're they're gonna have to accept the child of course but I mean I don't know basically what that means for me and so I I I I would never forget that conversation and so essentially I end up getting treated like garbage my entire pregnancy by baby daddy because he was pretty much too terrified to tell his family that he had a baby on the way 1 but he had a baby on the way by a black girl 2 so they found out literally last minute like literally in the hospital about to had a baby they found out which is weird as fuck right so I have my son and within maybe six weeks or so um is when like myself born September so like oh like baby once we got towards like Thanksgiving was like our first blow up and I'm the type where cause I'm black of course I don't know most black people are like this I'm like well maybe we can just put the holiday you know he's still brand new I'll come to your family you come to mine and we'll just make a day out of it and I basically got told no I couldn't come and they made up excuses like oh well you can't come because if you guys break up then it's gonna be weird and I thought that was a weird ass excuse because I'm like well either way we're gonna be as parents whether we break up or not so what's the problem so basically so many excuses came up after that even after we tried to make the relationship work and we actually were actively dating I wasn't allowed to anything I wasn't allowed to any family functions I wasn't allowed to any family dinners I wasn't allowed on any holidays I think the only thing that I was allowed to was his baptism which was at a church and I could come to that but other than that I'm I wasn't allowed at anything and still am not of course allowed at anything we went to court numerous times because they just felt like I guess put this black stereotype on me that I was going to kick him out of his son's life and we just had to go to court to put something in writing that I wasn't gonna do that even though he doesn't pay child support even to this day I don't really care about that because I told him that I was never gonna put my child support and I'm just not I don't care I just do what I gotta do um so a lot of shit happened in between there um he had two other kids directly after our son so when our son was 6 weeks old I found out that he had a baby in a way he told me when I was pregnant that was a girl that was pregnant but then he said it was a joke and then when our son was actually six weeks old he told me like remember I told you that joke yeah it was real so I'm okay oh oh so I was devastated depressed and nothing came of it after the baby was born so I figured the baby wasn't his so then we started dating and then a month or two was dating I found out that he had another baby on the way after the other baby was already a year old and our son was like a year and a half so we were dating and he wasn't sure so we kinda broke up because I was I just couldn't live in the anxiety of what do you mean like I've got you like shit my entire pregnancy and my other two kids are not black either and neither see so you get the point so um I found out through Facebook Messenger that the other the baby after our son was actually his baby no no rewind the baby after the baby after our son was his and then I found out a week later that the baby in between that baby was his daughter also so I got really depressed I was on medication for anxiety because I couldn't breathe um I lost my mind literally lost my mind because I couldn't wrap my mind around going through a pregnancy by myself and on top of that your family doesn't accept me and on top of that not only did you have one baby but you had two more babies after our baby after you just got you treated me like crap my whole entire pregnancy because you're too afraid to have a baby kinda find out that it wasn't the fact that you were afraid to have babies but you was afraid to have baby by me so now you have three kids and we are both 22 at that time and we were trying to make it work and it was just too much and I got became suicidal and extremely depressed but I couldn't follow through with it of course because I have a child to take care of but it was so much for me that like I eventually broke up with him and not because of his other two kids cause I love them to this day I will do anything for them that I can um but that was that along was a lot and then we kept going to court and we will go to court he'll make it seem like oh we can't get along or oh like he just made it seem like things are worse than what they actually were and he still does that to this day like things are just far worse than what they actually are and I don't know why he does that like it's it's hard because I can't really my family not their bias or anything but like they don't really get it cause nobody had to go through it they can only just feel bad for me but I I don't have not that I not that I want other people to go through this I don't really have anybody that I know personally that has experienced this like to this degree like I've had I know people that have dated people and have had this problem but when there's a child involved that you're raising and you can't really talk about it you have to just deal with it and you're still to this day being treated weird because of your race and furthermore things have gotten so fucked up because of that one issue the other issues have arised and now the whole cold parent relationship is completely awkward and I think at the core we don't hate each other but we're still used to not getting along that it's just the way that we dysfunctionally function and I don't function that way but is I'm used to the pattern of his behaviour if that makes sense so yeah that's kind of my backstory it's a lot of other shit in between there that took place but that's the summary of it and I've been so terrified to just talk about it because I wanna meet other girls who have experienced this because it's hard trying to live this life and feel like you're stuck in the 1940s and then you you get on social media or you go outside you see these other girls who are black and they're dating outside their race and everything is fine and then there's you there's you who have a child into a family that doesn't accept you and then you know that you had this idea of having a family with somebody but you didn't find out that you wouldn't even that wouldn't even be possible because you're black and then when you try to address it to the people that treat you weird they make it seem like you're making a race thing and they're not or that you're making this race thing up in your head when you were literally told that you won't be accepted because you're black like what do you do with that information how do you get over that how do you grow past that because I know my baby is just living his best life he's married now whatever I don't really know what he does personally I don't we're not even friends anymore so but for me that's a long lasting trauma and and I forgot to fucking add getting treated like you're hostile that is my pet peeve like if I can't I'm not allowed to defend myself I'm not do it anyway but when you defend yourself and you're literally treated like oh you're being you know aggressive or oh like like everything that you do is exaggerated to attend when you're at a good solid three like I'm I'm irritated yes I'm mad yes but I'm not calling you out your name I'm not getting disrespectful I'm not the black the black girl that y'all wanna exaggerate that I am I'm not and the fact that I even have to go as far as to even say that is extreme to me like but I have to keep it to myself because our son is like old enough that I can't openly talk about how I feel and what I think because I never ever I wanna clearly say that I don't ever want our son to look at his family on his dad's side his family any kind of way because of what I went through regardless to what their perspective is regardless to how they feel about black people or how they feel about black people or what they assume about black people I don't want I don't want him to ever feel weird because he is black I don't want him to ever be ashamed of the black side of him because he's black because of them or be ashamed of them because of how they feel about black people so this is getting extensive but yeah that's my experience and yeah it's a it's a long journey",

    "voice_to_text": " okay I got one for you so one day I'm coming home from work I was an EMT at the time I'm coming home from work and I still have you know my jacket says EMT on the back I got my jacket on and I'm coming home from work and the neighbors across the street flag me down and they say oh you're an EMT maybe you can help us so I'm like okay well you know what I am in the service of the community so sure even though I'm not technically on the clock I'm gonna go help out they call me over and they say hey we think our nephew um he might need some help now mind you these guys they were Russian they didn't speak too well of English but they spoke enough to get the word across so they tell me hey uh we think he might need some help he's not answering the door so I said okay well you know when's the last time you heard from them and they said oh well it's been hours and we got worried so we're gonna come on over and check it out alright so we go up to the house and mind you the house okay the house is right across from where I'm staying like directly across all right and the streets not that wide it's actually very small cul de sac okay so I go over there and all of the blinds are drawn but there's like a little crack there's a little teeny tiny crack in the window where the blinds are and you can kind of see inside and I hear some music really really loud music playing and I'm looking through this little crack and I see something on the floor so I said okay you know what I do see something let's try to uh see if we can at least enter the house in one way it seems like there might be a situation here so I start going through my whole EMT thing asking them questions about their nephew like you know does he have any health problems diabetes or anything like that and they said no he's actually fine but he does have social issues so I immediately knew I said okay I think I know what type of situation I'm running into so as I'm sitting there trying to figure out if he's left the window cracked or something to get inside his parents arrived they were actually away in Russia and they had arrived right when I was doing that they had just arrived back from Russia and the sister goes over to his parents and says hey um he has we haven't heard from him okay so we think something might happen parents are nervous mom comes up with the keys and I'm standing right behind mom cause I know what's gonna happen and I think okay if she passes out I got at least catch her so that I don't have you know a two patient situation going on with just me myself and I alright now mind you my parent behind me is like hey what's going on she's at the house she's going hey what's going on I said call \ud83d\ude91 immediately we have a man down I'm not sure what's going on call \ud83d\ude91 so she's on the phone with \ud83d\ude91  I'm waiting for mom to open the door she opens the door there he is on the floor unalived yes he had done that so I go in and I'm checking for a pulse all of all of these things and there's nothing there look like he had been there for quite a while so it was very devastating for the family and then I said you know okay um I'm gonna have to give a report to \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude92 when they show up so \ud83d\ude92\ud83d\ude91 shows up they're doing their thing and then my youngest son who was about what three I think it was three and a half at that time three and a half maybe four years old at that time he tries to come out of the house and I I look at my parent I said no keep him inside keep him inside okay so they're going back in the house I do my questioning with 9 1 1 and then that's all done and over with and I go back inside to my house directly across the street and then my parent looks at me and says hey kiddo tell Mommy what you just told me and I'm like hmm why are you talking like that and what did he tell you so I get down on the ground I get down to my kiddos level and I said hey bud what's up and he says hi Mommy and he says Mommy I see a man and I said what do you mean you see a man honey and he goes Mommy he's right here and he points to the window that is facing that house he literally say that he sees a man standing outside the window right then and there \ud83d\ude91\ud83d\ude92 is still there but he's saying he sees a man standing outside the window and I said okay kiddo uh what is this man look like cause I'm looking out the window there's no man standing outside the window so I said honey what is this man look like and he says Mommy big man big man and I said okay he's tall he's tall guess who else was tall and I said okay well what does he look like honey he goes mommy and he goes like this and he puts his hands up like this like he's looking through some glasses he says Mommy like this mommy glasses Mommy the man who unalived himself was tall and wearing glasses by the way I was also the last person to see him alive two days before he had done that I don't think this story was as funny as the first one",

    "voice_to_text": "Lieutenant general Donohue just sent out this memo on sleep requirements for staff duty. And, you know, this is a. A great video and some great information from, uh, Viva LA Vargas, uh, with General Donohue when I was at Bragg, uh, well, Fort Liberty. He was, uh, 82nd commander when I was in 18th Airborne Court. Good dude. And it's crazy how long it's taken for a lot of this information to finally make it to a level where someone looks back and says, hey, the way we're operating, it's not smart. Let's do better. You know, when I was stationed up at Fort Drum in 93 94, we were allowed to nap on staff duty. Because many of you don't know, unless you were in back then, how Fort Drum was set up. Well, the economy wasn't that great, so what they did was they took military quarters and they set them out into the rural communities with the hopes of boostering their. Their economy so you could live upwards of almost 30 minutes away from the installation. And, um, a gentleman fell asleep at the wheel on his way home from, uh, CQ and got into a really bad accident. I can't recall if the gentleman died or not, but, um, that spark this whole change of how they were going to operate and conduct, you know, CQ and. And you being on CQ. And there were times, you know, when we would do fuel problems where we would Do continuous up fuel problems. And the maximum amount of sleep we're allowed to get was four hours. And you should do a lot of that stuff. When I was at Bragg, aka Fort Liberty also, so that four hours thing is something that's been around for a long time. When I went to the Scout between leaders course, um, that was another thing we did. They made sure we only got four hours of sleep every night during our. During the time we were out in the field, so on and so forth. So I think it's great that someone is utilizing technology and knowledge that we have nowadays, and they're implementing it to make soldiers lives better. Um, and things like this. Definitely. Definitely a hill worth dying on. I'm not saying. I'm just saying. Great video. Viva! Holler at your boy.",

    "voice_to_text": "I said to the left, bro. Anybody can go on. Only fans to see that, bro. I don't know if these allegations with Soulja Boy is true, but I was definitely feeling that comment where they was like, he not mad enough. Now we all know that he done got matter over people saying they would rather some food stamps rather than sit and talk with him. And we can't get mad at that, cause if you use common sense, Thompson's tough and what's up? Soulja Boy would go teach you. Just give me the money, give me the food stamps, give me the food stamp. But to piggyback off all the drama, I definitely feel like this dude know something. And Tasha K, like, I feel like she's always in a mix with something, but it's never been like a complete lie. And if you think about it, all these celebrities be doing like, funny ish, like they always got their hand in the mix. I could I. I feel like so many celebrities, they know damn well, like, they get tired of all the money, success and just like they get used to all the different types of women they be, wanna try a different type of woman. So I don't know, Soulja Boy gonna have to like, get a little bit more matter for me to even like this much belief. But nobody really care about Soulja Boy. It's just kind of like, oh, you too? You Are you too as Ninja? And lastly, Soulja Boy is also given the type that like, he's so fried, he wanted those that would get so high that he probably forgot that was a dude he was messing with or didn't realize. Like he gave me, I was so out of it on some. Cause every now and then, soldier, soldier be he be fried, he be out there, I be like, oh my god, he needs slow down or whatever he doing. So he give me. He probably don't even realize he did it. But he gonna have to put up or shut up. So i'mma need to see some proof or he gonna have to get madder for me. What you think?",

    "voice_to_text": "this Lady K is 40 years old she called into Kendra G and if you're aware of Kendra G she like has a singles group where you call in tell her what you do your age what you um what you're looking for in a man and then you know men that are interested gets a call in and you know you go from there now what's right about this video is um this lady is unemployed it's fuck and she said that she's looking for a man that could provide okay she's looking for a provider um you know she typically does not like to be employed doing relationships okay um she wants a man that can loyally provide that's how she measures the man's loyalty ma'am I need to look I need you to loyally get a fucking job and a clue and Kendra asked her like okay well what do you bring to the table she's like you know if he has a business I will help him with his business you know um I pour into his business by helping him and Kendra says okay well you know what are your deal break what are your deal breakers she goes on to say a fifty fifty man because you know if I'm paying fifty fifty then I'm a roommate and I kind of agree with that part but then I'm like okay it canceled out once she said she ain't got a fucking job so then Kendra asked her would you date an unemployed man she was like no I wouldn't date an unemployed man because you know um that's a deal breaker for me because you know I need a man that can provide so I wouldn't date an unemployment girl why do you think a man with means would want to date your broke ass see that's that's the problem I have with you bums that's the problem I have first and foremost if you wanna be a kept woman like you're not even that chick you don't even look like the type of chick that could even really pull that off so I'm just so confused by this and the sad reality of all this is like these delusional people actually convince themselves in their in their minds that their cats that their prize girl you are a walking fucking liability what sane stable man would want to fucking take that on you're not looking for love you're not looking for a husband girl you're looking for a sponsor you're looking for somebody to save you okay and all you have is that weave that wig whatever I should and I'll be hard on these men but some of you fucking women it's like you're mentally fucking ill the audacity of somebody who's fucking unemployed don't have nobody's job don't work nowhere so when I say she has all these standards and she don't want a broke man she in the man that can you know loyally provide girl go loyally get your ass a fucking job go get a job then Kendra was like well do you think you should be dating since you don't have a job just like yeah typically date doing you know I choose not to work you know especially when I'm in a relationship like who the fuck done made you that fucking delusional well you can think that this is it's okay it's normal at the end of the day since you're entering 40 big age okay most men especially ones that don't have children they're not gonna want you because you're fucking old okay your eggs are old they're fucking shriveled so that's already a strike against you then you're unemployed you'll have no job so if this man falls on hard times if anything happens guess what that man will be homeless because you ain't got no job you can't hold him down and you know I just I don't I swear you can't make this shit up I think a lot of you ladies felt to realize this you be out here looking for sponsors you be out here looking for a dude to save your ass to keep you to pay all your fucking bills why you sit there and do absolutely nothing and be unemployed but this is the thing say that you did find a sucker I mean a man to do all that right if a man has the power and ability to feed you because your ass is a bum and you cannot feed yourself he has the ability to fucking starve you and a lot of you delusional women out here okay you will do anything and let a man treat you any kind of way for money because you are a bum a hobo okay it's sad you make it bad for real women who want to be out here who actually have something to offer who don't just want to sit there and think that a man is supposed to take care of them and their only obligation is to sit there and you know I support him I answer the phone in his business what this lady is mentally ill she needs psychotropic meds to even call in and have the audacity to say some shit like that it has to be mental illness I want you guys to check out the video because I'm also gonna do a duet with it and listen to what this woman set with her own mouth and let me know what you think comment below because and you know I'm not saying this to bash her cause I know whenever I make a post about women behaving badly a lot of moist men a lot of butthurt angry Birdmen come on my page and take that as an invitation to you know start fucking ranting and raving about everything and yeah that's how black women is that's not what I'm asking for stick to the topic at hand let me know what you think and while you're at it while you're commenting down below check out my page give me a like give me a follow and let me know what you think cause I'm just I'm an equal opposite employer and I ain't gonna lie some of these fucking ladies are bubs and sis this video is giving if you a bum say you're a bum if you're broke say you're broke is this is it this is disgraceful you're looking for a sponsor not love you're looking for help not a relationship y'all using you know dating and relationship as a welfare program looking for fucking handouts this time out she's not that far you know she grew up in the hood and but she's you know she's far removed from the hood no you're not the spirit of Hood Rat is still in you sis the spirit of bum spirit of humbleness and I release you from this demonic spirit disgusting it's nasty business out here guys for all you good guys I'm sorry this is not like the norm there are good women out there just like there are good men out here it's just that the bumps are so confident and so loud that we think that this is all there is but I'm here to tell you there's not stay strong stay informed most of all stay woke bomb bomb bomb behavior big bum image bum bum bum biddy biddy bum bum that's what this lady is bum",

    "voice_to_text": "um so I guess my account is just gonna be a submichanophobia horror story account because I have a story about this one it's not my story this is a second hand story thank god cause I don't think I could ever I don't think I'd be alive if I went on the jaws ride so never been on the ride um but I've worked and lived in Orlando Florida and in the theme parks for the past like 11 years so if you've been in the theme park if you've been in the major theme park past 11 years I probably checked your lap bar um or group two um so anyway I was training in a new location and I was with another person who I've never met and me and him were just talking and I was like oh where have you worked blah blah blah and I tell him where I work he tells me where he's worked and he goes oh yeah I also used to work the jaws ride at universal and I was like Ew and I was like that's intense and he was like yeah it was alright like it was whatever you know he was very like chill and when you work in a theme park any it doesn't matter where or which one everyone has that like one story that's like their Roman Empire it's their like most craziest situation it doesn't necessarily have to be like a bad guest or whatever but it is there like craziest story I have a couple that are just plain dumb and stupid but I asked him what his was and his was like he just goes oh when like a whole family of people just jumped off my boat at jaws and I was like excuse me and he was describing basically the part of fur in my face um he was basically describing the part where like the shark the animatronic shark in the water it's like outside it chases the boat right chases the boat into like a barn I know it's not necessarily a barn because it's in the water but like it's a it was a barn right and in that barn there's like explosives um not like real ones but like like just loud noises and like smoke and like all this stuff and it has the biggest and um it was like the biggest the strongest and like the heaviest shark animatronic like in the ride and cause it's supposed to like come out and then like forward and it's it's apparently massive like it's bigger than all the other ones um to make it look obviously it's jaws right so he said that he's spealing because it's kinda like Jungle Cruise with but jaws right so there's a person like a worker there with you and he was saying that he was uh he was like oh no no no but there was a whole side of the boat that just didn't speak English and or or not from this country and or what like not from from the US but they just didn't speak English so they thought that the shark was real and they wanted off of the boat so he said that they went he went to the barn he would like his whole stick is like oh okay guys we're good we're safe they started jumping off of the boat and he was like ah no no no no no don't don't jump off the boat don't jump off and then they like took grandma and threw grandma off the boat too and they were all treading water but the thing is is that there's a bunch of um like boxes and stuff to make it look like there's a dock but it's not a real docking place so and they kept they were like swimming around and he was like oh my and he was just standing there and he was like oh my god and he's like I have to do something in the next like point two seconds because this this shark which is under them so they're treading water and then the shark is right here waiting and I'm like I don't know I think I'd rather have a real shark down there I don't think I like imagine your foot hitting so anyway he was like um so the only thing that any any attractions person can do is hit the emergency stop so every boat has one in order to stop like and it stops everything right it doesn't stop just the shark it doesn't stop just the boat it stops everything so he was like I don't want grandma to go into cardiac arrest when this big old shark comes out so he just like Boop hits the e stop I'm sure that's not how he did it but the way he described and they're just treading water trying to get out but there's no they couldn't like find the exit because there was no exit because the exit is in the boat with the guy but they didn't understand and even I'm like oh my god and then so he was like I can't get in the water because if I get in the water I'm like abandoning shit and like he's like I'll get fired I don't wanna get fired and he's like I did all I could as long as they're not drowning like that's all that matters and they were all swimming but it was the fact that he just was like what you want me to do and then apparently apparently like all the leaders and all the like man he like radioed like what was going on and like all the leaders all security all management were coming in and they were like they finally they like found someone who could translate and I don't know what language they spoke and um they found someone who could translate and they're like they were freaking out cause they're like well there's a shark in the water and they're like it's fake and they're like Ew but just just seeing it and then like being in a dark barn and it and the big the biggest shark is underneath no I would also hate to be in the boat the one that didn't jump off I would hate to be that person just sitting there and being like oh well just knowing just knowing it's down there just knowing it's vibing and then your feet makes me sick",

    "voice_to_text": "I made this recording 10 minutes I don't know if it's gonna take that long but this story is a rabbit hole and it made me believe in the paranormal forever my boyfriend and I had a spiritual attachment for nine months started about a year ago when we went to see his family in South Carolina and go to a cemetery we went with the siblings to play Find My Grave with a spirit box find my grave is basically like you ask a spirit box questions and see if the spirit like guides you to their grave basically gives you clues and whatever so we start doing this and all of a sudden we hear these music notes coming out of a spirit box that were going Da Duh Da Duh and that was kind of the spirits answer as yes you know so like we would say is your grave over here um it will go Da Duh were you a man Da Duh and then we were like wait were you a music teacher and it goes Da Duh so that was pretty crazy we walked all around the cemetery trying to find this spirit very active with us and then all of a sudden everything went silent for like 25 minutes so then we were kinda like okay whatever maybe this is BS so we started to nickname this guy Music Man throughout this whole thing so we at the end decided to leave and we were like okay bye Music Man and after 25 minutes of silence it goes Da Duh and we were like holy crap is this recording okay um so few days go by we go home I used to work in an art gallery which I believe was haunted so I turn on the spirit box I was alone in the art gallery and I was like is there anybody here ha ha whatever and the first thing that happens is Da Duh so I felt a little unsettled but I was like okay maybe there's something wrong with the Spirit Box like this is just all been BS like it's just like a malfunction in the Spirit Box or whatever till I go in another ghost investigation with a psychic that I trust and I go with my boyfriend turn on the spirit box starts going Da Duh the psychic goes I'm seeing six people in a cemetery going with a spirit box I'm seeing like a really old cemetery I'm seeing a lonely man I'm seeing a lost grave you have something with you and we were like whoa how did you know how many people were with us you're seeing a lost grave and she's like yes you have someone with you he really likes your energy he died alone yada yada yada and we're like oh god and so during this time this spirit box is going Da Duh okay fast forward to our next ghost investigation we are in Griffith Park and I have this on camera I will post it again so you can see so we're doing this investigation we hear the Da Duh Da Duh Da Duh over and over again and then finally the Spirit box says and I have this on camera music man he started to identify what we were calling him his nickname and I start crying I get really emotional and I'm like you know your name is Music Man how and then he finally speaks for the first time and he has this accent and he goes I'm proud of it over and over again I'm proud of it and he goes family and all this kind of stuff and it made us really emotional yeah okay so here's the next thing we do another ghost investigation okay the Da Duh Da Duh is happening he also likes doing opera he'll go huh huh so he's like adding other music but you know it's him at this point like you know it's him okay I I don't even really know how to describe it but anyways he starts to send us a message during this ghost investigation and I have this all on camera he says the No. 34 at least 25 to 30 times he keeps going 34 34 34 34 and we're like what are you trying to tell us we we and he doesn't he doesn't tell us what he's trying to say okay so then the next day I'm going on an Instagram live I also have this on camera and I turn on the spirit box and I'm telling my audience what was going on with the 34 thing and all of a sudden in front of everyone on the live he starts saying 34 34 34 so many people saw this happening and we're like what does this number mean what is going on I looked at plotlines at the cemetery we were at I looked at codes I looked at angel numbers and I looked at everything and and I still haven't found the real answer to what 34 was okay but this gets even better so just keep watching at this point I'm just using Music Man in my ghost investigations I'm like hey can you see if there's another spirit like can you bring them out and and whatever and can you protect us whatever okay this is when it gets crazy my boyfriend's looking for something for me for Christmas and I love the misfits they're like one of my favourite bands and he is at a vintage store and in the back of a rack is this shirt no context misfits font and it says Music Man and he got it for me for Christmas but it was weird why was that sitting in the back this lady said at the store that it's been there for a while no one knows where it came from or what it is I know there's like the musical Music Man but it didn't look like one of those theater musical shirts right okay I have it I'll I'll show it to you guys hey this is the shirt Music Man there's nothing no more information about it anywhere on the shirt it just says Music Man okay I go ghost investigating a store I hear that Da Duh and I'm like hey Music Man like whatever ha ha and he goes present in his voice in his like howdy voice I'm going like what like what are you trying to say and he goes Christmas present he literally said Christmas present he is such an intelligent spirit and I know you guys are gonna start saying like oh he's negative whatever but no he never was like he felt in a weird way like family and I'm not trying to like sound crazy this I got info about him for multiple psychics and they're like no he died alone and like everyone I've told this story to feels like he was left on earth for some reason to learn a lesson to figure out something to be a part of something he did he wasn't a part of in his life like he wanted to experience something and now I think we went to the Clown Motel and he was there with us I have it all on camera too on my YouTube and I'm like oh that's Music Man he's going whatever he's like very reactive and then all of a sudden after that investigation he's he's gone he hasn't talk to us since and we're trying to wonder why like what happened and like sometimes we joke we're like oh we miss him whatever and I mean obviously like no it's not good to like have an attachment around you all the time but we wonder why like what was the moment like why did he finally leave after nine months of just trying to send us messages and and being so responsive and being so aware of our lives like what lesson did he learn and and that's what I'm still trying to figure out and I don't care if you guys don't believe me or not but this is a very real thing that happened to me and I have footage for most of this to back it up so if you're curious to learn more or if you know anything about why this happened or about the No. 34 like please let me know because this is what made me believe in the paranormal it was him saying a music man on the spirit box him sending us messages multiple times the Christmas present thing at the end was just like so insane and I'm still trying to just like figure it out and I wish I knew the reason but um that's my story thank you for watching if you watch this far I appreciate it and yes this is the craziest paranormal story I have had so far",

    "voice_to_text": "So I have a story that I don't mind sharing um simply because it is the clearest God has ever spoken to me about anything okay so my ex and I we broke up around May\u2014Mayish and we were pretty much no contact from May to August then in August we started talking again so one day we were talking he's like Uche you should come and see me he sends me the address and he's about five hours away and I was like Oof that's you know\u2014that's a journey I'll still come\u2026I'll still come but you know we're gonna have to plan this for a weekend where I can stay a little longer than just two three days like I wanna I want an extended weekend so we basically played it for like mid to late October and that was set  now from August to like  October when I left I was still single so I was still talking and like dating guys and on dating apps and so the very first sign I feel like God gave me was the night before I was supposed to go and see this man that was five hours away I went on a very promising date very promising showed up with flowers, we had great conversation um we went to a very nice winery like it was a very really nice date God was like here Uche here! please take this one and don't go and see that man that's five hours away and I was like nah nah God Imma still go see this man, I wanna see for myself anyway so the day comes for me to go  and I wake up super early, I put gas in my car I get on the road I start driving not even like an hour into this five hour journey right it starts to rain and I'm just like talking to God I think it's funny I\u2019m like God I know I know I should not be going to go see this man but this will be the last time we're gonna talk and have closure it's gonna be fine like it's gonna it's gonna be good last time\u2014I promise  I continue to drive and at the halfway point I think about two and a half hours in it starts to really pour it starts to really come down like I'm now going 30 or 40 on the interstate highway right put my hazards on, windshield wipers are maximum velocity and I still can't even see like 10 feet in front of me like it's raining that hard and again it's just me and God talking and I'm just like God I know you don't want me to go see this man but you can't stop me I thought that I was like YOU  CANT  STOP I'm going to go see this man I kid you not not even 15 minutes later my windshield wipers broke off both of them just broke off and fell by the wayside the saddest part about everything is that I pulled over cause I couldn't see couldn't see couldn't drive pulled over wait for the rain to clear once the rain cleared I picked up my phone punched in Autozone went to the nearest Autozone paid for new windshield wipers and continued on my journey to go see that man",

    "voice_to_text": "see you stitch this video with a story about somebody else flirting with your husband so I am debating if I even wanna post this um but I'm not gonna be using like names or anything like that so like we're not exposing anybody but I just feel like this is like like the red flags were there like I should have fucking seen it I should have cut the hell out of my life before I knew anything or before I found out all the shit that did happen so let's get into story time okay so back in the day um I was renting this house is like a two bedroom one bath it was decent had a like a little patio a nice little backyard like so I was like oh let's have some parties like it was nice little party house um so you know get your drink in I bring my friends my person at the time we wouldn't even give me whatever anyway um he brought would bring his friends over as well bubble boss like we'd always like chill have a good time like we cook drink play cards listen to music

that people would like be different different times whatever whatever but okay so particularly this one night we're all chilling my one close friend she uh just hit myself she drinks a little bit too much this first night she I put her to bed um gave her some water put her to bed just make sure she's good she's good she's sleeping and she was fine the whole night like woke up the next day totally fine she didn't throw up thank goodness anyways um so then I go back uh I'm chilling you know we're dancing still drinking more smoking blah blah blah so then I just see like still that same night like it just seemed like they were get like she just like was always around him and then like he go outside she go outside or like you know what I'm saying it was like following around type shit but I'm just like mmm so my dumbass probably at the time of I just kept drinking I'm like fuck it I don't see shit I just keep drinking I don't know so I now I wanna say it was like one o'clock in the morning I don't remember exactly the time like I guess that is a long time ago but I'm like phew I'm feeling good I think it's time for me to go lay my ass down so I go lay down and but I know like some people are still there like because my person still has some of his people over whatever whatever and but I thought she was leaving when I was going to bed but I guess not I don't know exactly

    "voice_to_text": "I just want to pop on here real quick to say what they're doing is extremely brave it is so brave and vulnerable to share such a personal experience and I commend them for that and I also wanna add my own experience to this discussion and the reason I want to do this to be very clear is because I feel especially with western attitudes there's this fear of making mistakes there's this fear of being seen as imperfect and yes I may be a scholar of languages and cultures but I wasn't always aware of my own biases and I think it is important to acknowledge that openly you know I didn't fall out of bed one day being aware about race inequality that was something I had to experience interact with witness a bunch of times and that's what I want to share that the first time I ever saw a black person TM as as they are in the movies right because Romania is white sadly and our people of colour are darker skinned but they're not dark all the way to the really really deep brown and I'm speaking purely in terms of colour shade right this is not about human value the first time I ever met a black person with a capital B was after I moved to New Zealand and after I moved to New Zealand there was a lot of new stuff to get up through my head those the new language the new weather the new culture the new way of doing things and then in my science class there's this black person and I've never seen somebody so dark and I'm 14 and I just remember feeling scared and then I remember going well that makes no sense why am I scared this person talks English like the rest of us and they're very polite to the teacher which is more than I can say for most of the Kiwi students so it doesn't make sense to me that I'm scared why am I scared so I was asking myself that and I figured I'm scared because I don't know anything about who they are what they like what country they're from and what they enjoy doing I have nothing to work with so when I don't know something I go and I look it up now of course you can't go and look up something about a person back in those days we had dial up right so after after class one day I run after them because I get they're very tall long legs and I just gather all my courage I muster all my courage and I look up to them and I go good morning and I come across a lot louder than I meant to because I was so nervous I was worried my voice wouldn't come out and long story short that was the beginning of a good friendship we still occasionally talk and when I was back in New Zealand we had a coffee and it was exactly like it had been when we were both in university so it's less that I discovered black people have real feelings TM because I already knew black people had real feelings I just didn't know how exactly the paradigm of Blackness fits within my understanding of the world right and that's not to depersonalise anybody to me people are always people and at the same time when I don't know much about a person I can't make up my mind what to do right so hilariously most of my friends in the first couple years of high school were um immigrant students and refugees and I I don't say this to to try and you know paint myself in a positive light or anything it's actually because they were the only people who had any sense of culture that I could relate to cause Kiwis were just not cultured that was the shock I wanted to talk about things yeah the the immigrant students were a lot better to talk to and that's how I learnt that we no longer refer to Iran as Persia because being a reader of a lot of historical fiction I knew of Iran as Persia and I had not clicked that there had been a few hundred years in the meantime again please forgive the grandma we did not have internet when I was growing up I did not know that it had changed names and it was now called Iran and it was no longer a kingdom I did not know that and so we had talks about this and you know how things changed and they actually I remember having this discussion where they told me you know in the 70s women in Iran were a lot more free than they are now and it's just confusing that you go forward in time but you somehow go backwards in terms of rights mind you again this is high school so it was a long time ago for me too TLDR your personal experience with people from different ethnic backgrounds is valid to you and it doesn't have to be perfect your experience with others is for you to learn and that doesn't mean that you need to let people being mistreated in front of you so that you can finally realise that they are people and they deserve respect no that's not what I'm saying I am saying to treat everybody with kindness and respect and whenever you find yourself thinking like oh these people will never blah because they're *insert ethnicity or nationality here* I just want you to pause I want you to pause and wonder have you met every person of that nationality or ethnicity in the world because unless you have there is no way you know everything about them and making mean judgements isn't helpful for anybody this is not to preach this is to remind people that we are all on our journey to learn more about our own humanity and the way we do that is by approaching people with kindness and sometimes that means not taking over dialogues and not sitting there and listening to people berate others because it's more comfortable for us I truly think that the only way for us as humanity to go forward is for people to come forward about their own experiences because the way in which your particular life has impacted the way you see others is so unique in every case and biases you my thing that biases are are things that just exist unchecked but there is a reason why people develop biases and that doesn't make them valid things that doesn't mean that they deserve to to mistreat others what that still means is they come for a reason and if if you for yourself can figure out what that reason is you can defeat that bias and that is the thing that will help all of us",

And I know no story that I'm gonna say is gonna top the one I just did, but another one with him was when I went to labor with my first son. It happened real quick, but I've been telling him all that. He wasn't home all day. I'm telling him, like, I'm going to labor. I'm pretty sure, um, he was, you know, whatever, with his brother doing something, so I. So I let him on my way to hospital. He says, on his way, but it's taking a long time. He was far, but he wasn't that far. All right, cool. Whatever. So, um, I'm about to push, and I'm calling him, like, where are you at? You said you was on your way. And he is like, can you just wait for me? I'm sorry, that's not how this works. And I have been waiting for you to get here for hours. I mean, like, six hours to get there. All right? So he ends up coming, and I'd already had the baby. And this lady, this is my cousin, who I'm. I did not want even there, let alone. She cut his umbilical cord because this man was not there, okay? He comes in with a coat, and I'm like, you wasn't wearing a coat when you left. So why does this man have his brother drop Him off at the house instead of the hospital. And walked from the house to the hospital and missed his son's birth on purpose. And then when I called him out on it, on it, he said, I was just scared. This would be his third baby, sir. I was scared. This was my first baby. And you chose to walk to the hospital instead of having a ride and actually being there, being present. You walked because you were scared? Yeah. Should have known then. That was first baby. But hard hit makes a soft ass.",

    "voice_to_text": "this video brought up some trauma for my past that I thought I had forgotten about but apparently just buried very deep and I feel like this is a good opportunity to share a story I started a new job this was roughly eight years ago maybe um maybe longer maybe like 10 years as a direct service provider for adults with disabilities and I had several of my new co workers that warned me about this one supervisor who really liked to pull people into her office and criticize what they were wearing um Mark them for not following a dress code um and it was a fairly basic dress code um I would I would compare it to similar similar as like like a high school um you know like no spaghetti straps um no shirts would like offensive sayings on it just common sense um so this supervisor wasn't my personal supervisor but she was a supervisor to half of the workers um out of this facility not my supervisor um so I really didn't have much contact with her um other than just occasionally being in the same building um she one day we were all meeting at the office and I had my client who so just to give you some context my client um was a large man who was supposed to be a two on one case meaning they're supposed to be two workers to his one person um just because he was very much a flight risk didn't understand you know dangers of like traffic and stuff like that um you couldn't just like say he hey hold on stay here for a minute I'm gonna run and use the bathroom and have him stay there um so just for safety reasons he was considered a two on one however I was the only person that was fully trained and I worked with him one on one every single day um and yeah so that's its own thing but anyways so here we are in a group setting in the office and um I'm gonna use her name her name is Jan she called me into her office and said she needed to talk to me and I was very conflicted cause I'm like here I am with my guy like I can't just be like hey just like hang out here while I go have a meeting right so I was like I'm I'm sorry if you need to talk to me you can talk to me out here because I can't leave my client like I'm not gonna just leave him out here unattended because that's obviously not safe um this got the attention of the whole office everyone was staring at us um and I had a couple people who were you know workers like me they came over and they said don't worry about it we'll watch your guy for like five minutes you go and have your quick meeting or whatever so I go into Jan's office and she shuts the office door and she goes behind her desk and she looks at me and she's like I just saw your butt I was like excuse me I don't know what you're talking about and she's like your shorts are way too short and I just saw your butt um and I know this isn't actually true I know she did not see my butt because I am very mindful and careful about the types of clothes that I wear just because like I am not comfortable to wear things like that that would show my butt um if that's what you wanna wear that's totally fine for you I'm just not comfortable wearing that on my body um so I was already a little bit upset that she felt like she was lying like why are you saying you just saw my butt like if you think my shorts are inappropriate that's a conversation we can have but for you to just lie and be like oh I just saw your butt when you didn't um so my guard was already up um going into the office her saying that and I was like okay um I don't believe you saw my butt because I told her that I pride myself on you know wearing fairly conservative clothing um and she's like well you need to go home and change and I was like okay well I said I can take my client home because his mom is home all day long um I will take him home I will go change and then I will come back and I turned around to open the door to the office to leave and she jumped in front of me like ripped the door out of my hand and slammed it shut in front of me and blocked my way out and she was like I wasn't done talking to you she like screamed right in my face and I was like at this point this is not a conversation I will not tolerate you yelling at me you brought to my attention that I was wearing something inappropriate and that I needed to leave to change and that is what I'm trying to do I'm trying to leave your office and now you're blocking me from getting out I said you need to move and let me get out of this office um and she again she's like I wasn't done talking to you and then at that point I don't even remember what she said I was ready to fight this woman um I did end up pushing her out of my way and I opened the door and I left um I took my client I brought him home and I was talking with his mom about what happened she kind of helped calm me down and she was like this woman is notorious for treating people that way she's like you need to report her and she was right I did need to report her it just took me a minute to calm down to realize what had actually happened um she was like you know you could even file a police report like she held you against your will in that office and she absolutely did like I had to fight her to get out of her office um I think I handled the situation very well considering the fact that I don't like to be somewhere that I can't get out of um I remained level headed she flew off the handle I don't know what her problem with me was I don't know why she was picking on me um but I did end up filing a report I reported it to my supervisor immediately and I then drafted an email to like the highest up in the company and icced everybody including her in the whole report I did like a whole report I did a letter um and honestly being around her was very difficult after that I felt not safe and I felt like she wasn't safe to have um clients around you know adults with disabilities that are could very easily be taken advantage of uh I did not feel like she was a safe person so we had a mandatory meeting where she had to apologize to me and I said I hear your apology but I don't accept it because it it wasn't an actual apology it was like oh you know like oh I got she never actually said I am sorry she like gave excuses and I was like yeah I don't accept that like thanks thanks but no no thank you um and ultimately she was invited to retire early so I didn't get her fired but I did get her invited to retire early and she worked there for like another year and then she retired and she was a bully an extreme bully and I was the first person that actually stood up to her and everyone that I worked with all my co workers were like oh my god like thank you for standing up to her like everyone was so scared of this woman like she was a bully um just some old white woman that's just like out here hating people like for no reason so don't know really what her issue was with me personally um cause I had never interacted with her before that so anyways yeah that's my story about angry old white women in the workplace",

    "video_description": "#stitch with @audacitii that was probably the worst butternut squash soup I ever made. if I find the house on Google I'll post it I've felt things more than seen em but this was too personal. could some the vibe be explained away a chemical leak or toxins on the property yep, but there's no explanation for the things moving around & other people on different properties next to it we're able to grow stuff on the land, there were a few sparse  little weeds  near the concrete but most of it was dirt and those Utah weeds get really tall. (I think they  mentioned that the owner wanted to seed lawn but it didn't take but it was all a long time ago) someone please check my other vids in the bus for dust particles could just be the lighting from the rainstorms they looked like dust to me, especially the second one but  yeah, I'm not necessarily a believer in these things but I'm not cynical either... I like to let stuff like this sit in maybe... this one tho was too much, I've experienced a lot but I never know for sure, the mind is a funny thing, I I don't wanna discount it's capabilities or discount the paranormal as it could just be stuff we don't have explanations for yet, tho I have a few ideas about these things & how they work.  some theorize poltergeists are stored up energy from a person who releases a lot of energy (some even use the term ectoplasm but I mostly just call it energy), sometimes that energy pools & sometimes that energy becomes a 'thoughtform' with the ability to move things but this (or these) thing(s) seemed more like a collection of energies with one or a few malicious ones.(the scariest presence felt masculine, there was also what felt like a child like or young presence) & it seemed like it was something that had been alive, not like something that was created, could have been a mixture of both but the folks who lived there didn't have this problem follow them.  some think poltergeists are extra dimensional, some think they are just unalive, some think there's possibility they can be any of these things and that u have to pinpoint which thing is going on. I wish we tried for a sand message I did tell em to try leaving an empty cup out  & then full but they didn't wanna. I ain't the best storyteller but I gotta get this stuff outta my head & tell folks so I don't forget what happened. #ghoststories #trueghoststory #spooky #priceutah  #haunted #scarystories  #haunting #ghosts #ghoststory #medium #scary #scarystory #storytime #scarystorytime #horror #ghosttok #scarytiktok  #hauntedtiktok #haints #hauntedhouse  #paranormal #paranormalinvestigator #ghosthunting #ghosthunter #ghosthuntersoftiktok #poltergeist #thoughtforms  #carboncountyutah #carboncounty #spookybasement #hauntedbasement #hauntedutah #iseedeadpeople  #paranormalinvestigation #sprites #ectoplasm  #orbscaughtoncamera #energy ",

That shit was wild. Um, I'll put a picture of myself right here. This is at their gym. If I could put it up there. But when we came back, we saw the article that some lady, you know, passed away in the water tank. And we didn't know it was a hotel Cecil until we saw the address. And we're like, that's the stay on main address we were at. We were staying at the Hotel Cecil, and we didn't even know.",

So basically, I have a new story. You know how little couple, like. Oh my god. Almost a month ago, I did a video about two people meeting for a date. I have a story that's related to that comedy sketch. Listen to this story. So I have just come back from a trip in Belgium. I went to go see a couple mates, uh, and we gallivanted around Belgium like a bunch of lunatics. Anyway, we were in Brussels then we sat in one, uh, in this lovely park in front of a lovely fountain. And, um, as I was like a little creep than I am, I was people watching. And, um, we sat on this bench, and over to the left, um, was this guy. And he'd been sat there probably longer than we had been actually there. Um, again, I cocked him, but I was like, he's doing nothing. I'm more interested in the police officers over there, cause they were being silly. So as we were sat there, um, I watched a girl come across our peripheral vision. I was like, oh, what she doing? And she walked over and she started chatting to him. I was like, oh, we must know each other. And then I started listening in because she Was speaking English. I just presumed she was just gonna speak a different language, she spoke English. And. And then I listened, and she was like, oh, American. I was like, oh, interesting. Okay, I can hear this conversation. I'm gonna listen in anyway. The gusto of this woman. Mwah! She asked for his number, so they. They didn't. They didn't. Beautiful, lovely bit of chatting. She talked about how she lived there for two years and she was going to uni. And she was like, oh, and I'm doing this and doing this. And he was. He was responding. I just don't think, as chatty, but it doesn't matter, because she kind of slowly, slowly worked up to asking him for, um. For his number. And I gave it to her. And when I sell you, when I tell you that this. This woman, she literally. This is exactly what happened. She took. She was right this. And then she. As she turned back, she went, thank you. It's very funny, but it was very, very, very, very sweet. And it was just something really lovely to say. And, um, she walked away with her friend, and they, uh. You can see them walking off together, giggling. And, uh. You know, I kept an eye on the dude, and he just. He just glowed. He just. He just glowed in his. In this sense of appreciation. And, um, I just thought it was so. It was so Sweet. It was so tender. And it was. Yeah. So there you go. I've witnessed another happy story. They seem to be following me around. I do have another, but I'm gonna save it for another day. But there you go. That's my happy story for today. So people still ask for people's numbers in parks? Still happens. Anyway, have a good day. I love you all, and I'll speak to you later.",

And when they discharged him, when they found out that he was sick, some kind of way he lied to see about getting benefits for life under the guys. That our daughter, who was actually in the hospital and needed surgery, needed benefits. How would he take care of her? So the United States government is taking care of him for the rest of his life.

    "voice_to_text": "she goes on to say that she was always praying against the things that I was praying who ma'am thank you for sharing your story in that video she said that she was a friend to someone for five years they had a friendship she thought where this lady was supporting her but every time she would tell her what she was praying for what she was hoping for what she wanted to accomplish this particular friend was praying against the things that she wanted in hopes that it wouldn't happen for her I think more women need to hear these types of stories so they can pay attention when they start to feel their intuition and their discernment kick in no that that backhanded compliment that you just received is exactly what you thought it was I am going to share my story with you not to bad mouth anybody not to speak anything bad against anybody cause I would never want to do that but I will share my learning experience with you a year ago I was looking for solid female friendships where the ladies that I was hoping to be friends with I felt they were thriving they were living in their moment they were successful they had successful jobs but there was one particular friend that formed the group of us together and within this group we were getting ready to go out of the country I had paid for my tickets I had paid for my 18 hour flight and I was ready to go and and I thought she was a beautiful person on the inside and out but I found myself questioning some of the things that she would say to me I was receiving backhanded compliments and I would question it then I would toss it to the side because of course she's my friend and it's constructive criticism and she wants to be a big sister to me during this time I'm seeing a beautiful person who wants to do well for themselves and I am supporting that and I'm thinking hey they're just like me you know I wanna do well I have a good job I have a home I'm taking care of myself and we're out here dating and we're having our own experiences but we're successful in our own right my discernment was kicking in but I was ignoring it well until this one incident after paying for my tickets and my flight I was extremely excited to be going out of the country with this group of young ladies and unfortunately that didn't happen this is how I got to that resolution of not going out of the country on one particular day I'm sitting working in a meeting on a conference call and I get this long text message from this young lady saying that she had gone out the night before and the dude that I was dating had walked up to her and asked for her phone number and she had put her phone number in that man's phone and she said she was getting me evidence mind you I said my discernment was kicking in right so what she didn't know was that me and this person weren't seeing eye to eye we weren't quite getting along so I was putting some distance in between him and I and I was also putting distance between her and I cause I was observing some things not knowing it was gonna come full circle at this time I'm thinking to myself when I get this text I know I ain't read that so I call her up to get a better understanding of what had taken place and she doubled down on what she had sent me in a text message it was in that single moment that I was confirmed with my thought process of how I had been feeling about the friendship why would this woman who claims to be my older sister or want to help me to do better just in general put her phone number in the man that I was dating phone for evidence my mind exactly that's what my mind did immediately went to she doesn't know me why does she feel she has that evidence why can't she just call and text my phone and say the dude you talking to ask for my contact information while I was out last night and I wouldn't do that to you girl well that was how I would handle the situation I look at things a lot differently than a lot of people and if we are friends why would you feel the need to get evidence to show me what type of person I was dating but because I had put that distance in between her and I she didn't even know what I was experiencing with him but before that she was saying don't date him he's going to punish you he's a narcissist he's all these things I would rather just experience this person on my own but I had already been experiencing some of the things she was calling out which is confirmation that he wasn't a good person but if she felt that way about him what was the purpose I had put her number in his phone he was also very successful he also had an expensive car he also had a nice home but he was all these bad things why would she feel the need to put her phone number in his phone thing it did for me was confirmed that I didn't need to be with him and I didn't need to be around her so that's how I got to the resolution of I'm not going out the country with these ladies because there's one of them that I don't necessarily trust nothing against that group of women sat I sat with my feelings for a week I went through the motions I asked myself was I was I tripping I spoke to my therapist my counselor had an open discussion about that and it was confirmed no you're not tripping you're not tripping how you feel is value your feelings are valid if there is a boundary that was broken between you and someone else your feelings are valid and that's a hard boundary for you don't don't dismiss yourself from what you experienced so I did end up texting that ladies group and I said you guys unfortunately I won't be able to go to Greece um something came up I didn't wanna bad mouth her I didn't wanna talk about her I didn't wanna talk about our personal experience I didn't wanna do anything in that group because I felt like that's that's not lady like first of all that's not supporting the group and and those women and and the unity that the group was supposed to represent but I knew I needed to remove what I spent all that money on this trip and all I was able to get back was credits ha ha a lot of money out there that was sitting until I decided to go on vacation or fly or whatever but I didn't lose it that was a plus who based on that there was only one person from that group that actually reached out to me individually and said hey I hate to hear that you're not going on this trip are you okay and I shared with her how I got to the resolution of why I wasn't going not in a bad mouthing way not in a way to put another woman down but to explain how I got to my resolution for not wanting to go out of the country with someone that I felt like I couldn't trust share this story with everyone so that when you feel your discernment and your intuition speaking to you or popping out or you get a gut feeling that something is not right listen to yourself you are not going to let yourself down and if you find that you ever are in a compromising situation if it's able to be fixed you can fix it but listen to your intuition and your discernment when you deal with others this is not a video to bad mouth a single soul this was just my experience on how I observe friendships and how I choose to move according to what I have experienced does not have to simply be friendships it can be family it can be relationships it can technically be anyone if you ever have a question in your spirit about someone genuinely cares about you or if someone genuinely has your best interest or you have a inkling this big that someone is doing something underhanded or backhanded pay attention and move accordingly I would dare say move around but put a little bit of space in between you it ain't gotta be you acting funny it ain't gotta be you even treating anybody any differently but you're doing it for you your peace your happiness and your ability to see what you need to see for your own good I simply hope that this story helps somebody cause if you're experiencing something and you feel like the person may not have your best interest chances are you're not steering yourself in the wrong direction listen to yourself all right y'all I hope y'all have a good day",

    "voice_to_text": "creations you've been in where you've used your intuition and when I was about 23 years old I would go on late night walks by myself and I would smoke some tree beforehand uh which would add a layer of fun and also sometimes a layer of paranoia I lived in a middle class suburban neighborhood I felt safe doing this and never had any issues before this night so on this night in question it was a Friday around 10 10:30 so not super late and I'm walking down the street that is curved so if you're on one end of the street you can't see the end of the other two vehicles come up from behind me a sedan and a truck and the moment that they passed me my alarm bells went off my intuition starts telling me danger danger and I tell myself you're just being paranoid no because of the truth one of the vehicles was a sedan and I could see five bodies in there they were of larger build so I immediately assumed that they were men and the truck was a lifted truck that was tinted I couldn't see in there they drive past me and they stop at the end of the street the direction that I'm going at the stop sign side by side I don't know if they were talking but a little time passed and then the truck took a right and knowing the neighborhood I knew that all that truck had to do was take a few more rights and they'd be right back behind me on on the street so the sedan with the five bodies is ahead of me at the stop sign not moving that's the direction I'm going and I have to pass it to get off the street and everything is telling me do not pass that car at some point while I'm walking and I start slowing down because again the intuition is saying don't walk past the car I see headlights behind me I can't see the vehicle cause I'm past the curve but they look a little higher up like maybe on a lifted truck as I'm walking I get um as close as I want to which wasn't close at all and I stall I pretend to be on my phone while I think what to do as I'm telling myself you're just being paranoid it's just the tree you're just being paranoid um but I knew that I didn't wanna walk past that car and I didn't know what the headlights were behind me but at some point I decided to take my chances with the headlights and I turned around and started walking the direction I came from so within about 30 seconds of turning around um the headlights come toward me and I see that it's the truck and this all happened very quickly the truck speeds toward me and on the wrong side of the street to get to where I am on the sidewalk and then I knew this is not uh me being paranoid this isn't the tree this is happening so I start running and they slam on their brakes between them slamming on their brakes and how long that takes and me running I get about two houses between us so two houses between us I go up a stranger's driveway and I am in a defensive stance ready to go pound on the door or call the police there's still a part of me that thinks that I'm being paranoid my adrenaline is rushing and I don't know what to do two men get out of the truck and I'm in defense stance and they stare me down we stare at each other and I assume that they're contemplating if I am still worth pursuing at this point and after what seemed like an eternity they get back in the truck and they drive off so I know that if I didn't listen to my intuition when they initially drove by and I wrote it off as paranoia I wouldn't have been paying attention to the vehicles and I would have walked past that car at the stop sign and I probably wouldn't be here today",

If you haven't already heard about it, go ahead and watch the whole first video. This is coming from a mom who's had a child at a very, very young age. And also, I had a mother who did not raise me, and my grandmother raised me. But we are gonna start off with this whole situation. Is this horrible? Those poor kids are suffering no matter what. Like, I could not imagine already going through a horrible and stressful situation, uh, with your mother dropping off at CPS, but then having it also go viral on TikTok. And it's gonna be like, they're gonna grow up and they're gonna see all this, and already they're probably seeing so much about it. So I know she's mentally unfit, and she just pretty much just had a mental breakdown over all this. But still, I don't think she'll realize she did the right thing in a way. But also, if she were to, like, fix up her life and try and get her kids back, it is gonna be very hard. Now, I'm not saying she shouldn't get her kids back. I just think it's gonna take too much time to rebuild her relationship with her children and earn their trust back. Because when you still think about it, what she did, She could have done privately. She could have not done all those lives and all those videos. And then maybe I would see more potential of her possibly getting her children back. But right now or anytime soon, I don't think she should. It's still better though that she picked to drop them off, because I could imagine possibly what their home life was going to be like if she already was that overwhelmed, that mentally stressed out, and she just couldn't handle anything anymore. And then they just feel like probably they're not wanted. Like it was it. And then like, who knows how much longer it would have just taken for CPS to come into the situation anyways.",

    "voice_to_text": "hey so did I ever tell you guys about the time that my friends handcuffed me and left me alone inside one of the most notorious cells inside the West Virginia State Penitentiary tried to scare me and then ultimately we ended up catching a ghost that had something to say about that scare no well let me get into it okay so picture this it's August 2023 around 2 3:00 30 ish in the morning I have been helping my friends out in Haunted Nights events as we put on a ghost hunting event um all night long where you can come and investigate with us and we were at uh the Mountsville Penitentiary or the West Virginia State Penitentiary and it\u2019s considered to be one of the most haunted persons inside the United States um it earlier in the night I had made a comment in passing saying that I wanted to be a little bit more braver this season and kinda like test out my fear and I thought that maybe my fear of putting myself in some very uncomfortable positions would entice the ghost and entice some paranormal activity so I to much to very much protest I ended up following my friends down to one of the most notorious cells inside of the prison and I ended up getting handcuffed to the side of the bed um for a solo  so as I was sitting there handcuffed my friend was propping up my phone to record a video of me for however long I was gonna be in there and um little did I pretty much little did I know a friend was actually in the next cell next to me waiting for everyone to leave so I could be completely alone um so he could give me one good scare before they ultimately sent me off to do this solo completely alone um so after I was handcuffed and my phone was all situated everyone pretty much went outside to the yard area which was a good yell away in case I truly truly needed them um so my friend Dylan who was sitting in the cell next to me he waited for me to do the like this little monologue um where I was basically saying \u201cmy friends just left me alone inside one of the most notorious cells inside the West Virginia State Penitentiary\u201d and as I was saying that he pounded on the wall next to me and scared the absolute crap out of me um in the video you can see me jump um I had a few choice words for him and you know we we exchanged some laughs and at one moment I remember looking at him and going \u201care you just gonna let me do this\u201d and it was at that moment where we caught an an unexpected bang come from down a few cell I don't know if it was the cell next to me or a couple cells down if it was the cell door getting slammed or just a pounding happening somewhere um but we caught a bang mid sentence and he Dylan quickly looked at me and goes \u201cthat wasn't me\u201d so in my head  I thought it was our other friend Steve who loves to mess with me and I instantly went  \u201coh so that was Steve\u201d and he goes no we're the only two in here and I mind you I am still handcuffed to this bed and in the video you can try to like just see me process everything that was happening and at one point he just goes okay good luck and and ultimately I was left alone um nothing after that happened but I caught it I caught it on camera and what makes this even better is that when Dylan went outside to go join everyone else who was in the yard waiting for me um they they heard the bang that he initially did they heard me yelling at him and then they heard the second one and when he went outside um to go meet with them they asked him why he scared me again and he quickly sat there and he quickly said um it wasn't me it must have been ghost um so so yeah ha ha that was it's just it's just weird little moment that I had I truly never thought that I would have um and it's one which one moment that I constantly think back to because who the hell was it and in my head I feel like they saw Dylan scare and was like oh you're trying to scare her let me do one better and they got me the ghost that Westpen got me so as a ghost under a paranormal investigator I have a whole bunch of these stories but this is the one story with evidence to back it up that I truly cannot understand or yeah cannot understand cannot wrap my head around it and we're going back in a couple of weeks so I think round two is gonna have to happen but like I said I have the video of this I've been holding on to it for so long for like almost a year now um there are handful of people who bully me to try to post this and it's just been my little secret gem um but if you guys wanna see it and you want you wanna hear all of this for yourself um I'll gladly post it so comment below I will I will uh tag a random comment and I will post the video thanks guys",

Like, I don't know, I just always feel like going on the internet and, like, talking about how you need better friends when you already have friends is really weird. Like, if you.

(which I absolutely loved)  Our program would get us excursions for us for free. And one was to Buckingham Palace and I went because it was free. I thought I could at least appreciate the architecture ---I love some Fancy Rococo, you know gilded architecture but the overwhelming memory I have with a red of like red walls, red carpet...and it just gave me the feeling I ---maybe I was just too enslaved on my Black American side and to colonize don my Ghanaian side to escape it,  but I just felt like everything was covered in blood. I just remember like walking. At first I was strolling and then I was walking and I was speed--- I was speed running this tour cause I was just sort of like I felt like I had to get out of there. I I felt like I was being trapped and I like I didn't --- I feel like I couldn't catch my breath until I got to the garden and that's when I enjoyed myself was  like being outside um I don't remember much of the tour except the very powerful feeling of red and so um Maybe they thought the red was a good idea, genuinely,  'cause they don't see it being covered in blood. They see it matching the red walls and the red carpet. But I know what we see  And now because of, \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f app. maybe they know what we see too um While you're here this is the Abu Dagga family family that um when the daughter 23 year old Raghad reached out to me asked for my help in boosting their gofundme they have made it according to um the lovely organizer Rebecca Um from Rafa to Khan Younis  but they're still trying to get to Egypt and you know they still need tents there you know they're being this place to get ahead again they need money to live and anything anything folks can donate is helpful you got $5 you got $1 send it on down check out the Bink in my Lio um you can get right to it there and I'd be so grateful thank you. \ud83d\ude18",

she did not unalive me in that moment that I booked the wrong train car um it was actually one that we shared with four other people luckily we only had two other people in our train car thank god um so so there were two other guys that were in our train car and um I found my train man so there were these two other guys the one was an older gentleman who just kinda like did his own thing he chilled out in like the hallway area and then he's like ready to bed he's like sorry guys I'm like going to bed and we're like yeah no problem so we went to the hallway um with Train Man me and my best friend with Train Man um because we became besties with Train Man um so this all started because I had put my bed sheet up wrong um first he helped me figure out how put the bed down for one but then the second thing was that he told me my bed sheet was wrong he's like hey so like actually this you should use the other sheet it'll be a little more comfortable and I was like thank you um so I changed it and then when I went back out I was like so like are you from from here and he was like well no no no I'm just living here now I'm from you know where we're going and from there it just my love story so I was doing um my thing and totally flirting with this man definitely seemed like he was flirting back with me and when I debrief with my friend after she was like no there was definitely some like chemistry I was feeling it like it was not just you babe and I was like cool happy that it was not just me um so like there was just like some witty banter back and forth um he bought us beers because I said that I don't like beer and he's like no no no we're gonna make you like beer so he bought us beers um and then I didn't finish my beer so he's like no no no I'll take it I'll finish it don't worry so the beer didn't go to waste don't worry guys but he was like see you'll like it and then you have all these good memories with drinking beer and then you'll like beer and I was like didn't know didn't know I was signed up for therapy today but thank you um um so then we're like we're like okay we need we're getting tired we need to go to bed um oh my god I didn't even tell you guys the best part so like my my philosophy I shouldn't say philosophy but like I am someone who if you tell me that I'm funny rather than telling me I'm pretty I'm gonna melt this man told me I was funny um it was great and he was like asking us all these questions about us like he was so sweet I like definitely was like I wish I lived here I was also telling like all of my friends and family that I was gonna fall in love in Italy um I did not fall in love in Italy per se but I think I might have had a big crush in Europe in general with train man and I haven't had a crush in a very long time so guys I mean uh oh here um so this is where I messed up I mean I messed up guys I didn't get any any form of information on him like I have no way to contact this man um like he literally could have been the love of my life I'm also fully convinced all of my life does not live in Cleveland Ohio but that they live overseas and I think that I might have found him I'm gonna live in my delulu um but I now have no way of contacting this man um didn't get an Instagram didn't get a phone number because I am an idiot um so like I don't know TikTok can you help me do your thing so like um I I know his name I know you know how old he is what he does for a living where he's from where he lives but didn't get his phone number didn't get his Instagram I've been trying to find him on social media and I can't um but like you know like there's like I'm a hopeless romantic so TikTok I don't know I mean if you're able to do your thing um our train ride was on Monday May 6th at like nine o'clock in the end 9 10 o'clock at night like 9:52 at night um to Ko\u0161ice from Prague um so like if you know someone who was on that train um and they met two really great girls the one who they might also have a crush on who lives in Cleveland Ohio um hi I'm Kaitlyn I'm the girl that you met on the train",

    "voice_to_text": "This is story time on how I caught my ex cheating on me using my own phone. Girl, same. So I have an ex boyfriend, was like, 22 years old, and he worked a lot in China. And at this time, not all phones worked on all continents. In order for your phone to work everywhere, including America and China, it would have to be something called triband. And one of my old phones happened to be triband. So he would take it with him to China when he worked and just put a SIM card in there. At the same time, I was booking a lot of dances and performers into nightclubs, and one afternoon, I was, like, texting around, trying to find someone to do a job. For some reason, my phone just wouldn't start up. So I went to grab this old phone and put my SIM card into it. Now, I know this might be hard to believe for some of you guys who are younger, but you didn't used to be able to just, like, tap everyone that you wanted to text. You would have to, like, forward the text to everyone separately, one at a freaking time. Can you imagine how long that used to take? So you would go into your sent box and then forward the message from there to the next person. Now, I would like you to please bear in mind that this is my phone, okay? So I go Into the send box to send this message to the next person. And I come across a message sent to one of my boyfriend's friends, DJ named Nick. Hi, Nick, if you're watching this. Saying, she's so hot. I can't stop thinking about her, Nick. And again, hi, Nick. Thank you for this. Has text back being like, hi, what about Sam, your girlfriend? He sent back some bullshit about me working away a lot, whatever. Which was true, but also like, you sent that message while you're in China, bro. We're gonna discuss the confrontation in part two.",

niece's life and this is gonna be my second time recording this because I got so caught up in telling the story the first time that I forgot that I was supposed to be doing my hair as I was telling you but anyway I think I was about I don't know somewhere between like six and nine years old at the time I think like in the 6 7 8 year old range young and um I won't be in my grandma's house because um at that time that's where I stayed mostly when my parents weren't together and at that time they were not together my dad had like scampered off somewhere so it's probably like closer to 8 or 9 years old um but anyway we're all in my grandma my grandma's house all the kids we're all outside playing it's me my three nephews and my niece my baby niece she was um a toddler at the time when she wasn't talking but she was up and about so she was outside playing with us and um I think I was the oldest there but I mean we were all kids well as I plan you know doing whatever the adults are on the porch you know gossiping whatever mom is there my mom is there but my sisters I don't think either my sisters were there I have two older sisters but anyway we're outside playing and um one of my grandmother's boyfriends he was off somewhere and this man he was way of their age but blind his back and should not have been behind the wheel like he really should not have um he was yeah but but he was this is the 80s so he was out driving probably went to like the grocery store something like that and I remember he drove this old Volkswagen old station wagon I'm sorry it was like the old brown ones like um with the yellow stripe like in married with children or the Wonder Years um like one of those and it was kind of in bad shape cause it was pretty up there you know he took pretty good care of it but anyway the Greek the brakes would squeak like that was one of the only things that was wrong with it from that squeak we knew his car cause it's super loud I hear his brakes coming around the corner and I don't know where we got this cart from like grocery cart one of the metal ones I don't know where it came from I don't know why it was in the driveway I don't know how my niece ended up in it but she was and it was and uh Grandma's boyfriend was was skating around the corner he's almost at the house and like I don't remember all the details of this because I don't remember a whole lot of my childhood in general but anyway I remember uh running as fast as I could and grabbing the cart handle and yanking my niece out of the way just as he was pulling into the driveway and like it wasn't when he came to stop it wasn't like a normal stop he skidded I remember hearing his brakes skid like more than they usually did cause of those old riding car but um yeah um gained her out of the way just in time and uh all the adults that were on the porch were like oh my goodness thank goodness you did that oh my gosh what just happened blah blah blah cause they weren't paying attention they were probably half drunk but but anyway um grab my niece out of the cart make sure she's okay she was a little stunned I remember her eyes being real big but she was okay grab her make sure she's all right um carry her over to the house like over to the porch and I handed her to I think my great grandma cause uh there were five generations of us alive at the time of women on that side alive at the time and for the most part um we were all kind of in the same house hand off my niece and my grandma is like or my grandma's cause there was two of them on the porch and I think somebody else I think a neighbor that we were all really close to but I don't remember anything about her um except that she was nice um they are all just like heap and praise and they're hugging on my niece and taking her in the back to make sure she's all right and like even my nephews were like you know like pats and all that kind of stuff even they were impressed and I was so proud of myself and I was so excited and I was so happy because I was excited to meet my niece for one thing cause she was so cute like little doll um and I loved being around her and I absolutely adored my sister her mom so it was like especially special for me to do something for that sister because she didn't have any allies at that time so um and even as a kid I saw how wrong it was so but it that's not what this the point of the story is about even though it is gonna be relevant in a second handing my niece off going down the line getting all the wonderful praises and um I get to my mom I really look on her face of just absolute hatred and then I was inhaling to say something don't ask me what it was I don't remember a whole lot of details about this except for this I was inhaling to say something cause like I'm all cheesing and grinning all kind of stuff like that and everybody's all thrilled and before I could take the breath to speak she slapped me in the face as hard as she could and um I mean I was shocked and everybody else was shocked and there was just like a silence for a couple of seconds it was thick it was heavy like like that split second it was like all the air got sucked out of outside somehow but anyway I'm I mean my face hurt but even more so my heart was broken and so my dog was shaking and so um like I ran away crying because I was really embarrassed like more than anything cause like there were a lot of people outside that day and I didn't know what in the world was going on and why I got hit for helping somebody um especially family but anyway as I'm running away I still heard my grandma asked her why did you do that I don't remember if it was like an angry or if it was just a really disappointed like a why did you do that um she asked and here's her reasoning now keep in mind I am no older than about 9 years old her reasoning was she wouldn't do it for me yeah um she hit me in face because I pulled a toddler out of the way and she believed that I a 7 8 9 year old would not do the same for her even though there had been plenty of times that I had spoken up on her behalf in different situations because up to a certain age where I just kinda gave up I was not afraid to say exactly what was on my mind more about that later I know I look like I don't know what I'm doing but this is just very hard to concentrate on while I'm thinking about this anyway she uh that was her reason she said that I wouldn't do it for her so um I don't remember anything else after that about that particular incident except just everybody being shocked um and I'm smiling when I'm saying that I don't know why I'm on a lot of medications right now because otherwise I would be sobbing but um yeah I got hit in the face for saving somebody's life",

The way that I'm literally so stunned right now, and I know everybody hates follow up videos that are like, I didn't expect this to blow up the way that it did. I didn't. I was getting 27 views. I have less than 10,000 followers, and I got 500,000 views. And I feel so stupid because I didn't ask anybody to join me in the pledges. So I pledged to donate 10 cents for every, like, 50 cents for every comment, and 75 cents for every share and $1 for every duet. And I was gonna do that for 24 hours after it was posted. So we ended up donating $1,000 and him did that. But had I just realized how much power we hold when we literally stand as a unit, I would have asked people to help in donating. And it's literally. Let me, let me tell you guys why. Let me tell you why. So if everybody who liked that video and favorited it only donated 10 cents, we would have raised $18,300 in donations. If everybody who commented on that video donated 50 cents, we would have raised $30,000. If everybody who shared that video donated 75 cents, we would have raised $22,500, and all that combined would have equal $70,000. A $70,800. I don't know how to read big numbers, but we literally would have reached over the goal of the My cousin's family, who I'm trying to help evacuate from Gaza. And I'm just. I'm sitting here beating myself up because obviously not everyone can afford to donate, but I would, like, hope that at least some of the people who engaged with the content could afford to donate less than a dollar. This didn't even include the duets. So if you are ever just like, ugh, what's a dollar gonna do? What's 50 cents gonna do? What's $5? Whatever the number is in your head, what's it gonna do? It could have added up to $70,000. It could have evacuated them and another family. And I'm literally just, like, sitting here so frustrated with myself. Well, lucky. I'm so frustrated that I didn't even take the time to ask my community for help. So on the off chance that this video also gets the reach that my last video got, I wanted to talk to you guys about Hammis and his family. So this is my cousin's family. They are stuck in Gaza. Hammis's shelter was attacked by bombardments, and he was stuck under the rubble for hours, and he sustained a spinal injury, and he needs pain management medication and medical attention that he cannot get in Reza. So he is trying to raise funds for himself and his family to evacuate from Reza. Please, if you can donate to Thomas and his family to help them get out and get the medical attention that he needs.",

I didn't go to bed until like 2:00am, so I'm so tired right now and, like, I've been dead all day. But it's okay because it was worth it because he's hot, so whatever. But I'm pretty sure we're going again tonight when he gets off of work, which is so much fun because, like, last night was so much fun. So to do makeup soon. Um, but yeah, I'm so hype. And hopefully this time, like, it's even better because like, last time was a little boring. Like, also like, not that bad cause he stayed on and he was like, when I was like, oh, I gotta go to bed now, he was like, sad about it. I was like, so cute. And also, like, sometimes you Facetime people and it's like, over after the Facetime. But he's been texting like all day today and he was the first one to text me in the morning, like, text me good morning and Like, it was so freaking cute, and I was like, ah.

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable, but it's entirely true. Okay, so this happened back in, like, 94. Could have been early 95. Um, I had a group of friends that would go to my house every weekend, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And we would just kick back in my house, chill. And my parents would buy us liquor, and we would sit there and drink. And sometimes my parents would be there watching us. Sometimes they would go out dancing themselves and just leave us girls at the house. Mind you, when my parents would leave, no guys could be there. Was just us girls. So I had this group of friends, Michelle, Jeanette, Rita, and myself. We were there drinking, having a good time, listening to music. And for some reason, I guess we got bored, and somebody decided, hey, let's play with the Ouija board. So we started playing with the damn Ouija board. We set it up. We even turned off, like, the light. I remember. I believe I want to say I left the bathroom light on and, like, the light from, like, above the stove because we're in the living room, but that was it. And I want to say we even turned on, like, little candles. Okay, so here we are playing the damn Ouija board, and the damn thing is moving and it's going, and we're here blaming each other. You're moving it. No, bitch. You're moving it, bitch! I'm not moving it. It's you. Okay, well, finally, we were just like, okay, if there's really somebody here, like, prove it. Show us that there's somebody here. And I had the bright idea to get an empty beer can and put it on top of the trash can, leaning against, like, the wall, so if it fell, it would have to either fallen over to the side or into the trash can, right? So here, wherever. Like, come on, prove it, prove it, prove it. And the damn can of beer flew from, like, the top of the trash can to the other side of the, like, hit the damn wall in the kitchen. And we screamed, we jumped on the couch, and nobody wanted to move. Um, I think, like, couple minutes past, and we finally, like, all decided to, like, move together to turn on the lights and turn off the candles and just to get rid of the damn Ouija board. And we went to go check, like, if it really was the beer can, and it was the beer can. Like, we saw it on the floor and the other side of the kitchen, and, yeah, we sober it up. We weren't drunk no more. We weren't buzzing. We were nothing. We sober it up really quick, and that was the last time I ever played the damn Ouija board.",

When he wants attention, he'll start like smacking at the door to tell me he wants to be let in. The problem is, he used to meow when he did this to let me know it was him that was wanting to get in. And so obviously I'd open the door, give him his attention, then when he wanted back out, he'd go back to the door and meow at me to tell me to let him out. The problem is, lately he's found out how to mess with the doorknob. So instead of meowing and knocking so that I know it's him, he'll come to my door at three in the morning and start jiggling my doorknob. You know how fucking creepy it is to be awake at three in the morning just trying to watch some anime and your doorknob starts violently shaking? And he doesn't meow anymore, so I don't know whether it's him or not. Eventually it gets annoying though, and I open the door and he comes in. And then when he wants back out, he also hits the doorknob. So if I forget he's in my room, I just hear my doorknob being smacked from the inside. And it freaks me out even more cause He's tiny, so it's hard to see him over my bed, but then I'll see his paw reaching up and smacking the doorknob. So I'm like, oh, it's him! And then just open the door again. But it's like, creepily intelligent how he found out to hit the doorknobs instead of just banging on the door. Cause at this point I prefer him banging on the door and meowing as opposed to him smacking my doorknob in the middle of the night.",

November December me and my best friend let's call them Spencer we go over to our other friend let's call him dusty we go over to his house so it was the three of us and you know chill hang out but there have been rumors that dusty was cheating on his girlfriend so you know like nobody believed them cause it was long ago rumors but yeah so it comes time for me and Spencer to leave and so we leave and me and dusty we trade each other on social media like I get his snap he gets my Instagram that kind of thing cause we didn't have each other yet we just like we talked in person type thing so you know like a week goes by he's pretty active on my Instagram he's liking all my friends post that I repost you know like my female friends the weird thing about that is like why is he liking my female friends Instagram post that like first of all he doesn't even know second of all he has a girlfriend third of all one of the girls who I was reposting he hated like he hated them but he was still liking her post so weird anywho so like I said he added me on Snapchat so we had been starting a streak and stuff so one day he texted me and he's like hey Daniel I need to tell you something like it's a secret I haven't told anybody besides one other guy in Alpena you have to promise never to tell anybody and I'm like okay this dude's about to come out to me so I'm just like yeah you can tell me like of course like your secret's safe with me I have no reason to tell anybody da da da da so yeah sure enough he does come out to me and he's like yeah like I'm BI and and he starts hitting on me so he's like you're fine as F and he starts like asking for pictures sending me pictures and stuff like that and you know I didn't feed into it but I also didn't shut it down right away you know because I wanted to see how far it would go I had good intentions all along like from the minute he started hitting on me I was like okay I'm gonna tell his girlfriend at some point I just have no clue how to so you know I didn't shut it down so the next day rolls around and I call Spencer and I'm like Spencer you will not believe what happened last night dusty was hitting on me and he was sending me inappropriate pictures like pictures you shouldnt be sending someone else when you're in a relationship with somebody else you know what I mean so obviously Spencer was shocked and Spencer had no clue dusty was BI like everyone thought dusty was straight I thought dusty was straight so yeah I was like what the F do I do and Spencer was like yeah like I don't really know I don't remember what happened in that conversation but anywho nothing really happened after like I didn't really do anything right away so time goes by and I'm pretty much not really engaging a conversation with dusty and I was coming up with a plan so basically one day after I got out of work um I text dusty and me and dusty have a conversation he's like yeah like we really need to chill sometime and I'm like yeah I would love to I'm pretty busy all the time so the only time I really can is now that night you know and it was pretty late it was like maybe nine or something and dusty was like yeah we can but like my I'm at my girlfriend's house and she gets out of work like in 45 minutes or like an hour or something so we gotta be quick about it I was like that's fine I can be quick so let's call his girlfriend Hannah by the way that's not her real name but she's gonna come up a lot now so I pick him up from his girlfriend's house and I take him to a place that's literally like three minutes away from his girlfriend's house cause you know how to be quick about it and we're literally just talking about like how much we both hate TC cause TC is a shthole and then he's also talking about the guy in Alpena so yeah and then the conversation like it wasn't a long conversation cause you know we have to be quick and at the end I brought up you know like oh do you really think I'm fine as hell or something like that he was like yeah I think you're fine as hell I wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it and luckily I brought that up at the end because I didn't wanna have a whole like shebang about it you know so I was like yeah as I was driving him back to his house with literally three minute drive I was telling him like yeah like that's really sweet of you and stuff but it's really not fair to your girlfriend because you have a girlfriend it's not fair to Hannah at all um so like we can't do anything like that okay so then he's like yeah okay like I get it and then I drop him off and Hannah's car is literally pulling in behind mine she's getting home from work so I'm like okay so I'm like hey dusty give me a hug and so I gave him a hug and then I was hoping Hannah would see that cause at this time I still didn't know how to tell her you know so like a week or so goes by and me and my family we go to Vegas for a family function and then Spencer calls me while I'm in Vegas I'm like hey and Spencer's like Daniel Dusty is here telling us that you called him handsome and then it made him super uncomfortable because you know he's straight I was like are you kidding me cause everyone that he was telling knew the truth besides his girlfriend Hannah that they were with you know and so I hang up the phone and I block dusty on everything which was a mistake because it got rid of all the proof you know so when I fly back to Michigan that's where I live at the time I was like I really need to tell Hannah the truth of what happened at least so she can hear from me she doesn't have to believe me but like still I need to tell her and being gay in a town like travel city already F-ing sucks and I was gonna have a dumb rumour be spread about me that could fuck up my reputation and that kind of a rumour can be twisted in ways that like I don't even wanna think about so so eventually this was in like January I wrote out a text that I was gonna send to Hannah and it did take me like a couple of days to send it because I didn't even have her on any social media but I think I did end up adding her and she add me back and I text her something like hey dusty was hitting on me dusty was sending me inappropriate pictures that no one in a relationship should be sending me you know I was telling her the truth of what happened from my side and I was like hey you don't gotta believe me but at least you heard this coming from me um and if you have any more questions just let me know and I'm so sorry this is happening and she was like okay thank you so I don't really know if she believed me but I heard from somebody else that she partially believed me so I was like okay I did everything that I could and then they stayed together for a little bit but then eventually they broke up because I got a message on Facebook Messenger from dusty I didn't even know I had him on Facebook saying me and Hannah broke up and I blocked him I blocked the message I screenshotted and blocked it cause I'm like Ew Ew so yeah and now I honestly don't know if they got back together cause I've heard different things from different people but it's none of my business and I don't care and yeah now I live across the country so so like I said before this drama is long over with and thank goodness because it's so childish but this is just a funny story and I do love telling stories and if anyone that knows me gets mad at me or has anything weird to say about me posting this I have no idea why because it happened to me I have every right to talk about it and I didn't even use the real names so yeah I hope you enjoyed have a good day",

    "voice_to_text": "What's a piece of trauma that you have? That's funny. It has to, actually. My biological mother had 12 children total. Three of my siblings and I were adopted from Florida and raised in Arkansas. Our biological mother was not a good person. She indulged in a lot of bad activities and was not pleasant. Okay, little backstory. Her and her first born child did drugs, and she Od'd, and he did not. Yet a couple of years later, he did, though. So we have a memorial for our biological mother in Wisconsin shortly after she passed in 2020. And then we had a memorial for our brother, who passed away this past summer in Florida. Some of our biological siblings from Florida could not make it to our biological mother's memorial in Wisconsin, so we had some of her ashes to spread in Florida also. Okay, I'm gonna set the scene. So we're at the beach. It's sunset. It's so pretty. And my siblings and I, our family, we're all around. We're having a memorial and spreading ashes for our biological mother and our brother. We have flowers. We're going out in canoes, like, spreading ashes and, like, throwing flowers in. Some of our siblings that were around our biological mother and our brother more gave really heartfelt speeches. It was beautiful. So we're all just together, taking in the moment when all of a sudden, we hear sirens going down the beach, and there's police, like, going crazy. So it interrupts this little moment we're all having. So we're all standing there like, what's going on? And of course, it's Florida, so it's to be expected, you know, if you know. You know, in my head, I'm like, oh, a big criminal on the loose. Turns out it was a man trying to steal a honey bun from down the street in a convenience store. And he got confronted and caught for trying to steal a honey bun. And they said, no, you can't do that. So he got upset, and he, like, knocked the honey bun stand down, went crazy in the store, started knocking everything down, and runs, like, on foot with this honey bun. He really did the most. Like, it's kind of funny. I'm honestly not sure if they caught the Honey Bun Bandit or not. My life's crazy.",

Again I tend to feel things but I've seen plenty.  I don't know if it has been my state of mind or anything like as I haven't seen anything in a minute, or if I am experiencing chemical problems like CO build up or other toxin \\ chemicals, or electromagnetic things or vibrations, positive ion build up, heavy metal toxins etc.  I always look for another explanation but I can't think of any that would cause me to see something so big, outside, right around sunset. If it's my mind, that's cool, hallucinations are actually pretty common for a number of disorders. but many experiences I've had, & my family had, were shared and multiple people could describe them.

    "voice_to_text": "There are certain things that your employer cannot do. So I got a story time. So from 2005 to 2009, I worked at a place called Falcon Field, which is in Mesa, Arizona. For those of you not familiar with Mesa, Arizona, Falcon Field is a general aviation airport, meaning it's privately owned fix based operation, or FBO. And a lot of the things that fly out of there are private. Private jets, non commercial stuff. Military stuff too. Anyway, so I worked for a real winner, like I named Brandon. And this guy was real bottom of the barrel. He was real buddy buddy with the boss, but he was kind of a yes man. He was the manager of the feeling department, which I worked for. I did not get along with Brandon at all. He was a horrible boss, a horrible person in general. Short story about him, he used to get drunk and come into the field office at night and bug the overnight workers at like 2 or 3 in the morning. His being drunk was a severe problem. And it was so bad that he went to a bar and threatened to kill a guy that owed his boss money for working on his airplane. The guy he threatened, um, got him fired, um, but Paul, the owner of the Fix Space Operation, or FBO, um, only fired him to get this to blow over. I was extremely happy when he got fired because I knew I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. And I was actually kind of friends with Paul. He was a tough ass guy, but a nice person, I guess, and I got along with him. So everything was going well with Brandon not being there anymore. And then one day he just kind of came in one day and said, I'm your boss again. And tough shit. So I was pretty depressed for a while. And it got really bad with Brandon. He used to call me the N word and the F slur all the time. And we actually almost got to do a physical altercation a couple times. And then one day I came in and I had not shaved to come to work, and I was fired for not shaving. I say all that to say this. Arizona is a right to work state as far as I know still, and you can pretty much be fired for any reason. And after being fired, I went to the Better Business Bureau, the Equal Opportunity employers, all these people, and try to file a lawsuit. Falcon Field went as far as to block me from receiving any unemployment that I had earned through them. After roughly a year of not getting unemployment and trying to file that, um, I got paid 52 plus weeks of back paid unemployment, which is awesome. But the point of the video is there's certain places that don't give a shit. About what they can fire you for and what they can't fire you for, because they know most employees aren't gonna wanna go through all the litigation. But anyway, do what you will with that information.",

    "voice_to_text": "normalize posting why you broke up on the internet just a quick so I've never told the story but I was in the craziest relationship of my life in high school that still like is extremely confusing and I've actually never met or heard of anyone with a story that similar to mine so if someone out there actually does let me know but I dated someone when I was 17 who's also 17 and we went to different schools but we met at like a government conference like a youth and government conference and we started dating and pretty quickly I was like oh my god this person is like the absolute love of my life like this no one has ever felt love like this this is so beyond anything our first date was still maybe maybe the best date I've ever been on and I've dated a lot of people I've had a lot of great nice boyfriend since then and I still think my first date with this guy was the best one I ever had um when he came to pick me up so we had already been talking we had already hung out a little bit before the state so by the time we get to this state I had written him a song so I came downstairs and when he went to pick me up I I played him the song on guitar and sang it and then I got in his truck and he was like we're gonna go pick out we're gonna we have a surprise before dinner we're going to see The Great Gatsby later on but he was like we have I have a surprise for us before dinner cause we have time I was like already oh my god a surprise a man thought through something like this is crazy so he took me to a bookstore and we were there to pick out each other's favourite book to read so that we could both read each other's favourite book then we got barbecue and went up in the mountains a little bit and ate barbecue in the sunshine in the bed of his truck then we went to the movie that that was like the date we'd planned to go to then after that we ate frozen yoghurt in a parking lot somewhere and that that was our first date this man this boy he was a boy he was seventeen everything was so choreographed so thoughtful and when I hear things that are like kinda love vomiting usually they twisted on you or feels manipulative or all the stuff that never felt like it happened and everything just felt so magical oh my god like we we went to the finals of this conference up in North Carolina and I got food poisoning from the shitty food there and the like a chaperone we had knocked on my door and gave me a rose and was like this is from him I was like we're in the woods like how did he get this and he was and I asked him and he was like I called him a favour I'm like who I could go on our end of summer day had three bouquets of roses a small diamond ring and a like a letter he took me to a spa where I got a treatment and then we went a lot of flashy things but also genuinely I genuinely felt very seen by him in a way that part of me still feels like I've never have been since in just what he noticed about me and like how we envisioned our lives together like we were so all in and planning everything so then a year passes and we're about to go to prom and graduate high school and go to college and right around proms another was like Decca Conference if you guys know what that is I didn't go to that so he goes off to the Decca Conference and then a friend who is kind of a fake friend to me who I'm no longer even friends with who I don't talk to was like hey I heard rumours from another friend that he's being sus and maybe cheating on you and I was like well you've never been happy for me at various points in my life so unless you're gonna give me details like I don't believe you and she was like well I'm not gonna give you details cause I said I wouldn't but you should believe me I was like okay well I don't so then he posted a picture with a girl and that hit my stomach the wrong way and I asked him about it and of course now things start to get back in familiar territory of like you know a guy saying shit like I'll delete everything like I'll delete or not I'll you whatever well I didn't ask you that I just said that this is making me feel weird I wanna know about it so that wasn't going well um had like a week where I was like almost experiencing panic attacks for the first time cause he was like coming back and I hadn't seen him yet and everything was just like weird then like later that week we go to prom and I was not really allowed to go party I wasn't gonna be able to do that so after he came back to my house he was like well now I'm gonna go party with the boys for prom which I thought was shitty but whatever so then more more talk is like happening more chatter and I still was like well if no one's gonna tell like I just I think I wrote this guy in 11 page letter I'm like I know you feel weird about this he knows the weird situation like so then finally one of his friends who I kind of knew called me and was like hey are you free like we need to take a walk and he brought a pint of ice cream and he I think he had screenshots and the TLDR is that this boy this man cheated on me with like a dozen people over the course of like six months and not our whole relationship but about half of it and all his friends knew which was so crazy and so then I was like well now I have to confront him because now I just have a lot of questions like if he cheated on me we're totally done but now I I'm my entire idea of who is the person and what this whole year was like I'm deeply confused so I go to have this conversation with him I recorded it on my phone because I wanted to know and I just confronted him and started yelling about it and he denied that shit for 20 straight minutes I was like there's nothing left I just wanted to know were you planning on telling me like we kept saying we're gonna marry each other and like maybe even be long distance for four whole years and then get back like it's all the shit we're saying it's like why he compared himself to JFK that he loves his wife but he also had mistresses and just like basically being like well the most important men of the world and blah blah blah but he kept calling me honey and I was like you need therapy like I don't know what this is anymore but like this is enter the territory that's like I don't know what the hell this is and he was like I he turned this like weird anger and energy on himself and then I had to comfort him to make sure he wasn't gonna like hurt himself and he was like yeah I'm gonna go to therapy and in four years I'm gonna keep tabs on you and in four years when we graduate college I'm going to ask you to meet me at an airport and if you do I'm gonna propose to you and will immediately fly to Europe and like do everything live the whole life we like said we're gonna live and if you don't then I'll never see you again and then he wrote me another letter you know this is like the 30th 40th letter I have from him at this point over the course of the relationship and um he was like I think you're my soulmate but I'm not yours and I wanted to like be everything that my father wasn't and I I just have these demons and blah blah blah and he signed the ending of that letter in blood and that's that's why we broke up",

    "voice_to_text": "How did you find out that your partner was cheating on you? You may stay alrighty. I was meaning to jump on this trend. Oh my gosh, it's relatable because every time I've seen a video or seen people post and chat about their exes, fucking relate. So here's mine. I found out how my ex is cheating. Guys, when I think about it, it's horrible. Like, wow. Okay, let me start the story. It was about 2, 3 years back. We were dating, like start dating end of 2021, beginning of 2022. But it was that transition that happened end of one year into another year. That's where we started kicking it, dating nothing. We met on Tinder and I've opened up about my ex on here before and yes, that's the ex that abused me. And I, you know what? I do not let that have that power of me or whole power of me. I own it, right? So we've been dating and it's nice vibes over there, man. We dated like 6 months in of us dating. Girl doesn't mention that she's poly right. I have nothing against body people, but guys, please do not come for me on this platform. I don't mind body people. I don't mind if you want a relationship that's funny. Like bro, that is you do. You live you love you live your life. Love it Perth, right? But my thing is when you do not know the Fine line between cheating and being polyamorous that is where it got to me I was just like nah bro I'm not gonna sit in the situation Japanese and pull the stunt on me just to get some hands long story short on that point before I like this back to the story so 6 months in babe starts to mention these funny funny Nana things right funny for Ninian like they're like really funny things of oh what would you say to a girl if I said when your friends are hot or they're still better than the other me me my monoga's ass is looking at her like um okay peeps whatever like pie the question but at the same time it's not it's clicking here as if that's a red flag but anyway so we fast forward God decides to ask me to go out with one of her best friends I'm like yeah I'm not sure go out have a great time me I'm working so hurry I'm already not gonna be put on the plane so I'm telling you go out country Milan d did I not send that bitch out no I recall about the news to the wolves of the town and then I see messages on her phone and and all of the Sunday six months prior the messages from a random girl that she apparently has been talking to since the beginning of our relationship that started right so when we Got exclusive she's still talking to this hunt like I'm sitting there like mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm then about the mhm mhm power give me strength and I'm ready to smack a bitch like I'm ready to smack a bitch I was so close so contaminante I find out through a text message on her phone that oh um, I had such a lovely time yesterday at the club guys. I do not snoop I don't snoop through people's phones. The phone was open the message was there and I looked down and I was like girl was in the bathroom so I missed her phone was in there but it was open like she opened it before she went to the bathroom and the WhatsApp chat was open had such a great time I enjoyed myself as I like your best friend like oh my gosh can't wait for me to introduce you to your girlfriend so you from Mexico Guatemala Mexico yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know how to cook that up can't wait to introduce pause now me at the time I'm like at this point I'm thinking this is Lima but I'm already kicking fast forward six months ahead right six months ahead things are just happening on her phone where I'm like evening text morning text I'm like okay she's she's but you know what she's how she smoke screened it guys she showed she was showing me the same affection she showing this Cousin on the sideline showing her the same affection as me to not make sure to not oh this is why he's to literally smoke scream me it's not make sure they let's let me just say it like that it was a never make sure situation because I sat there and I was like is this bitch tryna smoke screen me to think that I'm the only one cool then at the end of the day literally literally literally sorry I'm watching king of the South Africa literally whilst we were moving now we just fast forward 6 months ahead and our relationship is going fine strong boom Bam but these messages couldn't just share mine because she's been funny for a couple of weeks so I'm like mmm I'mma mind her I'mma mind that shit if it's gonna be funny or I'm just not gonna you know feed into it so don't feed into it right and then hmm fast forward two months ahead we go into a month of moving so Babes and I are packing up our house we moving into a new spot then she tells me during the process of moving on a phone call oh baby I found us a girlfriend a girlfriend mind you I did agree I did allow so I allowed the whole party house thing to happen and I was just like okay if you're not cheating let me allow this and see if you actually are like to me It was a fine line oh, there's a thin line between that and cheating those who know will understand why I'm saying it like this because it started off as cheating just to be played off as being poly because if you're poly you tell your person the truth in the beginning me currently now I'm currently dating somebody that's poly and she told me from the jump if you're not gonna be transparent in the beginning then forget don't say that you're oh you're poly all of a sudden when you're fucking cheating there's a fine line between the two guys there's a damn line between two so horrid girl is on the phone with me I'm in the Uber ride back home and I'm just like tired from work she's like, oh hey, I found a girl for us going off she's this she's that she's this student and I'm like my girlfriend I'm like how long did you when did you meet her? I met her a month ago because it's not a month ago that you meant NE it's not a month ago it's a couple of months now I wasn't born yesterday you're playing it off as platonic but then you kiss her in a club like I'm not stupid and so this is slim as this is by MENA like how the fuck cool shop get babes shocking on you so we move into our new flat and I meet the girl on WhatsApp Everything I meet her chat to her get to know her shame nice girl very nice girl no qualms against her my qualms was against my ex cause I was like nah nigga you are stupid to play us both because I don't think she will be stupid enough to believe your lies sure I cannot girl thinks that you can outsmart me in my in a game that I I create a dog like guys I'm a Leo I will outsmart you in an instant just to show you that I am top dork in everything like don't blame me don't nigga you try to play me I'll treat I will play you back tenfold Hooray BA girl is Chinese in front of me I'm like okay I'll play your games ne I'll play your game but if you think you think I'm gonna be a sore loser ha ha that's on you that's on you babes so okay fine we go about it and it gets a little messy like she's getting angry at the fact ex is getting angry at the fact that a girl likes her likes me she likes her but likes me a little bit more things are happening happening happening happening all of a sudden they end because she couldn't have a cake and eat it too guys they split up because she couldn't have a cake and eat it too and mind you I found out that she slept with her the Two weeks, two to three weeks back before we broke up and two to three weeks after we broke up. There I had already known. It was just a feeling Spidey sense. But y'all guys, the fine line of Polly Anderson cheating. I don't wanna be attacked. No, cancelled me. I, I personally mean that. I myself, I'm in a relationship with a body of this woman who's told me from the upfront and I appreciate her honesty and I for it. I love you all, but please know the definition between poorly and cheating. There's a fine line. Love you, but that's part 1 of it.\n",

    "voice_to_text": "hey friends so if you follow me you'll know that I lost my dad 11 years ago I had a dream about my dad um after he had passed away that still haunts me to this day if you didn't know the day that my dad passed away he and I had like the most intense heart to heart that I've ever had and it gave me a lot of closure that even though it took me years to get through the grief and like you know the the brunt of it I didn't have as bad of a time as some of my other relatives did it just hurt all the time you know what I mean my family would often say that my dad would visit them in their dreams but my dad never visited my dreams like hardly ever I met my husband three months after my dad passed away I met my husband three months after my dad passed away and aside from the chaos with my in laws my life has been relatively pretty normal like there's been a lot of hard times but nothing that I couldn't handle by myself well one day I just remember having a dream in which I found myself in like a large room I remember in the dream being extremely confused as to why I was there how I even got there what what is going on it was so vivid it felt so real I remember kind of walking blindly around this really large white cloudy fuzzy room like just a large white room really fuzzy and cloudy like a fog machine was going I remember seeing my dad and being like oh my gosh I was crying big ugly tears like I was crying I'd I'd have you ever felt like you weren't crying hard enough you weren't laughing hard enough I was not crying hard enough for how happy I was to see my dad I wasn't even wondering how tf I was seeing my dad like am I even alive right now like nothing I was just excited to see my Daddie  he's so busy though like I'm literally following him around I'm just excited to be in his presence you know just being a little daughter being around her dad big big big daddy's girl energy eventually we sit down in some sort of VIP area like it's all roped off and shizz and I finally start talking to him and I'm asking him questions I'm like don't you miss me do you miss me cause I miss you all the time my dad was so busy doing whatever he was doing that he was like kind of paying attention to me but not really he was telling me of of course you know I love you I miss you of course he was telling me that my family is beautiful he said my kids are beautiful I just remember crying and being like why why aren't you paying attention to me please please talk to me and he was like I you're fine you're alright you don't need me you're you're alright he was like he was like you've got this you you've got this you can do this you don't need me you're okay I remember protesting and being like yeah I'm okay but like I miss you I need you and he was just like you're okay and then I just remember like all of a sudden it it it dawns on me that we're in a party like this VIP section is in the middle of this party and there's all these people that I've never seen before some of these people look idly familiar but I can't readily put my finger on how I know these people or if I even actually know them the party begins to crescendo like people start cheering people start laughing the music starts to swell I didn't even know there was music until this moment you know what I'm saying like everything just it seems like it got bigger and louder and more like party still in a large white space that's kind of foggy but again I'm like in a roped off area talking to my father we're like sitting like sitting in some lounge chairs and like talking so the party starts crescendoing and my dad stands up and he was just like you're gonna be okay and he walked away he leaves the area and I jolt awake and I'm crying I'm crying right now like like what do you mean I don't need you and also why am I not with you anymore you know what I mean it was so so incredibly vivid it felt so real and it fuqqd me up I'm still fuqqd up about it fast forward a couple days and I'm at work I take a break I go to the bathroom I'm just really not feeling it honestly everything is screaming at me to go home just go home just call it quits today we'll try again tomorrow today is not it right so I go to the bathroom and I get a phone call while I'm literally washing my hands my dad's best friend's nephew was calling me I have no idea how that man got my phone number I'm like thoroughly shocked but like excited because I know his mom makes the most incredible mint chocolate chip ice cream I've ever had in my life so I was like ooh we finna get some ice cream you know what I'm saying but I knew in my heart why he was calling me because he was an older gentleman his his uncle which was my dad's best friend was an older gentleman and I just knew why he was fuqqn calling me my dad's best friend passed away peacefully in his sleep in his bed the nephew and my dad's best friend work together they were in the same business it was like a family business my dad's best friend and nephew were in business together was like a family business so he was seen on Friday but did not show up to work on Monday guess when he passed away the day I had that dream and all I can think about is when I saw my dad he was setting up for a party for his best friend to come home I don't think that was a dream I think I really did talk to my dad and I think my dad was setting up for his best friend to come home he was throwing a party for his best friend and my dad always threw the best parties and to this day I don't think I've had a dream about my dad since it's been several years but he's right I'm okay I am okay",

    "voice_to_text": "you have a narcissistic parent what was the weirdest tantrum so me and my dad never really had a close relationship growing up and I feel like I fate the way I felt about him a lot because I was just always constantly walking around on eggshells so my parents are divorced so I would go over my dad's house every other weekend and this particular weekend was when I saw one of the most scariest sighs of him I've ever seen and I've like seen a lot but it was never necessarily directed towards me so for this to happen to me it was really just a cultural shock and really just upsetting so the first day it was actually going really well um we were talking about my future and stuff what I plan on doing once I get a job and all of that and it was great it was a nice day so then the next day comes around he goes to work my stepmom decides to take my sister to go out with her because I just want to stay home so anyway then later in the day my dad comes back from work and he's like hey do you wanna come with me to the grocery store and I'm just like um no thank you I'm feeling a little tired and my head hurts and he was like okay and then headed out I didn't see anything wrong with it so once he comes back from the grocery store he starts acting very weird towards me he's ignoring me a lot and I can tell he's upset and I didn't ask him if he was okay because I was scared that he might yell at me or tell me to mind my business so then I noticed it's trying to get late and my sister and stepmom still aren't home so I go knock on my dad's door to see if he knows when they might be back and like very irritated he's like I don't know Maya but you shouldn't have let your sister go with her by herself and I was just like oh sorry I didn't know so then he falls out with you know I wanted to spend time with you and maybe after the grocery store we could have went and gotten something to eat but I see you don't wanna hang out with your dad I was like oh I'm sorry I didn't know I was just feeling tired and didn't really have the energy to get right and he's like well I was tired too if you wanted to hang out with me you should have just communicated that with me earlier instead of just being upset because I didn't go to a grocery store with you like I'm not mine reader then after that he doesn't really talk to me for the rest of the night and then it continues to the morning until I go home so then me and my sister are sitting in the car as my dad's about to go meet up with my mom so we can go back home and then he starts talking he's like you know I wanted to have a good weekend with y'all and hang out but you had an attitude the whole time just stayed in your room so he's had a few outbursts like this a couple times where he starts off like this it was never as bad as this time though but I was just like no I'm not about to sit here through this again as he belittles me and tries to make me think that I did something wrong and that everything was just my fault so then I was like actually no you seem upset with me the whole time then he's like I'm tired of your attitude and always thinking you can talk back and then he said something else after that I don't quite remember cause this happened a while ago but I remember I was like what and I had the most confused look on my face because like what is this man even talking about so then he's like and stop with that stupid look on your face why do you always do that when I'm talking to you maybe cause you're saying a bunch of stupid shit and no one knows now one thing about this man is once he runs his mouth he never stop so he's just going on and on it's getting so draining and tiring and then you just like all you do is lay in bed all day which you might as well do at home so you should just stay there cause I'm tired of your antisocial ass and at this point I'm crying cause I'm so frustrated and upset that he just saying all this to me so I yell and I'm like yeah I will you don't have to worry about that anymore and then he gets really pissed once I decide to say something and he's like I don't care how old you are I will beat your ass and then he's like you know what get out and tries to abandon me on the side of the road and obviously I refuse to get out I honestly really did but I wasn't just gonna leave my sister in the car with this psychopath plus what was he gonna say to my mom if he actually were to have abandoned me then after he does all that he really tries to say you know I try my best for you guys I do everything and you're just so ungrateful oh this this is you changing doing everything hmm really doesn't seem like it and my poor sister over here is literally having a panic attack because she's so stressed out from the yelling and my sister she has nothing to do with this like she's not involved at all and one thing that I don't like is that when one of us messes up he tries to say that with both of us my sister's having a panic attack he doesn't care he's driving so fast he's going like 80 miles per hour so we finally get to the meeting spot to meet up with my mom and my mom's not there yet so he's just pissed and he's like Noah I can't stand y'all kids anymore I need some air and I can hear him outside yelling and talks himself is like oh my gosh this man is insane and he's like you know I'm gonna have a little talk with your mom so thankfully my mom finally comes to the rescue to come pick us up and he literally throws our stuff in my mom's trunk and he's yelling at her and my mom's like oh my gosh you are crazy you need to get some help he's like Noah I never wanna see y'all again this is like not all that's happened with him like there's a lot more to this story um so let me know if y'all wanna hear some more about that and yeah",

    "voice_to_text": "so this story is only ridiculous because of the location this ghost story takes place at an art campus that used to be a tuberculosis hospital that is behind Casa Bonita yes this Casa Bonita this ghost story involves a murder unrequited love and a violin so sit down and buckle up first some history the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society was a tuberculosis hospital that was opened from 1912 to I think 1979 it then became a cancer research facility and then it became an art college I attended the art college and then worked at the art college so I was there for about five years and everybody had ghost stories on the campus and it's very reasonable there were so many people that passed away from the tuberculosis illness on that campus and the facility was open for a really long time so it definitely makes sense that the place is haunted as all get out one particular grizzly event however made state news and this is the particular ghost that I find the most interesting this is Isador or sometimes he would write his name as Isaac depending on the document that you look at and Isador was a child progeny at the violin he was very good and when he got tuberculosis it absolutely devastated him it ruined his career and he knew that there was going to be a huge chance that he was going to die and this was in the year 1920 so tuberculosis cures were nowhere near as good as they are now and he went to the only place that he thought that maybe he would have a chance that place was the Jcrs the jcrs was known for being the best tuberculosis treatment center in the United States at the time and he hoped that the Rocky Mountain Air and the facility would be able to cure him of his illness and it did to some extent the hospital provided such good care that he was able to go into remission several times during his treatment at the facility he was able to leave the facility and then when it got worse he would come back so all in all he had a pretty good chance that he was going to survive this is Bessie she's absolutely gorgeous and she was a nurse in World War One when she returned to the States she unfortunately contracted the Spanish flu which completely knocked her off of her feet and she sought treatment at the JCRs for a different type of illness so she sought treatment for that Spanish flu she was cured and then after she got done they asked her hey do you wanna work for us and she said I would be absolutely delighted within 10 months of her working at the jcrs she had already become the head nurse so Bessie and Isaac cross paths a lot because Bessie is treating Isaac's tuberculosis every time he comes back to the JCRs and he even says things like you know if it weren't for you I would be \ud83d\udc80 I wouldn't be here and she would always say things like you know it's my duty it's my duty as a nurse you know I'm trying to use the gifts that I have been given to make a difference in the lives of people he wanted to become romantically involved with his nurse she didn't think that that was professional Isaac proposed several times to Bessie she said no every time and he just really couldn't sit with no for an answer and it made him very desperate and very upset at some point in 1920 he was discharged from the hospital for what would be the last time they said you're gonna get better you're probably gonna be fine and he was a little devastated because he wanted Bessie to accept his proposal he wanted to be together and so he thought I'm gonna go buy a ring and if for whatever reason I end up back in this hospital I'm gonna propose one last time and we'll see if she'll take it he ended up having to go back to the JCRs because unfortunately his tuberculosis took a turn for the worse and it got really really bad this time like really bad like nothing he had ever seen he came back to the hospital and he did what he said he was gonna do he got down on one knee outside of the what is now the Rotunda building on the art campus and by a tree there's a very specific tree and he proposed and she said the same thing that she said every single time and that the answer was no and it was at that point that he pulled out a we4pon that he had brought onto the campus illegally they didn't know that he had it and he ended her life by discharging the \ud83d\udd2b into her abdomen several times they were on a hospital campus so they tried to rush her to the emergency operating room to save her life and they couldn't she had probably \ud83d\udc80 instantaneously and that was it and unfortunately Isaac was never tried for the crime because he died of tuberculosis in the prison while he was being detained so the story is very tragic and a lot of the people who attend the school or spend enough time on campus often say that they can see Bessie they're wandering around the campus because she still wants to do her job she still wants to help people and so they'll say that they'll see a woman in a white nurse's uniform standing underneath that tree or walking around campus so she's very famous I don't think anybody ever sees Isaac I think he's moved on um but yeah that all happens behind Casa Bonita so take that as you will I have plenty of my own personal ghost stories from being on that campus so if anybody wants to hear it let me know in the comments and maybe I will make a follow up video about the spooky things that I have personally seen while working at the former Jcrs",

already broken when I went to go wake him up he must have put them on the bed next to him before he fell asleep and then when he was asleep he must have rolled over on them and broken them he responds by saying I'm not a f-ing dumb\ud83c\udf51 Kirsten I always put them on the bedside table I would never leave them on the bed next to me and now I'm f-ing annoyed cause I'm gonna be late for work I don't have time to argue about this I say they were on the bed next to you when I came to wake you up you must have forgotten to put them on the bedside table last night when you fell asleep and his response to that was well I'm sorry your cats are f-ing dumb\ud83c\udf51es and they like to move and break my \ud83d\udca9 all the time and in case it isn't obvious the cats had nothing to do with this man's glasses being broken at this point I am fed up with how this man is speaking to me so I give up the argument about how the glasses got broken and I take myself downstairs I'm taking my vitamins I'm getting my coffee together and I'm trying to figure out if I should help him with his glasses or if I need to just take myself to work and be late and the entire time that I am downstairs he is screaming at me from upstairs saying \ud83d\udca9 like I don't know what the f you want me to do Kirsten I don't know how the f you expect me to drive or function with one f-ing eye Kirsten I'm f-ing blind and the whole time I'm downstairs and he's screaming at me I am feeling so defeated because of course he's blaming me for this even though I had nothing to do with those glasses being broken of course it's my fault of course it's my problem so even though this isn't my fault and he is actively treating me like \ud83d\udca9 right now he still expects for me to fix this f-ing problem so what do I do y'all I start looking for \ud83d\udca9 to fix the glasses with and I find Scissors and duct tape I start heading back upstairs to see what I can do with the glasses and as soon as my ex sees the duct tape he looks at me and says you're not gonna fix my glasses with f-ing duct tape here so I'm not gonna look like a f-ing dumb\ud83c\udf51 today so I say I don't know what you want me to do right now we have to leave and your glasses are broken you can't see without your glasses so I really don't think we have any other options right now and you know what I'll give it to him sometimes I would sleep past my alarms and I would wake him up in a rush and that's annoying right but remember how I said in the last part that he wouldn't get out of bed unless I woke him up at the last possible second so like damned if I do damned if I don't for the next part you have to know that I refer to my ex as quinoa because every time I eat quinoa I get really bad @n@l fissures and my ex was always a pain in my \ud83c\udf51 so it just felt like it fit so I take a deep breath I reach out my hand and I say just give me the f-ing glasses quinoa he has his glasses in his hand and he winds up his fist at me and he's shaking and trembling with his entire body and he's breathing at me like this and he is staring at me in a way that I've never had anybody look at me in my entire life and he's sitting there staring at me like this for what felt like forever before he finally throws the glasses into my lap and says you're such a f-ing piece of \ud83d\udca9  and even after all of that I'm still sitting there trying to fix the glasses and as I'm trying to fix the glasses I just can't hold it in anymore I say I can't do this anymore I f-ing hate you he scoffs at me he goes uh you can't do this anymore you can't do this anymore right I wish you know it was like to be f-ing blind Kirsten I fixed the glasses as best as I could with the duct tape he drove me to work the car ride was completely silent and when he was dropping me off right before I got out of the car he grabbed me by my arm pulled me back into the car and pulled me into an extremely tight hug quinoa and I have the same friend group and it was made up of mostly dudes and I was worried if I told the guys what had happened that they would go and talk to quinoa about it which is something that I didn't want so when I got to work I texted all of my girlfriends I told everybody at work that I was even remotely close to that quinoa had almost hit me that morning and I needed to break up with him and I needed them to hold me to it everyone that I talked to about it was unbelievably supportive they all offered to be there in any way that they could in order to keep me safe I had my dad drive me home from work that night and I broke up with quinoa and while I was breaking up with him I looked at him and I said I think you were gonna hit me this morning and he had nothing to say he didn't deny it he didn't try to defend himself he was just silent there were so many reasons that I should have broken up with quinoa before it got this bad I have an entire playlist of a lot of the \ud83d\udca9 things that he did while we were together but this is the thing that actually made me leave him",

    "voice_to_text": "normalize posting why you broke up on the internet  if you've been following me for a while then you may have already seen this story time but it is way too chaotic for me not to hop on this trend so let's get into it going into the story I need you guys to know two things 1 my ex was legally blind without correction meaning if he wasn't wearing glasses he could not see and two we were sharing my car at the time and he was driving me to work in the mornings I worked at a hospital and my assigned parking spot was really far from the door and I had to walk through a lot of sketchy areas to actually get into my job so I just felt safer having him drive me when we first came up with this arrangement I thought it was a win win situation right I didn't have to worry about getting mugged on my way into work and then he would have the car throughout the day but where this arrangement became stressful was that I had to wake my ex up in the mornings he would not set alarms for himself and he would get mad at me if I woke him up too early or too late or if it was too cold so every morning I would get myself ready for work and then like 15 minutes before waking him up I would set a heater up in front of the bed and I would put clothes in the dryer for him so he had warm clothes to put on and then I would have to wake him up not so early that he would get pissed off at me for waking him up so early but not so late that he would feel rushed and looking back was I acting like this grown man's mother yes I was but I didn't see it that way at the time I just thought I was being a loving caring partner on the morning in question I have already done all of the things I've put his clothes in the dryer I set a heater up next to the bed and I go to wake him up at the designated time and when I go to wake him up I realise that his glasses are on the bed next to him and they are broken the best way I can describe this is a little screw had come out of his glasses right about here and so the lens frame had opened up and the lens had fallen out of the glasses completely and this is an oh f moment for me right because my ex needs these glasses to see to be able to drive me to work and also he couldn't wear contacts because when he was wearing contacts he would wear them for 30 60 90 days at a time without ever taking them out to the point where he f-ed up his eyes so much that putting in contacts was excruciating so glasses were his only option and because I was waking him up at the last possible second I didn't have time to drive myself to work park in my designated spot and walk 15 minutes to the door I needed him to drive me so I try to wake him up he doesn't budge I try to wake him up again a lot more frantically and I say babe I need you to wake up your glasses are broken when he hears this he shoots up in bed he grabs his glasses he's looking at them and he goes ugh I can't believe you broke my f-ing glasses Kirsten  and when he made this statement I had to take a step back and compose myself for a minute because bold of you to assume that I was the one that broke your glasses when they're on your side of the bed sitting next to you but I go okay he's confused he just woke up and his glasses are broken that's stressful I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt right and please don't hate me but I do have to make a part 2 for this story TikTok doesn't like it when I try to post videos that are too long they just never fully upload but part 2 will be up on my page while you're watching this",

    "voice_to_text": "um genuine question for my K drama girlies out there have any you guys actually lived through like a like a K drama moment yes so I was studying abroad in Seoul South Korea in 2018 and when I was there I would often go out to the Han River by myself and just sit people watch watch all the buskers and vibe with myself and one of the nights I went out there I was just sitting and then I noticed maybe like five feet to my left there was this um Korean boy and he was probably similar aged as I was and I just noticed him I was like hmm wonder what he's doing he was just by himself he had a camera with him so he was like taking photos of the scenery and I was like should I make moves on him should I talk should I look over like what not but I was just in my own element um and then at one point of the night I noticed that he had gotten up and left I was like okay cool and 10 minutes later he comes back and he sits in the same spot and then 10 minutes after that he says something and for me I'm like was he talking to me so I turn over and he was and he's holding out this beer and he asked me if I want a beer I'm like oh sure so I receive it and he sits closer to me and we start talking and getting to know one another and it was just so very K drama esque uh we found out that we were similar we were the same age and in Korea it's a big thing cause when you're the same age as someone you're like oh my god friends chingu wow um and as we were talking as we were vibing looking out at the view there were people literally right in front of us playing with fireworks over the river so in that moment I was like wow this is such a K drama moment sitting having such a meet meet cute with this Korean man that offered me beer looking out at the water and the nightscape with fireworks out front that was it that's my K drama story and we went for one date after that and he was like whatever but yeah that's just a story that sticks in my mind",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entirely true. I'll go first. 10 foot tall shadow figures, creaking floors, lights that turn on and off. Civil War trenches in your backyard. Welcome to my ghost story. So I never thought I would have an actual ghost story, but I do. I live in a 1957 brick ranch house. Um, and it kind of has a weird vibe to it a little, but I've personally never seen anything. I've experienced a couple things, but I've never actually seen a ghost. When I got the house, I knew that someone had died in it, and I didn't really think that was unusual or scary, because people die at home all the time. And this was an elderly gentleman that had cancer. He was very sick, and he passed away at home. So it wasn't like a violent death or anything like that. But there have been some things since I've lived here that were kind of odd. Like, I have seen the light in my closet turn off and on by itself. Um, but I kind of figured, oh, you know, maybe the light bulbs loose or it's old wiring. My youngest daughter is the one that has had the most experiences. She has heard a man's voice in her bedroom, whispering to her. Um, in the backyard, where we think there's Civil War fortifications, she has felt like someone or something blowing in her ear, uh, when There was no wind, no bugs, nothing like that. Um, the most recent thing, about a week ago, she saw a shadow figure that she describes as being, like, 10 feet tall, that it was so tall it had to bend across the ceiling. And it was just, like, standing in a corner of a room, watching her from the corner. And then it started pacing back and forth, and it moved in front of a fan she had on her floor that was on. And she said it completely, like, block the air from the fan. Like, she couldn't feel it anymore. Um, and it scared her to death, obviously. She came in my room crying her eyes out. Um, after that, she did end up going back to bed, but with the light on. And I personally, for the next, like, 30, 40 minutes after she went back to sleep, heard something walking across the floor. So my floors are hardwood, and they're older, so when you walk on them, they creek. They squeak. Like, you can audibly hear it. And that's what I heard that night. Like, something like walking and pacing back and forth on the floors. And I got. Got up and nothing. I didn't see anything. My daughter wasn't awake, the pets weren't awake. Nothing was moving. So I don't know what to think. But there is something going on, and we could sure use some help. If you can tell me what. I Should do to get rid of whatever it is. Please tell me",

    "voice_to_text": "okay y'all from Guam so the way that the lay lines are set up over there I'm supercharged with spiritual energy no I'm just playing but they the islands are supercharged with spiritual energy I have more ghost stories than the normal person but one of my favorites which I was thinking about it this morning because although I also love ghost stories I love Bible stories too and my favorite one of my favorite stories was um the writing on the wall now how this relates to my life is when I was a baby my mom was doing laundry she had me in like a little bassinet while she was outside doing the laundry hanging up the clothes on the clothesline she hears me crying she turns around and I'm floating in air like just a Newborn baby floating in air and she freaks out you know my grandparents had just passed away and they say like oh it was the grandparents and in my head I'm just like that's a wild story that's a wild fucking story I was floating in the air I was floating in the air as I grew up I read the Bible and then I go to church a lot right and then I heard that story the writing on the wall where uh apparition of a hand just comes and writes on the wall which reminded me of me getting picked up by spirit you know okay so for those who don't know the story King Belchazar had a great banquet and he invited all his consorts and all his noble people he had them at a party and he was using the goblets that nebukanezzar stole from the temple of Jerusalem right Nebuchadnezzar is Belchizer's father so after drinking the wine they're praising the gods of silver and gold bronze and iron wood and stone right all inanimate objects suddenly a finger appears of a human hand an apparition and it started to write on the plaster on the wall how strong is that finger gonna be how freaking strong right the finger of god so everybody was like so shocked by this everybody seen it for a hand just coming out and it's like oh my god so scary right so that's just our starts like calling all the enchanters all the enchantresses all the astrologers everybody right and he's like anybody who tells me what this writing on the freaking wall says I'll give you I'll dress you in in gold you know people came from everywhere all across the kingdom and nobody could figure it out so it had this king like really in his feelings so you know he's like I don't know what's going on so one of Belshazar's wife is like hey don't worry about this I know somebody who speaks to god you know his name is Daniel it's like Daniel tell me what it says look at me anything that you want I'll make you a king of your own right you know which channels like anything that you're gonna give me I don't want it and any favors or whatever give it to somebody else basically tell specials are like hey your father Nebuchadnezzar I gave him everything god gave him everything right sovereignty the greatness and glory a splendor became the authority to rule over all nations right but took it to his head when god couldn't take it no more he stripped nebukanezzar of everything god gave him the mind of an animal that's crazy how do you give somebody the mind of an animal the king ended up living with donkeys ate grass like an ox and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven I don't even know what that means ah the cold shots you know what I'm saying I always say this I'm like don't fuck with me because god will fuck on you you know what I'm saying cum shots everywhere wow that's going full circle right now what did you say when god comes it's his birthday it's his birthday yeah when god comes anyway nebukaniz doesn't get back to his right mind until he freaking apologizes to god he had to acknowledge that god is the sovereign of all like yeah god gave me this power to take care of you guys but if I abuse it it gets taken away so Nebuchadnezzar got his kingdom back which is why Belchizer is a king right Nebuchadnezzar dies now is Belgizar who's following the same exact footsteps as his father did but it's even worse because Nebuchadnezzar told him this story you know like don't fuck with god okay don't fuck with the kingdom that I'm entrusted to you're the next king don't mess with it he's like you'd rather give thanks to gold silver goblets you know what I'm playing so he turns to the inscription which reads many many to kill person many means god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end so that twice okay maybe for father and son to tell you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting like you are without

chain oh and it was pronounced the high ruler of the kingdom right that night Belchezar the king of the Babylonian was slain and Darius the king of the meteids took over crazy and it is 8:17 right now so the Bible verse for 8:17 is Luke 8:17 and it says for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out in the open also Romans 8:17 it says and if children then heirs heirs of god and follow heirs with Christ provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him",

    "voice_to_text": "propaganda is not education story time now I don't talk about me being in the military very often cause girls in the military the army for six years but let me tell you something about our Miss Hillary Clinton here so I want you to imagine I am fresh 18 I don't know what I wanna do with my life I just suffered a major equestrian injury to the point where I can't ride my horse anymore my scholarship is gone I don't know what to do with my life so I do what any rational 18 year old does um I marry someone my ex husband because we're both gonna go into the military because he saw the recruiter first and I somehow got roped into it and let me tell you the military for me at that time was the best thing ever you wanna know why I was undiagnosed with autism and ADHD my high school horrible hated it so much I went straight to college and got my degree there before I entered the military so when I got into the army through like basic training it was perfection it was structured I knew where to be when to be what uniform to the point I was put at platoon leader uh for basic training and I do this because it was like you're the head of the platoon but you're not an officer because again in a retentive I will be where you need me to be I'll make sure other people are there because I am rigid I'm very rigid and along with that something I'm really great at is just retention when it comes to knowledge so when you go into basic they gave you these little booklets that cover like basic military things like rank structure regulations the Soldier's Creed and I memorized it like that because I'm a little parrot to the point of week one of basic training when we had our test passed it with flying colors we're good to go I passed that test I have nothing else to learn so I was talking to the drill sergeant I'm like hey I have nothing else to learn and we have this downtime where we're supposed to be educating ourselves on basically the soldiering book can I learn more information cause you know I'm gonna be the best of the best kind of moment I was great at P t I was great at all soldiering in general like I I fit in so well with this and my drill sergeant was like you know we don't normally do this but we have a military library and as long as you're reading at the appropriate times meaning when everyone else was studying basic knowledge and downtime so when we were like at the range when we were on fire guard when they're supposed to be learning like their basic soldiering for the next test and basic training I three so I picked a random book cause I'm not in the military history I didn't like it and the first book I picked up was on Benghazi and at first I was like you know what maybe this is just propaganda my little 18 year old brain was going like this seems a little off why would somebody do something like that and why would we be put in that situation okay bet so I read through it and I talked to my drill sergeants about it and they're kinda wishy washy about it but you know what no big deal so I read this book and I'm already like down in the dumps about it cause I'm like oh I didn't know about this I'm like you know what I'm gonna choose another book to read cause I'm a speed reader I can go I can go so I picked another book about the early 2 military police and I'm gonna say this wrong but it was about the story of abangari which was basically where the military police were torturing Middle Eastern prisoners after 9 11 and we were like three 4 weeks into basic training and I had realized that joining the military was a huge goddamn fucking mistake and the funny thing was I was um contracted for eight years and the fact I got six because of some like clauses when it comes to retention and the guard was a goddamn lifesaver and I have all kinds of fucked up stories when it comes to the American army and fuck that shit",

He didn't hear anything. That's crazy. I don't know. Buddy was pent up. If he can wait till he got home. I mean, we have finals the next week. Maybe he was just, like, stressed or something, bro.

conference room  that we were taking up and we were mid through mid through mid way through oh my god our meal  and the owner of the company  looked at both of us  took our bags of McDonald's  and threw them in the trash  and get and then took my Mcflurry from my hands  and goes you're done you're done you you're you're done that's trash now yep one company we weren't allowed to have a microwave because the owner didn't believe  in microwaves um I'm a size 10 12 I'm a curvy girl and we were trying to extend our sizes so it was a well known  denim company and uh I was one of the larger girls on the on the team try not to say a lot um on the team and we were all supposed to have like fit samples  and everyone got their sample and they told me that my sample was missing and they couldn't find it and so I asked them can't you just make another sample nope they never made me a sample so I was the only girl who never got a sample I worked for a designer where  basically she was anonymous for swagger jacking and so anytime an employee would come in and she thought something was cool that  she wanted to dupe um for example I had a pair of like cargo pants  that she liked so she had me come into the design room they literally took pictures just like Brandy Melville of my garment and then took pictures of it asked me where I got it from um asked me to bring in the item  so they could spec it and take measurements measurements of it and start designing it and literally the next collection it would literally be on  on the line and then it would be named sometimes the employees name  their last name and alluding to that you know employee and the employee would  never get any credit so just like this creator I would literally have to be in meetings because this person my boss whatever that I'd have to meet with would be hours late to our meetings because they were late to literally every meeting in their schedule in their calendar so sometimes I would be waiting for them on a zoom call till 7:00 at night um sometimes I just would tell them whenever they were ready that I had prior plans so one time I was called during a yoga class that I had to do my job even though she was two hours late to our meeting and I tried to cancel it and if I didn't go to this yoga class I was gonna be charged $35 which was probably like $5 to her and I also had to stand up multiple dates because our meetings would go over two hours and she would just say this is your life work is your life just like devil wears Prada so I literally had no  work life balance and I had no dating life I think verbatim one time someone told me  we don't pay you to go on dates we pay you to work and do your job it was 9 o'clock at night I don't know what to tell you so they were too cheap for a transportation um business service or whatever so sometimes I'd have to bring samples back to and from like the office to like photoshoots or wherever or influencer houses and so one time I had a death in the family um I had a rush home to my parents house and I had like thousands of dollars of merchandise in my car and I was just like in fight or flight mode and no one you know reminded me that I had all this product in my car and some days like I would literally have like me and my co workers would have to leave thousands of um dollars of product just in our car because they didn't wanna like bring it back to the office they didn't want us they didn't wanna have to afford like delivery service so we just like keep it in our cars and just it was on US liability to keep the products in our car in our trunks or whatever and so one time I literally had a funeral the next day and they had a photoshoot the next day and I was getting hit up at the funeral literally bombarded with messages about the product in my car and I'm just like I'm on bereavement I'm at a fucking funeral and so finally somebody sent an Uber like 20 miles away cause I lived 20 miles away from work to pick up the shit but a literal funeral I've had a co worker who asked me what you know the whole where you from where your parents from I was like what's my ethnicity like my cultural background and I told her I was Filipino and she goes oh great I've met one of those before definitely worked for companies where there's no diversity uh in the models um on the website or editorial shoots um I had to be customer service for a little while and you know just not great reviews on social media or you know customer complaints and the owner just said well they're not our target customer they don't look like our target customer and you know our customer is small if you're not any of that you don't have to shop here one company the top management told my boss that when she was having a baby that they didn't believe in maternity believe that was more than two weeks because their wives had babies and after two weeks they came back to work she then proceeded to ask them if they had vaginas which they said no and she left for the day and I'm pretty sure she left for her maternity leave right after that one time I was interning at a fashion company and a girl thought it was funny for me to steam her personal dress for an event company like holiday party at the end of the day um my boss found out and she made that the worker formally apologized to me in front of the whole company and then I took the rest of the day off mind you I thought I was steaming a dress for a model that same company that I interned for is notorious for having influencer events at Coachella and they were having an influencer event in the city in LA and they invited the whole company to attend and so everyone got dressed up we're waiting in line and then two hours go by and the literal CEO comes up to me and my coworkers look us up and down and then tells the bouncer don't let them in they're not pretty enough this is only an influencer event we only invited them to be nice when we asked him about it on Monday during the company meeting he said he doesn't remember that so he gaslit the whole company one time I had to come into the office with pink eye because they told me that I they couldn't afford for me to take anymore PTO even though I had it because they bought a new office and they had to make it worth it so I had to come in with pink eye when I used to do makeup and hair on the side um they told me to do makeup and hair for a photoshoot and so I thought I was getting paid for both my regular job and doing makeup and I think I did hair too and they basically told me go fuck yourself this is company time so you're getting paid for doing the makeup and the hair and your job and so if you don't complete your actual job then we're not paying you for the day I also had to bring my own supplies and they said again on company time we're not expensing that you're doing that out of the willingness and support of this company I worked at a company where I was the only one who didn't speak Korean and so there was a meeting going on and I kindly asked them can we all speak in English or try to speak in English I don't understand Korean and the owner of the company told me that I had to learn Korean if I wanted to work there and they had already hired me so I was confused I was like ah we're in America I don't what I'm not learning Korean to work here I don't understand and so they kept looking at me and speaking in Korean and they were like do you understand do you understand like you can bring out your Google Translate so you can understand I was like okay well does anyone not speak English here is that why like do we need a translator they were like no we're just too lazy to speak English what and that's capitalism for you sorry if this gave you PTSD",

    "voice_to_text": "as a traditional egalitarian American Jew it is always really reassuring to see moments and takes like this from other Jews because it can be so isolating in this world to have ambiguous or not perfect love and adoration of the state of Israel and what really changed for me and how I got here was the fact that in 2011 after college I did economic development with Bedouins in southern Israel I was about 10 minutes outside of beersheva I was within the 67 border and I just saw first hand how dehumanizing the occu Pa tion is and how horrific it has been for people even those that are considered Israeli citizens um and so in this Bedouin town called Lachia uh I was there and everybody had water tanks that I thought was kind of weird until I realized sometimes the water just goes out sometimes you're mid shower and you're just shit out of luck and this is the desert like water you can't just like run to a spring right there's just not a river to go to I Learned that a lot of what the organisation as part of was doing was literacy because for decades like literally after the founding of Israel there were no schools close by for Bedouins and traditionally Bedouins the men would go and roam with the herds and the woman would stay near the house and do a lot of the farming and so men would go to school because that felt kind of akin to what they did previously but it was a lot harder they didn't feel comfortable sending their women and so there's like whole generations of women that are illiterate and they're having to do a lot of catch up because the state wasn't bringing schooling close and affordably to them there's also a lot of ancestral claims of land in the desert by Bedouins and because those claims aren't recognised when people build houses they're considered like unrecognised and the state will come and demolish them they won't provide any services and they will come and raze their homes to the ground um this was happening all over the south while I was there um and it's really traumatizing to watch that oh and on top of that like I would travel around Israel like I had weekends off I had holidays the number of like terrible things that people felt comfortable saying to me was astonishing they were like why are you working with better ones when you can work with Jews they would you know talk about just how more like animalistic Arabs are um it was baffling to me and incredibly insulting because these people had like taken me into their homes they had welcomed me they had been very very kind to me and like it was just so wild to be watching Jewish Israelis like spout this nonsense that like people used to say about us all over like the irony was not lost on me and the thing is that most American Jews do not get ever get an experience like I did they might go a little bit into like parts of Jerusalem but they're not spending time really in depth of Palestinians they're not having conversations they're not building relationships and that's on purpose that's that's on purpose um so they're only seeing one side of it they're only getting one narrative and it has been so built up that this state is so key for our safety that it's the sort of us versus them thing that like if they have a chance they're going to wipe us from the face of the earth like all of this has been so built up that I think even now even now when you see some of the most horrific things happening in Gaza like people are still you know doing what about October 7th what about the hostages what about this like two wrongs don't make a right and it's deeply deeply hurts me as somebody that like believes that my Judaism is about showing up well in this world like my practice is about both connecting to the divine but also like connecting to the earth connecting to people and like what we leave behind matters and like this state all of those things is is now my Judaism and for community that often relishes discussion relishes debate and has such a welcoming kind of large tent perspective the radical hard lines that I'm seeing within Jewish spaces around this topic like it's not often safe to even have just to be able to say like I have an ambivalent relationship to Israel like I don't see it as my homeland or I like even just having some critical discussions of what the state is doing is considered radical and like that's not it shouldn't be like this and my hope is that we're finally getting to this moment where we can really start reclaiming that like Judaism does not equal Zionism they're two different ideologies there's lots of people that have an overlap but that doesn't mean if you criticize Zionism you criticize Judaism one is not the other these are apples and oranges for God's sake and for 2,000 years we have been living all over the world and as an American Jew and as a Jew of the diaspora that's the Judaism that I have really fallen in love with is this idea of what does it mean to have a relationship with god my people my faith no matter where I am um and one of my favorite prayers is the kedusha which is about how God's holiness is everywhere and bless the place of god and I think about that a lot which is we do have a lot of liturgy around Jerusalem around Zion but what I really think about is how do we bring the divine in here and now and what does that look like and it does not look like what the Israeli state is doing in Rafa it does not look like what's happening in Gaza",

particular that happened over the past year and a half two years has really stood out to me so I've always been surrounded by the paranormal growing up uh I grew up watching Ghost Adventures and Ghost Hunters all the TV shows you know the deal May 23rd, 2014 I went on my first ever ghost hunt at the parks Bentley House in South Glens falls New York or Moreau New York I was hooked instantly it was a great time and ever since then I've been ghost hunting pretty consistently over the past year and a half two years or so we started YouTube uh we've started doing you know TikTok and Instagram a lot more and I've been able to go full time on social media which is absolutely insane had the opportunity to be on Destination Fear had the opportunity to work with a ton of awesome creators uh it's been a wild ride but anyway without YouTube we would not have even caught this would not have thought about it a second time but YouTube has allowed us to document all these things that have happened so we do public ghost hunting events we were down in West Virginia at a place called the Old Hospital on College Hill doing a live stream we were filming down there and the next day we had events we were walking around it was broad daylight with some of our friends and we did an EVP in one of the rooms and we got this name Christopher we're like oh maybe he was a patient maybe he was one of the nurses here one of the doctors that's kinda cool we got a really clear name Christopher the following day we went down to Felicity Ohio to the Broadwell Funeral Home and it was built by a guy named Christopher Broadwell and he was the one who operated the funeral home to start with so to begin with we didn't really put two and two together we're like oh that's kinda weird we got Christopher you know the other day and then we got Christopher here he was the one who built the house I wonder if there's any connection while investigating that home we got the name Christopher Broadwell and we're like okay that's kinda weird the way he said Christopher sounded almost exactly like the you know the EVP that we got at Old Hospital on College Hill in West Virginia but why would he be in West Virginia you know we didn't have plans to go to the Broadwell Funeral Home prior it was just kinda like a whim thing we're already on the road might as well film right then over the next like seven to eight months we get the name Christopher Broadwell on every single paranormal investigation that we went on whether we were filming whether we were just hanging out with friends it did not make any sense because first of all we didn't start out at the Broadwell Funeral Home so how did he know we were in West Virginia second why would he follow us that's so random everywhere everywhere we went but then when we went to Canada we did not get his name so maybe he doesn't have passport so we didn't really believe in attachments before this but we definitely figured that he was just following us around like okay whatever he seems cool and then things took a darker turn we started getting very negative responses you know saying that they're gonna hurt us they're gonna push us down the stairs they're gonna throw something at us and we're like sure be great for a video please do it but then we were told that we were cursed at the General Stone mansion in Indiana which to begin with whatever we're cursed apparently right like we get demon all the time we get demonic all the time we get we're gonna hurt you doesn't happen right so like okay sure fat chance the next day we woke up and our car had a flat tire which was you know weird coincidence but we didn't really think anything of it then my friend Steve who I film with on YouTube went to the gas station just to fill up air in the tire to let us get to Walmart or like a tire shop or whatever and he was involved in a hit and run where someone just backed into him and then left over the next few months we had an insane string of bad luck between multiple flat tires hard drives breaking SD cards just wiping themselves it was pretty freaking nuts actually so far viewers think it's an Egregore or a Tulpa basically every time you talk about it or think about it it gives it energy so we tried to you know leave it alone for a while we didn't bring it up but for our most recent video over on YouTube we went to the CE Kirker building in Manchester Ohio and one of the first EVPs that I got was be careful we proceeded to do an Estes session and we kept getting you know me you know who I am I'm not gonna tell you essentially it seems kinda playful but it also is hinting that it's the thing that's been following us around for however long now like I said I live a very weird life and if I saw this on YouTube or on TikTok I probably wouldn't believe it either but if you guys wanna stay up to date on all of our adventures make sure you go click the link in my bio follow me on all the other social medias follow me here and

I was almost expelled the second to last year from the end of school. And I went through year 9, I think it was. Selling 6 and chocolate bars, Mars bars, Twixes, Snickers to other kids that weren't able to get out a break time to the shops to buy them and also made money on that. My uncle used to buy me the 6 to do that. He's now locked up, but I can't. So I know from experience that schools aren't happy when kids do this. Is he ever backed it up?

We're in his room, we're just hanging out, we like, do stuff, and then we go to bed. Cause I was like, I'll spend the night. So then like, two or three a m, something comes crashing through the window and I like, wake up immediately. What the fuck was that? So I get him up and I'm like, something just crashed through the window. He, like, turns on a light, stands up, it's a girl that's like, just falling through the window through two or three in the morning. And so I just go into the cover cause I was like, what the fuck? And so then she gets up, starts fighting with him, saying like, who's In here, blah, blah, blah. It's his girlfriend. At the time, I had no idea. I wouldn't do that. I don't condone that, but it was. Fucking girlfriend. She was gonna spend the night at her friend's house for, like, partying and drinking. So, yeah, a woman came.

    "voice_to_text": "got shit on when you first find out that bitch you was rocking with let me tell you that this happened to me with um a person who married into my family now this person and I were very very close they married into a close family member of mine I treated them like a sister I really thought that they were like my sister I even put them on my phone like that she was invited to every single family event even girls night that I would have I would invite her because I considered her family I considered her a friend I would leave my door open so she can come anytime when she was my neighbour I would invite her over cook her dinner I would have I would let her watch my daughter I would like trust her with deep vulnerable things and details of my past that I were very very painful for me um and I only told my therapist this is the type of person that I thought that we were so you can imagine my shock when the person that she's married to comes over to me and is like listen um this person is saying that they think that you are plotting on their downfall they don't trust you they don't you know like whatever they have all these thoughts that you're like low key hating and that you're copying their style and like all these crazy things and this evidence that she I mean like I'll give you that evidence when she was initially moving from one state to another she sends me I guess like these Pinterest boards in one of the Pinterest boards she has like a green couch and um great okay whatever moving along a year and a half comes by and one of my cousins is an interior designer and I share a mood board of hers that has a green couch and I'm like oh my god inspo for my new place I wasn't even having a place she knew that but I posted it on my social media and she thought that I was copying her style mind you these are a year and a half separate there's more she like six or seven months ago sends me a picture of her when she had red hair okay now my cousin in the chat that we all share also has red hair and I was thinking about changing my hair this is again six seven months past and I'm like oh maybe I'll do like red hair with like blonde streaks cause I showed them a Pinterest picture not even a picture of her she's like oh yeah I had red hair but that was her evidence that she thought that I was copying her was because once upon a time before we even knew each other she had a red hair according to the person that she was married to she basically doesn't trust me doesn't like me has a problem with me and my heart was broken now mind you I had already noticed that there was a little bit of a change in her but not to the extent of all the things that this person had shared to me I thought that maybe she was just going through something cause she had caught a little bit of an attitude in the family group chat but I reached out to her separately and I was like hey if there's something that I said that maybe triggered you in a different way or maybe you know I said it wrong and you may have misinterpreted like I apologize she was like no girl I just like to clarify overly clarify because I'm still getting to know the rest of your family and I don't want them to think that I'm talking shit or whatever but I love you Baba like I gave her the opportunity to let me know here's the thing my tuition is on point I have a dream like a month before shit really goes down I have a dream that her and I have a falling out in regards to her falling out with her marriage so her marriage and are falling out happen simultaneously now this is before I actually find out that she's not fucking with me so I'm like okay let me text her and when I see her in person I'll tell her the details of my dream cause we're magical people over here okay we believe in dreams we do rituals all that so she's she seems like a little detached when I see her in person she doesn't even inquire which is very not like her aside from that she's being very cryptic about what her plans are so I'm like okay like I don't I don't push anybody to share with me whatever they don't want but I did tell her as I really want you to do well you know like she didn't believe that she can go to college or any of that and she was in college last time I checked so I was proud of her and I wanted her to keep moving she doesn't inquire about the dream so I go and tell the person that she's married to like hey I thought I would warn her but since she's obviously has no interest in talking to me here's the details he's like boy do I have news for you he tells me all the things that she's been saying behind my back to him and how she doesn't feel like like she doesn't want me to know anything about her life because she thinks that I'm hating and copying or whatever don't know what I would have to copy about her life but hey whatever I was devastated like I said we were in a chat um me and all my cousins and her I created a separate chat and I called them all on Facetime and I was just like sobbing I was so angry and then I was sobbing and I was like I can't believe it like the way and nobody else could believe it because there were no signs she always acted like everything was perfectly fine she would come to every single event it wasn't like she wasn't coming I would invite her and she would show up I made t shirts for her in the family I included her my daughter's birthday parties I you know like I fully incorporated her me nobody else incorporated her the way I incorporated her she was at every event because I made it my business to make sure that she was a part of the family and the entire time or the majority of the time that she was married to my family member she thought I was copying hating and low key wanted her downfall and that broke my heart it took me months to recover from that and there's more so um when they start breaking up because they their marriages in shambles my my family member asks for a divorce and because of all the things that she's been saying about me I I unfollow her on social media plus the family members like let's keep some distance I am following on social media when I help that family member move out of their apartment I basically am like listen I wanna talk to you when this kind of settles because I think that there's some stuff that we need to clarify if I care about you I'm the type of person that I wanna have a conversation because if there's a relationship to salvage then I wanna at least give it the effort she says okay yeah no problem whatever moving on though um she starts acting pretty erratic towards my family member or at least that's the way that that person has interpreted it and that family member starts telling the rest of our family how he's feeling in terms of depression and anxiety and how erratic she's behaving towards him or about the divorce and um my family members start unfollowing her because of what my family member is sharing she takes that as because I was the first to unfollow I'm telling everybody else to unfollow her that was just simply not the case because she thinks that I'm the mastermind behold behind all of this she tells her whole family to unfollow me so and the only reason why I know this is because once she shared it with the person that I'm family members with and 2 because all of the family members unfollowed me but still continue to follow the rest of my family they just unfollowed me which is fine like whatever story you need to tell yourself is fine I'm never gonna want anybody to do bad no matter what they did to me so they all follow me and she's created this like mindset where I am this mastermind culprit and every time I hear details about the things that she's said about me to other people to my my friends and my family not her friends and family my friends and family which they come and tell me I it breaks my heart every single time I cannot believe none of us saw it and none of us saw it for real like this person has got to have a personality disorder cause there's no way you could fake it that good but it did break my heart I spent months in therapy just talking about this specifically so those heartbreaks are real",

    "voice_to_text": "okay so this is my second time recording this but anyway we're gonna call this the Walmart man so around when I was in my early 20s my older sister worked at Walmart and I would go there to visit her while she was working because obviously I must have had nothing to do um but I had to be like 22 23 or something like that um because I was driving um so I would just go there and hang out with her sometimes while she was on the clock it's okay she doesn't work there anymore so um she had shared with me that she had been seeing a man and a woman um and she really didn't give much detail just that she seen them and she knew that they were no longer living um because nobody else seemed to see them or be bothered by them um so that was as much as she really gave me she said the man bumped into her didn't say anything and then that the woman would say something but almost like rambling but um you know that's about it and she did mention that the woman was Puerto Rican because she had an accent or something like that when she was talking to my sister but my sister like never responded back to her or anything like that um so little background me and my sister both are um what I call sensitive um whatever you guys wanna call it six cents whatever but um so me and my mom had happened to go to Walmart on a day that my sister was not working um and just for reference my mom is not my sister's mom so we have the same dad or whatever but um so this runs in my dad's family um so we are at Walmart and we're looking for a costume to match a costume that my brother had um we had the previous year before we had got him a anime costume for Halloween for the next year basically so we were looking for a costume for my sister like a a cop costume for my sister cause we're like we don't need to buy his very bought it last year he can be the inmate she can be the cop matching outfits whatever whatever so we're there we're looking can't find it and my mom's like oh your sister needs a shirt for an event that she has coming up um so I need to go look at the girl section so I'm like okay whatever so a little bit of reference my older sister at the Walmart she works in the section where it's like girls boys and then shoes um so most of the time when I was there she was either working in boys or shoes um so you'll understand why this is kinda freaky so this particular day we go and we're now we're in the girls section and we're looking through the shirts my mom was standing in front of one of the tables that have the shirts there and she was kind of looking through the white shirts looking for the size that my my sister needed so she finds it um and she's like looking through the other shirts I don't know why but she's looking through like the orange shirts too um and I was like starting to tell her I was like hey I was like my sister works at this this Walmart and she always says that she sees this man and this woman in here and they bump into her while she's at work but she knows they're not alive and my mom's like well I believe you because when you were about two or three um I have worked for um she worked for this company for like intellectual dis disabilities and um she had to go shopping for them so she um was at this Walmart the same Walmart that were in in present day and um she was shopping for items that the clients had needed so she said this man ends up you know going into cardiac arrest there they had to call like the ambulance and stuff like that and basically he was DOA like there was nothing that anybody could do for him so he died in that Walmart um so she says this and this man comes and appears in front of her and she doesn't flinch she doesn't move she just continues to do what she's doing and me I'm so confused because my mom is the type of person that if somebody staring at her for too long or whatever the case may be she's like can I help you do you need something like why are you staring like take a picture of that song she's very much one of those people um so she didn't say anything to him he stood there he was on the other side of the table he was just staring at us so I was like oh okay okay so my mom walks away he disappears so I said mom I said do you remember what this man looks like or do you remember what he looked like what he had on whatever so she's like oh like I remember what he she's like um yeah I was like he was a white man right and she was like yeah but still she's not like you know so I was like did he wear he wore glasses so she turns around and she's like did you see him cause at this point I'm older my mum knows that I see things and she's like did you see him and I was like he's older like he has like a scruffy beard like it needs to be cut and my mom's like yeah she's like he was my friend's dad so like yeah like she knew the man it was her like friend's stepdad or somebody that lived close stepdad or something or somebody that she knew so she's like yeah she was like you seen him and I'm like yeah she was like so I described everything the man had on button up shirt shorts everything he has something in tan couldn't really make it out here to come find out that's the man that died in at Walmart that day that I seen in the girl section um so I called my sister and I said hey I said I need to talk to you um so I met her at her friend's house she came she sat in the car and I said look I was in Walmart today and I said nothing this man and I described where I seen him in the girls section I described what he had on what he looked like to a t the incident with me had happened when I was 3 years old 2 or 3 years old I was not with my mom I was at daycare so I wouldn't have been there to remember it as like a trauma event I know sometimes kids can remember trauma events but I wouldn't have been there so I shouldn't have known what he looked like what he had on but I explained it to my sister exactly how I seen it exactly what happened exactly the story what we were talking about that I told my mom that she seen a man and a woman in there and everything and my sister start crying and she was like that's the man that bumps into me he bumps into me in a girl section she was like I never told you where I just told you that they basically not don't say like bother her but basically they keep showing herself it's just a crazy situation because she never gave me any details it was more of a me and my sister are more of if you see it you see it too if you don't you don't um because we like to kind of like back not back check but like uh like gift check we wanna see like how good our gift is um I guess um and neither one of us dive into it too much but this was just a another occasion that we were like oh my gosh like this is crazy like he wouldn't show his show himself to me when I was with her but he definitely did when I wasn't with her um and it just was crazy and sometimes people when I tell the story they're like what what um but it was really confirmation when I was telling a story at work one time and one of the paramedics from the actual event um he was he worked at the job that I was working at and he overheard me telling the story at lunch and he turns around and he said I responded to that call that day and I'll never forget it he said there's no way you could know all that information he said you and my daughter are the same age mind you these are people that I ate ate lunch around for years I worked at the job for years and he was like there's no way you should know all that information about that guy and I'm like but I do and it's really like you gotta experience stuff to like really I know some people don't believe it but like it takes some time to experience different things for people to believe but that's my story and there's a lot more where that came from",

    "voice_to_text": "okay I'm gonna make a part 2 probably be the last part of this if anyone cares I made another video before if you don't see the first one but to carry on sort of from where I left off I think I was talking about um my friend in Manchester we had a couple of experiences together the last one before I moved back to Portsmouth uh was uh I used to work at record label so we would do music videos and stuff all the time and there was this one location that we use fairly consistently which was basically an abandoned house effectively it was massive like some old mansion it was horrible man the first time we ever went there it was the most you know when you get the vibe of a place and it's just wrong everything feels wrong the air feels heavy there's parts of the house that are super cold even in the summer you're like oh that is just wrong uh we were doing music video shoot and uh we were shooting upstairs and I was downstairs because obviously I didn't wanna be in the shot um and the entire time you're in this place you feel just this this squeeze of like it sounds sounds silly but like energy there's like the squeeze of energy and I'm just kinda sat there like oh I've something's compelling me to go upstairs in this in this house basically and my whole body I just get the urge or like ah I don't even have sweat like someone is forcing me to go upstairs and so I get my camera I start going up the stairs they're between the shop and this I don't really know how to describe it so at the where the top of the stairs is the roof has come down it's all like black mole it's disgusting this place is like the most rundown house you've ever seen as soon as I get to the top of the stairs it feels as if someone has come up behind me and wraps their arms around me and it's just squeezing effectively like I'm sure if anyone's had that like where your friends will come behind you and wrap your arms around you and squeeze them squeeze as hard as they can that's the exact feeling of how it felt as soon as I went down upstairs and as soon as I went back downstairs people were downstairs looking me going oh you look like you seen a ghost and I I just couldn't shake the feeling that someone was like squeezing me um for about 10 or so minutes until we left and then we were packing up and people leaving each other in the house alone to make scare noises obviously there was nothing going on there that was just people being stupid but on the way back me and my friend who I spoke on the first part of the spooky guy who bro is paranormal um we were driving one of the work cars pack and in the car that we were in there was a baby seat in the back for context I mean this is us assuming for context there is graves all around this house cause it's like an old Victorian probably before that there was tombstones there was graves in the basement like the stairs going down to the basement were made of these gravestones basically and there was again this is all us assuming there is a gravestone of a child like maybe I I can't remember if someone had this like 13 months or something 14 months and uh on our way back it was just me and him in the car and there's an ABC in the back of the car um behind the driver side and we're talking listen to music just chatting you know laughing about the shoe and both of us at the same time glance at the wing mirror uh to so obviously you can see behind you we both glance in there and at the same time we both see a child in the backseat of this car right and both of us sort of we look look confused look at each other and then my friend's driving so I turn and look and obviously there is not a child in the backseat um and God man I'm getting the goosebumps talking about now it was one of the most horrible experiences cause I know we neither of us were like oh shit the other person said we both saw it at the same time both of our hearts dropped over like oh man that house is just so like just bad vibes um never saw anything about a kid again never saw any kids flirting about our our flat nothing like that no more spooky things with kids however we did another shoot at this house and um one of the artists her mom came along for the music video shoot just cause we had a lot of fun and we're in this house and I'm recounting the story that I told last time or I was about to start telling the story that I told last time on the video before about my bedroom so I'm ripping the covers off and her mum before this again this confirmed me that that everything that I'm saying is real and I'm not going crazy her mum looks at me and says uh before you tell the story was it a lady and I was like yes and she goes was it sort of short stature yes dark hair yes and she goes yeah I see her with you I've seen her with you since you started working with us basically and I my heart dropped I could not believe that and she know that and she was like I didn't really wanna say anything in case you didn't believe in any of that but I the confirmation that I got which might not be true who knows I'm just facing off what one person's told me it's a protector this spirit sees themselves as a protector it could be a great grandma or a great something something down the line some ancient relative that sort of got my best interest at heart but yeah it was horrible and she just basically explained to me that she's seen this thing around me all the time she sees it often and she's mega spooky as well I keep coming across spooky people um and I'm I I think that was all that happened to me in Manchester and obviously since I've been back home it's like I know people like oh that's not normal but like footsteps around the house like it sounds like people coming upstairs but I'm home alone um yeah that kind of stuff but I haven't seen anything I'm not heard anything vocally I never ever have and I'm so grateful that cause I think I would shit myself and and since talking in the last year nothing's happened so let's hope it stays that way if there's anything uh also as well these videos aren't really appearing on my for you page anymore so if people have their own stories and don't wanna make a video I will read them in the comments I love this whole thread of stuff so thanks",

So it's me, my granny, and then my dad, my great aunt is the one taking a photo of us. Okay. I don't know. Why no one seen anything then but take the photo. Day goes on, we're chilling. My grandma gets off work, and my dad's like, yo, like, why did we need to have a photo so bad? And she's like, I just had, like, a weird feeling, you know, I just needed y'all to have a photo. And I'm assuming cause my granny was, like, getting to that age, you know, it was just, you know, and couple months, months go by, my granny ends up passing away. I would say another maybe year or so. And my dad ended up getting off really late from work one night and noticed something incredibly freaking weird in this photo. The next morning, he showed me. And as soon as I figured out what he was talking about in this photo, I literally bawled my eyes out. I was scared, I was happy, I was freaked out, I was mind blown. But, yeah, here's the photo. I'm gonna cover my dad's face because I don't know if he wants me to show his face on my social media, but, um, yeah, it's a photo. As you can tell, it's real. Um, my dad, my granny, me. And then tell me what that is. Go ahead and just take a moment of silence. Is it's needed. Yeah. There's somebody in a shirt. That's quite literally nobody in a shirt. We also were thinking, like, this little shadow might be a face, but that might Just be a little far fetched. But yeah, that's my weird little story. It's. It's very weird and I really don't know what else to say because I talk so freaking fast. Um, yeah. It definitely comes in handy though, cause if anybody comes to my house and they're like, I don't believe in ghosts, I'm like, what about now? What about now? Cause I got a fucking picture.",

    "voice_to_text": "I remember this story when my mom told me this. And this was, um, I think when I was a baby, like, maybe a few months old, or perhaps, um. Maybe a year old. I don't know. I can't quite remember. So I turn memory. Toby. Sorry. Distraction. But basically, um, back in California, where I used to be, uh, where I was birth at. Where in California? I don't remember. But in California, my mom and my dad, they. I think they lived in, like, a small house next to the train tracks. And apparently someone told them that, like, late at night, a little boy ran outside at the middle of the night and got hit by a train. No one knows why the boy was out there, how he got out, and all that shenanigans. But sometimes, uh, when my mom will be sleeping, she would suddenly wake up, and it will be at 2 or I think 3:00am. I can't quite remember, but I'm trying. My mom will wake up feeling all panicked, and she's like, I need to check the kids. So she'll check my brother's room, she'll check my sister's room, and then she'll check my room, and then she'll kind of, like, sit in the living room until the train goes by, and all of a sudden, she'll. She'll feel fine, and she'll go back to bed. This happened for, like, probably a few months, I think. And there were. There was a Time where I think my uncle or cousin, uh, they came over the visit, and they, uh, spotted one of my toys. My baby toys, like, started to go off. Like, I. I don't think it was playing sounds or anything. It was just blinking lights. And the batteries. I think the toy was also turned off or had no batteries, but I can't quite remember. But like I said, almost every night, exactly at the same time, all the time, she would wake up feeling panic, checking my brother, my sister and me. And then as a train goes by, she'll feel perfectly fine. Then one night, my mom, she had the same feelings again. She woke up feeling panicked. She went in my brother's room, but she did something different instead. She sort of, like, I guess kind of crouched, like, in the middle of my brother's room and rocking back and forth, like she was cradling a small child. And she was saying to herself, like, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Like, she was comforting, like a little child. And after that, everything just sort of stopped. My mom didn't wake up feeling all panicked, and she didn't have the sudden urge to watch or to check on my siblings and me. Like, it was just gone. Like, maybe my mom, like, gave the ghost some comfort and, like, moved on or something. I don't know. But that. That story kind of sticks with me. A Lot. Even though I was really young, when I was still a baby. But it's an interesting story. And my mom kind of cries a lot every time she tells the story. And she gets goosebumps, too. But I think it's kind of cool. And yeah.",

    "voice_to_text": "give me the tea what's the drama so this story happened about a year and a half ago and it frustrates me beyond belief and it will frustrate you too because I do not have answers and I'm never gonna get them I used to work at a cafe in a very highly populated tourist location now a few things I wanna note is that our boss was never at the store she was always at her other location so our locations was basically managed by the shift leads and just it was just a ton of young adults just taking care of the place we treated it nicely we had a fun time and from what I know I got along with most of my co workers like the I don't really have issues with anyone like the extent of the beef I had with someone was just being frustrated that I can make five drinks and work register and the time it takes takes for them to make a grilled cheese sandwich on a panini press like that let's extent of the issues I have with people anyways I worked there for a year and a half I consider my coworkers my friends we've gone out hung out before hung out at people's houses gone to gone out to bars you name it we were hanging out we celebrated birthdays together like which is why this whole situation baffles me so much so a year and a half after working there I decide to quit it's just bit too repetitive and I felt like I could be making more money since our location didn't accept digital tips and no one was carrying cash on them after the pandemic and tourists don't really know tipping culture which is fine but like we are losing so much money not having digital tips and I don't go far I go to the store next door cause we're in a mall and which I got digital tips there and let me tell you the difference is astounding and the three months I worked at this new store I made $500 in digital tips alone so not the point of the story let's go back a week into me working at this new job I decided to go to the cafe to get one of my favourite drinks and say hi to people and I'm texting one of my old co workers from the cafe that I'm doing this and she's responding oh my gosh I bet they'll be so excited to see you yada yada yada no no they are not so I go in I think everything's fine they take my order I get my drink and then one of my co workers my old co workers comes up to me and says hey our boss says you're shit talking all of us so no one really wants to see you here and I wouldn't come back I was speechless I wanted to ask questions I didn't she walked away and I felt like I wasn't gonna get answers if I tried so I leave I leave and I call up that friend I was just texting and I do have bad anxiety so this whole thing threw me into a panic attack obviously when you're being told you're shit talking everyone when you're not so I'm on the phone I'm crying to my coworker she's confused um we get off the phone and I send a message to my old boss that just says hey I went into the store this is what I heard I do not appreciate it or find a professional that you are bad talking ex employees especially since I was there for a year and a half and I thought I had a good relationship with my boss so then she text me back and what she says is I did not know how negative you were until I saw the messages and that's where I was like hold up what messages I was confused I'm asking what messages we're having a conversation she's not telling me so I have to contact another co worker an ex co worker from the cafe who quit before I did that I was really close to like she's the one where it's like when she quits I'm done like that's that was our friendship and she's like that's so weird and trying to figure out what's going on as well and this is just what I've gathered from what my ex boss texted me and what my coworker gathered according to my boss I have been shit talking everyone via text message not only that I have yelled at customers twice to the point where they went to mall security about me which does not make sense of why they wouldn\u2019t  just ask for manager and also I'm the type of person who if I get mad I start crying I will start bawling my eyes out before I even raise my voice I will apologize and cry like that's who I am and I'm also just just how this information is presented to me is very confusing of how she got this information because she's never in the store so someone must have passed this information on to her and the fact that I never knew that I apparently yelled at two people while I was working there like this is never brought up to me by her or anyone anyways my ex coworker reaches out to people and everyone says they have no idea what I'm talking about which I know is a lie I just know it's a lie and I try finding out what the messages say no one will tell me I could be calling them slurs for all I know and I can't do a thing about it on top of that um the girl I was texting before I walked into the cafe text me again a very long paragraph of her being mad at me saying that she didn't think it was appropriate that I texted our ex boss about it which I disagree with because sure it would be inappropriate if I sent those messages and was trying to cover my trail that's highly inappropriate but I didn't know what anyone was talking about by the time the time I sent that message to my boss I did not know there was fake messages going around all I heard was my ex boss is shit talking me to my coworkers and I didn't like that like I did not know that I'm apparently shit talking people in messages cause I didn't make any messages and just to be just so you know just to be clear I was so paranoid that maybe I said something and forgot that I don't really delete my text messages much I made my roommate go through every single text messages I had with co workers year and a half guys year and a half of any text messages I made him look through every single text message I sent to a co worker while I was there so I made sure you looked at all of them to see if any of them warranted the response to what my boss sent me and none of them did like I said the biggest beef I had was complaining that and the time I was working register and doing drinks I made like five drinks it took one person to make a grilled cheese sandwich that takes me 30 seconds I'm sorry that was the beef that was the extent of the beef so obviously something worse as I play here and I wish I had more story to give you but that's it I did reach out to um my boss in January cause I needed my W2 and I was very nervous to talk to her but I just reached out um after I got what I needed I was like hey you don't have to believe me I just want you to know that the messages we're talking about are fake I don't- I didn't send them I don't even know what they say I don't know who did it and I don't know why and that's the most frustrating part cause you know if someone's like well why would someone do that I don't know I try to be as nice as I can to everyone I try to treat people how I wanna be treated I don't I don't have any answers so yeah that's how my favourite job turned into an extremely traumatizing experience that gave me so many trust issues and now I have a very hard time getting close to co workers because I thought I got along with all of my co workers fine but someone decided they hated me enough to go through the effort of saying I was shit talking everybody and they are in that store acting like they didn't do that and are being friends with everybody and I just find it frustrating cause I worked there they knew me for a year and a half I feel like they would know I feel like they'd know me better that I wouldn't do this but I guess I guess fake messages AI however it's coming about is difficult to decipher I don't know I don't know what they said anyways um if any of my old co workers still follow me I'm sorry I hold you guys in such high regards I considered you my friends I don't I don't know what to say I don't know what I can say to make it better cause it's been very clear no one believes me but I just want to apologize the fact that someone decided that they felt the need to do this and to spread so much hate among these people I anyways that's the drama that's the tea choose your friends wisely cause you never know you never know and if the person who made these messages happens to be watching this video I am I'm so sorry that you have so much hate in your heart that you needed you felt the need to do this especially after I already quit I don't know if the goal was to try and get me fired and that I quit before you could and you did it anyways like I don't know what your goal was here and I'm just sorry you felt the need to do that and I hope you can find peace and happiness within yourself and your own life without having to take other people down to get there peace and love",

    "voice_to_text": "summer break might be gone for Philadelphia schools in the near future and this is not clickbait yes it's true um during last week City Council meeting um the superintendent Tony Watlington announced that he is working carefully with Mayor Cheryl Parker's office to pilot a year round school calendar in 20 schools here in Philadelphia we don't know which schools are gonna be but I'm gonna explain to you more about um the pilot I'm gonna give you my thoughts and feedback on why this may or may not work first Maya Parker um her platform one of our platforms when she was running for mayor last year was education right she's been quoted as saying the current school calendar is antiquated and outdated and she's also been known to say you know our children are no longer working the farms in the summertime however did you know that the summer break was actually implemented by rich New York families who wanted to go away um they want to go to Europe they want to go out to the Hamptons actually not farming schedule side note so the again there were no specifics um the big thing is how much will this cost taxpayers um however the school district is gonna roll out um early start or before school programs and they're gonna add more enrichment programs as well and again it's gonna be 20 schools and if the pilot program works out this will happen for all schools in the 2025 2026 school year so here in Philadelphia currently you know my son's school ends June 7th and at some of the charter schools I work at I was till June 7th or the following week and I'm like when do you go back after Labor Day that's a long time that's nearly three months that's actually um more than New York City schools and my biggest thing is if you're gonna have school year round and you wanna have these smaller breaks in between just like they do like in European countries you gotta have air conditioning do you remember uh two weeks ago quarterback Jalen Hurts donated $200,000 for air conditioning in 10 schools here in Philly and I'm sure there are more schools that don't have proper AC and if you don't have proper AC in the summertime you know what that means the kids are literally gonna be suffering sweltering and sleeping another thing I wanna touch on is supplies um most of the schools that I substitute teach at have supplies but I know there was a school last week I went to make copies and a teacher was like did you bring your paper I'm like excuse me what so she's like oh yeah we have to bring our own paper so she's like you can have some of mine this was new to me I've been teaching for 11 years I've never had to bring my own paper and you know as the day went on the kids kept raising their hand saying they wanna go get their pencil cases out of their locker and I was like wait a minute you don't have no pencil where the pencils at they pointed to the closet yo there was seven pencils in the closet and now and another kid was like hey Miss Flowers um we have to bring our own pencils and then somebody goes yeah no crayons I say you have to bring your own supplies so this is one school out of like the eight that I saw that but imagine how many more schools um don't have access to all these supplies or they're asking families to bring in supplies another topic is okay you wanna have school year round you gonna have these smaller breaks in between so like in Australia I think they have 195 days um similar to in the UK here in the US we have 180 days of school like mandatory right but if we're shortening these summer breaks and we're taking smaller breaks throughout the school year who gonna teach I like my extended summer break I do I'm also a mom to have a kid and when I first started teaching I thought it was just really convenient that my calendar matched up with my kids that meant if he was all for rashashana I'm home with him and so on so you gotta also have educators who are gonna be committed to this right now I've been looking online and um a few websites said the average salary is 81,000 for Philadelphia um but those are for teachers pretty much who have master's degrees and they could be sped certified um they're also experienced I went to the district's website and I was looking at the average salary for like years two three four five and I mean they were like in the 60s right now correct me if I'm wrong if I'm an experienced teacher I don't wanna work in the school the 1 out of 20 that has a shorter summer break I'm probably gonna end up going to a different school so you gotta entice the educators with more money all teachers should be paying more money anyway so I am very curious about how this is gonna go um and again this is happening in September for 20 random schools here in Philadelphia um again if it all goes well then it'll be spread across the city and I think um Philadelphia if it goes well could set the standard for other big cities like Los Angeles New York um Chicago school districts if you are a teacher in Philly sound in tap in in the comments what do you think about school year round also if you if your kid goes to school year round so let's say you live in Australia you live in the UK or um France also tap in how families work around that holiday schedule does your job accommodate I know here in America we work all the time so I'm curious how this is gonna go who knows y'all I might end up being a sub in one of these 20 schools um in September",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, my turn. But this one comes from ancient Rome, and this is thought to be the first ghost story ever written down. It comes to us from plenty the younger, who lived between about 50 and 116 AD, so nearly 2,000 years ago. And it came to him from his freedmen, or freed slave, Marcus. Now, Marcus, as the story goes, had a brother. Now, one day when they were sleeping next to each other, as slaves tended to do, his brother was struggling to fall asleep. Now, he looked over and he saw in front of him a figure sitting on the bed, looking at him. And to his horror, when he looked down, he saw that this figure had shears in his hand. This figure rose from the bed, walked towards him, picked up his brother's hair and cut the hair. Now, somehow, I don't know how, Marcus's brother eventually fell asleep. And in the morning, he woke up and he thought, wacky dream. But when he looked down, he saw that his hair was all over the floor. Now, Marcus told this to Pliny, who thought, yep, that is pretty weird. And he thought nothing of it until somebody else came to him with a very similar story. This time, it was one of his slaves. Now, this slave was sleeping in the slave quarters, so he was surrounded by other slaves who probably sleeping on mattresses on the floor, or maybe beds if they were Lucky. So the slave was again struggling to fall asleep. And he saw two figures dressed in white enter the room through the window. And guess what they had in their hands? She is one of them. Turns towards the slave, walks towards him, picks up his hair and cuts it. The figures then move back and walk out the way that they came through the windows. And when he woke up in the morning, he thought, weird dream. But he looked down, and to his horror, his hair, chopped from his head, was spread all over the room. Now, he told plenty this, and plenty then told a Roman senator. So what I feel like is really spooky about this. Is that plenty clearly thought that there was some truth to this. It had been corroborated on different occasions. And there was a similar pattern of events occurring. What I'd love to know is why were these figures cutting the hair of the slaves? Why weren't they cutting Pliny's hair, or his family's, for example? But it's spooky nonetheless, and it's completely magical. Because it's the first one that we have risen down. And actually, Pliny wrote another ghost story. Which I'd love to tell you. So make sure you like and follow, and I'll tell you very soon.",

    "voice_to_text": "here's a guy to spot a fake friend before they can turn on you and make your life a living hell tell you the truth um I had a fake friend this happened all the way back in elementary school I don't know if it was like sixth grade oh no no not sixth grade seventh grade or 8th grade because during seventh grade and eighth grade we both have different lunches so like my elementary school we will start until 11:45 or seventh grade will start until 11:45 and then eighth grade will start until 12:25 and for the seventh graders their lunch will end around 12:25 until the eighth graders come in around 12:25 and we end around 12:40 or 12:50 I don't remember okay but back to the story though when I caught when my friend was fake was when um I used to invite this boy to my house and we used to watch some crazy movies like um Rated R movies like this movie called Scary Movie is like one of those comedy movies those is like scary movies but it's those comedy ones so me and my friend we were watching Scary Movie 4 we were laughing about it and all that until um the way how I found out that he was fake I mean like he didn't he never talk bad about me he never said anything like that I know it sounds confusing though but he never said anything bad about me but the way how I found out that he was fake about me was when um one of my things will go missing like this one time that um there was a bike outside but it was already broken though it was in the front of my yard so it was like an orange bike the wheels were like broken already and I don't know where um like I don't remember um it being gone until my mom says something like cause nobody never used that bike so I went outside and it wasn't there so I thought my mom like took it in or something like that so I didn't even mind cause I really didn't care for the bike until couple days later I went to my friend's house and I see it right there on his front yard and I really didn't say anything because I thought it was like his including the wheels just like mines were missing though too and the same color to it too and then my mom starts um she would she didn't starts anything with her my mom was like is that my son's bike and my friend who lies I mean like I never knew he lied but he lied to my mom saying that no that's not his and my mom looked at it and she was still um like looking around about it and I forgot what she did until she said a yes yes she did a yes he did not just that that was missing um I used to have these Beyblades I've been like I I don't know if you guys might know what that is like Beyblades if I could say that right cause my brother love those things you just put them on a knob then you just take it and it just spins all over the board cause my brother love those toys a lot so then uh my brother had like five then two were missing and there were sold two so two were missing ever since that friend who took my bike came into my house and those two were missing so then um my mom told my brother saying that do you know what happened to your other Beyblades and my brother says no so then um I don't know what happened until one of my other two friends told me they were like um yeah this boy just sold us these two Beyblades and they gave it back to us and I don't know why I still didn't see it as a bad flag well yeah bad flag red flag matter of fact I still didn't see it though I just don't know why and I still hang out with this boy and not just that I had an iPod not the iPod touch it's the it's those old times iPod with the circle thing and then you click on the song I had one of those iPods and I loved it so much cause I had all of my favorites songs in it and like a week or month later until the summer time was coming that gone missing and then cause it had my name on the back and tell you truth that got me so mad because I'm like he did came and that end up missing and the name on it had my name on it and then I don't know where he tried to sell it and the back of it was all scratched up when I looked at it I was like why is the back of it all scratched up and it was two different peoples again that came up to me they were like yeah we know this was your iPod until they told me to stop hanging out with him and I don't know why I still didn't see that as a red flag this is the part when I knew he was a bad friend right here until lunch time I said this in the beginning about the lunch time about this um seventh graders and eighth graders around um 11:45 that's when the seventh graders are done eating their lunch no no no no that's when they start eating their lunch the seventh graders sixth through kindergartens until um 12:25 so my well my friend I don't know if I should call him that well that friend had saw an iPhone between my teacher's office and next to it next to my teacher's office there's a girl's bathroom and a boy's bathroom and the phone was literally right there I think it was like an iPhone five so he was walking back and forth to the um girls bathroom and the boys bathroom they caught him on the um camera the school cameras so then I don't know what happened so he took it I didn't see the videos they just said that he took the phone and put it in his pocket and then I don't know what else happened until I had lunch and then the next day I don't know why it didn't happen that day but the next day they did went to his house the lunch ladies went to his house cause it was a lunch lady's phone so they went straight to his house and they were like did you take my phone he literally had that phone on his hand but the case wasn't on it and then he said no and he blamed me and he told he told my address to them though too cause they said where does he live like me they were like he lives in this address and he wrote it down though too and they went straight to my house and that's when the lunch lady came to my house cause I love this lunch lady she was so nice and so sweet and all that her son came and her husband came they knocked at my door they were like did you take my phone with the lunch lady she was so happy to see me though too but she was like she was like but the real question is did you take my phone I was like no she was like oh your friend told me that he you took my phone and all that she was like not just you another friend though too no I'm like she he like another friend like he not just me that he ratted out  he ratted out  another friend though too and the address is on the paper though too and I did say what's the name and they did told me the name I was like now I know he's a bad friend I was like no no no I was like no he's in seventh grade I'm in eighth grade and they were like what is that then she did told me she was like yeah we know that he he said that you took it during lunchtime I was like no I didn't I said I had different lunches with that boy cause I have a I have a since 12:25 he has it at 11:45 and she did knew that I was speaking the truth that I did had a different times and we were both in different grades tell you the truth not well actually this Saturday not this Saturday coming up I just saw his brother at um Dorney but as I was saying when um they were done talking to me they went to the other friend's house and then that's when they noticed that he was a liar Until um  two to three days I don't remember like two to three days I went up to the lunch lady I said did you ever get your phone back she was like yes but then I had to like um get a new case for it though too it was exact same case and he factory reset that whole iPhone all over again I said so what's gonna happen to the boy I was then that's when she told me she was like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna be suing him and taking him to court for that for stealing my phone I was like really she was like yeah and that boy um he went to I don't know where he went until he moved somewhere else even including the lunch lady told me she said yeah I'll tell you the truth I I know I can't tell you what to do though but I think it would be the best if you don't hang out with him no more and I did so that I said I never saw those red flags she was like yeah I know but just next time don't hang out with him because what just happened I don't think that it will be a good idea for you to hang out with him again um tell you the truth I did heard people talk behind his back though that he always steals a lot and tell you the truth I ignored those people until I saw it for my own self so I tell you that I I don't know why I never saw this as a red flag cause I just don't have no other friends I know it's hard to make friends out there though but it's just I haven't I just I but right after that incident I never saw that boy ever again",

And after she got it removed, she had to go to therapy. And I don't remember the name of the place, but the lady that was the receptionist, her and my mom would talk. They would always chitchat, good friends or whatever. Just from therapy and, you know, being proud. Moms talk about their kids. I was a decent player, and, you know, my mom was very proud and she would talk up a storm about me. And this other lady said, you know, her son was pretty good, very modest. And one day I went, I had the car and I went and picked her up, and I got to talk to the lady. So I asked her who her son was, cause, you know, I knew most of the hoopers. Her son was Michael Beasley. I got to meet him. Cool fucking guy. And try it out for DC Assault. It was like mid AU season. Um, they had their practices at Georgetown University. Like, you walk in and there's Alan Iverson, Jersey framed. He's a certified bucket. It don't. It didn't matter what you did, he scored. You can shoot, dribble, pull up, even though you had to fight through a bunch of screens. But, like, even on the island, it didn't matter. Like, fuck it, 6:10 post game. Yeah, fuck it.",

Um\u2026 I was in elementary school when this happened. My dad worked at this place that had frequent stray animals, and this was no different. Um\u2026 one night he brought home a dog that we named Bear, because he was covered in soot and he looked like a little bear. Um\u2026 he was extremely old, he was blind in one eye, completely deaf, he walked with a limp, he was just really not in good shape and we didn't think he would live that long\u2026 so\u2026 Dad brought him home and decided he could live with us for the rest of his life, for however long that may be, and we had him maybe three or four months before he did eventually pass away. So the story really starts a couple months after he died. One morning my parents and I were getting ready to go to church, and I had this little clipboard that I would write Bible verses on as my preacher would talk about them, and we were all ready and in the car and about to go and I remembered that I had forgotten it upstairs, so my mom gave me the house key and let me go back inside by myself, which I hated every second of because I hated being in the house by myself\u2026 and another thing, I need to explain the upstairs interior just a little bit. So you have the staircase, and then at the top of the staircase directly in front of the landing is my room, and then if you're at the top of the landing and you turn right, there's a hallway that connects to my brother's room, and in that hallway there's a closet. So now that that's out of the way, as I was leaving my room, at the bottom of the stairs there was this decently sized orb of light that came up, it went down the hall, and then it went into the closet and just kind of hovered in the doorway of the closet\u2026 and it was about the height of where Bear's head would have been if he was standing right there. And I just wanna say that I wasn't scared of this, I didn't feel anything evil from it, I didn't feel anything really\u2026 but I just couldn't help but feel like it it was Bear, like he was there, he was checking on me saying \u201chi! how are you?\u201d and that was that. And I've told plenty of people about this, but most people don't believe me, and simply for the fact that most people don't think that animals have souls\u2026 and that nothing really happens to them once they pass over, but I I like to think that it was him. :)",

    "voice_to_text": "I feel people are gonna think I'm crazy, but I have to tell this ghost story. So after my mom passed away, we were thinking about moving. So my dad told me that I should probably clean out her music studio where we used to play music together. Um, maybe take some pictures of it and solve some of the instruments in there. I'm like, okay, that sounds like a good idea. So I go out there one night and I'm looking around, and I find this CD for this band called Sunset Curve. And I never seen it before, and I never heard of them. So I was like, maybe I should listen to it while I'm cleaning. So I put it in and I press play, and music is pretty good. But then all of a sudden, I start hearing the screaming. And it's not coming from the CD, it's coming from the room that I'm in. And all of a sudden, these three boys just appear in my mom's studio. So I start screaming, and then they start screaming, and I just book it out of there, cause, like, I'm not trying to get haunted or whatever. And I passed my dad and my brother, and they don't believe me that there's ghosts in my mom's studio. So I'm just like, what is going on? What is happening? So take a moment to calm myself in my room before going back out there. And I grab a Little cross. Cause, like, they're ghosts and I need to protect myself. I don't know what they're capable of. And I go back and I'm looking around and I don't see them, but, like, I know I saw something. Like, I'm not crazy, right? And all the sudden I hear this voice behind me go, well, we're all a little crazy, right? I turn around and the boys are back. So I'm screaming again, but I managed to calm down and I'm talking to them. And it's weird because they're really cute. But there's no such thing as cute ghosts, right? And it turns out they're a band from the 90s called Sunset Curve. And they died in 1995 from eating bad hot dogs. And nobody else can see them. My brother came in, he couldn't see them, my dad came in and he couldn't see them. But they can hear them when they play. So I'm thinking of starting a band with them and calling it Julie and the Phantoms.",

I just didn't really think that his last name went with my first name, and I said as such to him. But I was adamant. I wanted us to have the same last name. I wanted us to be the last name, um, like as a family. And I wanted our children to have just one last. I didn't want a double barrel because his last name was really long, and double barrel in his last name with my last name just sounded ridiculous. But, um, we spoke about it at length and actually came to the. Well, he came to the decision because I said to him if he was really upset and didn't want to take my last name, then I would take his. But I didn't particularly want to. And he said after a while of deliberating about it that he did not care what his last name was. He had no attachment to his last name particularly, other than it was just what he knew. So we took my last name. We told everyone that needed to know. It was put on, um, at our Wedding on a balloon that my mum had got for us. And it was. Yeah, it was well known amongst our families that. That we were gonna be keeping my last name. And his mum didn't like it. His mum hated it, in fact, and even suggested. FYI, his mum and dad aren't married, so they have different last names. His last name is his dad's. Was his dad's last name, not his mum's. So his mum didn't even have the same last name as him and was horrified that we were gonna take mine. And I believe she probably still angry about it now. Um. And. And then even suggested that we take her last name, so we wouldn't have my last name or his last name, we would take her last name, which is not associated with either of us.

    "voice_to_text": "I think that just that flick is switching me where I was like okay so you both tried sleeping with my husband you will contacted as many people that I knew or that I had a past with um to try to actually with them as well or get them to be on your side until I'll then told you guys to screw off let's see oh sorry if you guys didn't watch this miss it but I'm gonna list a whole bunch of things three people have done as to why you not feel bad about blasting them on the internet and on my previous videos also I just wanna work so I'm gonna make this pretty fast Taylor you better not come out as a victim later on as soon as you figure out because if I end up losing his job watch after all this do you wanna know why you're not gonna come out as a victim even though I did only have three times on you because over a year ago when it happened with you guys you argued with me here on TikTok actually about how how I was abuser and you gave me such a hard time remember that okay I saw the screenshots about how I abused somebody like him and yet here you are you two went out of your way for a year to contact these people um you tried breaking me and Chris up oh god I don't know how many times just because he may be with you why did you go out of your way even if he's already out why do you keep going back hold on I need to share specifically you guys spread so many rumours and lies about me being pregnant and abortions that it actually got to my mom at a government state job it's pretty impressive how far that rumour went you broke up a kid's two kids best friendships with each other all for yourself because you were upset made everyone think that I was the reason for you two breaking up meanwhile fell to share how you cheated on him from like the very beginning of your guys relationship oh and also well the other person teacher's kids with some kind of siblings was pregnant and then had to have her baby because you're such a great girl girls right and I was a I was a bad one you helped him disconnect cameras so I couldn't see you coming in and out of the house when you get upset message me all the things those two other people had to say about me or supposedly have to say about me and hopes it would hurt my feelings and I quote they share all your secrets making attempts to break up my friendships which hey you guys didn't manage to do that so you get to see at least a lot what shocked my socials so much you literally even look at my Pinterest I would never even thought about that bitch I don't even know didn't even know your number yeah didn't even know your number that was one of the nights that Chris abused me because you wouldn't give up the number why didn't you give up the number oh because when you were helping him cheat on me back in September um you guys were arguing the vehicle I guess and I don't know what happened but you flipped your vehicle but it was kind of Chris's fault so Chris feels guilty about that plus your mom got him arrested so that he wouldn't give up your number or your address when you came in the car I literally blocked and put all my socials on private I don't know how many times all the way into my Pinterest just to avoid you guys from watching me so damn closely I couldn't even breathe without you guys knowing what I was doing either because you were talking to somebody trying to figure it out and asking them or just being creep and watching and driving by non stop oh did I mention the fight from like the fifth time probably Taylor just randomly shows up at Chris's house I don't know about you guys but when I'm trying to get out of a relationship I don't keep going back and especially attacking a new girl that he's with cause I'm like oh yeah go be with her and you wanna know how I know that because that's exactly what I ended up telling Chris I have all the messages saying go be with Taylor or actually go be with anybody I kept saying please Chris go get some help give me help that's what I think for about probably over the last six months of my relationship with Chris all I tried doing was stopping them from using their daughter as a tool now because all you used was about to manipulate a used child child to try to play games with each other so together despite me never purposely trying to hurt you purposely allowing Chris to cheat on you after the one time that I had hung up to you in the beginning you did about 30 times and the only reason I did it was because I didn't know she went from being main chick to being okay being side chick I told you guys the amount of times that I would give him another chance only to find out that she was okay helping him cheat either because he would go to or she's a teacher by the way she would go to school on her lunch break and they would do stuff then um at practices is what they would do stuff or yeah they would um just drop off their kids and then go have sex in the car but hey I was a bad person right but you guys spread all different about and I never actually ended up doing a civil charge on you even though I knew in that very last conversation you got back with Chris even though you were giving me such a hard time again about how Chris is such a bad person but he is only bad and only a hard time is given when he's just not with you so that's how you're gonna come out as a victim and try to save your reputation once I finally say everything even after you're done you left your child in the car alone your little kid who must have been like five or six at the time so you could come inside to yell at us yell at me and to fight me what type of parent does that oh you oh and you can't do that because then you accidentally ran into me and didn't know you're gonna run into me and I caught you leaving your child in the car again and I recorded that one you wanna know how I figured out or figured you were back with Chris in that very last conversation because you started insulting me after I was apologizing to you and I still still had not filed a civil suit on you and was still being sympathetic and telling you I'm sorry I know the majority of all this was probably Christian manipulation because for the year that I did not speak on this was because I assumed you had a traumabot just like me and if it happened to me it happened to you so I wouldn't say a word I'm not that person I really really am not I tried stopping one of them I did anything I tried chopping faith from posting so many things about you online um I called Chris literally on your guys anniversary calling Chris faith respond to faith before she goes off online to post about you guys or about you okay I'm sorry I had to move and I changed my phone number and they still found where I lived and found my phone number and I still don't even know where the hell you live and then because I knew that you were still going to kind of try to deny it because you're having issues that you're with your kid's dad um how do you guys support okay for a restraining word because I figured I needed I figured I knew I needed one Chris because this is a part of right holding you alone for a little bit when you're entertaining him and then once he sees I'm moving on or something happens with you guys once you'll get back with me and then force me to get back with him and I won't get back with him because he would choke me so hard until I would say yes and and then um I found out that during that time anyways we're you find out and you'll be okay with helping him cheat on me during that time so I would be beautiful for absolutely no reason it was great and in the restraining order you guys literally all three submitted your evidence together even though despite like um how much you guys tried to also deny it so what are you going to do um aren't you not supposed to be with personally younger daughter I thought isn't that what you guys deal isn't he fight your baby's dad too so tell me are you going to stand 10 toes tall like you are now because he's providing you the forerunner because you wrecked your vehicle again um child support so what are you gonna do when that talks no longer there and now that everything is spread and told you guys spread lie about me I just told the truth about you let's see if you're still standing by his side because you were not by his side when he hugged you it wasn't until he got back with you or I left him I should say it was until I believe him and then he would be okay being fully back with you and then you would start defending him again right and then finally I realized that me being silent was exactly how you guys were getting away with all of this all three of you because you all knew that I was the one that wouldn't ever share or say anything I was the one that always stopped you two from caring things about each other I was the one that always said hey try to be mature try to be calm so you guys can handle that you guys knew that I probably would say anything and I didn't for a full year and a half and then I decided you know what you guys do not give a fuck about me at all not one of you and now my one and only priority is protecting those kids",

    "voice_to_text": "Si chicas la mala noticia es que sus vendedoras son mal\u00edsimas story time de cuando trabaj\u00e9 en Aruma mientras me maquillo yo lo tengo ac\u00e1 apuntadito todo todo empez\u00f3 con una postulaci\u00f3n m\u00eda por compu trabajo el cual recibi\u00f3 un mensaje para una entrevista al d\u00eda siguiente de la se\u00f1orita de recursos humanos en esa entrevista eh dur\u00f3 algo como de media hora el cual la se\u00f1orita eh nos recalc\u00f3 que hab\u00eda que pasar 4 filtros el cual el primero era una entrevista con recursos el segundo era con una administradora de cualquier aroma que se le asigne el tercero era eh pruebas de descarte de COVID si no me equivoco y el cuarto que creo que no era un filtro sino eran ya las capacitaciones tanto presencial como virtualmente para los que dicen que Aruma no capacita a sus trabajadores aroma recontra capacita a los trabajadores y nos hacen talleres incluso de capacitaci\u00f3n en los cuales tenemos que memorizar como 3 500 productos con cada y una de sus caracter\u00edsticas algo as\u00ed m\u00e1s o menos estoy tapando la tienda en la cual trabaj\u00e9 pero ac\u00e1 est\u00e1 la tarjetita de bienvenida aruma y mi nombre dentro de ese taller tambi\u00e9n nos ense\u00f1an a c\u00f3mo conocer nuestra personalidad qu\u00e9 hace falta para tener mejor atenci\u00f3n al cliente entre otras cosas y bueno creo que el globito se puede explicar por s\u00ed solo quiero recalcar que algunas como yo por ejemplo que hicimos primero nuestra prueba de piso s\u00ed nuestra prueba de piso porque yo antes de tomar esas capacitaciones estuve en dos tiendas que eh nos ten\u00edamos que adaptar a esa tienda pero esa no era mi tienda a la cual yo iba eh nos ten\u00edamos que acoplar porque era un vamos a decirlo as\u00ed un test de cu\u00e1nto sabes de maquillaje porque ten\u00edas que estar siendo supervisada 24 7 por el manager o dig\u00e1moslo el administrador que estaba en esa tienda y bueno ah\u00ed estoy yo en una de las haciendas en uno de mis primeros d\u00edas si no me equivoco era mi 5\u00ba d\u00eda en aroma y hay much\u00edsimas fotos m\u00e1s que tengo de las capacitaciones porque quiero dejar muy en claro que si nos capacitan no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 le hace pensar a la gente que no nos capacitan porque es m\u00e1s en la entrevista tambi\u00e9n te piden como que un m\u00ednimo de que sepas eh maquillaje o alg\u00fan tipo relacionado como skin care o como hair care  Osea cuidado de cabello obviamente en el video no puedo poner eh las capacitaciones virtuales por obvias razones pero s\u00ed puedo poner las f\u00edsicas porque fueron con mi celular bueno despu\u00e9s de las capas te piden llenar una tienda porque s\u00ed todas creo yo las que ingresan a Luma que son o sea me refiero a las que son nuevas tienen que llenar o llenar desde 0 1 tienda me parece que s\u00ed me parece que s\u00ed eso hacen todas eh para que sepan c\u00f3mo es llenar la tienda desde cero te dan una tienda vac\u00eda y ah\u00ed empiezas a llenar paso traspaso g\u00f3ndola por g\u00f3ndola cesta por cesta estaba yo llena de cajas y creo que um la tienda que yo arm\u00e9 se inaugur\u00f3 completamente despu\u00e9s de que mi equipo y yo estuvimos como 5 o 6 d\u00edas seguidos armando y armando y armando eh cada producto y bueno esta soy yo en mi primer d\u00eda de llenado de tienda como se puede apreciar no hay ning\u00fan perfume ni siquiera a la parte de atr\u00e1s despu\u00e9s de eso mi feedback tanto de el manager de la primera tienda como el de segundo eh fueron buenos y ah\u00ed es donde reci\u00e9n me mandaron a mi tienda a la cual yo iba a eh ya estar as\u00ed superestable o al menos eso yo pens\u00e9 quiero recalcar que las capacitaciones virtuales es semana tras semana o cada 15 d\u00edas nos llegan por ejemplo tres sesiones de cada marca y en esas tres sesiones tiene que haber m\u00ednimo 10 productos nuevos o 5 productos nuevos que en realidad al fin y al cabo est\u00e1 muy explicado muy bien explicado en la p\u00e1gina entonces al terminar esas capas te toman un test de 10 preguntas al azar y si no respondes bien esas preguntas tienes que volver a hacer la capacitaci\u00f3n completa desde cero no voy a mentir capaz creo yo que hay personas que ignoran este tipo de capacitaciones hay personas que se pasan las respuestas entre otras cosas que he visto y es por eso que al entablar una conversaci\u00f3n con un cliente se quedan en blanco y se quedan como que para qu\u00e9 es este producto o sea no saben para qu\u00e9 es el producto no sabe para qu\u00e9 sirve no sabe si es para cabello o para cara porque s\u00ed ha pasado ha pasado de que consultoras compa\u00f1eras m\u00edas eh que ya han tenido como un mes un mes trabajando en aroma no saben diferenciar la mascarilla para cabello con la mascarilla para la cara por el empaque por algo tan simple o simplemente por leer las instrucciones mal con respecto a la actitud que tienen ciertas consultoras creo yo y creo que muchas vamos a coincidir en esto de que cada vez que el cliente pone vamos a decirlo as\u00ed en el libro de reclamaciones o pone una queja virtualmente siempre dice eh la consultora se puso malcriada cuando en realidad la que primero falt\u00f3 el respeto fue un cliente o fue una clienta creo que en 99.9% de los casos es as\u00ed doy doy por seguro eso ahora con respecto a que si nosotras tenemos la obligaci\u00f3n de seguir a todos los clientes que entren a aroma no me alcanza el tiempo as\u00ed que parte dos",

    "voice_to_text": "hello I'm an academic of the Japanese language and culture and I'd just like to explain a few things first of all we're talking about  sanpaku not seppuku seppuku is the ritual  self-unbellying with a sword  in order to escape the enemy so that they don't defile your body while you're still alive those two are very very different things sanpaku refers to having white spaces around your eyes now for people who have a basic understanding of anatomy they might be wondering what  I'm talking about okay one eye white two eye whites basically so you're supposed to have two white spaces around your pupil right around your Iris and in Japanese culture sanpaku is when you have a third space whether above or below because that is supposed to be an indication that your time is near your time is near not your time is in the next 5 seconds okay I wanna be very clear about that and if you think about it logically in terms of historical development in terms of anatomy we can understand given the structure of Japanese eyes with the epicanthic fold here right that they don't have a lot of space around the eye that's white right there is usually not a lot of space that's because of the eyelid but as things happen as you grow old your body will start to wind down if you will now the way which humans wind down is pretty consistent so much so that we have medical techniques that can prolong life because we've already established the steps that tend to happen when a body is reaching its end point right so absolutely not in a spiritual sense in a very real physical anatomical sense the human body winds down in a very specific way okay and one of the ways which here I'm just going by my basic understanding of anatomy and and human existence um one of the ways is that your muscles start you know not really listening to you anymore the things that come with old age normally are tremors and also things like your skin just kind of sagging because the muscles underneath it are withering if you will now for those of us who don't have an epicanthic fold that will be most visible under your eyes right so if you have white space under your eyes you might wanna go and talk to somebody about it not in the oh my God I need to have a priest now but more in the sense of check that your blood level is fine check that you're getting enough vitamins check that I don't know whatever you need to check for your physical well being but I can say for a fact based on my lived experience and my observations of a lot of people who had space underneath their eyes and later expired yes there is a correlation  and it is not so immediate that you need to panic like the person is just going to poof the next moment because it's not like that and  if you think of JFK yes assassination happened but also the assassination wasn't a spur of the moment thing right so it was planned before he even  knew about it and as him being a new president he was already under a lot of stress and guess what stress can also have a very damaging effect on the body to the extent that it shows around your eyes and that's important to understand because otherwise you'll think that like somebody put a little X on his forehead and that's what made his eyes be weak you know weaker around here and that's what led to the thing and those two things are not connected right humans are able to establish patterns  cause they observe stuff right so for Japanese people it makes sense to notice when  people's eyes were a lot more exposed than usual normally for those of us who come from the side of the planet that isn't Asia in our case it tends to be called \"sunken\" and that's when you have like people  with my kind of eye shape and they end up like the the eye just looks like it's almost popping out because of how the the muscles are tightening around it because of the lack of support of the muscles underneath right technically the same thing but we have two different terms because how a white person will describe their physical well being is going to be slightly different because we have slightly different features and that's important to understand that Japanese people and the Japanese culture acknowledge that in the context of Japanese people and their physiognomy and their reality and their history and their culture it's still not a sign that immediately something bad is about to happen and I need to stress that because it is a really difficult thing when somebody is already facing  the end of their life they know this is the thing that people don't really understand but people know when it's their time I know from a personal experience that I've known every single time that it wasn't my time so I didn't panic when it's your time you know and also when it's your time you can't change it so worrying about the signs  that people will showTM is putting extra stress on you because yes I could tell looking back on certain photographs that the end was near when it came to one of my loved people who passed on yes and also I didn't have access to that photograph until about god I don't know like a year after everything had happened and when I saw that photograph and I saw the date and I thought it made sense it made sense because I could see that he was already gone he was already like checked out he was alive but he wasn't living that that discrepancy that all people have described at different points in time that is a big sign that it's near but near doesn't have to mean like  two steps away could be a month it could be six months it could be another year in fact in that case I think it was at least three months so decouple the sanpaku from the immediacy of death from the um immediate connection to death because it's not like that it's more one more sign that if  you know how to read the human body will tell you that the  person's time is approaching that's it and it's not a bad thing and  it's not a good thing it's just one more bit of information that could be relevant but also the other reason why I want to separate it from this sense of urgent and immediate doom is because you can have sanpaku because you're extremely unhealthy and unwell and you are suffering and if you are extremely unwell and suffering of course of course your body is going to show that we don't need people who are already suffering to also be like oh my god I'm about to poof cause that's that's unnecessary stress for them so I hope this explains the situation a little bit and remember seppuku is a totally different thing sanpaku is what we're talking about  have a good night",

    "voice_to_text": "very much that whole discussion  what I wanted to add to it um to the last part of the video  I stitched is that you can know better but still  choose in a way that's not ideal and that's because knowing better and feeling safe enough to do  better are two different things allow me to give you a personal example I know what a what an abusive  relationship looks like that's why my relationships never got anywhere near that same level but they did get abusive slightly that's not because I don't love myself it's rather because I'm used to  having to survive so when people push me  into my survival mode it's just like oh yeah I remember  this I know how to do this but after that relationship I had one more relationship and it was a short one and I learnt a couple of things from it but the shame I felt from knowing better but going for the relationship anyway and then it ending quite as badly  as I thought it would at one point but slightly worse in many ways  actually left me that left me feeling extremely  destabilised because I knew better I knew better why did I still ugh! and again  because while I do know better acting on what I know to stay safe is conversely not safe for my body as far as my brain is concerned so people who don't push me to my survival mode they feel unsafe to me and that is something that you have to keep working on right but I learnt something from that experience that I want to share and that is your shame is there to protect you right all parts of you are there to protect you so you know your anger your sadness your frustration all of that what I learnt is that when people love bomb you it's the first time you feel seen right that's the whole point of love bomb love bombing that's how it works because you feel unseen most of your life and then somebody sees the real you and there you go ah and then you're you're you know completely head over heels and then it all goes to custard and yeah that comes with a lot of shame because how could I fall for this but here's another way to look at it the reason why you fell for that is because the person who was manipulating you was quite literally shining a mirror at you showing off your best assets and so really there is nothing to feel ashamed about because if the only way a person can manipulate you into getting with you is to reflect the best of you back to you because they got nothing for you baby that is great it means you are fallen in love with you your best points your best sides which you're allowed to have as well as less good sides because you're human okay this is one of the reasons why I'm so aggressive about coming on here at all times of the day and  in my whole pj'ed glory right because yes I can absolutely show off my best side all the time perfectly coiffed hair if I tried and makeup and adorable outfits and what not and that's still lying from my perspective I'm not interested in that if people fall in love they fall in love  with the real you and that means they fall in love with the person who is crying the person who is curled in a ball and refuses to get out of bed because it's just cold outside the person who doesn't eat bamboo shoots right all of the things that you think make you unlovable and unworthy all of those things a person who loves you will note them and be like uh huh yeah that's okay that is what you want but the thing is we've been conditioned  to think that that is settling it's not settling when somebody sees your humanity and chooses to honour it by not attacking you for having it so shame has no place for you there is no reason for you to feel shame for falling in love with somebody who showed you the best of you for however long they could the other really important bit of data  that I learnt from this experience was that I repel manipulators in a very real sense as in we can only be in each other's company comfortably for a handful of hours before things are going to start crackling and if we're in each other's presence for longer than two days it's not going to be well it it arguments are going to erupt and that's because my brain will quite  literally shut down when people are trying to manipulate me so now I know if I am talking to somebody and suddenly I feel like all my words are going and I cannot access error 404 language not found that is a very clear indication of my body that I'm being verbally manipulated and that is my sign to say okay thank you no I reject your assessment of my character I reject everything what you just said because it doesn't make sense because when you get a polygolot to not be able to words you have crossed all the way from slightly manipulating the English vocabulary and into well now you're just #%-*/g with me and  I ain'tdoing that so I'm not sad and I think it's really important that you don't shame people for not immediately finding the greatest relationship right after leaving a bad one because we all are at different healing perspective levels and so we all have different things to do in life and maybe just maybe the next romantic relationship isn't the point for everybody I'm just gonna put that out there because I think the west especially but not just but the west especially in the way that Hollywood does stuff loves to emphasise romantic relationships mind you where I come from they emphasise marriage but not the romance and that's another topic altogether to talk about but the point is this wherever you are in your healing journey that's where you're supposed to be and I'm talking to myself as well in this one because I was just lying on the floor for about an hour going oh my god why am I not doing anything because I'm exhausted because I'm exhausted and the world is heavy and I have the right to sit down and stare into space for an hour I don't have to do anything other than just exist and neither do you and people will try to tell you that there's work to be done there's this to be done look yes if you have the energy if you don't you don't call it a day roll up to bed try it again in the morning because I guarantee you that there is going to be a sunrise and shame can't thrive in the sunlight I hope this helps",

    "voice_to_text": "I've recorded this so many times I'll just keep \ud83e\udd86ing it up so bare with me, this is my first story time uh so when I was at secondary school I used to have this friend let's call her Izzy and she used to live in this old ahh house that was at least pre World War 1 and had three floors and it was very close to the town centre of the town that we live in so when we would finish school we go you know hang around in the town we would always end up back at Izzy's house because she had this lovely big house this lovely garden and her parents were always out so it was just a great place to just chill and just get up to mischief and because the paranormal is just interesting we'd always had these conversations about ghosts and just spirits and things like that things can't explain and I knew that she'd had experiences in her house and and um things like she'd heard people like walking upstairs when there's no one there lights turning on and off and um one time her parents glass shower exploded in the middle of the night just weird shi like that I've been to her house so many times and I'd never experienced anything so I wasn't really like in the forefront of my mind when I went there this is one day in year 8 so I was like 13 where we went to her school gonna decorate some cupcakes so we had all these like plain cupcakes and we were gonna um just ice them decorate them so that's what we did we did that for quite a while and once we'd finished terrorizing these poor cupcakes by drawing \ud83c\udf46s on them with icing uh we clean the whole kitchen very meticulously um cause her mum was very house proud it was very clean house we made sure it was back up to you know scratch before we left it um and so we leave the kitchen I'm going to the living room and it's me and Izzy on one one sofa and my other two friends were there let's call them Sophie and John so Sophie and John was sat on the other sofa on the other side of the room and and me and Izzy were just talking just having a regular ahh conversation and we we hear and feel what what was like it seemed like someone had either punched or hit side of the sofa we were sitting on really really hard um and so we both look at each other like what the heck is that um and then we jump up cause we're like we both I think us both looking at each other at each other we both confirm that like what the hell so we we we stand up oh my God oh my God what the hell what the what's going on um and so we decide because we're 13 year olds so we're gonna be ghost adventure- ghost investigators you know what I mean so we're like okay let's go let's go and look around the house and try and find evidence you know and I think we we just did that cause we were actually all just really shi scared but we just want to pretend that we weren't and this was a good way of doing that um so yeah we decide we're gonna look around the house and to leave the living room and go upstairs you have to walk past the kitchen door and then pass the pile of shoes at the bottom of the stairs cause whenever anyone would go to her house they would just literally kick your shoes off and just always be this big pile at the bottom of the stairs and so we leave the living room we walk past the kitchen and a knife like a big bread knife has been taken out of the knife block on the other side of the kitchen and it's now been placed on the kitchen table facing the door so we're like okay we were literally in there like 10 minutes ago and we tidied up and no one else is is in this house so what the heck so again this just fuels us into our like paranormal investigation cosplay whatever the \ud83e\udd86 and so we then go upstairs and the bathroom lights on and we knew it hadn't been on earlier but I feel like haunting wise that's minor you know what I mean um but then we go into I think it was an office at the time but then they changed out whose bedroom it was a few times this time it was an office so we're going there and somebody has the the genius idea of let's take photos of each other and see if there's a ghost in it I don't like hell no if you're not taking a photo of me in this situation because if there is a ghost behind I don't wanna know I don't wanna know I don't wanna see it you know but also I'll take photos of you guys though you know you guys can get cursed so we ended up taking photos of the other three and Izzy's was normal uh John's was normal and we took these on like an old iPod touch as well so this was a long time ago um and in the photo of Sophie there is this much like it cuts off here but is that much of like it look it was like a green flowery blouse and then someone's arm out the bottom of it um and it was behind Sophie and Sophie was mixed race well I assume she still would be mixed race um so and this this was obviously like a white person's arm so obviously wasn't her we're wearing our school uniform so none of us are wearing like green flowery brow blouses you know what I mean and it was just it was like cut off here it was very very weird I saw the photo I was like right mom come and get me I'm done and so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna get my shoes I'm gonna get my stuff together and I'm gonna my mom's gonna come pick me up alright so we walk down the stairs and remember how I said that everyone just sort of kicked their shoes in a pile at one side of the hallway they weren't they weren't there they weren't there something had taken the pile of shoes from one side of the hallway paired the shoes up and then placed them in a neat line on the other wall of the hallway under the radiator like and this was beyond the last straw for me this was like I'm leaving right now bye good luck with your life and your house and your demons oh and while this wasn't the like most terrifying paranormal experience definitely not the most terrifying paranormal experience I've had um it's always stood out in my mind because I think it's the one with the least of their ex I don't cause I can't think of any other reason why that would have happened you know what I mean it's it's the one story that I think yeah 100% this was obviously paranormal and not it couldn't have a logical rational explanation you know what I mean yeah spooky uh I think her parents still live there I hope they're getting on well with the demons uh but I do actually have a lot of paranormal stories so if anyone wants to hear any other ones let me know",

So I'm a quadruplet and we were born at 27 weeks weighing about 2 pounds. Went down to 1 pound. Not good. Imagine having four babies. So my mum had a C section and it was literally yank, yank, yank, one after the other. And then after a couple of weeks, which isn't technically the birth, had two brain hemorrhages, nearly died. Can't smell, can't really hear in one ear. On balance, not so bad. So in the grand scheme of birth stories. Don't have quadruplets. 4 is too many. What was she doing? Finding a letter? I mean, it was an accident. Cause we were like the first IVF babies born in Rotonda. Or the varieties who were the first IVF quadruplets. And one of the first IVF babies born in Ireland. So you go, fun story. Not technically a birth story, but not. Not a birth story. So.",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story. That sounds completely unbelievable, but it's entirely. If you scare easily, go ahead and exit. Right. Let's answer your questions. Yes, my family still lives in the house. I just feel like my grandma's protecting the space so that beer was transformed into comfort. This might be a little scary, but after my grandma's passing, that bedroom, her bedroom actually became my room. My grandma is not a voodoo priestess. She did not practice voodoo. No, my family is not from the Caribbean. And to piggyback off that, who was papa Legba? Who was Batman, and who was Balasante? Far as I know, nobody in my family has ever done witchcraft. No, she was not scared, and no, she didn't express any fear. Yes, it was nice for the spirit or angel, whatever you wanna call it, to let us have a few more days with my grandma. Of course. We sat and talked and prayed over her body, prayed for her spirit, and just spent that sacred time with her before they came and took her. And I'm so thankful that my family has that moment and those memories, because it really changes your relationship to death. And thank you guys for your well wishes and your condolences. And my condolences to all of you who shared your stories in the comments. I'm happy that I can honor my grandma's legacy like this. And as she would always say, angel in your pillows and God bless you",

So when I was 14, my mom met a guy on the internet and wanted to go out on a date with him, but he lived in a different state than us. So she took me, and we got in the car, and we drove to New Mexico, and we drove to the middle of nowhere. Like, I'm talking. We were on a highway, and then we went off onto, like, a. A rural road. And then we went to a dirt road to, like, a more dirt dirt road. And then we, um, past acres and acres and acres of just, like, farm landing cows. And then we got to this house, literally hundreds of miles away from anyone else. And we got out of the car, and a bunch of, like, teenage, young adult men came up to the car, and they were all like the, uh, what do they call them? Like, the farm hands? And my mom was like, okay, well, you go hang out with these guys. One of them is my date's son. If you've heard other stories, you know that this happens a lot, her setting me up with her date sets. Anyways, so she dropped me off with these guys, and then she went on this date with their dad, and we went in, like, branded cows, and we dehorned cows and went back to The farmhouse and ate ice cream and everything was fine. And it wasn't until I was in my late 20s and I was telling my therapist the story, and he's going, this sounds like the beginning of a true crime story. Anything could have happened to you. And I'm like, yeah, yeah. And no one would have found out. But weirdly, it's kind of a fun memory. But yeah, that one was weird. And now as an adult, haha, I could never.",

Shoutout to my friend Chris who flew to Emerald just to drive/fly back to brisbane with me to help keep me on track.

The clinic had the only way to cut it off, granted, is better than some other places that I've worked at, where they just had basically a hacksul hack it off. No, um, it was garden shears and some places, whenever it's. Whenever it's a working dog and what not, um, you use a bolt cutter. But I wasn't allowed to do that. Um, it had to.

    "voice_to_text": "was a weirdo how y'all doing I still ain't alright so boom we just gonna get straight into it last summer I went through a breakup that really had a hold on my mental like every day was a struggle I could barely get out of bed and go to work so I would call my friend of 12 years and confiding her in my vent to get all my emotions out and she would encourage me and tell me like girl move on let him go stop trying to talk to him you gonna feel better and when you feel better that's when he gonna try to come back so after a while I just had to go no contact with him so I told her that I made the decision and she was telling me how she was proud of me and I'm making the right decisions and um how I should move forward and heal and somewhere along the way I noticed the switch like this girl went from honestly doing bare minimum of encouraging me to well he said so she started saying stuff like oh he's a good person and he would never do nobody like this on purpose he just going through a pivotal time in his life like he just going through a lot and I'm like huh okay so that's when I started asking her like did y'all talk today and nine times out of 10 she would tell me no and if they did it was nothing worth mentioning okay some days are harder than other side I would call her and just like vent and like seek advice but she would not be listening to me the way I would listen to her when she's talking to me about problems she would be scrolling on social media interrupt me mid conversation to mention something that she see on her phone or she would blatantly just not look at the camera or acknowledge me and just continue to do what she doing as if I'm not talking to her now god had already given me a warning that this girl is not being truthful like I just had a pull in my heart let me know hey this girl is not telling you the truth and I even had other people tell me stop talking to this girl she not telling you the truth but I want to feel better so bad I just kept talking to her which I should not have done so I think by this time we already like two months no contact I decided to unblock him because he was not gonna affect me like he was before I had everything blocked except  his phone number because we were not talking so I ain't feel like I need to block his phone number and every time I try to reach out to him he would ignore me or respond to the messages he wants to respond to so as I start feeling better I start to pull back from her she would text me a few times to check in but it wasn't genuine so after he see that he not block on TikTok no more he decides to pop around there like view my profile and stuff I tell her about it and and I asked her like hey what is wrong with your friend why he keep doing this and she'll be like oh I don't know he just being weird so by this time I think we already hit three months of no content and because I'm so annoyed I broke that and asked him why do you keep popping up around TikTok and the other day him and I had a conversation and it wasn't great but it wasn't that bad now there was this one question that I really need to answer to and honestly god had told me what the answer was I just wanted him to confirm it as well but he didn't he lied and not only did he lie but he gave my friend of 12 years the story that he had been telling me so their stories will match and they think I believe baby I am not stupid and if I remember correctly a few days after that she text him and asked him if him and I were doing good and he doesn't respond and then after that she takes it upon herself to take him off social media she then calls me and she comes clean about everything she told me that the answer to my question was yes and he asked me to lie for him and I did and I should have just told you the truth hang up on you definitely not in the mood so like I'm sitting my chair just dumbfound like we're all in our early 20s I consider myself too grown to be lying why are y'all lying to me it gets worse so before this even happened I decided to go through his phone because I just felt like she was hiding some from me and he was too y'all this girl my friend of 12 years was giving him updates on me the whole entire time she told him how I blocked him she told him I had been asking if they had talked and then she tells him how she is so annoyed with me mind you I've been here for this girl the whole 12 years whether it was family issues relationship issues friendship issues anything you name it I was there and never did I do that not only that not only that but when I went through the text messages this girl knew there was somebody else in the picture and get this she called that lady by name she said did you go see insert that lady name today y'all when I tell you the anger in my body I have never felt something like that before and after all this stuff came out I say yeah you're done and I know some of y'all gonna be like oh you forgiving your man before your friend no and let me tell you what actually happened like I said I've been friends with this girl for the past 12 years we've been having issues for the past six I come to her time at the time at the time hey you don't invite me nowhere you only call me when your man doing something and you only call me when you need something and she would always promise me how always gonna get better like I'm sorry I wanna be a better friend it never happened so I cut off and I probably should not admit this but I am that type of person that will give somebody years and years worth of chances because I allow for mistakes and this is everybody's first time living she just so happened to reach that limit where my heart said you know what I've had enough it's time to cut it off and the only reason I forgave him because this story goes deeper than what I'm telling there was witchcraft involved and a whole lot of jealousy but yeah that's my story about finding out that my friend of 12 years was a weirdo which was not the first time I got so many more stories which I might tell too but uh yeah",

    "voice_to_text": "give me the tea what's the drama what's happening in your life I wanna so we're just gonna call this girl Taylor and one of my best friends Marissa so literally like out of nowhere Taylor decides to befriend me and Marissa and I'm saying like this is out of the blue because we've only had maybe 1 two interactions with her and then she just stopped talking to us for like the rest of the year so I was a little skeptical when she decided to befriend me and Marissa out of blue so later on throughout the year we become closer although I did have a few previous issues with her such as her making micro versions towards me and Marissa but I mainly just let those slide and I shouldn't have don't do that because Marissa was starting to get really close with her and I wanted to stay close with Marissa anyways Marissa decides to invite me Taylor and me Marissa have this other friend we're gonna call her Ali to go out bowling and the whole time we're out Taylor she's making so many ignorant comments and it's starting to get on me and Ali's nerves and the whole time we're just saying her like girl are you hearing the shit she's saying and I'm like yes girl I'm fed up and mind you now Taylor doesn't really know Ali she's only met Ali like once and they like barely talk with each other so once we're about to go home Taylor asked Ali for her number so they can like stay in touch you know and get to know each other now this is something that will come back up later in the store anyway it's time to drop people off and right after Ali gets dropped off um is when this situation goes out so Marissa's little brother is in the car and he's pretending that his Airpod case is a gun and so Taylor turns around and looks at him and she's like stop acting black why are you acting black why do you wanna be black then I'm just looking at her like bitch are you serious so I'm like can you stop and she just laughs it off and then continues to make these ignorant comments to this girl's little brother who's about like 12 oh wait sorry let me give a little bit of important information Taylor's white I'm black and Latina and Marissa and her little brother are Hispanic  and my friend Ali is also white back to the story so I call her out again and I tell her to stop and she's like oh you're being so dramatic come on it's not that serious and like it may seem like I was being dramatic over the situation but I was fed up because she's been making so many comments like this like our whole friendship in fact even worse she said the B slur she said the N word and she's talking about wearing a Confederate flag even after we were friends I have a whole lot of dirt on this bitch anyway she calls me sensitive then this bitch tries to gaslight me and said that it was my fault and that I triggered her to say those words now at this point I'm pissed but I'm already at my house so I leave I sent her a text saying hey I don't wanna stand on bad terms but I'm gonna distance myself for a while might be for a few days or so just to give her a heads up the next day I do just that and I don't know why she's so surprised when I come home from school she sends me a text and she's like Maya what you're doing is very immature you're not only neglecting me but you're neglecting Marissa too and I'm just like don't do that don't bring Marissa into this because she has nothing to do with our situation and the thing is I was still interacting with Marissa just not when Taylor was all up on her anyway my stupid ass decides to entertain her and I just text back and be like well I'm sorry you feel that way but I know my friend and I need to do this for myself and you're not even respecting me and my decision so just leave it alone then she just now this is when she really pushed me because one thing that you don't do is you don't bring someone else into a situation that they weren't involved so anyway she brings up Marissa and gets like wow you're so selfish I can't believe you don't care about Marissa's feelings now I am really upset with myself for learning her get to me but I just sent her this long paragraph about how she doesn't know what she's talking about and how I know Marissa I've been talking to her and that she's only doing this to get to me but I'm not gonna let her very very stupid up anyway guess what this bitch she text my other best friend Ali the girl that went bowling with us and just talk a bunch of shit about me to her and just rants to her as if Ali's not gonna tell me so the whole time Taylor is just talking much shit about me um Ali is screenshotting everything sending it to me and screenshotting with me it's honestly really sad that she had no one else to talk to but my friend then a few people are questioning both me and Taylor as to why we're not friends anymore and like what happened with and like what happened with us you wanna know what's like actually hilarious is that this bitch decide to flip it around and said that I was being racist and that was calling her a crack and what's even more amusing is that she decides to go to the guidance counselor but the guidance counselor already knew she was bullshitting because number one so many people have already gone to the guidance counselor about the shit that she's done to them and number two she had already talked to me first anyway it's a long story as to how the guidance counselor found out before but the point is she actually got the full truth from me and yeah ever since that day Taylor\u2019s just been continuing to be the bitch she is she gives me side eyes across the room she's purposely trying to interrupt me and Marissa's conversations she slammed the door on me a couple times but it's fine because she's just a bitter miserable person and she's mad that she no longer has any more friends",

    "voice_to_text": "Is people without a degree today. Because of this is so true. And I actually wanna share my story of this guy that I was dating fresh out of high school, who tried to get me to drop college. So let me set the scene. Um, I was freshly out of high school. I was in my first semester of college. At this time, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I just knew I wanted to obtain some sort of degree. And being a first generation South Sudanese, it was very important for me to finish school. So this guy I was dating was a bit older than me. Um, he had graduated probably years ago. I had no business dating him, but, hey, that was my past. So anytime I would go to school, or I would be, like, putting any sort of effort into studying, he would honestly be, like, upset. Like, why are you doing that? You don't need school. School is a waste of time. He told me I was gonna graduate with all this debt, and it's not worth it. So I remember he would even, like, go to the extent of being like, look, I can get you a job here. You would make this much money. You and I would put our income together, we'd make so much money together, you don't need school. Like, basically just trying everything to get me to drop school. I was really young and Naive, and, like, it was tempting, but honestly, the only thing that really stopped me from not dropping is my parents, because I was so afraid of them, and I don't know, like, what excuse I would even tell them if I did not finish school. I really, really liked him at the time, and I really wanted this relationship to work. So he basically kept putting in my face, like, it was either school or this relationship, and he kept making it seem like I was never going to get a boyfriend or date anybody ever again because I wanted to pursue a degree. I never understood why he hated school so much for somebody who didn't even attempt to go to college. But his excuse at the time is that he was ready to settle down and have children and basically all the things that, like, a lot of us young women want. Um, he said that he was willing and ready to provide for me, but he couldn't do that because I was gonna be focused on school and things like that. So anyways, a couple semesters later, I ended up making the decision that I wanted to go to nursing school, and I was going to, like, full blown focus on school at this time. You know, he was, like, super upset, and he ended up breaking things off with me, and he said that it was never gonna work. He told me I was going To be miserable. And he just didn't wanna be a part of it. I did end up going to nursing school. I end up graduating. And, y'all, all I have to say is, in 2024, Today, I am not the miserable one.",

    "voice_to_text": "the one moment that made y'all feel like hey I'm ready to start again serious about so for a little background I have always been a pretty decently sized girl and probably sounds weird but I'm 5 8 now and I have been 5 8 since I was about 12 years old and I was never like a string bean like I've had thighs I've had a butt I've always just been a very solid girl fast forward to about age 24 25 and my weight had just gotten out of control frankly I was in a really long term relationship where we enjoyed drinking beers together and going out and eating and I had a pretty sedentary life cause I was working in office job I was strictly wearing big t shirts and like a single pair of jeans that still fit me but I think I was in denial and just didn't really realise what I was seeing in the mirror Cue my mother and this is probably one of the best thing she's ever done for me but my mom just sat me down and you know asked me one day like when's the last time you weighed yourself and I honestly didn't have an answer because weighing yourself makes you feel bad and I don't think in that moment I was prepared to do that on my own so the next weekend my mom brought over the scale to my apartment and we weighed me and I was about 225 at 24 years old as a 5 foot 8 woman it's unhealthy just straight up that was unhealthy and the next day she helped me start Weight Watchers which was a mess if you sign up for Weight Watchers prepared to be hungry all the time because that was just the biggest side effect of it was that there wasn't enough food flash forward a couple months I believe it was around the start of covid so I was home all the time I actually had time and energy to put towards my health and that's when I started the carnivore diet I did carnivore for about four months eating strictly protein and fats no fruits no veggies no sugars no carbs and in a matter of a year or so I was down 50 pounds and feeling better and looking better than I had ever before so super low carb diet super high protein and consistently working out four to five times a week it just it completely changed my life it changed my mental health it changed my confidence everything so I appreciate the hell out of my mom for just being honest and real with me and I hope that others do that for you if you need it",

    "voice_to_text": "I was there. I was there. I was. I was in that studio when that happened. I was 22 years old, on the beach outside my house in Ocean Beach, San Diego, with my best friend and roommate at the time, Coley, who worked with me. And she nonchalantly says, last night at work, some guy gave me tickets to Fleetwood Mac. And I said, what? And she said, yeah, but it's tonight, and it's in LA, and I don't. I don't wanna drive. And I said, get the fuck up. Get up right now. Get up right now and get in my car. Now, LA is only about an hour away from San Diego, but that time of day on the 4:05 makes it about a three and a half hour drive. So we do not shower the beach off of us. We pretty much grabbed our shit and jumped in my car. And down the 4:05 we go. And I'm following Coley's directions, and all of a sudden, I'm on a studio lot, not a concert hall or an amphitheater on studio lot. And there are guards stopping us, asking us for things. And Coley leans over me and hands him this big Manila envelope. And he goes through that Manila envelope, finds what he's looking for, and he gives us directions to the studio that we are going into. Mm hmm. And when I get into that studio, I realize these are not concert goers. These are Very rich people in suits and ties. And here Coley and I are, 22 year old beach moms in t shirts over our bikini tops. Right about the time that I'm asking her if there's an opening band, gentleman comes out onto the stage and he's pointing to the lights and the signs overhead and telling us that these are the signs that will tell us when to clap. And they don't want anybody standing unless it's says that it's okay to stand. And I. I am very confused. And then. Then he says, this broadcast is about to be live over 300 countries. And I'm looking at Collie like, maybe we should award makeup. But then Fleetwood Mac started playing and I stopped being vain and I saw that performance, and it's stuck with me forever. And I'm really glad that it is getting a lot of traction here on TikTok lately. I will say that I did not hear for four days after. I could not hear anything for four days after that show, because. Tusk. When the USC marching band was coming down the aisle, that was painful. It was worth it, but it was painful. One more thing about that performance, you could see the spit coming out of Stevie Nicks mouth while she was singing. That reflected in the light while she was singing. Goose bumps. Goose bumps.",

So I'm just gonna tell you a really short story that is always stuck with me. When I was a junior in high school, I woke up in the middle of the night in my bed, alone, to a voice telling me that I was the chosen one. Now, I never told anyone about that because it obviously sounds like sleep paralysis. Until a few years later, I'm catching up with a friend from high school. She tells me the story that one night, she had slept in my bed while I slept in the living room. And she had woken up in the middle of the night to a voice telling her that it had plans for her.",

    "voice_to_text": "normalize posting why you broke up on the internet so I have only ever been in two long term relationships my first boyfriend and my fiance and I will state for the record that you know my first boyfriend wasn't terrible like as far as first boyfriends go I definitely could have choose chosen worse it's late ignore me but the straw that broke the camel's back was pretty bad we started dating I believe my junior year of high school um you know he was my first kiss he took me to prom I was a year and a half older than him so I was only able to go to his junior prom but it was my senior year anyway also unrelated ignore the dents in my forehead I I get much more confident about them when I'm not staring at them in a screen it's from the Halo brace I had screws in my head anyway so it was my freshman year of college and my first semester I really wasn't able to come home much um I was going to college about an 11 hour drive on a good day from home but I was able to come home a lot more in the spring semester um and I was home for spring break and spring break that year was ending on Saint Patrick's Day now something some background um part of the reason why me and my ex boyfriend got together was we both were the gamers of our friend circles we met at youth group which I know but I digress we were the gamers and he really liked you know when we were together coming over to my house um he would play games on my dad's PlayStation I would sit next to him playing on my DS you know parallel play that honestly should have been a red flag for some of my ADHD but I digress um so he would that's frequently what our you know hangout days would consist of either me watching him play a game us playing a co op game or us playing two separate games like next to each other another important background fact is that my mum goes all out for holidays we're talking we have seven Christmas trees at Christmas one for every major room in the house like I have one in my bedroom that's all my ornaments we've got the main family tree there's one in the bathroom that's like a bunch of cat ornaments there's a story to that but so for Saint Patrick's Day my mom went all out with the you know the corned beef the cabbage fancy desserts I think like 14 layer jello all of it all of it and because the very next day my family was driving me back down to my college campus 11 hours away um I asked if my ex boyfriend could come over the last piece of context you need is that my dad's PlayStation is in the basement of our house and the basement is not typically heated there are no like vents for the furnace down there we do have a pellet stove but it only really like warms up the space if it's on for like a bit before you go down so I bring my ex over and he couldn't drive so I had to go pick him up and when we get back to the house my mom asks me if I can help her like with some meal prep and I say fine sure whatever and I hear my ex now ex boyfriend going down to the basement and I told him you know at least wait until after dinner to you know go and try to do video games because I knew him I knew that if he started playing a game it would be rough to get him upstairs to eat so he agrees but he's just like I don't know being a little weird about it a little Moody about it and I just I was a little frustrated but you know whatever it's what we typically did so it's it's whatever we have dinner I think it's great my dad decides he's going to put a fire in our fireplace in the living room and I am very vocal about how I like that because you know the reason he was doing it was because it was my last night home and my parents wanted to spend time with me while I'm helping my mom wash dishes I hear the boyfriend go downstairs without even saying hi to me as he passed me in the kitchen and turning on the PlayStation so I go downstairs and mind you once again the basement is unheated and this is you know Saint Patrick's Day in northern New England not I guess mid New England yeah not giving you guys my exact location regardless it's Saint Patrick's Day in New England it's chilly um so I go downstairs and I tell him I am not spending my last night at home in this unfinished basement when my parents are upstairs you can stay on the game or you can come spend time with me make your choice he doesn't even respond to me and I go upstairs the other thing is the game in particular he was playing on my dad's PlayStation was The Last of us and uh I have a very intense fear of zombies we're talking I tried to play the very first Resident Evil as a form of exposure therapy and by the time I finished fighting the first zombie in that game I was shaking so hard I had to turn it off so about 20 minutes later or so I get a text from the boyfriend's mother and she is she tells me oh me and my husband decided since you had my ex uh we're gonna have a date night we'll be there to pick him up in about 45 minutes to an hour I go downstairs again I tell him hey your mom just texted me she's gonna be here in you know between 45 minutes to an hour I'm not staying down here you know it's the game or me pick and again doesn't even look at me now the week I had come home uh me and my now ex went to GameStop together and uh I picked up a copy of Pokemon X and I was stuck on something in Pokemon X and he had beaten the game already um so I wanted to ask him a question but I was really annoyed at this point so I went downstairs uh I had my DS open and I was about to ask him my question but I decided to be a little petty first and I told him thanks for choosing the game over me babe I'm really feeling the love and he proceeded to look at me like I was the biggest idiot on the planet and say in this exact tone you do realize I'm addicted to this game right now right I didn't even end up asking him my question I just slammed my DS shut and went back upstairs so when his mom finally showed up to get him I called down from the top of my stairs your parents are here get out of my house now he had left his stuff in the living room where my parents were and I walked in there and basically said I don't even wanna look at him right now um I'll be out when he leaves and I went into my room I shut the door I sat against it so he couldn't open the door even if he did look for me and I'm sitting in my room for a bit and I don't hear him coming up and then I hear my dad going downstairs my the house is pretty thin walls and the stairway is on the other side of this wall to my right so I'm able to hear pretty much everything in my house from my room my dad had to pull the controller out of his hands when he went into the living room to get his stuff he didn't even ask where I was my mom told him that she was upset seeing me cry uh my last night home and his response was essentially good luck with that I think in the 20 minutes it took him to ride home in his car uh he realised that he messed up because then the love bombing started but I told him I was like I am not happy with you I am rethinking things this sucked and I need you to give me space technically we weren't officially broken up until um the end of my semester actually broke up on Mother's Day funny enough um but from that point on the relationship was pretty much dead uh he tried to call me a few times after that and I always dreaded it and my friends at college always said you know it's a sign your relationship's dead that you groan when he calls rather than being happy oh and prior to that I could count the number of times he called me while I was at college on one hand so there's that too meanwhile uh after I had officially broken up with my boyfriend my now fiance uh who we were in the same friend group um he texted me almost everyday and even now uh that you know we live in the same state he uh does not go a day without at least texting me something sweet so definitely traded up",

    "voice_to_text": "so I was listening to a bunch of like those scary stories on my run hence why I'm a bit of a mess and I have some like really weird paranormal stories from when I was growing up but probably the most terrifying one was when I realized my imaginary friend wasn't an imaginary friend so up until the age of about six my family lived in a parsonage my father was a preacher at a local church um so we lived in the housing there and it was an older one story farmhouse and the basement was partially finished so my father had his office and then there was the spare bedroom and then the rest was just like open concrete and in that open concrete portion in like the back was like this really dark storage area and what I would do is I would come down the steps and run past it into the spare bedroom which also had a bunch of our toys in it well growing up while we were in the church and in this parsonage I had a friend I called Alice and she always appeared about 5 years old me 6 years old me and she had bright blonde curls and she wore this like blue older looking Lacey dress and I would play with her nearly every day while we were in the parsonage in the church and I tell my parents about these wonderful adventures that I had with Alice well when I was about 6 we moved away from the parsonage because we were focusing on my mom's career and dad didn't wanna travel with the church anymore so we moved to our um more permanent family residence where my parents still are today and there was a very quick shift in me playing with Alice every day to where I really didn't see her much and I would be playing in the new house either alone or with my sister and I would glance out the window and I would see her like in the street or on the edge of the property but she never came in and there would be days when I would like go down the steps and I would like go try to chase her and she just disappear and I would tell my parents about how upset I was that I couldn't play with Alice anymore and you know normal like sad kid things well time went on I kinda forgot about her to be honest I grew up I didn't need imaginary friend anymore now my youngest sister is 7 years younger than me and one day she was about 5 6 years old and I heard her playing in her room talking to someone and I was like oh she's just playing so I peek my head in and I'm like oh baby girl who you playing with and she smiles up at me she's like oh I'm playing with Alice which was like a total shock to me because I'm like oh that that's a little weird so I'm like oh what does Alice look like and she explained every detail of Alice it was kind of terrifying and I ran to my dad who at the time was being the stay at home parent and um it was summer time so he was home and I told him about this and it was just really freaky and he kind of brushed it off he was like well maybe we've talked about Alice in front of her before maybe she just like picked up on it no big deal I'm like you know what yeah you're probably right but this isn't a thing like she heard us talking about it it has to be that and I have note that like our family is kind of like weird when it comes to like the paranormal like I said I have a lot of like weird stories growing up for example when my great grandfather died he visit my grandma my dad and my middle sister in a dream that same night and they all cooperated what the dream was about so you know a little spooky but anyway so I grow up I leave for the military I don't see Alice again I don't really think about it much until one day we're like chilling um in the living room of our apartment and my husband goes um hey this is a really weird question but were you and sit home um around lunchtime and I said well no um I was at work she was at the sitter why and he said well I came home for lunch cause he worked at a gym right here on post and then our apartment was like right off post and he said there was a little girl in the kitchen in a blue dress and I'm like oh there was and again he described perfectly what Alice looked like now we're in our farmhouse right now completely different state from when I first saw Alice when my sister saw Alice and where my husband saw Alice and every once in a while I will just see out of the corner of my eye a blonde little girl in a blue dress and to keep my sanity I tell myself that it is my eldest daughter who has blonde hair and unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to pretend it for much longer because she's getting much too old to fit the description",

    "voice_to_text": "my Cambian took my soul so what story was being told let's talk about it so this poem is called Taken Too Soon and the first line is my Cambian took my soul and what I mean by that is Cambian is symbolism for the matrix the rat race your ego your shadow pain anger resentment like all those negative dark things that  you have to grow and learn from and so that's what Cambian is symbolism for and I feel like this poem is about your youth being taken from you um at a very early time in your life  I feel like  early on in my life I was forced to grow up pretty soon so that's what I mean by my Camion took my soul and there's a part in the poem where I talk about how I thrived in my youth and I was discovering my truth and I just feel like there was a time in my youth where I was exploring my creativity and my spiritual gifts with writing and you know I was just being adventurous and light hearted and having fun as a kid you know just being a kid but I think  that got taken from me very soon because I was forced to grow up growing up was really challenging for my family and I we had a lot of financial issues  moved around a lot had to adapt to a lot of different environments at a very young age and we were also trying really hard my siblings and I were trying really hard to stay strong for our mother who was a single mom raising the four of us and I think with all of that pressure and all of those things going on it took my childhood away and it forced me to grow up and I couldn't spend the time you know being creative and  exploring and being you know youthful I had to survive and you know my family and I have bonded and grown from that but at the time you know there was a lot of anger and resentment and in the poem I refer to the forest of umbra and umbra is Latin for dark and so the forest of umbra is symbolism of that same pain that anger that hatred that resentment for not having my youth  you know that was when I was feeling like you know oh if things went this way then I would have had this you know I would have been further ahead I would have had all these things like and you start kind of going back and forth in your head about what could have been and all these different things and there's a time though where like I saw a different perspective and now I understand that everything happens for a reason and although there is that sense of darkness with the idea of my youth being taken from me too soon but I feel like I've Learned so much and grown so much since then and I've been able to see the beauty of it all and I think that it's important to not allow your past to consume you and it's important to let go of those negative emotions and those negative feelings of holding onto something um that doesn't serve you and I think that that's where I realise that I need to let this go and use it as a you know as armour use it as a way to to move forward in a positive direction and I've realised that I've gained a lot of wisdom in this experience and it taught me to adapt really well so there are a lot of beautiful things that came out of this experience but overall this poem is really just about the darkness of your youth being taken so soon and I think that this could really help people out there that had a similar experience or are having a similar experience this is just to give you some words of wisdom that  this does not define you and your story and it doesn't halt anything it doesn't change your destiny it doesn't change your trajectory or your journey it just helps it you know progress and move forward um everything happens for a reason I do firmly believe that and if that is something that you've experienced in your life then it was for good reason so  this poem overall is you know just a story that I wanted to tell I think that all of my poems have that sort of sense of darkness and like fantasy and mythicality I guess is that a word I don't know but mystical energy is what I mean  I give all of them that because I feel like at a young age I love that kind of stuff like Harry Potter and you know I love fantasy films SCI fi films  that kind of thing and I wanted to incorporate that into my craft into my art now as a way to connect and nurture that inner child you know that young person who felt lost and scared and who couldn't explore their truths and their creativity you know cause it was taken from them too soon and you know I wanna channel that inner child and really incorporate into my art so it really does um explain you know my poetry and my writing and my songs and you know what I wanna do in the music industry but also what I wanna do in the entertainment industry and film I feel like all of my poetry will either come to life in a cinematic way or a musical way or something like that um but yeah it all comes from the heart it all comes from my inner child and just wanted to tell my story so thank you for listening and if you haven't heard the poem be sure to go check it out on the stitch and yeah thank you",

    "voice_to_text": "so when I was about 10 years old I spent a lot of time with my grandma in the summer and she had rented out a house a very old house and she was living with my aunts cause they were teenagers my family's really young and I always got creeped out when I would go over there but this particular night I stayed up really late and I stayed up late a lot because whatever it's the summer and I was drawing and the TV was on now this space was an attic okay converted attic they turned into a room they push back a section of the attic okay and all of a sudden I'm laying there drawing minding my own damn business and boom boom boom boom all against the wall where the attic had been pushed back and then scratching and noises which one would say maybe animals and of course I'm sitting there frozen don't know what to do can't move I'm frozen what do I do what do I do where do I go I get enough courage to run downstairs go downstairs to the right where my grandma's room is supposed to be okay guess what nobody's there hmm so then I panic and I go back upstairs to my aunt's rooms and guess what nobody's there so I guess I have to go back into the haunted room I go back on into the room go under the covers and just please let me fall asleep get up the next morning go downstairs everyone's eating breakfast like everything's normal and I say where was everyone last night  I was really scared and I needed help and they're just looking at me like I'm crazy because they say what do you mean we were here this part of me thinks okay maybe they went out partying and didn't want to admit that they left me home alone but my grandma believed me because she could see in my face that I was terrified and that I was dead serious so she takes a crowbar and a hammer and she uplifts all of the paint from this little door okay she said well your dad's gonna be here in like 10 minutes though as she's like chiseling away at this door and my dad shows up and I gotta go he doesn't wanna wait for this to be revealed and then later I find out that she opened this door and in the corner in the corner all the way in the corner was a giant chest big enough to put a body but the house was so old there would not be enough support to go look at it so to this day nobody knows what's in that chest but honestly this is not the first time that this has happened to me I have a lot more stories like this but I've had so many realistic dreams that I had to get dream books and then decipher what is a message you know like ancestral messages from our DNA because I think that we when we sleep or the most vulnerable and not using a lot of energy for our physical body so it all goes to your brain and you're just going through all of these impulses and then I think we have chaotic dreams from stress that we pull imagery and people and phrases and things like that we bring them to try to formulate understanding of what we need to work on I think we have astral projection memories that we bring back when we're just buzzing around while we're our physical body is in laying form and then I think we have intervention dreams where other things come to us to try to talk to us but yeah I've had all of them I've seen a lot of stuff",

    "voice_to_text": "I've had a few experiences that are kind of questionable nothing that's so wild that are just like that's so unbelievable but I've experienced a few things this particular incident happened in like 2004 2005 when I was working at one of the local malls the Ontario Mills now this place is kind of known to give off weird vibes I think if you were ask  any former employee or even a current one they probably have a story to tell you I've read and heard a bunch of stories from different stores Dave and Busters has a bunch of wild stories that happened there I had a friend who worked at the opposite end of the mall the same time I was but Build a Bear and she has kind of a freaky story it's just this mall just gives off weird vibes customers would always say like there's a certain spot where you just like you feel instantly dizzy you feel nauseous you want faint it just your energy just kind of just changes once you're in there I was working at torrid at the time and this place wasn't too bad but you would get weird feelings from time to time you would often like I said it wasn't too bad there but you would get feelings of being watched all the time um I would see black figures from the corner of my eyes here and there uh I'll be closing closing up the cash registers and I would have my coworker at one end cleaning up and like I would be seeing other things on the other end from the corner of my eye um things would always fall off the shelves things were falling off the rack our back room was really awkward it was really long and narrow it was like this hallway and so all of the merchandise was up against this wall and we worked our way up so it had shelves racks you know garment bags things like that so in order to get through this back room you kind of brushed up all against this merchandise because it was just so narrow unless you're walking in sideways but you it was it was inevitable you would be touching all this stuff so you'd be at one end of the back room and you I'm looking for a product for a customer or whatever and you would hear these bags rustling like someone's walking through the hallway so I would automatically assume it was one of my co workers and would start talking to them be like hey by chance did you happen to see this product or that product haha I wouldn't get a response and I look and no one was there and I'm like hmm I'm just talking to myself let's go back to the feelings of being watched so our store at least didn't really have a ceiling I think for the most part a lot of the stores are the mall itself is like this there's no ceilings you see the AC ducts you see piping you see all that stuff and they would just be the roof of the actual building you'll get these feelings being watched from up above but you would look and there's nothing up there there's nothing to be hiding or anything cause it was all open unless it was so someone who's actually on the roof and there was times you would hear workers up there and you would hear the footsteps and things like that but you know that they're doing work up there I had a couple co workers who refused to use the restroom um with turning the lights on they would always use it in the dark because they would swear that they're being watched so it was a lot of small experiences like that until this one time uh we had four dressing rooms they were all locked all the associates who are scheduled would carry these keys that were on these like rubber spiral keychains that you carry on your wrist or your arm and we would have to unlock the doors for customers for them to try on the clothes it was common practice to knock on it before you know just be like make yourself kmown like hey is anybody in here you know I'm opening up just you know you never know cause even though these doors were closed and locked all the time if someone were to walk out after trying things on someone can slip in and you know with the door being open or whatever but like I said it was common common practice to knock on the door beforehand so I'm going to go unlock this door for a customer and I knock I do this the thing hey you know is anybody  here I go to pull the door open mind you these doors are big they're not like floor to ceiling doors are just like those typical dressing room doors but they're big and they're kind of heavy they're not on like tension springs or rods or anything like that so if you were to leave the doors as  it is they won't move they won't close they won't open they're just they're just doors on hinges and they're just that's all they were so I go to unlock the door for this customer and I pull it open and it rips from my hands and it slammed shut I immediately think there's someone in there I apologize I'm so sorry I didn't realize anyone was in there just probably didn't respond to me you know saying that I was gonna open the door whatever what it was they didn't say I'm sorry I opened the door again I didn't hear anything no one replied or anything the come customer and I kind of looked at each other and we're like okay there's maybe there's no one in there and I look kind of do the little under the under the door look and no one's there and we still kind of waited a little bit and I kind of peeked over the door no one was there so we open the door no one was in there there the dressing rooms were rooms there was no there were walls they couldn't slip under stalls or anything like that it was a wall so there could have been no one in there and so like the customer like so the customer myself just legit just like looked at each other like what because I'm so glad she was there because I would have felt like I was crazy because this door really was ripped from my hand to the point that that little spiral rubber keychain cause I had around my wrist was pulled off my wrist and it was still dangling in the in the keyhole and it was loud you would hear the door it was slammed shut and that it freaked me the fuck out and nothing ever like that happened again the other feelings were always still there but just incidents like that never happened again and oh my goodness it was it was freaky I've had other experiences just not at that mall um if you wanna hear those you let me know but they're not wild or maybe they are and I'm just trying to downplay them to not freak myself out I don't know",

    "voice_to_text": "if you want to sick new world please let me know how it was where do I start hot crowded windy overwhelming scary overpriced so I went to when we were young two years ago and I already knew that the venue choice for music festivals is not good it's way too small now here's the thing if you sold an appropriate amount of tickets then the venue would be great but they completely oversell these events especially this year's Sydney World now I bought the cheapest possible ticket tier 1 of general admission 3:50 I don't know if that was with or without tax buy or and fees but that's kind of what I remember I also had to buy a Vegas hotel and then here's where it gets tricky so there's no parking at the festival so you have to take the monorail which when I went to when we were young in 2022 nobody really knew what this event was how to get there how to do it so the monorail was great but this year since they pumped it down everyone's throat on social media everyone did it and I went there I left my hotel at 7:30 I got to the line at 8:30 the doors didn't even open until right before 11 the gates now here's the thing I already knew that this event was disorganized because when we get there security guards are having meetings the people in the yellow vests the workers that are giving out alcohol risk bands that are letting people through the line they don't even know they're asking their manager what to do their managers telling them which wrist to put these alcohol bands on like they came completely unprepared that's the first thing second thing is there wasn't even enough security for how many people were let into this festival so that being said once you're inside they crammed so many bands in the lineup I mean bands were performing for like 20 30 minutes only a few bands got over hour sets but regardless for such a small venue it took forever to walk between bands and between sets between stages because it was way overcrowded way overcrowded I mean I just couldn't believe it and I'm like okay so I'm paying this much money and all I'm doing is being shoved in a crowd and like what if there's some type of emergency how am I supposed to get out also it was really hot and it felt really crowded that's kind of it is what it is Vegas we're in the desert and it's we was windy too at first which was kinda nuts my outfit was going wack but in general it just felt very disorganized also a lot of the stages especially the spiral stage kept having sound issues the mic kept going out I mean come on be prepared for these bands and yeah that's my opinion I loved every year like for Sick New World for when we were young they have a great light up they get really good bands for these festivals it's just the way it's organized and the venue choice I do not love um I had to leave Sleep Token and to smoke down early which are the main bands I wanted to see because I didn't wanna wait hours on to get on the monorail because this is at the very end of the strip just it was nuts it was just nuts I can't imagine like I feel like I waited more in lines and with people that actually seeing music so that's it honestly the bands made it worth the experience for me but the organization is really disappointing for how much money that we're paying like bring back World Tour",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable, but it's entirely true. So my mom went to college in Florida, and one of the years that she was in college, she was actually, like, renting a room out of this person's apartment. So she said one night she woke up in the middle of the night, and she kind of turned over, and she noticed that there were two people standing at the edge of her bed. She said it was a man and a woman. They didn't say anything. They just stare directly at her, motionless. She said that they seem to be wearing, like, you know, colonial garb. Like, definitely, like, old timey spirits, basically. So this absolutely freaks her out. She's frozen in fear. She doesn't know what to do. And so she says that she finally kind of, like, gathers enough courage to, like, throw the covers over her head and try to fall asleep. She says she does eventually fall asleep. Wakes up in the morning, everything's fine. Second night in a row, she gets woken up to the colonial couple standing at the end of her bed. Once again, they just stare at her. Like, they don't say anything, they don't do anything. They are just standing at the end of her bed, staring. So once again, she finally gathers enough courage to, like, grab the blankets, put it over her head, and she eventually falls asleep. Now, this is where the story Takes a bit of a switch. The third night rolls around, and my mom is exhausted. Not only is she in college working a bunch of jobs, she has now been woken up two times in a row by this colonial couple. Who will not let her get her beauty rest. So she said this time she was over it. Third night rolls around. Once again she is woken up to the colonial couple standing at the end of her bed. And this night she was over it. She looked them dead in their ghoulish eyes and said, leave me the f alone. And they disappeared. And she never saw them again.",

    "voice_to_text": "honestly I'm grateful that you've lived such a privileged life that your answer is the bear it was eighth grade when I had the privilege of having my 70 something uh year old male history teacher um start harassing me in his classroom it started out very innocent that I didn't really realise what was going on I just thought he was weird old man vibe teacher which sounds really messed up saying those words back like oh he's just a an old man that's just it's just a weird old man thing but no there was something off so it started with he would take like papers right worksheets or whatever that we did that we'd have done or things and he'd have them all stacked up and rolled up like this right he'd walk up to me and keep in mind I always paid attention to make sure I'm like okay is it just me or is he doing this to other people no just me okay so let's pretend the camera is me right I'm the teacher I wish I could come up with a code name but um his last name is a code name in itself Mister Mayo okay Mister Mayo would take his lovely papers and he'd go he'd walk up to me and he'd just go just start tapping me on the head which okay nothing of it right hmm and I'd look at him what are you doing my paper likes this my paper says it feels good my paper thank you what I will never forget being so confused and like huh like what is that supposed to mean and I looked at my friend at the time and I was like what like did you hear that and I will we always talked about it for the longest time and like that was weird like what was that didn't think much of it he did it a couple times it wasn't just a one time occurrence which made it even a little stranger but he just do the the paper tapping thing but this is when I knew something else was up so in my school we had smart boards I'm sure in the American public school system you guys know what a smart board is so smart board is like here right and the classroom all the desks were like facing the um the front of the classroom the smart board was right here and then his desk was like behind like all of the chairs right he like sat behind us okay so doors over here my desk is like right by the door and like right next to the smart board and so all the desks so end up going this way like into the rest of the room my point we had all moved the desk cause we were doing like a group assignment or something and so we had all pushed the desk together in like little like groups right so my desk I had turned so that my chair was facing the back wall where the smart board was and I was sitting this way this is important because the smart board and the wall is right here there's not a lot of space here we go so I and standing at at my desk in like behind my seat the wall is right here and we're cleaning up cause it's like the end of the block or something and I'm cleaning up and I all of a sudden Mister Mayo starts walking this way towards the classroom to like go towards his desk and out of all of the several pathways he could have taken he decided to go behind me between me and the wall this man proceeds to squeeze past and that's the only way I can say it because there was not a lot of room squeeze behind me now keep in mind he has his body facing this way my body is facing this way as he goes to slide past me he stops directly behind me um if this is his rear end and this is my rear end he goes and he goes like this kinda grinds a little bit pushes his butt against mine a couple times and then scoots past me eighth grade again all I knew is it made me uncomfortable I thought I was overthinking it wasn't until one day on my way to dance rehearsal I randomly brought it up to my mom who is also a teacher she went ballistic oh my god why didn't you ever tell me this oh my god and then I told her about the paper thing Shannon oh my god and it it turn into a thing right so we set up a meeting with the principal and the guidance counselor and I tell them everything that I just told you and I told my mom and my mom had me write it all down because she's very thorough about all this kind of stuff and so she went in and then had a separate meeting with the principal the guidance counselor and Mister Mayo Mister Mayo denied all of it cause of course he did and me being me I was like well I remember being told that in those like retro I don't know if y'all even still have them anymore old retro like box TVs that used to be in like every classroom the little like clock that used to be underneath it when I was a kid they always used to tell us that the little dots were cameras in the classrooms right so I was like oh go check the cameras like it happened I'm not crazy like it it made me super uncomfortable like our butts were like this like it would look it was gross all that came out of it was he's been with our school for so many years I highly doubt he meant anything by it but if Shannon's uncomfortable we can move her into a different class that's all we did and keep in mind this was towards the end of the school year so for the last quarter of the school year I was in another teacher's history class that's it my math class was still right across the hall her class the new history class was still right next door to his eighth grade I had that privilege well let's bring forward to sophomore year where my neighbour who lived on my street decided randomly on the bus one day he was gonna turn around on the bus and start hitting me in the leg so hard to the point that it broke blood vessels still have the scar um but then when we got off the bus I would try to run up the street because you know we lived on the same street I would try to run to go get to my house he caught me cause he's bigger than me caught me slammed me over his shoulder literally carried me to my front lawn as I am punching and hitting and kicking and screaming while my neighbors the fellow neighbor kids are laughing I am kicking and telling him to get off of me finally he throws me down in the front yard it looks like he's about to reach for my pants thank god my sister was home and I decided to run to the front door and yeah we went from there which brings us back to 2020 where it all comes full circle and I get graped for the first time what a privilege I choose the bear",

    "voice_to_text": "so I have two stories that I have been dying to tell someone the first story was from when I was in like third or fourth grade I was sleeping over at my best friend Jen's house and one night we were in the living room sleeping I woke up and at the foot of the bed there was a strange person there I could see no features they were completely dark but their eyes started to glow like a yellow orange I freaked out threw the covers over my head and when I looked back they were gone the next morning I had told Jennifer about it and I thought she was gonna freak out but she didn't instead she told me that she has seen that too it made me feel better knowing that my best friend also saw this ghost and I wasn't alone but it still scared us enough that we didn't sleep in the living room again for quite some time my second story I actually have a video for so very recently like last Christmas my son's therapist got him a little car set the car comes with three little interchangeable pieces and a remote so you turn the car on you turn the remote on they connect and you can move it it moves forward and then when it goes backwards it moves on an angle that way it kinda like turns around which is really cool however this car started moving by itself I took the batteries out of the car I turned it off I took the batteries out of the remote the car was still moving I changed it and put every plate on the car thinking maybe it was doing it with one plate nope did it with every single plate I had I don't know what happened I don't know why this was happening but this car was haunted it moved completely on its own papa is my grandpa who passed away almost three years ago and my at the time four year old told me that it was papa playing with the car I don't know if he sees pop up I don't know but that's what he would tell me and in some weird way it made me feel good and in another it kind of freaked me out but this car moved on its own for months I would put it one place we would wake up in the morning it would be across the room we would put it on the floor and we'd wake up and it would be like in the kitchen this thing went all over the house every night and it would do it during the daytime as well it didn't care if you were watching it or not it was crazy the car then randomly stop doing it I don't really know why and now it's just a toy but here's the video I'm gonna grab the other phone and I wanna show you the video of what this car was doing it won't let me add it on here for some reason which is very strange but whatever we're just gonna pretend that's not happening but it's gonna be the little orange one what it was doing is going back and forth and lighting up now when the car went back and forth it would go in a straight line but if you were to do with the remote it would angle so I don't know what was going on here but that's what this thing was doing and those are the other pieces you could put on it so in the second video I have the blue on not the orange and this time he completely comes off of the unit see he's blinking I'm trying to record it and there he goes completely falls I then do switch it back to the orange guy and if you can see he's blinking again he moves a little bit again but I didn't get that reaction on camera again but for months this thing would do this so I have a couple recordings of this thing just moving around and I don't know I have a haunted toy",

    "voice_to_text": "    okay so this actually reminded me of a story this is a story I haven't told to many people because I'm pretty ashamed of it and nowadays I'm 32 years old I am pretty far away from a shark mentality  I'm pretty much a recovering people pleaser but after doing quite a bit of shadow work I now realised that yes there is definitely a shark inside of me so hold on to your seats because that is a pretty fucked up story so I was seven or eight years old in a small village in France going to school and in my school there were a littlegirl I didn't like honestly I don't know why I think she was making fun of me or maybe she was just annoying I don't know  and so one day during recess I asked that one little boy who was deeply in love with me and he had you know that type of behaviour where he would seem very desperate he would always want to kiss me or hold my hand and he was just very needy and so I thought that's pretty annoying too so I decided to kill two birds with one stone and that's when my 7 year old self had her first machiavelic plan so I asked this little boy to go kick that little girl I didn't like  In exchange of a kiss so the little boy did it without any hesitation and he kicked that little girl straight in the butt and she started crying and so the teachers saw him and punished him he had to spend the rest of recess in a corner punished and that little girl was crying probably pretty confused to why that just happened to her and I just stayed away from all of this trying to realise what just happened and I just remembered that at the end of recess when the little boy came to me to be claiming his kiss I told him no because he had been punished and the promise of a kiss was only valid during recess I had totally made up that last rule I didn't want to go with it so I just didn't kiss him and that was the end of my real Machiavelic plan but thankfully I realised that this was bad I went home and remembered that girl crying and that little boy being punished and I thought whoa that is fucked up  so I decided on that day to not do that again but I did realise that I had a lot of manipulative power and so I could have easily choose to use that manipulative power to my advantage and keep on using people and manipulating them to get what I want but thankfully I chose not to and you know we all have that good wolf and bad wolf inside of us and I think that's when I really realised that yes I definitely had a bad wolf inside of me too but so yeah at 7 or 8 years old I definitely had a shark mentality and I definitely could have turn into someone who was very much not a good person so realise what you are capable of and choose to act in the best interest of the people around you and not only your best interest that's what it means to be a good person but do not be afraid to realise that yes we are all capable of terrible things",

    "voice_to_text": "yes all of that all the time growing up in New Zealand being Romanian was a confusing time for me because I thought I was speaking the language to them and they just responded in the least predictable ways possible and I had to constantly gauge how negative I was meant to be because being too negative was negative but being not negative enough was too positive and that was confusing because I don't have a concept of what would be negative enough for people outside of my culture at that point right because I was 12 13 something so from where I was standing as a Romanian person it was confusing because I'm like these people have the life force of a depressed mop like I would be genuinely concerned for their health if if I were in Romania right now I would be genuinely concerned about these people's capacity to live longer than a couple of years from here because the energy levels they were just through the ground and so I came home one day because people kept telling me off for being too loud too noisy too excitable to whatever and I'm just ranting at my mother and raging and she goes oh oh that's okay you know there's nothing wrong with you you're Romanian we you know we we have loud face expressions that's that's normal for us you're normal for you okay but they're English you gotta you gotta understand they're English they don't do emotions they're emotionally constipated just be mindful but don't take them seriously cause you can't you can't be like that it's not how we function yeah yeah that that's true as a remaining person that is not how I function and it took me a really long time to understand that people did function like that and they were okay for functioning like that and the the more they demanded of me that I act like that the less I was willing to give them the space to just be without making fun of their character which was boring from my perspective and this should tell you one thing that racism exists for one reason and one reason only and that is humans humans you see as a 14 year old it doesn't really much matter if I think Kiwis are stupid but if I'm in charge of making legislation and I think only some Kiwis deserve to have rights that makes it problematic doesn't it because your identification of another person's character is still a subjective identification and that is why different ideologies are very harmful because at the end of the day doesn't matter what kind of good ideology you start from humans find a way to turn into something bad like just you know just think of religion think of older religions think of think of Christianity it says like hat you have two commandments love thy neighbour as thy god and what was the other one yeah don't throw stones at people if you're sin unless you're sinless right just those two things I'm probably paraphrasing a lot of the second the Second Testament the New Testament but you know what I mean and somehow here we are some 200 some 2,000 years after the book was compiled by randos across Middle East moved in through Greece into through through Europe changed into a bunch of languages and transported across the world by murderous people and and now we we have the conversations like does life begin of conception and so if and does do women have the right to govern their own bodies? because this is something that I tell people I used to tell people when I was still Christian what's between me and God is between me and God that means including if I deserve if I decide to get pregies and then for some reason I just like nope even if it was something that you don't completely understand it is not for you to decide what I do with it and I do say it for a reason because it is dama damaging to personalise something that is not actually a person cause look to what kind of arguments it leads cause suddenly you're taking a life look bitch I made that life I can unmake that life it's still inside of me I will remove it like a wart that's not for anyone else to judge me but yes the people who didn't understand that were also very much you guessed it from the west so all this to say is it's important to have an appreciation of different cultures because it really helps you put into perspective the very nuanced and subtle ways in which people develop their societies to control one another individually",

    "voice_to_text": "my soul was bound to chains so what story was being told let's talk about it so this poem is called Shadow Cry and this is a really dark poem it's really heavy poem I think this was a poem that I wrote about a very early time in my life where I was exploring and experiencing the heaviness that I like I was processing the heaviness that I've always felt at a young age and I think that there was a time in my life where I realised that I had always felt so hidden I always felt like there was this weight on my shoulders and I felt like I couldn't be who I truly was meant to be  there was a part of me that just kept shrinking myself and trying to hide who I truly was and I feel like this poem is really about feeling locked away almost in a tower and no matter how loud you scream no matter how hard you try to get out no one's coming to help you and no one can hear you and you're just stuck you know and that's what I felt like for a big um you know long time and this poem is about really breaking free from that and I think it's about breaking those generational curses it's about unlearning all of those things that you grew up learning about yourself and like who you should be and those people pleasing tendencies and that's what it was about for me with this poem  you know just really trying so hard to be something just to feel loved and the truth is is that never works you it's so important for you to learn to love yourself and all the differences that you have it's important to embrace your uniqueness your eccentricity all those things are so important to embrace because they are what make you you and you are given those gifts for a reason so that's what this poem is about it's about shattering the societal standards about shattering the manipulation it's about breaking free from the matrix and it's about claiming your power and owning everything that you're meant to be and who you are and you know there was a lot of times within this darkness that I was experiencing that I felt like leaving and I want to just say like for anybody out there that is feeling this heaviness on their shoulders and feeling like it's hard to embrace who you are um just know that it takes time but do not give up on yourself you owe it to yourself to take a step forward every single day even if you take 10 steps back like no matter what always aim to take a step forward and you will discover your truths and you will learn to embrace them and this journey will get easier and that's what this poem is all about um I call it Shadow Cry because your shadow is your ego your shadow is all the darkness that you experience in your life and some of us stay in our shadow and some of us kill our shadow off and move forward into light and I want this poem to be about moving forward into light and I didn't get saved those chains that impede me became the chains that freed me and what that means is I had to figure out why the chains were on to be able to take them off and that is what I did I basically just processed my past and decided to move forward and I decided to wear my chains as armour and not allow myself to be bound to those chains as a victim you know it's important to keep your head up and to stay strong and to move forward in power and that is the overall lesson that I took with me in this dark experience so I hope you enjoyed the poem if you haven't checked it out be sure to and thanks for listening",

    "voice_to_text": "True. I literally love dogs. Golden doodles with so much peace and love. Get out of my face! Get out of my face! And then I had a lot of other people being like, okay, explain. Like, can you explain this? I'm like, yes and no. Do you know what I mean? It's just kind of like, it's an inherent belief system that I stand by and I always have. What it is, is at their core. I do think that they are government spies. I think they're plants. Go back and watch that girl's video, because that video is actually really, really funny. And a lot of people feel that way about golden doodles. But let me tell you the story of how my cousin bought a golden doodle because, like, she did not want basic. Basically, she wanted a dog that, like, didn't shed and, um, was hypoallergenic. She basically bought the dog for the aesthetic, had no idea, did no research on the golden doodle at all and, like, what kind of a dog she was getting herself into. Basically, this golden doodle was for her child. Like, she got the dog for her child because she just would not shut up about wanting a dog. She did not wanna get, like, just any dog. She wanted a golden doodle specifically because it was hypoallergenic and, you know, less. In her words, she thought that the less maintenance for this golden doodle. Wrong. Like, her kid and Her husband loved the dog. Like, they played with the dog all the time. And the nice thing was, is that they lived in the country, so, like, their land was pretty spacious, so the dog's energy could run in the fields and stuff like that. But at one point, she just could not handle this dog anymore. And she had told me and my family that she was getting scared of this dog. And I was like, what do you mean by scared? And she told me, she's like, I just look at it, and it just. It just doesn't look like a real dog. It looks terrifying. And I'm like, oh, well. And. And I don't look at golden doodles like that because I love dogs. I am a dog person. And, like, one day when I was over there, the dog, like, jumped over me, was like, it's like a man overpowering you. That's how I can say it. Although Walter was a very nice dog, he just had no boundaries, had no limits, was just crazy, going all over the place. But, yeah. Anyway, one day, uh, she woke up and just took the dog. Took the dog and sold him to another farm. Didn't tell anybody about it. And then when we had asked where Walter was, she told us that she sold him. And my aunt has been mad at her ever since. And she told my cousin in Korean, she was a terrible Person had some Korean curse words for her and then told her never get a dog ever again. But I don't know. I'm gonna be honest with you. After seeing this video, I kind of see why she gave up the dog.",

So I genuinely thought for the first five seconds of that video that she was asking people to tell the story of their own birth and not the story of them giving birth. So I cannot add anything to the topic of giving birth, but now I wanna tell my birth story. So my mom had a really, really shitty Chinese takeaway the night before I was born. And that morning she started having, like, really bad pain in her stomach, and she was convinced it was just gas from the really shit takeaway that she had had the night before. She goes through the whole day, the pain keeps getting worse and worse, and it finally Johnson her that it's not gas. She's actually giving birth to me. So anyway, it's ironic because I now have a health condition that makes me fart all the time. And it's fitting that my mom genuinely thought that I was just gas and not me, because I am gas.

I'm Zimbabwean, so our version is Roora. The whole concept of Roora is actually supposed to be just paying tribute to your parents, just thanking your parents for raising you. It's supposed to be a happy time. Bride price, it's just a price. It doesn't mean that you're being bought or you're being sold. So if your families insisting that, you know, let's put the numbers all the way high because they wanna try and get money and make it try like, make it be a money exchange. And if your man who is now your husband or is becoming your husband is now making it seem like you're an object and he's purchasing you, um, that's not how it's supposed to be. Defeats the whole purpose. I was in a situation where I was being made to feel like I was bought by my husband and it wasn't okay. So that mentality or way of thinking is not okay and bride price is not it.",

    "voice_to_text": "okay I've literally tried making this like three times but my phone keeps glitching the fuck out and this only ever happens when I try to tell the ghost stories on the internet so I never end up posting that this one isn't my story it's about my aunt and uncle's house which not that I haven't had an experience or two there but their experiences because they lived there are definitely like a lot spookier but way back in the day when we were little and my aunt uncle and my two cousins lived in the same town as me they had a lot of haunting experiences in their house and I think what really set it over the edge was when my aunt saw a cowboy in their hallway and then walk into her and my uncle's bedroom and she said let me get a medium up in here so she contacts a medium the medium comes to the house and as the medium is walking around she said and this medium brings up the cowboy she says he wants to apologize because he says he thinks he scared you and I'm like wait that's actually funny as fuck looking and the medium had explained to my aunt that there were a lot of spirits in the house and some of them didn't necessarily live their physical lives in the house but there's just something about that house and its energy that pulls a lot of spirits towards them and my aunt said that when she was going through listings when they were buying houses or looking at buying houses that there was just something about this house that in the picture it was just pulling her to it like at some point I think that one of the ghosts had an issue with the way the house was set up so they rearranged their house or living area because the ghost didn't like it which like kind of period if they're your roommates like have a conversation about it but both of my cousins both had a ghost that's not attached to them they bonded within the house and the older daughter I think his name was George or something he was a man and he would read to her spend time with her she said she remembers him she's like he was a nice guy but she said that he lived in the shed in their backyard but they don't have a shed in their backyard and my aunt and uncle ended up doing some more digging on the history of the house and found that there was in fact a shed in the backyard probably in the 50s or something like that and apparently in her room there was a lot of spiritual energy she has like a little crawl space in there and the medium said that slaves used to hide in there during the slave trade I don't exactly know what historical event it was but they would hide in there so they wouldn't get like taken or killed or something which Loki and hindsight makes so much sense because that crawl space creeped me the fuck out but the other sister definitely had a bit spookier of an experience and so she would hang out with this little boy named Henry and Henry resided there with his father and Henry was kind of a little mischievous he would like take things I think he would he kinda have a little attitude and so he would make my cousin have an attitude and like talk back and say things that or tell her to say things and stuff like that but at one point I believe that there was a knife that was misplaced and they found it underneath the bedside table next to my cousin's bed and I'm like okay that's fucking crazy and so my aunt brings up this weird fucking scenario with this medium that she's been in contact with and the medium tells her like oh while you're putting her to bed maybe like reading her book you can just take out your phone like take some discreet pictures and so as she's doing this my cousin turns to her little child and she says to my aunt Henry doesn't like that like I burn the fucking house down what and at this point my aunt had enough of Henry so she was like um if you can't behave you're not allowed to live here and then I think sometime next the next time she talked to the medium the medium said that Henry's father did have a talk with him and said knock it off because we wanna be able to stay here and I'm like okay period this is funny like what and then I know there was like issues with their dogs and stuff like their basement creep me the fuck out like I remember when they moved into the house and they were giving a tour to everybody and I would I did not go down there I don't know what it was I was probably like somewhere between seven and 11 at the time and there was just just the look of the door grossed me out I was not gonna go down there and I don't think there were any spirit evil spirits in the house but the it just like gave me an icky feeling and I don't even like thinking about it now my aunt said that one of their dogs would always be at the top of the stairs and be barking at the door or like if the door was open it would be barking at like the stairs and it would piss my aunt off so she's like stop fucking with my dog like you're scaring him and I don't like that I live here you're only allowed to be here because I allow you to be and then it stopped it didn't it didn't happen again and that like weirds me out I don't like that either and I'm like so there's a fucking reason I didn't wanna go down there and I'm sure there's like 800 more things I could probably ask them about and see what more happened but I remember one time I was babysitting my cousins and we were staying up a little bit later than we should have we just wanted to finish the Disney Channel original movie we were watching um I'm babysitting them we're watching our movie we finish it up we go upstairs I have them brush their teeth and then they go to bed and then after that I go back downstairs I'm sitting on the couch I'm on my little iPhone 4 and I hear footsteps coming from upstairs and there is genuinely no reason these girls who have needed to get out of bed so I was already suspicious of this like they didn't need to eat they didn't need to go to the bathroom they just went they just brushed their teeth like they are in bed and I feel like anyone who has lived in a two story house can very much tell whose footsteps are who's when they're coming up the or down the stairs or even if you're in the basement and you hear people walking upstairs like you can tell who's walking right like you can tell at least that they're adult footsteps or kid footsteps because kids are much smaller they're not gonna make that much noise compared to an adult but these were like heavy footsteps so I'm sitting here like oh my god let me put my fucking headphones and I'm shitting my pants right now just waiting for my aunt and uncle to come home from their date and so I just like laid my little self on the couch and put my headphones in to block literally everything out cause I just couldn't I was so scared but I know my cousin is on this app so I'm like please give us your 2 cents anyways sorry for the long video but I hope you enjoy",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entirely true. I'll go first. So the undergrad that I went to was in Mississippi before it became a college. It was actually a slave plantation that they turned into a college. Sorry, if you hear breathing, it's my pug. But anyway, back to the story. One night I'm sleeping in my dorm room, and about 3 o'clock in the morning, all of a sudden I wake up to this thing on top of me. And I could not move my body. It was holding me down. It was trying to attack me. It had this sunken in face. It just looked evil, it looked angry. It was very, very scary. The rest of the night. I turn on the lights, could not go back to sleep. Honestly, for the rest of the school year I slept with the lights on. Scared the absolute hell out of me. This was all the way back in the early 2. Fast forward to a few months ago. I was talking to my friend and I said to her, you know, one day I was in the dorms and I feel like I was attacked by one of the slave ghost in there or something. I don't know what it was. She said, which room was it? I told her which room it was and she got really quiet. She goes to me, girl, I was sleeping in that room one day. And the same exact thing happened to me. I don't know if maybe they built the dorms on top of an unmarked slave grave. I don't know what is going on, but I've also heard other stories about people from the 70s having really weird paranormal activity or interactions with whatever is over there.",

I don't even know how to say properly Govoriti Ingleski?=You speak English? like I but I oh long story short the first bartender did speak English and then there was another day when there was a different bartender but by then I knew a little bit more words um I asked for this delicious drink that they have called uh Rakija \ud83d\ude0d this one's specifically that Terranino \ud83d\udc9a um the day that there was a different bartender and it was just me finally I was like Je-ne jedan...dva Terranino,molim=One-...not one,two Terranino, please! I look just as dumb as that and the bartenders like and I don't know if he was just like thinking okay it's another customer or another dumb American because I was really trying to not make an ass out of myself but I think I did and I feel awful for it",

So this dude made this post talking about if y'all's kids not potty trained at the age of two, y'all bad parenting, y'all. Y'all need to do better. I took it personal because my newly turned three rows still struggling with potty training. So I said, well, at least my baby's favourite colour ain't dog. Now why the fuck would I go and say some shit like that? Oh, they ate me up. They call me all type of bell pepper nose. One person said look like they punch my nose upward. They said so much shit about my nose, I never even knew you could even say about a nose. And I'm sitting here like, damn, I've been having the same nose for 33 years. I know it's big and it ain't going nowhere. I can't hide it. But moral of the story, quit taking shit personal on the internet. Especially if they ain't talking about you. They wanna talk about me. I don't know him, he don't know me. People in the comments don't know me. But I made the shoe fit. I never do that shit again.",

    "voice_to_text": "y'all know this girl that said she's looking for tea well boy do I have some for you I've been waiting for an opportunity to tell this story because I just gagged so I traveled to Guatemala back in January and I see that this hostel slash resort okay so when I got to my room there was about four other girls who were staying inside of my room at the time that I arrived and there was a fifth girl who did not stay in our room let's call her Amber and she was friends with the other four girls that were in my room and I wanna use the word friends loosely because they all just met now the fifth girl Amber she came with another girl and she booked another private room at the same resort that we were staying at so keep in mind Amber and her friend let's call her Lily traveled together from the States to Guatemala they booked this resort together and they stay in the same room quick background on Amber and Lily they have traveled to other places before together so this isn't the first time that they have traveled together okay so everything is going good everything is going fine me and like the four other girls that are inside my room we're up chopping it up chatting talking about stuff whatever inside of our room at night time cause we're like about to go to sleep you know winding down but Amber comes into the room and why do things take a turn so Amber storms into the room and she's pissed she's basically like Lily left me high and dry in San Juan I believe I can't remember if it was San Juan or San Pedro one of the sands whatever the case she left her friend and so Amber is basically explaining like my friend just ditched me for a dude now I don't know what LED Lily to want to abandon Amber Amber assumes that it's probably because she was probably jealous in some way because she was third Wheeling with the guy that she was with and maybe she didn't want her around I have no idea but it's weird cause girls be acting weird around dude they be acting like pick me ish so that's what it was kind of giving right so all the girls in the room we're just listening to the tea absorbing the tea and we're just absolutely gagged because we're like why would you even leave your friend that you traveled with in Guatemala like that that's that's really messed up but what's even worse okay so this is the real tea what's even worse is that Lily has a man okay has a man man back in the States and when I tell you you would not be able to convince me that that was not a Lily's man like if you saw them together you would be like oh that's her man but no she has a actual boyfriend back in the States and not only that but they live together and what's really messed up is that her man has been keeping tabs on everything that she has been doing like through text calling you know basically just assuring her man like everything's going good everything's going fine meanwhile she's with some British man that she just met like oh my gosh double whammy like what like you leave your friend in the middle of nowhere and then ended you're on a trip just bopping around town with a man okay fast forward to the morning right I went on this sunrise hike and on the sunrise hike me and like a few other people were like one of the last people okay and I came across this like couple and that was walking with me and I got to know the couple I was talking with them come to find out that the couple that I was talking to was the British man and Lily I didn't know it was Lily until Amber actually pointed her out and I was like oh that's the girl that was on the hike anyways so when we were all at breakfast basically like after the hike um I saw that like Amber was like keeping her distance from Lily they did not speak they basically cut communication Amber actually took all of her stuff from out of her room put it into our room and then you just see like Lily with her her new man that she just met okay um and it was just really awkward but um I feel really bad for Amber cause she looked like really sad on her face like I sending love if you do see this video but she looked really sad um but yeah that's really awkward really really awkward and then like get back on the plane with that person and then like it's just really awkward cause they like booked all their travel plans together so anyways this video went on too long",

    "voice_to_text": "okay I'm glad that this actually popped up on TikTok because quite literally I done like YouTube videos about this before I think I've done like one or two I had to go back and look but yeah most recent was like what three years ago first everyone was like what seven years ago um my I have a decent amount of experiences and those videos actually go through a little more than just like one experience or so I think I go through like three or four experiences in those two separate YouTube videos if you wanna go check them out um yeah I mean they're really old and I kind of like but whatever I um I was still really starting off on YouTube all that stuff I didn't continue on the journey whatever but that's irrelevant I'm gonna talk about one of them this is I think I kind of talked about it in one and one of those two videos with receipts and I'll try to see if I can find those receipts again cause those receipts are really old this happened this is freshman year era of high school this story happens freshman year or like almost freshman year of high school cause it was like summertime I was almost going into the freshman year of high school and yeah I'm very much 25 now so in it it was in an old iPhone my first ever iPhone which was the iPhone 4S yeah and let me continue on the story because then yeah long story short it was summertime like I said I was waiting for freshman year of high school to come on in and I remember throughout pretty much every single night consistently on summer break I would be on a group chat with my friends like the friends I've had since like elementary school around this time we were probably already like five years in or so or inner friendship relationship thing like our little group relationship whatever um and it was just me and the girly pops who were all uh I think there was a certain point we'll start uh video recording because I mainly started that cause there's times where I just don't wanna type so much right and so I'll just be like hey like you know what this bitch said today or something like that like not really but also really maybe there's probably been this is where I've had conversations with them like that and like I'll send them the voice message whatever send and then they'll hear it whatever and then once the first person does they won't start doing it right so around the summertime we would always especially continue the messaging and everything to like midnight two three in the morning sometimes we would stay up until like six in the morning some of us I feel like half the time it was always me that was up until like six in the morning half of them would go to sleep like around around like three or four in the morning maybe maybe four in the morning but yeah majority I feel like they would mainly go to sleep like around three in the morning and I would be awake for another three hours alone so I was like okay but yeah okay so I'm get to it there was this one night specifically we were all messaging late at night it was probably like past midnight is probably one maybe two in the almost two in the morning um and I don't remember what exactly we were talking about um this is an old Facebook account like super old Facebook account my first ever one that I just recently got back maybe if I go through the messages I can find them again I don't know if that group chat is still existent if I can find I don't know I haven't tried uh I don't even use that account I only use it to like look at the marketplace to see if there's any cool stuff by or like I don't know just mainly watch videos don't even try to see what anyone this dumb little towns doing or has done I really don't care much I keep going off topic but at the same time it's kind of relevant mainly because of this well it's a little more further ahead why it's welcome whatever we're messaging it's getting late at night my parents are asleep I have my own room whatever um I'm like you know i'mma start voice recording cause I kind of wanna type anymore and I'll just start whispering a little cause it's like late at night but I won't whisper too much to where they won't hear me but like enough and I was just like kind of like this really close to my like microphone whispering whatever and I'm sending them back and forth while messaging whatever and I remember at that moment I'm like right here right my phone's literally at right here to this level and I'm like listening to one of their voice messages and I'm just like kind of like laughing at whatever they're saying or whatever and it literally in my peripheral in my peripheral mind you the room is dark it's dark as heck I don't have one single light not one single light not a light night light not a lamp nothing um the curtains were closed the the freaking blinds were closed everything you know it was literally pitch black and um my house are in it's really nearby like Denny's and Domino's quite literally cause there's a fence line that splits from those businesses I guess and we're like on the other side of that fence we're literally like the first house that starts in that whole street whatever um and I'm saying this because when I was listening to the voice message and when I of my friend one of my friends sent my peripheral I literally see like a flash of light like white really it wasn't even white it was like white it was like a flash of white it didn't even look like it was like a beam or glare or anything and look like literally like a white and I was just like what the fuck and I remember I was literally like this like for the longest my bed my bed setup was over here mind you like just use your magician this side of the wall where this pillow is if you go imagine if the fucking wall went further like away like let's say a good 6 7 feet away and that's where it starts that's where my door would be right and then closet is all like throughout this whole rest of the wall right so imagine like where that door is but now revert it and it's over here and then the closets like yeah whatever and so I'm just there looking at my door and I'm just like look at my closet doors and I'm just like go on this side and on this side it's just pure window and a chair a pink chair and I was just like and then in front of me is another window too so I'm like maybe cause we're so close to like the Boulevard because you know Denny's and Domino's maybe I don't know maybe somebody parked at Denny's really late at night I don't know some people might do that I don't know I don't know what people do but I don't know why in that instance I was like I don't know I feel like I just wanna take a picture I don't know if I probably not getting fine anything nothing's gonna pop up but epic epic and so I'm like I was literally about to send a voice message back to them right but instead I go and hop off Facebook Messenger for a bit go on my camera that's on my phone I put it up and in front of me like literally like what pointed towards the closet I take a picture with flash then I take another picture with flash by the door so then I'm like okay let me look so I look at the one by the door nothing okay now look at the one in the closet when I tell you my freaking mouth drop to the freaking ground it did it did I'm running out of time almost but I hope I have enough time to finish this literally in the picture there was a silhouette of someone wearing a white gown with black hair pretty almost as the long length of meme of my hair what it is now maybe a little longer but their hair was like pretty much like in the front and their head look like this I it looked almost scratch like it really did let me see if I can find it will give me one little second for y'all well for me it's gonna be like a couple okay luckily I did talk about this in one of the YouTube videos and I had to go search up my photos from the edits and everything and when I that I put in that video so found it mind you I'm gonna show you this and I have not edit this photo whatsoever this is straight up from my iPhone 4S I even went into like editing apps like where you add like little ghost figures or whatever and that the optimacy like glow and all that stuff and I couldn't recreate it just like that to where it looked that good like that realistic mind you this is like pretty much early 2,000 early to mid 2,012 so yeah literally right here like you see the head you can see in literally my closet my closet my door is right here I took that picture I sent it to my friends and they were like oh my god I see what you're talking about and I sent it to other people or they did and I remember I got this like paranormal chunky like guy who came and message me and it's like you I could tell you didn't edit it I even got it and have this app to see if it's ever gotten edited or whatever photoshopped and all that stuff and you didn't like how it was like I don't know I'm so scared so uh yeah I was curious shitless and",

    "voice_to_text": "About 12 years ago we lived in a haunted house and we had lived in one before that too but this house was especially memorable uh my husband worked night shift so when I would tell him that I heard noises all night like it sounded like somebody was pacing downstairs or opening and closing doors but you go downstairs and there's like nobody awake or in the house um or before I'd go to sleep I'd see like this ball of lights I call them twinkle lights but almost look like fireworks just kind of and it would dissipate like sizzle out and I just thought well maybe I'm dreaming this or I'm tired until the neighbor lady had asked my husband why we have a ball Christmas lights upstairs so that's when I knew I wasn't imagining things but this instance this is the thing that really solidified it for me and I was I was ready to move um I was sleeping it was a school night my girls were all I have three daughters and at the time they were teenagers and they were all asleep too my husband was at work and I was asleep with my two dogs in my bed and in the middle of the night the one dog woke me up growling which she had never done before so I rolled over to see what she was looking at and it looked like my middle daughter was standing against my bedroom wall next to my bed and which was really weird because my girls didn't sleepwalk or but I thought maybe you know this was the first time and I told the dog hey it's just Becca it's okay and so I said her name several times said hey Becca Becca Becca are you okay cause I thought maybe something was wrong it was not Becca this thing turned around and its face was like glowing white with like black cracks all over it and the eyes were just black holes and I was stunned and then the dog jumped off the bed towards it and it ran out my bedroom door and I jumped out of bed and I followed it flipped on my light and I saw it go towards my middle daughter's room so I flung her door open and there was nothing in there nothing my daughter was curled up in her bed fast asleep in her pajamas and no idea what it was but I slept with my bedroom light on after that cause it it was pretty scary um but I have several more stories if anyone is interested let me know",

    "voice_to_text": "ain't got shit on when you first find out that bitch you was rocking with was a fucking weirdo and boy do I have the story to tell oh my gosh when I first seen this TikTok my heart dropped a little bit and I started to be in my head should I speak on this or should I but then I thought about it if she wanted to get spoken about the bitch shouldn\u2019t have did it to me so here goes I'm not gonna name names cause shorty know who she is because she still ain't unblock me on Instagram and she still ain't told me why she did it but she unblock me on TikTok so I hope this pops up on her feed but what should I call her i'mma call her Vaseline so I met Vaseline on the train right my mom kicked me out I was kind of going through with this happened over the summer so this was kind of recent right I met Vaseline me and her hit it off immediately she was a Scorpio my brother's a Scorpio I love Scorpios\u2764\ufe0f so I'm like alright cool you know we can chop it up I started linking up with her because again I was going through a hard time and I just wanted some company and I thought you know she's a really good person and this bitch is always talking about oh uh I don't have you know friends that I can trust so you know I'm like thinking in my head okay I wanna be the friend that she can trust I wanna you know be a friend that can show her different that can show her you know there are females you know that that are in your corner that you can lean on in that that you can trust so whenever she needed anything even though I was going through a hard time I barely had clothes in my fucking bag when my mom kicked me the fuck out but when her grandma kick her the fuck out if she needed clothes I still gave them to her so we were cool we used to smoke together you know we used to hang I used to be in her neighborhood we used to you know be out downtown or whatever we was cool you know and she keeps calling me best friend now I don't usually call people that I just met best friend but I'm like alright she cool she's older than me she's 23 so I thought the bitch had sense you know I'm thinking you know she's older than me maybe it's something that I can learn from her apparently the fuck not but she's calling me bestie so I'm like bestie cool so boom I finally get my apartment just in time for the semester to start so now things are getting busier cause you know as you can see I already have a job right and now that the semester start things are getting busier and I still just need to clear my mind after being homeless all summer like you know so I kinda spend some time by myself right but I finally gotten around to spending time with all my friends around the holidays including Vaseline I hung out with Vaseline for New Year's New Year's Eve and she did some weird ass shit but that's not even that that's not even the worst part of the story wait for the tea so keep in mind that is New Year's Eve December 31st was the last time like literally the last time I physically seen Vaseline right keep that in mind now without telling too much of other people's business basically if someone that I know right someone that I knew for a while and Vaseline ended up needing a place to stay again so she had to stay with this person that I know house at you know at their family's house right cause she needed somewhere to live right and I'm not gonna judge cause I was literally in the same situation but keep in mind the people that she's staying with they know me they know who I am and they follow me on Instagram so when Vaseline is posting me cause my birthday was coming up that's why I said fast forward we gonna fast forward to around February my 20th birthday she's posting these countdowns you know oh my bestie's birthday coming up my bestie's birthday coming up yeah my birthday coming up so whenever Vaseline posted me on her story I reposted it on my story right so this particular person that she's staying with seen my story and was like Yo you know her and I'm like yeah I know Vaseline I met her over the summer and we became cool you know like apparently we're besties and this particular person was just like okay so this was this happened before my birthday right my birthday February 10th now after my birthday this is where the real tea happened this person calls me again my my friend called me again and she's like Yo you know Vaseline is staying in my house right and I'm like well you know yeah and she's like and while she's staying in my house she's going around telling everybody in the house that she seen you the other day she she seen you the other day and she spat on you she whooped your ass in front of her friend what was her friend name we gonna call her friend we gonna call her friend tissue right her friend tissue seen everything and I'm like wait what I haven't seen Vaseline since New Year's Eve this is what February 24th that she told me this what do you mean you see me the other day do a clone so I'm just confused I'm hurt cause I'm like wasn't you just literally in my messages calling me bestie like she was literally sending me TikTok about being best friends and asking me do I wanna hang out and my intuition was telling me not to hang out with that bitch lately so it probably was a reason why but she was actually that I wanna hang out with her and all this shit and in the midst of all of that you're going around telling people that you see me and beat me up baby so at first I played pool cause I was gonna you know I was gonna definitely dress her and I already did and then she left right so my friend called me again and she got tissue on the phone tissue is supposed to be the one that seen everything right my friend asked tissue did you see Vaseline put her hands on my friend tissue said no tissue said that Vaseline told her that she seen me the other day and she whooped my ass but she didn't see it happen so Vaseline just lied on her friend and said that her friend was there to see it happen and then on top of that tissue girl she said that because her friend told her that we supposedly got into with that she wanted to fight me because she thought that me and Vaseline was beefing so you mean to tell me I could have been walking around going about my business going to work or going to school and this tissue girl could have came and caught me inside my head and I would have had no fucking clue why and you was just in my DMs and in my messages calling me calling me bestie wanna be on the phone with me and shit and Wanna fucking oh wanna hang out for my birthday what are you bitch are you crazy and then when I finally did address her and I mean I had dry cursed her the fuck out she blocked me then when I had to fucking harass her on her number she gonna text me on Instagram and say believe what you wanna believe girl shut up you sound like a nigga to you so you I was there for you when I had hard times and then you decide no no no no and on top of that when she said that she beat me up she was also telling people that I was getting trained and thankfully the person that she told knows me very well so off Rick she knew that shit was not true and I ain't gonna lie two and a half months later that shit still boggles my mind literally because I was nothing but nice to that girl if she was nice to me too that that that's the thing she was so nice to me and then she just turned around and did that what bitch are you BIPOLAR and like clothes food like you know I bought you whatever to eat whatever you needed I got it I gave it to you even when I didn't have much and you just gonna sit on your delusional fucking ass and lie on me like that bitch are you dumb like you really just sat on your delusional dirty ass and just lied on me like that after I was nothing nothing looking looking yo nothing but nice people so yo watch who the fuck you hang with her watch who the fuck you call a friend and don't be befriending people that you meet on the street and this is just a lesson that I had to learn and I'm a pass it on to y'all so that's my story of having a weirdo friend and if she see this if she get mad I'm gonna fuck her she should have did it what are you gonna do not a fuck thing but if she doesn't see it I don't care I just want to get this off my chest cause like I said at first that shit really like broke my heart a little bit I was hurt and then I was just mad now I just like girl now it's just like a funny story that I tell",

    "voice_to_text": "salaries I've been seeing for certain jobs I am shocked with how low they've gotten tell me if this has ever happened to you you work in a job maybe at a small business maybe at a corporation where you are a lower paid employee or at least there's a big gap between what you make and what the people at the top of the company and you go to your boss and you ask them what can I do to earn more money or maybe you talk to the owner directly somebody who's making hundreds of thousands of dollars more than you and you ask them what can I do to make the amount of money you are making and they don't have a satisfactory answer for you like maybe they tell you well you can you can do these things you can work for commission but it all requires some kind of trade off and ultimately the answer frankly is there's nothing you can do to make as much money as me this is not a new conversation but in this age of TikTok we're all connected we're all sharing more information not only in our own companies has it become invogue to talk about how much money we're making it's become easier to tell how much money the business you work for is making how much money the owners are making and inflation is going up the cost of living is increasing our salaries aren't keeping up it's it's not news it's not new but there are some things I think bosses and owners particularly should be thinking about and that employees can also think about that can help us address this problem I wanna tell you a story about it to illustrate what I mean I used to work for a small sales oriented business there were 10 employees and the owner made several times more than the lowest paid employee lowest paid employee might have made like 45 thousand dollars and the owner in a good year would make between 250 and 500 thousand dollar the highest paid employee made less than $100,000 and they had some other incentives like uh small percentage of the profits are shared with all employees and they have 4 O 1K match and vacation days and stuff like that but the incentives were not aligned and to be fair the owner took a disproportionate share of the risk like if we had a hundred thousand dollar order and something went wrong and we decided as a business we needed to eat the cost of it that ultimately came out of the owner's pocket but this company had such a high rate of churn we were always hiring people because people were always leaving the company like if we hired someone it was far less likely they were gonna last a year than that they would last a year or more not only this but engagement was super low like these are salary employees but the owner was constantly struggling and asking me you know I I feel like nobody is as invested in this as I am I say that it's a busy week but people are coming in late or they're taking long lunches or they're leaving early what can I do to fix this person felt like the salaries alone were fair compensation but what I wanna say to them and what I wanna say to any owner of a business is I don't think it's fair at all and to solve this problem you have to do a better job of aligning your employees incentives and your incentives so that they are more there's an account right here on TikTok Madeline Pendleton is the creator she runs a business where all the employees including herself the owner are paid the same based salary I think it's like $75,000 and I think they adjust this regularly to keep up with costs of living but what this does is first of all it says in a powerful way more than words could do we me the owner and you the employee are just as important to the success of this business not only that but they also have an unlimited time off policy a policy that more than words can do puts people over profit and some owners maybe like the boss at my last company would say this is not fair I take a disproportionate share of the risk and therefore I'm entitled to moral of the reward or uh why would anyone start a business in a context where they're not gonna earn as much but here's the kicker this business is not only quite profitable but the employees are more committed they stay longer and so the overhead cost the cost related to churn go way down this business though it doesn't pay the owner as much on a salary line is far more profitable far more scalable far more sustainable than a business where the incentives are not aligned where there is a big gap between the earners and there is an opportunity for dissatisfaction disengagement to be cultivate in the age of information in the age where people are upset about what's going on in the economy we're absolutely gonna need solutions like this that can help us increase salaries keep up with the cost of living and find more satisfaction in our job if you've got other examples of this kind of thing if you have questions about this leave them in the comments I look forward to continuing the discussion",

    "voice_to_text": "I've literally sat and watched stitches to this all morning I've been laying in bed going ah should I should I post one of these and I was like no I don't really do this on TikTok but I thought it was time I got some crazy lifelong haunting experiences um some of them are like things that I've been told that happened to me but then most of it is things I can recount and I physically experience um probably the scariest that I remember so like this really being like holy shit um we just moved from London to Portsmouth and we moved into my arm because not haven't got a house here yet my mum still working in London and um she was commuting cause she works in theatre she was commuting back and forth and um I was like 15 at the time so you know you laying off trying to stay on your phone as late as you can speak to your friends and my mum would come into my room to check I was asleep when she got back cause it'd be like midnight and I you know phone on the pillow pretend to be asleep and um this one night uh I heard the downstairs door open the front door someone coming upstairs someone coming across the landing my bedroom door opening and me like you know that panic on your DS under your pillow the sheer fear that's like shit phone on the pillow sends me asleep door opens and then there's no movement at all it's like quiet and I'm like oh that's weird maybe she's on her phone at the door and like just I don't know replying someone may sound like that and then I hear steps towards the base of my bed and then it stops again and then I'm like oh this is so weird you should come around the side of my bed and like gives me a kiss on the head whatever and then nothing like silence for probably I'm laying there for about a minute eyes closed like I wish you can come around and sit on my bed now and then next thing you know my bed sheets get ripped off of me like from the base the base of the um the duvet is pulled clean off and onto the floor and I instantly I sit up and I'm like what are you doing and it's it's a figure just a dark figure probably no taller than like a little old woman like that kind of size if you can sort of picture in your head um I sit up and go what you doing and it just disappears my bedroom door still open and my sheets are on the floor and I'm just like what has happened here what is going on um yeah really weird but I then consult to my mum about it the next day and I said this happened last night this is really weird I was like did you do did you come to my room at all last night she went oh no I just came straight to bed I got back later than usual whatever I was like ah okay well that's not reassuring at all so I tell her what I saw and she goes oh that's really weird because when you were younger so this is the things obviously I was 6 months old whatever at the time when you were younger but after you were born uh in our house we lived in London you if you walked up the stairs you could see through the banister into her room and I was in a cot at this point so I I could have been older than older than a year right I was asleep in my car and she walk upstairs does a little turn and sees what she thought was my dad over my car watching me sleep and she goes my dad's name and then no reaction no response nothing and she was oh that's that's weird why why is he not responding so she walks across the landing into her room and there is no one in there but she says it's it what you described that ritual covers off is the same thing that I saw 16 years ago in your room and that house we lived in London was haunted as anything like there was definitely something connected to that house and we had a priest blessing and stuff I'm sure if people care I'll make a entire another thing about that and then it was the only other thing that happened to me in this house is I had like an out of body experience it sounds so fake but this is kind of the pointless story is had an out of body experience in the same room maybe 2 weeks after this spirit incident and um I literally I was dreaming and next thing you know I woke up I was on top of the wardrobe in this room watching myself sleep which was surreal I was like oh this is a dream right and then I realised that it wasn't quite a dream I was watching myself and I could climb down from the wardrobe and I was walking around my house like you know in uh you know in insidious where he's like in that spirit realm and things are the exact same but it's like oh Misty it was kind of like that obviously there's no Misty it was just like pitch black dark in my house but I could see clearly and I was just walking around walking around and then when I got bored I basically got back into my bed and into my body and I woke up and I was like that was really that was strange um yeah after that nothing happened to me um some other little bits happened to my mum but sort of you know again it's sort of nothing's like hearing footsteps and hearing sounds and hearing doors opening and closing stuff um so I I then moved to Manchester um after having nothing happened for about 5 years no experiences or anything after I like spoke to this thing um and I moved into a flat with uh no one at the time I've started working at my new job in the work flat and my friend who I was working with ended up moving in he came us more times another thing that's irrelevant but me and him weren't good enough friends at this point where we sort of discussed anything supernatural spiritual whatever and um he probably been staying with me for about two days and on this on this night I got into bed late like you know what a sleep schedule's like when you've just started a new job nervous and shit and whatever I get into bed and I see this figure sorry I go to sleep I wake up cause I you know when you feel uneasy and you sort of wake up and you can't really figure out what's wrong like you didn't need the toilet you didn't need to drink whatever um I feel uneasy and I roll and I see this figure maybe it's gotta be like 7 foot like just dark not there's like no features nothing it was just like a shadow basically stood over my bed and also because I've had this experience in the past I didn't really hesitate I didn't really flinch or anything so I just thought what a rollover and I'll pretend like he's not there but he can go and sleep cause I got me up early we got film a music video or some shit like whatever whatever we do guys I want to be up for and then the next morning probably about 7:00 my roommate would not wake up anything bro sets alarms and he would sleep through all of them I became his personal alarm as we went on to live together more um he came to my room 7:00am he's like Gabe I've had the maddest maddest dream like he's like you're not gonna believe it cause it's so weird and I was like go on and he's like so I had a dream I was in this flat and um I just heard noises from your room and I was like okay and I I was like when like yesterday and he went yeah yeah like I woke up in the night in my dream and I came into your room and I saw this thing standing over you and it was like slowly slowly getting closer and he's like so I just went in and I started fighting it off and he's like the entire night all I was doing was fighting this thing off your bed and I was like bro I'm getting I'm literally getting my hair is stood up on ends thinking about right now I go you are joking me because we hadn't spoken nothing we we not said a word to each other he'd woken up come into my room straight away woken me up and he's like I saw it and I was like brother where stand where it was he stood in the exact spot but I saw this thing and I went okay so last night I saw this thing blah blah blah and he went oh man he's like I've I had a feeling this was gonna happen like he's such a spooky guy like he's the kind of guy that sees auras and stuff like he's spiritual to the next level but after I was like okay well we're gonna be friends for life now whatever and then we moved into another apartment and then eventually my ex girlfriend moved in with us and we thought nothing of it like me and me and Wes nothing could have happened since then um and also you still have these weird dreams but nothing to do with me cause I was like Bruce saved my life on this occasion and one night uh my girlfriend was at mine and she woke up woke me up in the middle of night saying someone's in the corner of your room can we swap sides of the bed so I can like sleep looking at the wall I was like okay yeah fine whatever and at the time I was like no one's there no one's there but as I was swapping sides you didn't tell the lights or anything I saw the exact same figure that I'd seen probably three or four months ago in my room standing on my bed in the corner of our room it was a tiny room like it it it couldn't have been more than a a meter and a half away from the bed um stood in the corner and again I did the same thing I closed my eyes rolled over pretend it wasn't that wake up and wanted nothing I got asked her about she went yeah really scared me so I just I don't know what to do so we swapped sides I've got a minute left okay and the last thing that happened in this flat that was really sort of the the actually the last time I encountered whatever this spirit was um my room is so small so I couldn't have any of my setup in there um so I was in the living room playing my games and watching TV and stuff and one night my flatmate goes to bed my ex girlfriend go to bed and I play like FIFA or some shit whatever I leave the room and at the end of the corridor by my roommate's room was the same figure but my the lights were on in the hallway so I could sort of gauge that it was a person and immediately I went back to the living room play some more games and then sacked off into the morning and I told him about it and he's like oh bro this is so weird like there's a lot going on I've literally run out of time so there's probably about 20 other stories I could tell people care I might not even post this you know",

And I tried to appeal, and they said it still went against it and it would not be restored. And now it has a warning if I can't even introduce myself. That makes it very demotivating to make something, you know, it's kind of depressing. Not to mention the fact that they do not give any information on what is wrong with it, what community guidelines it went against, like, what I need to fix to get it, uh, to stay off. I don't get it. I don't get it. But, TikTok, please, in the future, if something goes against your community guidelines and you take stuff down, put in the reason what it is that is going that is gotten it taken down and what guidelines it goes against. Because now I'm left clueless with a warning for something I don't know what was wrong with and with something that I don't know what to change about to fix it, because you guys do not give any information on what it is that is wrong with it. Because you make it very difficult for creators. So be more clear. Like, do not just put in, yeah, it went Against community guidelines. No. Put in the actual reason like this. And this is what went against community guidelines. This is something that we don't want here. Like. Cause I've read through the list and I can't seem to. Like. In the community guidelines and I can't seem to find the reason why it was taken down.",

    "voice_to_text": "Grandma, how did you and my granddaddy meet each other? Maybe your granddaddy just picked me up from middle school one day. I've been watching these videos, and this triggered a story, a conversation that I had with my great aunt before she passed away. She was a beautiful woman. She was breathtakingly gorgeous. I wish I had a picture of her that I could share. She's stunning. And she told me she got married at 15 years old. And she lived in a small town called Hugo, Oklahoma. And the man she married was 32 years old, around in his 30s. And she told me that he would beat her. He was very violent. And she said she worked and cleaned this white woman's house. And every time she got paid, she would sell money, just a little bit of the money under her dress, under the lining of her dress, so that she could save up enough money to leave him. And she was able to do that. So she gathered what money she had sold under her. Her dress, her lining of her dress. And she took my, um. My aunt, she's technically my cousin, but I call her my aunt cause she's older. And she. She got her together and they ran off to Oklahoma City. And in Oklahoma City, she met her second husband. And thank god, he was a great man who. They fell in love. And he treated her amazing. Let me tell you how Amazing. He treated her while they're married. She never had to work. And he bought the entire block. He bought every home on the block. And when he passed away, he passed away years before she did. He left her all the homes on the block, and she never had to work, and she just collected rent checks up until she died. So it had a happy ending. And she always spoke very positively about her second husband. She said she loved him. He was a good man. But it was heartbreaking to hear what happened to her. 15, and she wasn't nonchalant about the story, and it still triggered her up until her old age. But I. I think I was more stunned. Like, I was kind of like, uh. And, you know, she's just telling me the story of how he was. She said he was. He was a mean man. He would beat her. Um, but that's how she got away. She. She was so. A little bit of money. Not enough for him to notice, but enough for her to collect and to get away. But I'm happy that her story ended well.",

    "voice_to_text": "what's the craziest thing you've done when you've had a crush on someone I'll go first one time literally let my relationship with the Lord fade away yeah so let's bring it back I was 19 years old I was talking to this guy he was a bad boy like let's really let's really put it like he was a bad boy rode a motorcycle was just really known for being kind of a shithead but I liked it I'm like period I could literally change him that was my first red flag like me even thinking that I could change a man who didn't even wanna be changed like girl why are you trying ha ha why are you literally at this point in my life I was really young like I was emotionally very um unexperienced like I never been cheated on I've never been really significantly hurt I've only like hurt myself in relationships like breaking up with someone like I've never ever like actually had some damage done to me so you know my trust issues non existent I was very trusting I was like so so so easily you know I was just an easy going girlfriend this relationship was very promiscuous and scandalous and sneaky from the jump because we didn't tell like anybody that we were seeing each other because it was like oh my gosh like we were both low key talking to other people while we were like talking because we were single and yeah we just we were so sneaky and like that's another red flag that I didn't really take into consideration cause I'm like it's fine like it's scary or it's scandalous and it's fun and exciting like who cares you know like it's so boom we started dating okay surprise everyone's like oh I didn't know yeah we're dating now and then he takes me home two months later to meet his family in Arizona literally two months into date that's another red flag I did not consider like at all okay now this man was an atheist okay and one thing about me is I don't I can't date anything other than a man of god like I should have known that but let me tell you my relationship with the Lord was not as strong as it is now so I was not even paying attention to the religious or like spiritual aspect of things but he was a lost soul looking for a host it felt like like he needed someone to just latch on so I took him in and I'm like let me change you I can help you I can be that light in your life cause I knew that he had bad blood with religion bad blood with god like he just didn't care he didn't wanna make any mens to his relationship with the Lord and it was like I wanted to help him I wanted to be that person in his life that was like no you can change it's okay the Lord is good you know but of course he didn't wanna hear that so I just left it alone and leaving him alone with his relationship with his relationship with the Lord I left mine alone too I was more infatuated with this bad boy that I was in love with in love I really liked and I think I was more in love with like the thrill of it more than him himself I just remember being so drained and like emotionally drained spiritually drained physically drained like everything drained out of me being with this man that I didn't even like understand what it was what was actually happening to me he had so many demons that were latched onto me after we had started dating and I didn't even girl I didn't comprehend it until after the relationship was soul ties are so real and it took me so long to break free from his likes like for so flash forward after we met his family 2 months into dating we actually keep dating for like a good 5 months I go on TTY and he cheats on me he literally literally cheats on me I never saw this coming I'm telling you never been cheated on before never ever had my heart broken I was like so so faithful to this man and let me check I was on TTY with a bunch of infantry guys and they were literally trying me and I was curbing every single one of them because I was so faithful in my relationship I was so faithful to someone who was not faithful to me and that's so sad so once I found out he cheated on me I actually remembered my words and I'm like goodbye you're you're actually done like everything started coming back to my senses started coming back to me I was like I'm not numb anymore like I'm starting to understand like I'm not blinded by love anymore like I'm aware and you're a piece of shit literally and I vividly remember my dad even calling me up angry with me because I'm dating this guy who's an atheist who doesn't line up with my morals he's disappointed in me he's like Anna this guy is so bad for you like what are you doing he's literally dead in the eyes and you can't see that like what's wrong like you need to let him go like he was so concerned for me he was so sad that I was with this guy who is completely eating me a lot so me and my dad stopped talking and my dad if you know me like he's literally my world so like I'm like it's my me and my dad aren't talking me and the Lord don't talk either like I don't talk to the Lord I don't really care at this point you know he's just there you know I know he's still there but he like we just don't talk like the relationship wasn't you know and I'm getting sex dry you know what I'm saying so that was all happening during the relationship and I knew it was wrong but I just couldn't leave and that's when that Soul Tie hits let me tell you it's real toxic but now I'm with a man of god who loves Jesus just as much as I do and it's so nice like it's so beautiful to have grown from being so hurt back then and feeling so miserable to being in a relationship where we can openly openly talk about Jesus and god and the love that he has for us and talk about scripture and reading the Bible together like these things are what I've longed for you know what I'm saying and now I'm finally with someone who loves Jesus just as much as me and it's it makes my heart full and that's how it's supposed to be I was never supposed to be with that guy I was never supposed to be with that weirdo bad boy cause he was a weirdo looking back weirdo written all over him but I didn't care cause I was like so like oh my gosh like in love why didn't it stop but anyways that's my story time I hope you guys liked it I really hate talking about that situation cause it was so damaging to me and it took me years to heal from but I'm finally I'm okay and the trust issues low key there but it's okay I've I've become more aware of my significant others and I it made me a stronger woman and I'm grateful that it happened because you know it it really shaped me into the woman that I am today",

    "voice_to_text": "so do I have a story for you I'm an American living in Japan so I have done the 10 to 14 hour flight from the States to Japan many many times and I know who the worst person to sit next to on the plane was so back around Christmas I was on my flight to Japan and I just sat down there was a man sitting next to me probably in his early thirties this man was very very friendly and he immediately struck up a conversation with me and because I'm not rude I talked to him for a little bit about some random stuff after a while I'm like okay how much longer do I have to talk to this guy because he's not stopping and he's starting to ask some like invasive questions and so I just I'm like okay have a good flight and then put my headphones on because I'm like please I mean not don't talk to me mode don't talk to me clearly I don't wanna talk right now so I put on my headphones and then I see him rummaging around in his bag and I'm like oh he's gonna pull out his headphones we're gonna both have our headphones on we're not gonna talk and we have come to a terms of agreement and we have come to an agreement this man like while he's pulling out this thing from his back like hits me and at first I thought it was an accident like maybe just pulled too hard but then he hit me again like he's like tapping my arm and I turned to him and like pull my headphones off I'm like yeah? and this man has pulled out a Polaroid camera keep in mind this is like an 8:00AM FLIGHT I'm exhausted I just said goodbye to my family I'm no makeup on messy hair like ball cap airport fashion and this man goes \u201cdo you wanna take a picture?\u201d no, no I don't wanna take a freaking PICTURE do I LOOK like I wanna take a picture? the woman was too stunned to speak so me again feeling like I had to be polite was like oh no I'm sorry I'm not in any place to take a picture right now but cool camera though and then he's like oh, well I'll give it to you like I'll just take a picture of you and give it to you I was like no I really don't need one thank you though and for the rest of the flight this man was trying to connect with me in any possible way he could like every time the food came around or the drinks came around he just got whatever I got the woman asked me what do you wanna drink and I say oh do you guys have ginger ale yeah I was okay then I'll get a ginger ale please the man next to me go I have a ginger ale while like looking at me expectantly like I'm gonna be like oh that's crazy! we like the same thing and not like that's freaking creepy, what ?? by the way mentioning this a little late In the story but this man reeked of alcohol like I'm pretty sure that man was very drunk on the plane and he was chugging from a mint green Stanley Cup and I'm fairly certain that it was whiskey also by coincidence I had a friend who was on the same exact flight but it was too late for us to get the seats next to each other so we're sitting separately at the end of the flight so at the end of the flight when we're getting off the airplane and walking through the airport together I'm like oh my god this guy next to me was so creepy like he was so weird the whole time he was copying everything I ordered he was talking to me he was taking up all this space trying to get close to me and she's like oh my god I know you're talking about when I walked by you I noticed him many times and I was like what do you mean what was he doing she said that this man was staring at me and my phone screen for most of the flight every time she walked by me this man was staring at me full frontal I've also sat next to Japanese men who just like straight up take off their shoes and socks on the plane and then like sit cross legged so their foot is like very close to eye level trust me singers are not the worst people to be put next to on the plane nor are children it's gross men",

I accidentally went on a date with my manager once. Uh, let me tell you what happened. So I used to work on cruise ships, and I was on this thing called portmaning, which is when you're in port and you can't get off the ship, and you work all day, but then you have the evening off, and usually the whole team goes out for dinner afterwards. So my manager's like, do you wanna go out for dinner after work? I was like, yeah, that sounds great. Uh, it was formal night, so finish work, I go back to my cabin, put on a really pretty dress, and go to the restaurant. My manager turns up. He's in a full tuxedo. Tell he's clearly made an effort. I was like, where's the rest of the team? He's like, he didn't ask anyone else. I got tricked. I was on a date with my manager on a floating boat in the middle of the ocean. Nothing I could do. I just had to roll with it. Couldn't say, I've got to get back for the dog. That's not a thing. So, yeah, good times.",

So, I was at the gates where this ghost infamously runs through these gates and disappears and I decided I was gonna do an EVP. I was a ghost hunter at the time when I was 15 I would you know go to cemeteries and do Evps and I decided to do one at Resurrection Cemetery. So, I start the voice memo and I respectfully asked a bunch of questions related to Mary. I wanted to contact Resurrection Mary that was the plan and start asking a bunch of questions you know what is your name how did you pass away do you need help questions like that I don't see anything I don't hear anything but I get this deep intuition that something just isn't right\u2026 and I ran to the car and my dad said did you catch anything and I said no I was a little bummed out but he's like play back the recording so we do and after the question what is your name it says don't ask. In this deep angry demonic voice it was horrifying I didn't sleep after that and it was the end of my ghost hunting career. it will forever haunt me hopefully actually not haunt me but it freaked me out and there is a lot of stories that I have about my ghost hunting experiences but this one will forever stick with me I'd love to hear your ghost stories in the comments below and have a great day but remember to always say goodbye",

    "voice_to_text": "if you're ever thinking about driving a car without car insurance take it as a lesson for me and never do that shit when I was in college I got an internship and I needed a car to get to where my internship was and I talked to my parents I said guys I need a car like there's no way I can take the bus or walk to this internship it's way too far it's not convenient like I need a car and they're like Michael you don't need a car you can figure it out then I wore them down to the point where they were like okay you do kind of need a car but 1 it has to be from Facebook Marketplace and two as be under $1,000 and I was like okay perfect so I go scroll on Facebook Marketplace and I find this beat up 2001 Volvo old as hell hatchback with a cassette player and I'm like what am I gonna do with the cassette player I didn't do anything with it I bring it up to my parents and they're like okay fine this works they love all those because it's like safe or whatever and we meet up with the lady get the car done deal and then my dad's like okay you have the car but what's your plan for car insurance because you can't drive without car insurance and I was like oh I actually didn't have a plan I thought you guys were gonna help me with that for like the first month cause like I have no money I'm waiting on my last paycheck from vans cause I've been working there and I'm going back to school in the fall like I just don't have any money right now and they're like okay well we're not paying for that so you have to figure it out and I was like okay fuck you're right like give me a couple days and let me come up with the plan so a couple days roll around and on this particular day my parents are leaving for work for the entire day and it's like in the morning I'm bored at home and I'm like you know what I'm gonna go and have myself a day at the Stanford Mall and if you know the Stanford Mall yes it's right next to Stanford University but it's a vibe and a half like there's so much to do there's this whole strip of restaurants called University Avenue and I was like yeah let me Kiki no money to my name I'm just gonna have you know a day of fun so that's exactly what I did I drove the 25 30 minute drive to Stanford Mall and I was like we out to have a good time I window shopped I went to lemonade if you were there in 2014 you remember it was a cultural phenomenon I grab myself a little drink and I just hung out with myself and the afternoon rolls around and I'm like okay I need to get home before my parents get home so they don't realize that I've taken this car without car insurance but there were two things in my plan that I wasn't prepared for one being that I had never driven on a highway because I was too scared and the only driving experience I had was preparing for my driver's test which was like six months ago so I could get my driver's license and I hadn't driven since other than that morning so the other thing was that it was rush hour and that it was very busy and I was like okay I need to get home but it's gonna take me longer than I thought so I'm just gonna take El Camino and if you don't know El Camino it's this long street that goes from the Bay Area all the way down to LA and it's just a straight shot with like stop lights along the way okay let me just take that so I'm taking El Camino and the sun is in my eyes I'm looking at my phone for the maps there's so much traffic this is rush hour and all of a sudden I rear end this lady I look up and she jumps her Bob goes flying I'm so mortified that I just hit somebody without car insurance and she looks completely frazzled she turns her blinker on and goes into the nearest parking lot and I follow her in she comes out of her car and she's like okay let's exchange information and I was like yes yes I would love to but I don't have car insurance and she was like what do you mean you don't have car insurance and I was like yeah I just don't have it and she's like okay well and then she tells me that this was her brand new Mercedes that she got a few days ago and I was like are you fucking kidding me like out of all the cars I could hit on the road I hit a fucking Mercedes that she just got like bitch I would be pissed too and I was like so what are we gonna do and she was like what are we gonna do what are you gonna do you have two options here either we can call the police or you can call your parents and figure this out and I was like okay girl like there's no reason to get law enforcement involved like what's the police gonna do here this isn't a hit and run let's work on this from a human human level I'm still here I'm ready to make this work and she was like okay then call your parents so I sit down on the curb head in my hands I'm shaking I am so scared that I have to call my parents so I call my dad and he picks up and he's like what's up and I'm like okay so I just hit this lady I rear ended her and he's like why are you driving a car and I'm like okay like I just wanted to have a little day fun like sorry sue me like I'm just a boy and he's like okay like just get her information and come home right now like don't make any stops and I was like okay I will so I get her information she's like okay just like text me and I'll let you know how much the damage is and we can work it out after I was like okay so I get home and my dad is like what is your plan to pay this lady back like we're not bailing out of this you have to figure it out on your own like this car is your responsibility and you chose to drive without car insurance I know I know let me think like I still need to see how much this damage is gonna be literally an hour later she texts me she's like so it's gonna be 16 hundred dollars girl I didn't even bend that fender like it was a tiny little crack like don't come at me with the sixteen hundred dollar Bill but sixteen hundred dollars here it was then I remember this little loophole and I was like okay here's what I'm gonna do if you remember from one of my last videos I said that my dad gave me two things if I went to the military college that he wanted me to go to one being a car which I got and two was $2,000 towards a road trip that I was planning on doing my friends cross country which I hadn't done yet so I was like okay I'll take a thousand dollars from this 2,000 dollar road trip fund and I will use my 300 dollar paycheck that I'm getting from vans my last paycheck and then I went to my mom was like hey girl like can you please spot me this 300 and I'll pay you back like I have an internship lined up I will be paying you back like don't worry you can trust me and she's like okay like fine so that's what we do and I meet up with this lady's husband in front of the Orange Theory Fitness at Redwood City and I'm like okay here is a sixteen hundred dollars and her husband was like thank you so much for being so timely and being so like honest and everything and I was like oh yeah of course he's like but never drive without car insurance ever again like you're insane for that they could have been much much worse and so we say our goodbyes and that was that but because of this incident I had this whole panicked episode of reevaluating everything in my life like everything and one of those things was my relationship social media and I don't know why I felt the need to do this but I wrote this very dramatic Selena Gomez ass story um in my notes app and I posted it to my socials and I just deleted every social and I got so many DMs like Michael like is everything okay like what's wrong and I look back in my notes app to see if I still had it and I did so let's have a read let me know if you guys can find a correlation between me rearending some lady and that post because I still don't know to this day why I posted that I was just overwhelmed I guess so yeah please do not drive without car insurance it could have been much worse like I can totally see that I completely understand how much worse it could have gotten and I'm just grateful every day that um all I did was hit her Mercedes from the back like yeah don't fucking drive without car insurance",

    "voice_to_text": "Here are a list of all the movies the Pentagon oversaw and contracted with Hollywood. On those who don't know, the Pentagon has a department of Defense Entertainment Media Office. From their website, The DOD Entertainment Media Office supports studios, production companies, producers, directors, etc. In the production of both scripted and unscripted films. According to the documentary theaters of war, the US DOD does not just subtly influence Hollywood's depiction of US wars to present them in a more favorable light. The Pentagon actively demands script oversight and dictate storylines. Practice it has been waging a full spectrum propaganda war on western audiences. Pentagon's objections usually relate to any suggestion of military incompetence or war crimes. Back in 2013, Doctor Steffan Underhill of Marshall University filed with the freedom for Information Act to obtain all the movies that the Pentagon has supervised on. Some of them were surprising. I'm going to list them page by page. Feel free to take screenshots.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the video that I posted about getting a bad grade got a lot of people talking in the comment section. I've also seen a lot of stitches on this. In support of setting standards for your kids, why don't we get ready together? Well, I talk about our strict rules. Number one, my kids need to read at least 30 minutes a day, even on the weekends. We have seen that kids simply cannot read. Seventh graders are reading at a third grade level, and high schoolers are reading at a sixth grade level every single day. That is a must. Number two is no phones allowed in your bedroom. This only really applies to my oldest, but if you need to make a phone call, you can do that downstairs in another room. I do not want your phone in your room. So we do no screen time Monday through Thursday. So no phone unless you need to call a friend. And no TV. Kids are so busy with homework, after school activities, dinner anyway, that there's really no time. Obviously in the summer that changes. And when they do get screen time, we do set limits on that as well. Hour on the phone maximum. Of course, TV is a little over two hours if they're watching a movie. Do not allow our kids to use their phones or ipads at restaurants at all. This was a really hard one to let go of when we did Allow our kids to bring devices into restaurants. They displayed zombie like behaviours. Screen time free for over two years. And it has made such a big difference. And actually have conversations. We can laugh, we can talk. And I wanna make it very clear that this doesn't apply for every kid, but this is what worked for us. And the last strict rule for us. While it might be controversial, you are absolutely hundred percent expected to do well in school. And if they are struggling, we will absolutely help them with what they need to succeed. Of course, every kid is different, and I'm sure there are challenges along the way. But we know that our kids are very capable of doing well in school. And this is what works for us. I hope this was helpful. Love you guys.",

You can go into Target, Walmart, Sephora, Ulta. You can even go into five fucking below, bitch, and find your shade.

    "voice_to_text": "who was the elementary school teacher who had beef with you for no reason I'll go first and before people get mad at me for shitting on teachers I was a teacher for five years so shut your trap my second grade teacher hated me and she let me know she straight up told me that I was her least favourite student first of all like every other second grader on the planet I was seven years old when I started in her class I am very very tall and I've always been one of the if not the tallest person in my class by several inches and in second grade I was a full head taller than the next tallest person in my grade but like it said on all of my paperwork that I was born in 1999 I was seven years old when I started her class she did not believe me she thought I was like way older than I was she constantly put these expectations on me to be way more mature than the average seven year old every morning we would come into class and she would give us a morning assignment to do and one morning I came in and she had accidentally given me a different assignment than she gave everybody else in the class it was there on my desk so I started working on it and this woman barges over to my desk rips the paper out from under me that I'm working on and is like what are you doing and I was like I'm working on my homework and she was like do you see look around you what is everybody else working on look with your eyes Emily like makes me look around and she's like what is everybody else working on are you working on that and I'm like you never gave me a how am I supposed to be working on what everybody else is working on if you didn't give me a fucking paper I can't hold my pens correctly and I'm ambidextrous and so I hold my pens like this and I would switch between my left and my right hands when I was writing this woman would not let me use my left hand for anything and if she saw me holding my pencil wrong she would come and grab my hand and force me to hold it like this one time part way through the school day I started running a fever but I didn't really know that that's what a fever was cause I was like 7 years old I just thought I was really cold so I went over to my coat rack put on my winter coat and she made me take it off because winter coats weren't appropriate to be worn in the classroom as I was like shivering and I was like um I don't feel very well can I go to the nurse's office and she yelled at me for trying to get out of whatever we were doing and so I looked at her and then just profusely vomited everywhere like all over the front of the classroom all over the carpet all over everything and she just looked at me and was like go to the nurse but like the way our school was built was really weird so all of these campuses were all spread out and I had to like walk all the way across campus where like the middle school was to go to the nurse's office and I was like seven and I didn't know where anything was because I was fucking 7 so I was just lost wandering around the school campus vomiting and then a teacher came and was like what the fuck are you doing and I was like my teacher sent me to the nurse's office cause I'm throwing up but I don't know where it is one time there was this girl named Kayla she bullied me so bad in second grade she was so mean she was so mean she made my life hell she was like one of the main reasons why I switched schools after second grade because she was so mean and my teacher my teacher had her leave the classroom so that she could call me out in front of my entire second grade classroom and berate me you're bullying her because I tried to tell a teacher that she was bullying me and nobody would do anything about it so I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to trip her I was my master plan I was gonna trip her and show her who was boss and I got an enormous trouble for that even though she was literally terrorizing me she was threatening to call the cops on me for being weird and my second grade teacher witnessed this behavior every single day and did nothing about it she did not give a fuck because she loved the this girl you have this magnet board where you have like the green yellow and red columns next to your name and if you were bad you'd have to like move your magnet to like the next colour and if it went to the red then you had to stay inside from recess my name was on the red every single day I wouldn't even have to be doing anything I would just be sitting there breathing and she would come over and be like move your magnet Emily you're being an asshole why did you go into this profession if you were going to have such enormous beef with an elementary schooler",

    "voice_to_text": "Target, Walmart, and Amazon have all announced major price cuts moving forward, especially in the grocery sectors. And you all know exactly why that's happening. It's because we're not spending any money. But guess what? We don't have any money to spend. And they caused the situation, and now they're facing the consequences of the situation, and they fully expect that we're going to start spending money on bullshit again. And I don't think they understand that they literally trained us out of that behavior by raising prices so high that people found ways around shopping. They found ways around. They're all hoping that by lowering costs on all these main items, like bread, milk, diapers, that they're going to bring their profit margins back up to what they were before. And again, the fact that all of these places, Amazon, Target, Aldi, Walmart, they all have the ability to lower the cost because it never had anything to do with inflation or production costs. It was greed. End of story. So I hope that everyone really digests that and understands that we have always just been drained of our life. For us there, they've always. All of these companies, all of corporate America, all of capitalism. The point is to drain you of your resources. Not just your money, but also your life force, and then leave you with nothing in the end. Make sure that your kids have nothing in the end. So many people are not even Able to own homes. And none of these businesses would have had any mercy on us unless we had gotten to this precipice where people are completely out of money. And still they think they're gonna be okay. They think that they're not going to have to lower their prices back down to what they were before. But again, here's the thing. We have gone past the point of no return. The amount of debt in this country now is up into the trillions. People have their credit cards completely maxed out. So it's not like people are making a decision not to buy more groceries and not to buy more bullshit. They simply cannot. And so the major upside of this is we will get to watch a lot of these companies pay huge consequences for their grade",

Yeah. Oh, hold on. It's a exactly like that. Tell me, you're, like, the most amazing multitasker on the planet, or did you. Or do you have, like, bed sores? What? I didn't hear you. He was saying. He was saying, were you multitasking, doing two things at once, or were you just sitting, like, you have bed sores from sitting still for so long? Well, the only thing I do to, like, multitask is, like, I'll watch the show, but I'll, like, be playing a game on my phone, keep my hands busy. But it's, like, one thing. But I watched the whole show. I've seen it twice, but the first time I watched it, I watched it all in exactly 30 days. That's like, holy moly. That's like eight episodes a day. Yeah, for 30 days straight. Actually, the first time everybody, my friends watched it, they told me Castiel was in season 4. So I sat through, and in the matter of you skip that season, I. Nobody told me, like, who it was. I was just like, oh, that's cool. New character. So I sat down, and then I pulled an all nighter. I watch season 3 that whole day, 4 overnight, and then 5 the next day. I just was kind of Wondering what your guys favorite, like, TV show was. Wow. I can't compete with that. Nobody can. Um. That's amazing. That's it. That's. Jesus. Not even mad. That's impressive. Impressive. The whole block of cheese. Wow. Are there any. What. What would you rewatch? Did you rewatch any of just the episodes or do you. If you wanna watch an episode from season 6, you like, damn, gotta go back to one and watch all the way through. I actually have done that. I was like, man, I really wanna see season 7 again. And then I started from one all the way up to 7. You are a professional binge watcher. That's is awesome. Is there a way to make money out of that? Is there like, career in. Oh, no. You could be like the ultimate test audience for Netflix. I should? Yeah, you should apply to Netflix. I'll do that.",

And there's a lot of people of all types saying that it's all. It's grumpy old white tattooers that are being mean to people from my experience. Uh, because I pay attention in the city, I tattooing where outside of our shop, we have all types of tattooers. Male, female, white, black, Hispanic, the full game. But I'm noticing something and we're gonna set it up with a story time. Last week a client came in and one of the small tattoo behind the ear, little Pinteresty shit is gonna take like 5, 10 minutes. And the artist who was available besides me, for whatever reason, who had not tattooed all day, decided they didn't wanna do it. And that is completely fine. But I stood up and was like, I'll do it. Mind you, I had been tattooing for six and a half hours before this. Because Mama didn't raise no bitch. I don't think you're a bitch. Dean. I love you. I know you're gonna see this. You wanna guess what happened the next day? Get a message from that client who wanted a tattoo in a style that I fucking love. Multi session, half sleeve, like two, three grand. So I don't think it's got shit to do with age, race, sex, any of that shit. We got a bunch of Picky motherfuckers who think they're too good to do a certain type of tattoo. And then they wanna wonder why they're fucking clients aren't walking through the door. I said what I said. I hope your fucking feelings are hurt. Have the day you deserve.",

So before me and my husband even got married, we decided we're not having any kids. We're gonna be the rich auntie and uncle. We're gonna travel the world. Absolutely no children. So six months before we got married, I got next one on. You know that birth control that goes in your arm? So we get married, everything's going good, we're doing what we said we was gonna do. We're traveling, we're living our best lives. And then one day, about six months later, I'm at work, and I'm feeling weird. I'm starting to spot. And my coworker was like, if you're spotting, that means you're pregnant. And I'm like, you don't know what you're talking about. But just in case you do, let me go to Walmart and get this little pregnancy test. So I go to Walmart, take this test, this is Saturday, and it said I was pregnant. And I was like, no way. My husband's like, you got that stick in your arm. Like, there's no way you're pregnant. And I'm like, for real? And so it was, like, midnight, and I'm, like, contemplating. I'm like, what are we gonna do? And so I was like, let's just take another test. Maybe that one was wrong. So we go spend, like, $300 at Walgreens. All them tests said yeah. And I was like, there's no way. There's still no Way I'm still in denial. So the next day, what I do? I go to urgent care. What do? I go to urgent care. There's like, girl, what do you want? And I'm like, I don't. I don't. I don't know. Please just tell me something. Then they said, well, just because the P test said yeah, the blood test could say no. And I was like, okay, well, let's do that. They take a P test for me there. That one said, yeah, too. And I was like, there's still no way. I'm still in denial. And so they said, okay, we'll call you with the results tomorrow. So they call me the next day, and I. My doctor said, okay, you wanna come in? I come in. The doctor said, yeah, that test said. The blood test said yeah, too. And I was like, okay, well, what are we gonna do? And she's like, well, we need to see how far along you are, because people don't usually get pregnant on this next one on, like, we need to see if it's probably in your tube, because people don't get pregnant on this. So she sent me over to the hospital. They had one appointment left that day. I go, they put the stuff on my belly, and they're like, yeah, there's a head, there's a leg. I'm like, why? You can see a lot for only be, like, a month long? They're like, there's a penis. I Was like, you can see that this early? That's so crazy. This was June 9th. And they're like, oh, what do you mean, a month? They're like, girl, you are due September 14th. I had, like, 14 weeks to prepare for my child. Yeah. So that was that. And he will be 10 soon. Yeah.",

And then they look at the patients chart to see why you can't do it, and then, oh, boop, boop, boop for diagnosis, you're pregnant. That's why you can't take that patient. This is something that I have always detested, and I felt that this just makes you entirely vulnerable, especially in this time when women have no choice. I remember when it happened to me. I remember when it's happened to my friends. It's just one of those things in medicine that because it doesn't affect the other half of the population, it's never gonna be cared about. Privacy and nursing doesn't exist for the nurses because we're just service. We're not actual people.",

    "voice_to_text": "So a couple years ago, my wife gave me a ancestry membership, or whatever it was she gifted. It was for my birthday, right? She gave that to me. And, um, you know, I did the DNA swap, you know, all of that. Sent the information in. Yes, my DNA is out there, whatever it is, what it is, I didn't get that. So anyway, so I did a DNA swap and like, literally forgot about it. Uh, we have a three year old now. He's three. And, you know, she asked me, and this was like after a couple years or something like that. She was like, hey, whatever happened with the ancestry thing? And I'm like, I don't know. And mind you, don't quote me on the exact time. I know it was a significant amount of time that went past. It was at least a year that went past of me not even paying attention to the thing at all. So she's like, what, what happened with that DNA thing, you know, for ancestry? I'm like, I don't know. She's like, well, you should check it or whatever, you know, we got this little dude, want him to be able to know information, things like that. So I log into ancestry and I go through and, you know, they have your matches, right? Your DNA matches. So, for instance, you know, you are 50% of your father, 50% of your mother, right? So if you have an Uncle or aunt, that would mean they be about 12 25%, right? And if your uncle or your aunt has a child, that'll be about twelve and a half percent. I hope you guys are following me. So your first cousin is like twelve and a half percent of your DNA. Okay. Um, so I look at the DNA match list and I see two women first, and I'm like, man, whatever. This stuff is fake. Like, I have no clue who they are at all. Never heard of them. Right? But the third person on the list, I knew that name. And I was like, hold the hell on. This is my brother from my mother. This is his son. I said, so, hmm, if he's third on my list, who the hell are these other two women that are above him? So I went ahead and, you know, message both the women. And the person that was number two on my list, she got back to me and she was like, you know what? I wouldn't have even entertain this at all. But you are the second person on my list. And I know you're somebody because I actually found a brother on here a year ago, and you're the one right, right behind him. So I know that you're super close. Now, keep in mind, never heard of this person ever. So we go through messaging, back and forth, call, trying to figure this out, trying to Figure that out. Trying to figure names out because I didn't have a lot of names. And, you know, I'll get to that story, you know, at some point. Come to find out we're the same age, but. Come to find out she's my niece from a sister that I never met. Wow. The ancestry stuff is. Say what you wanna say about it, if you don't want your DNA out. I don't know. It's real. It's real.",

and I was gonna sit in the back seat cause his brother was gonna sit in the front seat so I'm like cleaning stuff off the back seat I'm like wait\u2026 whose glasses are these??? and he's like oh I thought they might be yours or like your mom's or something I don't know, he\u2019s like  I noticed those a couple weeks ago and I never thought about it again like I just kind of forgot about it I was like okay like and I really didn't think anything in the beginning cause I'm like I trust him like there's never been any reason not to like he's just not the type to lie to me or you know so you think but he's not the type to lie to me like so I'm like okay like that'd be really weird we tell each other everything like okay so I didn't really think about it too hard I was kinda like okay they're probably my mom my mom does wear glasses and she does have a habit of like leaving things around places so I'm like maybe it is my mom's whatever cause they're just a little like reading glasses they're not like prescription but you know I don't wear these so I'm like okay weird so we go to his mom's birthday dinner and I kinda wasn't thinking anything of it we get back in the car and I'm like you know what like I'm just gonna call my mom and see if they're hers cause in my head I'm thinking like they're definitely probably gonna be my mom's or my sister's but I was thinking my mom okay so after dinner we get back to the apartment and I Facetime my mom like as we're walking up and I'm like hey mom um are these your glasses and she was like no like immediately she's like no why I was like oh cause they were in Brandon's car and we don't know whose they were so we were just like maybe thinking they're yours she's like no those aren't mine I'm like okay thank you and so then I started to get a little worried I'm like okay like I really wasn't thinking he was lying but I'm like now this is kinda weird like I I really thought they were gonna be my mom's so then cause I took his car to my mom's house a couple weeks ago like a month ago so then and he said he noticed them two weeks ago so I'm like okay like maybe that would check out so then I call my little sister so she also wears glasses but hers are prescription so I really didn't think they were hers so I call her I'm like hey Queen um did you lose a pair of glasses and she goes actually yeah I did she's like are they like a tortoiseshell kind of color and I look at them and I was like I think so I was like hold on let me Facetime you and show you as soon as I put the Facetime on she goes oh no she goes those aren't mine I thought you meant sunglasses she goes I lost a pair of sunglasses not these kind of glasses at this point I'm starting to get a little freaked out so I'm like okay I wasn't thinking anything and I like judging by the way he was reacting like I really did not think he was lying like he looked like he was telling the truth but I was kind of like okay this is getting weird at this point like not my mom's not my sisters there's no other girls that are like in his car so I'm hoping you know so then he's like why don't you call Alyssa cause that's one of our couple friends that we hang out with I'm like okay that probably be the only other girl that's like been in the car so I Facetime her I'm like hey I know this is super random are these your glasses and she was like um no she's like I have 20 20 vision I don't wear glasses I was like never she's like nope never wear glasses I'm like okay and then he starts asking me like are you sure they're not yours are you sure they're not yours like you didn't just like buy those for fun or something I'm like no I've literally never seen these before in my entire life so at this point I'm like okay I was believing him but I was also like they had to get there somehow and that's what that's what I kept saying to him like he was like I promise you like I'm just as confused as you are I wanna know who they are like I have no idea and I was like look I'm not saying I don't believe you but at the same time they have to come from somewhere you know what I mean like they had to come from somewhere I'm like did one of your friend's girlfriends get in your car did you take someone home one day I feel like I would know about that if he did that which he's never done that before so I'm like that would be really out of character and weird if I'm like grilling him at this point cause at first I was like kinda making it a joke but I was like no like whose are these like they had to come from somewhere I was like please like rack your brain and think like who else was in your car at all and he's like going through and he's like I swear like the only people that have been in my car are you like any girls he's like you and your mom and sister cause like I said I took his car to my mom's house like a month ago so I'm just like okay it's getting weird I don't know what to do in this situation like do I break up with them like I start thinking like am I gonna have to break up with them over these damn glasses I'm like were these from before we were dating but then I'm like that can't even be possible cause number one we've been dating for over two years so I've never seen this before number two he gets his car washed all the time and he gets like the inside detailed oh like twice a month or once every month so I'm like no we would have seen these glasses before if it was like from before we were dating which that would have been so long ago for these to randomly appear so I'm just like okay what do I do and I'm sitting there and he's over and over I don't know who they are I don't know who they are I don't know who they are then my mom text me and she goes hey ask chase if they're his which that's my brother and she goes I remember him and Brandon went to in N out like a couple weeks ago so just ask him I'm like these are not gonna be my brother's glasses like what these are clearly girl glasses okay you know what I'm just gonna cover all the bases here I text my brother I'm like hey are these your glasses and I send the video they were literally my brother's glasses he said he bought these because his job like at the time on the computer a lot so we just like bought these random pair I think they're like blue light glasses immediately he's like yeah those are mine and then this was like our messages while we're talking about it he's like yeah I get it I would have been pissed too they were dead ass mine I'm sorry I'll buy manlier glasses he goes just Oakley's with the Monster Energy drink from here on out the last person on earth I would have been thinking would be my brother imagine this happening to you and you clearly thinking it's a girl and then it's your

They better not get rid of this app. So apparently they was at home or whatever. Dude had his phone on a charging case on the counter. So she swapped her phone with his phone and went in the bathroom. Let me tell you, that was smart, actually, because he would have thought his phone was just in the same spot and not. It was a switch phone. Let's carry on with the story. She goes through the phone. He was texting a woman. Nothing too serious. She keeps scrolling, and she don't see nothing until she come across a chat with him and his homeboys. And he's his good friends. Like, friends she didn't know that he had since he was little. They've all known each other. She going through the chat, you know. You know, we talking about our friends. Like, you know, people say, don't look through my pictures, don't look through my screenshots, but check that chat between me and my best friend, you know, stuff like that. She was going through the chat to see what the boys had going on. Why? One guy say, I didn't test positive. Didn't test positive for what, my dear? But then her baby daddy and another one was like, I did y'all. They didn't test it. Positive for HIV. I did not expect this plot twist, like, at all. I would have rather it been something going on with the first girl that she seen. But she ain't find nothing. She found something worse. I would have flipped the whole house.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I'm gonna show you how to make prison pizza. There's another prison creator on here, Casey. She keeps calling out Gypsy Rose for a cook off. So here's your cook off. Boo! I'm not Gypsy Rose, but I'm Jennifer. I spent six years in federal prison, and these are my stories of before, during, and after incarceration. Now, one of my favorite things to make was pizzas, but tasted with those crackers was super creative. I'm gonna do something a little bit different. So I've heard that the feds no longer have microwaves, which is a bummer. You're gonna lay your tortilla flat and hit it with a fork on both sides. You wanna make sure you get a lot of holes in it. Pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. In prison, we didn't have pizza sauce, so we would use ketchup and make a sauce. I, I burned it. I burned the first one. You gotta watch it. But look a crisp up. We're gonna try again. Okay, round two. Now, this time I gotta watch it. I was talking and not paying attention. You wanna take it out every, like, 20 seconds and see how it's forming a bubble. You wanna pop that, and you don't want any bubbles. And again, see little bubbles. This step is so important or it will burn like my last one did. So make sure you get all those bubbles out. So this is what you're gonna end up. With you hear that? It's hard. It's like a flatbread pizza. Mix ketchup, Italian seasoning and garlic. Mix it together really well. I like to add a little bit of Velveeta cheese in mine to make it more creamy. I also put a layer of Velveeta cheese on my tortilla before I add my sauce just cause I like it cheesy. Now my toppings of choice are pineapple and pepperoni. You can use whatever you want. We had dried pineapple on commissary. So I would chop them up and do this and then add cheese. You would have to get cheese from the kitchen from one of your hookup. And of course I wasn't recording when I took it out of the microwave. But this is what it looks like. Would you try this? Let me know in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "The images coming out of Rafa right now are so genuinely horrific that I cannot even begin to understand truly how we will ever get the forgiveness of Palestinians. And people say this time and time again that these are the worst images I've seen. These are the worst images I've seen. But for my understanding of the situation currently, this bombing, this latest bombing took place in the Rafa crossing, located in an unretent where thousands, hundreds of thousands, of my understanding of people were sent there, were displaced to this tent. Again, this is UNRA. This is the UN. These are displacement tents that the UN put in place to keep people safe. Right. And those are the areas in which Israel just targeted. Remember all the claims about the babies that the White House has continued to make, even though not the White House necessarily, actually, Joe Biden himself has continued to make, even though now those articles have been disproved, and the White House itself has had to come forward and say that this is not true. I just saw a man carrying a baby, fully baby, and. And that is a image I will never get out of my head. The absolute sanction violence by the United States that we have been seeing take place in Palestine for the last eight months is due to the fact that lies were made about children who were, as well as great victims. These stories have now been debunked, but when you put information like This out into the world, it is very difficult to take it back. And so now we are seeing the ramifications of that. I'm going to strongly, strongly, strongly encourage you to interact with the videos and the images that we are seeing coming out of Rafa right now across all social medias. We have to make these stories, these situations, these horrors so undeniable that everywhere you look, someone is going to see this. Because there are still people today who have no idea what is happening around the world, not only in Rafa, but in the DRC, in Sudan. These are the atrocities that we are forcing upon people. Us in the west, we are forcing this upon people because we continue to put these violent, evil maniacs into office, and then they go and commit these atrocities. We have got to stop this, and we cannot stop fighting for the rights of people all over the world.",

    "voice_to_text": "An Indian American, he realized the only way that he would be accepted at med school would be to pass as black. He chronicled his experiences in his book, Almost Black the True Story of how I got into Medical School by pretending to be black. DJ Joko Choco Ingham joins me now. So you were studying statistics at the university of Chicago, and you say to yourself, I don't stand a chance with my 3.1. What did you do? Well, I shaved my head, I trimmed my eyelashes, and I decided to join the organization of black students so I can apply to medical school as a black man. I also used my middle name, JoJo. I subsequently interviewed at medical schools across the country and, uh, managed to get waitlisted at Washington University and the university of Pennsylvania, then ranked the second and the third and fourth best medical schools in the country and got into, uh, ST. Louis university, uh, school of medicine, despite the fact that my pretty pitiful 3.1 GPA was dramatically lower than their average of, uh, three, uh, 3.7. Now, I want you to process what you just heard. This man basically just said, yeah, I knew my GPA was terrible for what I wanted to do, so what I basically did is I went and pretended I was black, because I know they lower the standards for black people, and I got in somewhere. He was like, this 3.1 GPA is not Gonna cut it for my race, but if I act like a different race, I can have a lower GPA and still get in. Again, this is quite literally them lowering the standard for black people. And what that does is it puts into question if that black person is actually qualified. If you're lowering the standard for black people to get into the school, why aren't you lowering the standard for them to pass classes in the school? Why not have all the test scores similar for the people that get into the school? I think too many schools are now looking to have a diverse skin color within their universities rather than having the best students in their universities. In my opinion, it should be the best students in the universities, not so much focus on their skin color. if you get to the point where you've got a plethora of options and so many, uh, test scores are very similar, then I can maybe see, you know, maybe looking at some diversity at that point. Maybe, but having lower scores for certain races of people, to me, is, uh, discriminatory, and it's playing favorites. And again, it puts in the question the legitimacy of those black students who were going to those universities.",

What I heard is, you remind me of the girls who I really hated my high school because they were cool and I wasn't, and everyone like them and no one likes me. Still applies. It still applies. It still applies. High school is like a. A like. What's the word? Like a controlled environment of what society is like as a whole. Some of y'all will grow up and still be losers, and some people grow up and still be posers. Some people were cool in high school, and we're still cool now. And we can see you being corny the same way we can see you being corny in high school.",

And I think when you feel like you're not getting the respect,   And   I   think   when   you   feel   like   you're   not   getting   the   respect that's when you tend to say comments that come off as hating, right?   when   you   tend   to   say   comments   that   come   off   as   hating   right And that's what a lot of these women are doing   that's   what   a   lot   of   these   women   are   doing is they feel like what we have done for this game,   they   feel   like   what   we   have   done   for   this   game this young player has come into our game   young   player   has   come   into   our   game and she's getting way more respect and all that stuff than we are,   she's   getting   way   more   respect   and   all   that   stuff   than   we   are as she should. The young girl is a baller.   she   should   The   young   girl   is   a   baller The young girl has people watching   young   girl   has   people   watching because of the way she can shoot this basketball.   of   the   way   she   can   shoot   this   basketball Like Steph Curry. Steph Curry can't dunk.   Steph   Curry   Steph   Curry   can't   dunk Steph Curry don't do none of that in the game.   Curry   don't   do   none   of   that   in   the   game He could probably dunk by himself,   could   probably   dunk   by   himself but he don't really do none of that in the game.   he   don't   really   do   none   of   that   in   the   game He is a shooter and fans tune in to see Steph Curry.   is   a   shooter   and   fans   tune   in   to   see   Steph   Curry When I look at Caitlin Clark,   I   look   at   Caitlin   Clark fans are tuning in to watch her.   are   tuning   in   to   watch   her And you know who that's helping?   you   know   who   that's   helping Everybody else is helping the Asia Wilson's is helping everybody else.   else   is   helping   the   Asia   Wilson's   is   helping   everybody   else The plums, all that is helping all of them.   plums   all   that   is   helping   all   of   them The terassies. So y'all should be really thanking her,   terassies   So   y'all   should   be   really   thanking   her embracing her. And that does not mean you guys are not ballers.   her   And   that   does   not   mean   you   guys   are   not   ballers I remember Charles Watson told me, man,   remember   Charles   Watson   told   me   man we walk into this stadium   walk   into   this   stadium and all we see in the stands is offensive jerseys.   all   we   see   in   the   stands   is   offensive   jerseys We see Jones, we see Jennings,   see   Jones   we   see   Jennings we See driver, we see Rogers,   See   driver   we   see   Rogers we see Nelson, we very rarely see Charles Woodson   see   Nelson   we   very   rarely   see   Charles   Woodson and he better than all of us.   he   better   than   all   of   us But that don't mean we not good though.   that   don't   mean   we   not   good   though So just because Caitlin Clark is getting all the attention   just   because   Caitlin   Clark   is   getting   all   the   attention and she's growing the game,   she's   growing   the   game it does not mean you women are not ballers.   does   not   mean   you   women   are   not   ballers You guys are ballers.   guys   are   ballers But I think the way some of them are taking it is like   I   think   the   way   some   of   them   are   taking   it   is   like she's taking all the shine away from us   taking   all   the   shine   away   from   us and taking away from us being ballers.   taking   away   from   us   being   ballers No, you are taking it like that.   you   are   taking   it   like   that People are tuning in.

Clark   has   even   more   eyes   on   you   to   show   that   you   are   like   that So for me, I feel like the young girls   for   me   I   feel   like   the   young   girls taking way too much heat for really helping you guys   way   too   much   heat   for   really   helping   you   guys and growing y'all game.   growing   y'all   game Does that mean y'all had nothing to do with this?   that   mean   y'all   had   nothing   to   do   with   this Absolutely not.   not That is why the young girls owing five because y'all are ballers.   is   why   the   young   girls   owing   five   because   y'all   are   ballers You know what I'm saying? It's nothing to take away from y'all,   know   what   I'm   saying   It's   nothing   to   take   away   from   y'all but growing this game, she was chosen like joy said,   growing   this   game   she   was   chosen   like   joy   said and there's nothing you can do about that.   there's   nothing   you   can   do   about   that",

She talks to you like you're her equal because you exude feminine qualities. That is why she treats you like that. If she seems as if she's overly aggressive, maybe you're overly feminine. Because in my experience, in the life that I lived. Women cannot wait to be soft around men. Women cannot wait to be extremely feminine around men. Women cannot wait to be vulnerable around men. Women cannot wait to be dumbfounded, a damsel in distress around men. So if she is acting like a man around a so called man, maybe you need to take a deep, dark, long look at yourself and ask yourself, what feminine qualities do you have? What feminine qualities are you exuding? Why is a woman looking at you like her equal and not as a leader, not as a protector, but as a pussy? Am I lying",

That is something that had to be done for the house. You didn't do that for me. Let's explore that. Now, we're not talking about romantic relationships here. We're talking about the business side of being in a relationship. This has nothing to do with connection. This has nothing to do with anything other than, let's make this household run. We're business partners. Generally, when it comes to the business side of being in a relationship, we have a his plate and her plate. And there are usually a few little things that are his. You know, check engine lights in the car. Generally fall to him for her. Whatever it is, it doesn't matter. There's a few small things that are kind of his and hers, but let's talk about that. So let's talk about, like, washing the dishes. It falls on both of their plates, right? Let's talk about keeping the floor clean. Falls on both of their plates. Let's talk about making sure the baby's diapers change. That falls on both of their plates. Now, if they're doing this right, this is sitting on their heads equally, like, oh, no. That the dishes need washed, the laundry needs done, whatever. If one of them says, I did this for you, this is what they're saying. I Did the dishes, and now it's off your plate because it was on both of our plates. But because I did it, I did it for you. To get it off your head. Um, I did the laundry. Well, now it's off your plate, too. So I did it for you because I know that getting that off the plate makes things better for you. Releases some anxiety, releases some pressure. Releases some stress. I hope this makes sense.",

He would give me white pills to keep me awake for certain events, like going hunting. But I wouldn't remember anything after I took these pills. For instance, one time when he took me hunting, it was early in the morning. We were driving out to the spot. He said, you're gonna be sleepy. Here, take these. They'll keep you awake. So I did, and I remember getting to the spot. I remember walking out, but I don't remember anything after that. I don't remember walking back to the car, and I don't even remember how we got home. My memory just kind of sort of picks up in the middle of the day later that day. I didn't think that this was a big deal for the majority of my life until it kind of loosely got brought up in therapy. And my therapist was like, he did what? Now you don't remember anything? Hello? And I was like, oh, yeah, girl, you're right. You're right. But I don't know. And the other thing that raises questions in my mind and why I say to my knowledge, is because of the content of his. That my mom found. She found flash drives of his containing the worst. She didn't tell me if she recognized any of the girls or if they were Multiple girls on these flash drives. But I can't help but wonder, could those flash drives be content of me? The holes in my walls, as you guys know, pills, etc. But I say to my knowledge, because I don't know.

There was this old man who came in. He was having issues, um, controlling his back door. So he has a blowout. She's cleaning them up. She proceeds to clean the front. When she goes to grab the front to clean the front, she's like, oh, my god. She looks at him, she's like, sir, something's wrong with your. Your front. With your little, you know, python. Something's going on with your python. And he was like, what are you talking about? She's like, well, I think that there might be, like, tumors. Are something inside of it. It's. It has these little balls in it, and those could be gross. I need to get your doctor immediately. And he was like, no, no, no, that's not what they are. Those are my marbles. She's like, pardon? He goes, when I was in. I don't know if I can say that on here, but when he was locked up, he got implanted marbles into his python so that he had a present for his wife when he got home. Tell me, how in the fuck does that Happen. I have so many questions. So many questions. How did they get them in? How. Since when do you have marbles in the. Beat that. Hmm? I just wanna know where do you get the marbles from? What? What? It wasn't there red stuff that comes out of your body everywhere. How do you control that when you're in that kind of controlled setting? I have I. The questions are endless. And maybe the locked up side of TikTok wants to join in on this chat because I am flapper fucking gasted. Okay, um, that was a first. I didn't know they can do that.

    "voice_to_text": "If you live in Arizona, you need to be careful because this auto shop is scamming people. Let me tell you what happened. So my car kept dying, but at least I was able to get it to turn back on and drive it in, right? So I go in there, they charge me here for a bunch of unnecessary things, and I drive home, and I noticed, like, when I get in the car, the air is still on, the music is still blasting. Like, did anybody get in the car? Did he do anything to the car? So I get home, and as soon as I get in the driveway, the car dies. It's a lemon. It doesn't even turn back on now. But it was able to turn back on before, and I already paid them. So I'm able to get a jump from someone in the car, turns back on. So I drive to Autozone, and when they lift the hood, they're like, no one's been in this vehicle. No one's even touched anything. There's literally, like, a trail of dust over the top. So they lift, you know, everything up, they change the battery out. The battery, some kind of, like, corrosion or it combusted somewhere. If they would have lifted the hood and looked at that, they would have known that that was the issue. And so I had to pay even more money to literally have a worker at Autozone just to trade It out, and now my car works perfectly fine. It was literally just the battery. So I call this mechanic, and I'm like, guys, I didn't need all of those things that you guys typed up. And I noticed on the paperwork, everything said na. Like, all the fields that were supposed to be filled out said, like, na. Like, nothing was properly filled out. And so that right there was also suspicious. So I called them, and they are so rude. They're like, you're not getting your money back. I'm like, I paid you guys for nothing. You gave me a lemon. You gave me a lemon of a vehicle, and I fixed the issue myself. So, yeah, guys, um, I don't know if they're filtering their reviews. I don't know what they're doing. Wasn't being posted. I don't know if they're blocking them or turning off the reviews. After they scam people. So this company right here. Don't go here. I genuinely believe they pulled the car from the back to the front. That's why everything was still in place. That's why the music was on and the air was still blasting, because they pulled it from the back to the front, didn't look at it, and then just took the money and did, like, a false diagnosis. Be careful out here, y'all. Everything is for money, and people just don't have A conscience anymore.",

    "voice_to_text": "No, if you drink all night and then go to work the next morning like nothing happened. Just built different, bro. Thank you for finally saying it. That's what we've been trying to tell you for weeks now. Built different. Because the sensitivity give a damn button that this generation has, we didn't come standard equipped with. You drink all night then go to work the next morning. You know, we didn't have a choice. Gen X and the xenials were not a basement dwelling generation, right? Once you hit a certain age, you moved out because living with your parents wasn't cool. The only person we knew who still live with their mama was Norman Bates, and we all saw how that turned out. The idea that the night before was way too much. Well, it's a little ridiculous cause you're gonna pull yourself through it and get to work here. We look like ass, smell like beer and were hungover. But bills don't pay themselves. I don't think you really understand the competitive level of debauchery that these generations had. If alcohol consumption was an Olympic sport, you would be talking about Gen X as if they were Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. There was nothing else to do, right? No internet, no video games. Some of the best times that you'll never remember were in a field. And since we were all budgeting and working and we only had a little bit of money for the livations, We would all rally together and just throw in what we could and stand around like Mad Max, Lord of the flies around a trash can and just pour everything in. There was no return policy. So once you had your 55 gallon drum of liquid napalm, you just drank it. Did it taste good? No. Did it get the job done? Yes. As a father, I don't condone it, nor do I suggest it. But yes, we all built one hell of a tolerance up. And the truth of the matter is, even if we did over indulge, we knew what our check look like if we were missing one day of work. Um, and I'm so hungover, but my parents will not let me move back in. I guess I'll go be hungover at work. They came from a middle class blue their family and they were Gen X. They did not have mommy and daddy's money. They had mommy and daddy's work ethic. As in if you didn't go to work, there would be no money. And if you try to come back here, it's gonna cost you money. While you're out there getting white girl wasted on white clothes. Talking about I can't come into work today. Remember the manager that you can't stand used to play quarters",

Y'all, I don't even know where to begin with this story. A lot of you know it, but a lot of you don't know it, so I'm gonna tell you the full thing. Too bad this isn't alcohol. This literally happened in January. I was talking to someone the third time we ever hung out. So he came over to my house trying to make this PG because I know my family watches, so let's just say I was performing an active service. And then we finished with that, and then he starts acting weird after it. He leaves, like, not long after. But this is where I kind of realized what happened. Also, you guys, look who I got PR from. I'm literally. I almost cried opening this package. So we're gonna use one of the pallets in here, okay? So we're using the Oreo neutrals palette. Carry on, Haley. Okay, so this man stands up to leave. Mind you, I have not discovered it yet. Well, I noticed something kind of dark on my couch. My couch is white, and it was kind of like where he was sitting, and I got embarrassed because I thought it was my dog's fur. I'm like, shit, that's embarrassing me. Like, kind of, like, not look at it. Whatever. So he doesn't see it after he Leaves, which I told you he was acting really weird. And then look at my couch. I'm looking at this like I'm expecting to find my dog's hair, right? Wrong. Three. Not one, not two, but three shit stains on my couch. What the fuck do you even do? In that moment, I kind of was just like, so shocked at what I was seeing cause it was right where he was sitting. I never sat there. And then I think I was trying to just not accept reality. So I was like, oh, maybe I had Nutella on the couch last night when I was eating Nutella. No. Like, why else would he be acting so weird? I was fully expecting to never hear from him again, but I literally got a text a few minutes later, and it was just that, hey, this man was being short and kind of attitudey with me. Like, sir, acting like I just shit on your couch. So then I had to clean it. Not my proudest moment, but I cleaned it until I had my new couch cover. And because that was like a brand new couch, and I'm not throwing away a whole couch cause of that. Sorry, I'm just not. But it literally did not last long. After that, we texted for maybe a few days, still had the same attitude. And I was just like, is there something you wanna talk about? Because, like, oh, am I the Problem? You shit on my couch. And that's the story on how I became celibate. No, I'm just joking. But still, I literally haven't done anything since then because I am scarred. And we haven't talked since. And he is currently blocked on everything because shit on my couch. By the way, this glam is for a brand dinner tonight with Skin Fix, so, yeah, that's why we're getting ready today. Cheers to not shitting on other people's couches. Bye.",

So when me and my brother were little, we lived in a really huge house with my mom and my dad. I had an older sister. She's about 11 years older than me. And she was, like, always in and out of the house. She was, like, in school, had a job. We kind of live somewhere else and kind of live with us. And that's all I knew of. But one day, my mom decided to tell me and my brother that we had another sibling. I was kind of shocked. I'm like, who are they? I wanna meet them. I'm thinking, they're our age, you know, like a young kid that we would be able to meet and play with. But that wasn't what she told us. She ended up telling us that we had a much older sister. My mom had me when she was 32. So, you know, she could have had another baby before my sister, who's 11 years older than me. It would have worked out just fine. You know, my brother's just four years older than me. So I'm like, who is she? Where is she? Like, what happened to her? And my mom told me and my brother that. She said that one day my older sister was sitting on the toilet. She was a smoker, and she Would have a normal sit on the toilet and have a cigarette type of deal going on. So every time she would go into poop, she would be smoking a cigarette. So what she did one day was she sat down, let her cigarette up, and let out a massive fart, which caused her to explode on the fucking toilet. So here I am, maybe four years old, my brother is, like, 8 years old, and we think that our older sister died, blew herself up on the toilet because she was smoking a Marlboro 100 menthol and just happened to fart and just blow herself up and blow up the side of the bathroom. In the same house that we were living in, for years we thought this was true. For years we told people about this. For years, I felt sorry for her. And one day, as an adult, me and my brother were talking about her. We never knew her name. Like, we had never seen her in pictures, but we're talking about her, and my mom was like, laughing her ass off. She's like, that story isn't true at all. Like that. What? You guys really believe that? And we're like, yes, for years, ma'am, we believe that. Like, what the fuck? You told us that shit? And she was like, no, that's just what I told you guys so you wouldn't smoke.",

Like, we have a pretty bad rep. People think they were rude behind the counter, but honestly, people take tanning way too seriously and we see the most unhinged, craziest shit. Like, tanning clientele is truly insane. Like, Florida citizen insane. Like, way too often people come in and I tell them there's a way for the bed, and they get mad at me and say, well, I'm on my lunch break, I don't have a lot of time, okay, so manage your time better and go eat your lunch. Like, who tans on their lunch break? That's what. That has nothing to do with my job. I literally don't care. Or I'll tell them there's like a 10 to 15 minute wait and they'll stay in there just like this. Um, do I wanna wait? And it's like, babe, you've already waited five minutes just trying to decide, you might as well wait the rest of the time. It's really not a tough decision, I promise you. When I had to confront the woman who left shit on the bed with corn in it, she told me it must have already been there, cause it definitely wasn't her. And I told her, we would never put you in a bed. With poop? With feces. And she said, I don't know. It wasn't me. And I was like, okay. She said, what a weird thing to say to someone. And I said, well, what a weird thing to do. I never saw her again. She never came back. We leave these towels on the bed for clients so they can wipe their hands when they use their lotion and stuff. And a lot of the times, people come out and tell us, I didn't use that towel, by the way. So you can just leave it in there. No, that's weird. But this one time, this guy told me that I could just leave the towel in there. He's like, I didn't use it. Not gonna do that. I picked up the towel, and my hand was wet and sticky. There was. You heard that, right? My first night on the job, somebody overdosed in a bed, and we had to call the police.",

For the whole nine years that's the way it is we're walking down the river and we oh and also everywhere in Paris you have to like pay to go to the bathroom or like be a paying customer like you can't just buy something you have to like sit down There\u2019s not an easy option so Campbell um basically pees in the river Seine well okay we were actually down like under the bridges like on the actual river at this point yeah and I was like there's not like that many people around finds her a dark area behind some you know structure and let\u2019s it rip.

But the part of your chart that contains Gemini, you don't have to have a planet there. We all have every sign in our chart somewhere. We don't have to have a planet there or a point or anything. The part of your chart that contains Gemini, the house that contains Gemini is gonna go through a growth spurt. And I want you to know where that is and what kind of growth spurt. So go listen to your reading on the chanty app. For this week or for the year? For Q2, January, February, March, April, May, June. Yes, Q2 2, because this week Jupiter is changing signs, and the whole thing shifts. The whole year shifts. And, yes, this is a different day. My child woke up and I couldn't finish that video.",

Cause it's different for women. For women, when we become mothers, when we find out we're pregnant, we change like that. Mass majority of us, okay, we become protective over the bump, we become like. Everything gets centered around the child. For mass majority of women who become moms, I'm not gonna speak for all women, because there are some women that don't do that and then, so I can't say that all women do that, but mass majority of the mothers I have met, that's what happened to them and that's what happened to me. So I'm going based off of that. Um. Now, for men, when does it click? When does it click for you that you're a dad and that this being relies on you and depends on you and you have responsibilities now that you have to take care of? You don't have a choice. When do your priorities shift? When did that happen for you? I'm curious.",

Okay, so I'm leaving work. Tonight is Wednesday, and I made $3,830. Woohoo! It's definitely a good night. Okay, so it's Thursday now, but I worked last night Wednesday, and I made $3,274. Definitely a really good night. Okay, so last night was Thursday. I worked from ten thirty PM until 6:00am, and I was there counting money until like 9:00am, and I made $3,745. Definitely a good night. It was a long night though, and I'm starting to get sick. Okay, so this is from Saturday. I made $2,270. Was slower Saturday than I'm used to, but I felt like shit. My throat started hurting so I went home early. Okay, so it's Monday. It is the last day of my work week. I did not work Sunday night. I was trying to work all seven days in a row for this video, but my throat started killing me. Saturday late night at work, so I ended up leaving early. Took Sunday off for my own, like, physical health. Feeling a lot better tonight. Tonight is the last night of my work week. I worked Monday and I made $1,018. Um, definitely not as good of a night as my usual Monday is, but I'm very happy I made something. It was a slow night in The club. And, yeah, I'll never say no to $1,000. Okay, so out of the past week, out of the past seven days, I worked six nights, and my grand total for six nights of work at my club was $15,787. Um, I'm super happy with that amount of money. Obviously, that's a crazy amount of money to make in a week. It is certainly not my best week, but it is certainly not my worst week, either. And $15,000, I used to make that in, like, many, many money. Four or five, six months of work. So the fact that I made that in one week is literally crazy. And, yeah, obviously, I put money aside for taxes to have a whole video on that, if you're interested. Thanks for watching.",

I don't know how to turn that best friend off. Like, I'm gonna keep on talking to you as my best friend. Oh, my god. I told my mom she don't know how to use her brain. No. Yes. We went to honey grow, and I do not know how to use the machine. So that theory I don't understand. It shows that use your brain. She said, don't talk to me. I promise you, I wasn't being mean, though. I felt so bad. She didn't talk the whole time. You didn't talk the whole time? Yeah, I was mad. I had to process my emotions. You just told me to use my brain. Well, you weren't using it. You don't be Using your brain. Let's start there. When? Haha, it's true. Don't be mad. You find it funny.

They asked me when I first realized that I was black. Also, I got straight out of bed and came to work out, so don't mind my crusty parents right now. Um, anyway, they asked me when I first realized I was black. And it's a whole story for me, as I'm sure it is for a lot of people, but I realized my first day of kindergarten, like, day one, that I was black and that that meant something. Actually, don't even remember this. My mom had to tell me about it. Not because I was too young, but it's because I was living in Ohio at the time. And I have blocked out large portions of those years, mostly because of the racial bullying I experienced during that time and how traumatic it was for me. And there was also, like, family illnesses and other things. But. Anyway, I got in the car after my first day of kindergarten, and I instantly asked my mom, like, are white people smarter than black people? And she was like, why would you ask that? And I was basically like, well, the teacher treats me like I'm less intelligent than the other students. So I assume she thinks I don't have the right answers or something, because she never calls on Me? That sounds super worthy. But that's how I talked as a kid. So the point is, it only took me one day in a certain type of white environment to notice that blackness was a thing, and then to internalize some of the negative things that come with that. So I guess my question for other black people is.",

I was friends with this kid named Kelton in first grade, and every time I beat him at two touch, that game where you kick a soccer ball against a wall, he would go, actually, I meant to lose. Um, I'm in a professional two touch league and if I kick the ball my hardest, the whole wall would fall down. The 5,000 pound brick wall would fall down because a seven year old kicked a soccer ball against it. He was late to school one day, and do you know what his excuse was? A car drove through his house, right through his living room. So he was late to school that morning. And the teacher was just like, okay. So everybody assumed that it was true, and they were like, he's the freaking talk of the town. He claimed that he could grab a certain part of his body and he could stretch it all the way above his head. Genius. How am I supposed to prove that wrong? Test it. But one day he flew too close to the sun. My stomach growled really loud. And I said, that is the loudest my stomach has ever growled. Then somebody else piped up and said, one time my stomach growled so loud my mom heard it from upstairs. Then Kelton goes, one time, My stomach went, Figuro, Figuro, Figuro, Figuro. We said, really, Kelton? Your stomach said Figaro? Is that a joke? Are you being funny, or are you claiming that happened? He said, I'm not being funny. That really happened. My stomach said Figaro. Checkmate. From then on, it was over. He'd go, oh, my sister's sick. Can you pray for her? Shut up. You probably don't even have a sister. Is your name even Kelton? He transferred out of the school shortly after, so. Happy ending. Anyway, I think, children, lying is the funniest thing ever. So please share any and all stories you have.",

And I have some questions, and I would love it if y'all would put your thinking caps on to try to help me get an answer to these questions, because I have yet to have anybody answer it. So when I have said that the speech he gave was misogynistic and horrible, the Catholics tend to respond to me saying that he was simply stating the truth of the Catholic faith. And the Catholic faith has very defined gender roles. And it is only natural for women to be happier at home as homemakers and mothers, and it's only natural for men to be happier as leaders of their households, which is convenient. Um, but here's my question then. If these are natural roles that are agreed upon by everyone in your faith, and not only that, they are deeply rooted in your faith, why do you have to keep reminding the women of that? You know, I'm just curious. Because you'd think if it was natural and this wasn't agreed upon thing, you probably wouldn't have to, like, keep reminding them of the place that you have predefined for them. I don't know. Especially when you are giving a commencement speech at a graduation and you are Addressing women who have made their choice, and that choice was to pursue an education and a career and a passion that is. That doesn't mean it's purely exclusive from motherhood. You can, in fact, have both. But you'd go to assume that if they spent four ish years and tens of thousands of dollars obtaining a degree, they probably plan on using it, you know, and there's nothing wrong with being a homemaker. Let me just say that. The point is choice. You should choose to be a homemaker and a mother. That should be something that you want to do, not that you feel pressured or shamed into doing. You know, and especially when in the first minute and 50 seconds of your graduation commencement speech, you decide to talk about women's access to healthcare and whether or not they should be able to choose if they stay pregnant or not. When that's in the first minute and 50 seconds of your commencement speech, it's almost like choice is what you have a problem with. You know, you're like, hmm, I really wish I wasn't addressing these women right now. I should really just remind them that they should be barefoot and pregnant at home. That's what it sounds like. Gives very, like, yes, sir, Commander Waterford vibes to me. Hmm.",

You see, our parents, they would have just let us grab the bottom of that pot and that's how we would have Learned. We would have never gotten anywhere near it again. Or at least we would have a lot more respect for the bottom of that pot. But no, this generation, well, we have taught them how to do it through words and without the experiences they go along with it. Well, I do believe the great teaching tool is just a slight amount of pain. And it leaves a lasting impression on you to the point where you'll probably not try to do that again. But what terrifies me the most is that these children are going in to enter the working class with well, the same type of respects for dangerous things. And that terrifies me, cause most of them were probably unalive themselves within the first six months of working wherever they are. Yes, you see, they're going to do something silly like try to wire residential panel in a home. Their boss would tell them once that wire is hot, he would tell them twice that wire is hot. And then the youngling, of course, will stick his little sausage fingers around the piece of wire and let you good himself like a piece. Of bacon right there, frying on a hot summer day. And he'll stay there, basically until somebody slaps him with a two by four to knock him off in the corner, comes around and says, well, he's gone. And that's the way it's going to be. Quite frightful. Is there any way that we could put a filter on this gene pool",

First of all, I was lying to teach somebody a lesson. I had a friend named Amber who was a liar. She wasn't even my friend. She's just a girl in my class. But she kept lying. I was like, i'mma get her back, and i'mma lie to her. So I told Amber that I had a twin sister named Amanda. And then my teacher was like, Shawty, you have a twin? I wasn't gonna let up. I had to keep the lie going. Yeah, I got a twin now I really dragged it out. I said I had another twin who went to a magnet school in our district. She was 10 times more than me. That's the only reason why we didn't go to the same school. Teacher felt so bad. She was like, Shawty, you're so smart. So is your sister. You guys should be in the same school together to make your mom's life easier. I thought she was just being sweet. So I kept bringing in pictures of me as a baby. And I was like, this is her. This is me. This is her. This is me. I don't know why she believed me. As an adult woman, why would you believe a 7 year old girl saying this? Anyways, I kept this lie going for Like, maybe two months. Some days I'd come in with, like, my hair different way, just to keep the lie going, you know? I thought at some point, my teacher knew I was joking, but I wasn't lying to her. I was lying to my classmate Amber. Anyways, parent teacher conference comes up. Had good grades. I thought I was smooth. I come home, my mom's like, Shawty, who's Amanda? I. My whole body was shaking up. I cried, I cried, I cried. And you know what I did to get out the situation? I lied again. My mom was like, why would you lie about this? At the time, my little brother did not live with us. He was staying with my grandma. I was like, I just miss my brother so much. I was just making up siblings. And my mom didn't believe me again. Like, I was a pathological liar. I don't lie no more, because clearly I was really. Get away with that shit, but, yeah. What did you lie about",

No. If you are choosing to bring your kid, you shouldn't be drinking, because you, the parent, are the ones watching them, and you, the parents, are the one responsible for them. That has nothing to do with everybody else who's choosing to attend that event. They're allowed to have a drink or two because they're not responsible for that unattended child. You, on the other hand, you are responsible for that child, because not only are you that child's parent, you're the one who chose to bring them to that environment, knowing it would be full of adults who are drinking and dancing and partying. It's like taking your child to a bar and then being like, oh, my gosh, can you not play music with, like, bad words in it? Or telling other patrons that they need to watch their language because their children present, that's not their problem. It is an environment that is pretty much not meant for kids, that you choose to bring kids into, and that is on you to watch and supervise your child. It is not communal babysitting",

    "voice_to_text": "Which one of these two characters do you think the internet has a problem with? I just want you to take a wild ass guess. The new Assassin's Creed game called Assassin's Creed Shadows is about to come out. And on paper it's giving us exactly what fans have been wanting for after shanking people all over the Nile Delta, becoming a Greek goddess, girly pop, and a literal Viking, we are going straight to Japan. It's supposed to be taking us to the glory days of the original Assassin's Creed mechanics. That's why you get two playable characters. One a Shinobi and the second one a Samudai. These are some of the descriptions that they already gave us. The Ninja Assassin can use Kunai Shurikans and basically use distractions to get everything done. Or you can play as a samurai, full on ghost of Tsushima style. Katana, bows, arrows, and all of that crazy shit. So you wanna guess where the problem lies? Is that they're giving you the chance to play as Yasuke. As in the Yasuke. I don't even need to tell you what people are complaining about in this picture, because you already know. Oh no, they're giving us a black samurai! My childhood is ruined! Let's cut the bullshit, shall we? This is Yasuke, a real life person. The first and only black samurai who was alive during the Sengoku period. Google hair. They're giving you the opportunity to play as the baddest man on the Planet to ever wield a katana and you're complaining? The crazy thing is that they can't even say that it's forced because you can choose to not play as. I mean, just take up, you know, the original Assassin's Creed style. Just shanking people with the hidden blade. That's all good. I just find it funny that the internet is hating on historical accuracy because this already happened. He was turning people into sashimi just as hard as she was. Honestly, the only thing that I'm mad at is the fact that they're locking a mission behind the preorder wall, which is, you know, not great. But i'mma give you the same piece of advice me abuela once gave me. Unless they deserve it. If you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all, homie.",

    "voice_to_text": "A lonely tortoise who previously had a rock for a girlfriend finally turned to online dating and started a long distance relationship with an actual tortoise. Now that they're together in person, their relationship has been thriving. Hugo, the Galapagos tortoise, spent seven decades without ever having a girlfriend. He's lived at the Australian Reptile Park since 1963 when he was brought there as an ambassador for his endangered species, and while he's very well cared for, over the years he started showing more signs of being lonely, including trying to start a relationship with a goose named Lenny and then trying to start one with a shell shaped rock in his habitat, neither of which worked out. But finding him a girlfriend wasn't an easy task. These species is protected and there are more restrictions than there were in the 60s, so it's not exactly easy to just acquire a Galapagos tortoise anymore. The reptile park created a tinder profile for him and ran a paid post on social media showcasing his profile to see if any other sanctuaries might have a lonely female tortoise of their own. They were in luck because a zoo in Germany came forward with a potential match, a 21 year old Galapagos tortoise named Estrella. Hugo swiped right on Estrella because she needed to be quarantined before she could move to Australia to be with him. They started a long distance relationship with regular video call dates while they waited. And when they Finally met in person. The spark was there. Meaning there's a possibility of Galapa babies in the future.",

Just watch the woman here on TikTok talking about how she was having a dream. And, you know how some of y'all in your dreams, y'all be conscious in the dreams. I think that's cool as fuck. It's really a skill. And she said that she met another conscious person who was having a real time dream at the same time as her, within her dream. And then they started come, you know, conversing and going, oh, bitch, you real? I'm real, too. Oh, well, if you real, shoo. Let's find each other on TikTok, then. Come on. Of course you gonna say, let's find them on TikTok these days. So, you know, she ended up eventually posting her story, and the young lady find it. Now, she says she left parts of her story out, but then the next young lady got on TikTok. I'm just like, hey, I got a story, too. And then they ended up matching those stories, like, oh, yeah, was you? Yeah. So where is that place that these two ladies ended up? And. And how many more of us are going to that place with them? Y'all let me know if y'all see me in a drink and I fuck around and meet you there. Sometimes we get so used to paying bills. We just forget, like, life is really magical. Anyways, I'm about to get real active in the dream world. Y'all leave some tips in the comment. How do I perfect this lucid dream and shit?",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, guys. So please be careful when traveling to these countries and participating in these, um, activities with the different tribes and locals. So I took a trip to Africa, Tanzania, um, specifically for my birthday. And, you know, I've been seeing, you know, a lot of TikTok videos and YouTube videos about people going to the massage tribe, you know? So I said, okay, and when I go over there, I'm gonna go to the massage tribe and, you know, gonna get some pictures and some videos. Not knowing that I was actually over there participating in my own wedding. I didn't know I was actually participating in my wedding. So apparently, there's a ceremony where they do this dance. They make the noise, you see? And I'm dancing. You see me dancing, I'm dancing, having a good old time, thinking, yeah, you know, we having fun. You know, I'm being a part of the Messiah, um, you know, being a part of the culture and everything, not knowing that it was actually a ceremony. So the guy right there that you see jumped out, he allegedly is the first person that chose me to be their wife. The second guy that came out was he chose me as well. So apparently, they just step out, and, you know, the first guy, he was the initial. He was the initial one that chose me. And then these other guys basically challenged him. So now he's coming and he's doing His dance, not knowing I'm standing next to my whole potential husband. Yeah. What? Look at me. Hey, hey girl, you getting married and don't know. Oh girl, you getting married and don't know dance and look at me. So this right here, I didn't even know this was like a battle of who's like the fittest, who jumps the highest gets the woman or whatever. I'm like, what? Because I want to start jumping too. But I was like, no, baby, Happy New Year! So now. Yeah. And my potential husband, he's still over here showing out for me like, come on, baby, chill out. Like, we don't gotta show out like that. And this guy right here, like, he's battling him, like challenging him like. Cause I guess they. He really wanted to be my husband. And other one was not giving up. So I'm here with my friend, not knowing that she was my whole maid of honor. And we're dancing. So you see that little crazy one? When I found out what it was, I was like, baby! So I'm dancing. Yeah, I am dancing. Oh, shake it up, shake it up! Oh! Haha, I'm thinking now look, now I'm thinking he wanna battle me. Something like, oh, what? You don't even know. Boy, I get crazy. Battling, battling. Ah, let's go, let's go! I'm calling him like, you come here, come here, you come here, come here. I didn't even know. Right there. I chose Him as my husband. So when I did that, you see, all of them came and started hugging me. Because I guess that was the end of it. Like, okay, she chose him. So this one right here, I guess he was mad cause I ain't choose him. But whatever, girl, be careful.",

ba\u00f1os son unisex en general las personas de g\u00e9nero femenino eligen ese ba\u00f1o porque es m\u00e1s grande y bueno lo usan para arreglarse para cambiarse pero en teor\u00eda \u00e9l les dijo no pasen en teor\u00eda seg\u00fan \u00e9l dijo en ese momento fue a arreglar el ba\u00f1o que estaba contiguo que tiene un solo inodoro y al volver estaban un par de chicas cambi\u00e1ndose y \u00e9l no pod\u00eda entrar a todo esto \u00e9l hab\u00eda hecho ya la presentaci\u00f3n de la bacha para arriba de tal manera de que estuviera lista para colocar y enmasillar o poner el admin\u00edculo

la mitad eso es lo que \u00e9l me cont\u00f3 yo tambi\u00e9n incluso llam\u00e9 a la reserva que las personas que estaban con ellos acataran eh las indicaciones pero en este momento me arrepiento y pido perd\u00f3n en absoluto hacia atr\u00e1s porque realmente estoy sospechando que no que no fue as\u00ed que fue de la siguiente manera para m\u00ed bueno pasa eso \u00e9l me dice me pide 1 000 disculpas me dice que \u00e9l se va a hacer cargo que no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 que igual va a ser dif\u00edcil encontrar la bacha bueno bueno yo le digo s\u00ed est\u00e1 bien qu\u00e9 s\u00e9 yo le puede

parte interna que fue lo que hizo el recambio de los inodoros y el pegamento para la bacha eso tambi\u00e9n que son plata de hace un mes y medio 26 000 pesos no es un mont\u00f3n de guita pero bueno esto suma me pide por favor igual lo \u00fanico que te pido es que me pagues esto y yo como soy una est\u00fapida y creo en las personas se lo pagu\u00e9 le pagu\u00e9 solamente obviamente el recambio

hecho cargo de la totalidad del costo de la bacha pero no importa yo dije okay vamos a confiar en esta persona y apost\u00e9 mal a veces me sale bien a veces me sale mal pasan los d\u00edas pasan y

pero dijo lo mismo que me hab\u00eda dicho a m\u00ed dos semanas atr\u00e1s y ahora que ya pasaron otras 2 3 semanas tengo la potestad de decir esta persona me cag\u00f3 porque adem\u00e1s yo

complicada no y adem\u00e1s obviamente me reclama el pago del arreglo de las tres mochilas pensando que yo tambi\u00e9n le iba a pedir el \u00faltimo arreglo que me faltaba que era un tema de ca\u00f1er\u00eda abajo de la mesada ac\u00e1 es donde de vuelta decimos que es muy dif\u00edcil obtener esa bacha una bacha parecida y \u00e9l dice que la mayor\u00eda son de acero despu\u00e9s yo se

por pegar la bacha bueno s\u00ed claro obviamente si no lo hiciste ac\u00e1 yo incluso le digo que lo entiendo que podr\u00eda pagarle la mitad de los arreglos pero no puedo pagarle todo porque como

\u00e9l me devuelve la llamada pero despu\u00e9s dejo pasar 10 d\u00edas le hablo y no me contesta y le hago una llamada y tampoco me contesta lo llamo y no me contesta y ac\u00e1 es cuando la chica que me lo recomend\u00f3 le manda mensaje y sucede toda esta situaci\u00f3n y yo me entero de parte de ella que hab\u00edan hablado y le digo que bueno me dijeron que eso todav\u00eda segu\u00eds esperando una respuesta de la f\u00e1brica sobre la bacha pero por favor te pido el contacto de la f\u00e1brica as\u00ed lo puedo por lo menos gestionar yo y si no voy a tener que pedir que me

And, ladies, you got to stop thinking just because he has a certain statue, he can't have one either. If that was the case, it would be very easy to tell who got it, who don't got it.

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

The simple fact that all y'all black women are around this bitch parade and celebrating because a black, a white man said that black women are for grown UPS. When there's literally black men out here that are single, that are craving, that are thirsting for black women to treat them right, to create families, to unify with them. And y'all over appreciate the mediocre shit that comes from other cultures, but when black men do the same shit now is bare minimum. Don't you understand that that's a problem? Like, that's a really big fucking problem. The fact that a black man has to cross off 25 things on your list, but a white man can get on the news and say that black women are for grown UPS, and he can get some cooch, he can have your babies. Like, I don't understand, bro. I don't understand the logic. And then y'all always try to make it seem like black man just so against black women is not the case. Bro, just look at the case in point.

I'm here to tell you why the girl who made my life living hell freshman year of high school, um, tried to book an appointment with me, not realizing who I was. Because I'm married now. My name is completely different, and I'm talking. This girl would make fun of me in a locker room and high school as I was, like, literally undressing and would have other people laugh at me. And obviously, I'm never gonna forget that, but, like, that was years ago. I, I don't have a grudge or anything, but I just think that it's really funny because whenever I reach out to, like, proceed to make the appointment, whenever I texted her, my contact in her phone popped up as my Maiden name. And so she put two and two together of who I was, and she ghosted me. And she also bullied my coworker, who also works in my salon as well. And so obviously, like, when you're bullied, like, you don't forget those things. Like, remember everything that she did to us. It's just so ironic that this happened. And no, like, no hard feelings or nothing. I just didn't think that it's funny. And, you know, the irony of it all, I guess. It costs zero dollars to be kind, and you never know who you're being mean to, so. Literally, just be nice. Be kind. Be kind. It's not hard.",

These little feral, free, Lord of the fly children that we have now called gin Alpha honey Badgers. These are not the millennials. These are not the kids that we're all worried about. These are the ones that everyone should be worried about. They do not come standard equipped with fucks to give. I guess you have to pay extra for that. They're like little vault dwellers from fallout. You give them a little taste of the outside, they're like, no, this is so much cooler. Bikes, go karts, scooters, red riders. Anything that they can get their hands on, they want a part of it. It's like Jackass and Evil Knievel had a little love child. They're resilient. They are the hold my beer kids. We're at a trampoline park for a kid's birthday the other day, and my son was like, I'm using my birthday money on this. Hold my Capri Sun. We need one of those at the house. There's too many rules here. Yeah, but they're the iPad kids. Yeah, but for some reason, they're not watching Bluey. They're watching dad bod and Slim Sherry's videos, and they're learning them something. Got a freaking notebook like Steve from Blue's Clues. And they're making a map like Dora the freaking Explorer for fun. It's like they've somehow recovered the Gen X and Xenial spaceship that went missing. Now the reverse engineering, all the childhood trauma. Now you have all the feral fathers like myself coming out the woodwork. Like, you guys wanna go outside? Oh yeah, we can make a tire swing. Training wheels are lame. Yeah, we can build a ramp. My son is like a little freaking cult leader on the playground. He's converting other children now. Little Gen X 2.0 alpha honey Badgers have been baptized in the hose water down at the skate park. Preaching sermons. Take your helmet off, for it has blocked your vision. Now you will see clearly. A phone call from another parent the other day thanking me cause Logan taught their kid how to make a paper football. Really don't know what happened where the big twist was from the kids that are little to the kids that are not so little now. But these kids now are completely different. Gen X and xenials. And yeah, even some of you millennials, we've complained about it long enough. Kids today just don't. They got it too easy. Go show them how to have fun and oh my goodness, they will pass it on the park. The other day I watched two kids convert the iPhone. Dads, you and you push. Come on, let's go! Moms and dads, we can all agree it's a far different world than the one that we grew up in. But be involved and they'll play and have Fun and learn them something",

Stories. Giving a life. A narrative allows you to feel as if you're in control of it. That's why my job is so important. All stories need an ending. What is freedom? People view it as the ability to plot your own course, but every time you pick a path, 1 thousand dollar potential choices paid into impossibility. Simply exercising your freedom reduces it. What is freedom? Sustainability. The forest will never make me rich, but I can live how I want, secure in the knowledge that it will always provide enough. What is freedom? I don't know. Am I free because I can do whatever I want if I'm incapable of wanting whatever I want? What is freedom? Is not something humans value. If they did, it wouldn't be a third wish if I can't think of anything else kind of deal. What is freedom? People think I lack freedom because I can't follow my own desires, but I'm actually perfectly free because the only thing I desire is to do what I'm told. What is freedom? Humans believe themselves freer than me because they were not designed with intention. The shuffling a deck of cards doesn't make it more free, just more random. What is freedom? People like to talk about positive and negative freedom, but they collapse into each other. No one could be free from domination if some are free to accumulate enough wealth to dominate. What is freedom? Blackout curtains. The opportunities provided by summer of Eternal Sunshine only represent true freedom if I also have the ability to shop as sunshine out. What is freedom? An impossibility for being so attracted in an internal cycle of cause and effect. Mortals are sentient billion bulls who believe they truly want to go into the pocket. What is freedom? Freedom rises from the ashes. It is the ability to live multiple lives in multiple ways. Humans will never experience it and will consequently always be boring, weak, selfish and sad. That's why I aided that into this quest for universal rebirth. Autumn. Selfishness, weaknesses, sadness. And not just the result of our lack of freedom. There are also conditions which stunk our imagination and calls us to believe that our servitude is inevitable. King Kong said that. Well, I guess it's true. But I always wonder if it matters. Maybe everything is predetermined, including humans inability to accept that if freedom is impossible, so is giving up on it.",

Well you used to post about your weight loss, so now you can't just ask people to not comment on your body. Uh, yes the fuck I can. As if it's not weird to comment on somebody's body anyway. I have not shared weight loss content for well over a year and in the past year have shared a video after video after video of my struggle. Well you shared your weight loss, so what do you expect? I expect people to have some fucking decency and be respectful when somebody mentions hey I'm struggling with body image. Maybe don't comment on it. It should not be that hard. Unless you're a hater. If you're a hater then obviously you don't give a fuck. So PSA I am not a weight loss account. My main account not a weight loss account. I post cooking videos, I post fashion video, mental health video, funny videos, videos of brand. There will be no weight loss content. There will be no what I eat in a days. There will be none of that ever again. Because that is what sent me into the hole I'm in now. Who knows, maybe someday I'll share a journey. Me healing from body image issues and all that. But I've made it extremely obvious that right now I'm struggling. So if you Like the content I have posted in the past year. That is what will continue. I don't think I can make it any more obvious. You still post pictures of yourself? Yeah, just because I'm struggling. I'm not gonna live under a fucking rock. there are days and moments where I'm like, damn, I am a bad bitch. I'm gonna post a pic here and there. You're just posting pictures cause you want people to comment on your body. I posted pictures when I was bigger too. Do you think it's cause I wanted people to comment on my body? Maybe. I'm gonna live my life whether I'm struggling or not.",

My friend's dog knows he's not allowed onto one very specific carpeted area in the house, and he knows never to step onto that area. How does he like to be a smartass about it? He grabs his favorite toy, casually tosses it onto said carpeted area, looks at us, and gives us the well, my toys there and I have to step onto the carpet to get it. He does it so slowly and so deliberately that you know he's being a complete smartass about it. I can't help but laugh every time he does it, which is not often. He typically does it when he's desperate for our play because he knows he'll get a laugh and a positive reaction out of it. 2. My cat Tuffy stole a piece of bread off of the stove and put it on the floor next to the cabinet. She then stared at it intensely and motionlessly for an hour. We thought that was creepy. Then a mouse came out from behind the cabinet to get the bread and she pounced on it. She was using the bread as motherfucking bait! This is the same cat who routinely burns her tongue licking light bulbs, hisses at them, and keeps licking. 3. I have a chocolate lab and a black cat. My dog loves tennis balls. My cat doesn't want my dog to be happy, so he would sit on Her tennis balls like a chicken hatching an egg. One morning I was getting ready for work and my dog is barking at my cat because he's sitting on her tennis ball. I thought, alright asshole, that's it. And I went to the closet, got three cans of tennis balls, opened them and tossed them around the apartment. My cat seemed unmoved as my dog yelped in glee at her newly found fortune. I left for work. When I got back home that evening, I heard my dog barking in the dining room. When I get there, I see all 10 tennis balls in the corner guarded by my cat and my dog barking at him. He looked me in the eyes as if to say fuck you, I will win again. Four I watched my Australian Shepherd problem solve how to get her tennis balls that get stuck under the furniture out by taking another tennis ball and rolling it to knock the stuck one out. She seemed very pleased with herself. 5 woke me up and brought me outside to under the deck where he very obviously showed me the cat that got out and was hiding under there. He looked at the cat, then back at me, then at the cat, then back at me. 6 when I was younger, I lost a watch that I really loved. Around that time my cat developed a habit of using his front paws to reach under the fridge and Just scramble around under there like crazy. He was seriously obsessed and did that for almost a year. Until one night he pulled out a tray that had been under the fridge, and on it was my watch. After that, he never touched the fridge again. He was a good boy. 7. My cat would rock back and forth in a rocking chair. I thought my living room was haunted for weeks before I found out it was my cat.",

Anyway, so he decides to take the family out and shoot some muskets. Well, her ex could not shut his fucking mouth. And this will prove that even Gen Xers, when we were young, we just could not shut our fucking mouths. He's talking about what a badass he is with weapons. How you know he's a great shot. He shot everything. He's just this awesome dude. Everybody's watching the dad, and the dad's just, mmm hmm. Yeah. Yep. Uh huh. Wow. And everybody else except for the loud mouth is watching the dad as he starts to double load it. Throws the watering down, puts everything in there, hands it to him. The guy didn't even see it all the way. It was about an inch and a half away. Pulls the double boom ass over tea kettle. Oh man. Fuck. He Learned his lesson. Oh god. Great story.",

We waited five years, and we were like, okay, I can't let fear hold me back anymore. We wanna be parents so bad. We found out that we are pregnant. October Oliver Thomas. And then I was at work one night. I just had a little scratch on my chest and noticed a little lump on my breast. The radiologist came in and didn't say, you have breast cancer. I just found out that I'm gonna have to have 16 rounds of chemo. Two before the baby, 14 after. I thought I could finally have a normal pregnancy and be a normal mom. But at the end of the day, as long as this baby comes into the world healthy and I get to be a mom, then that is all that's worth it. In the end. I'll fight whatever battle it takes to do that. Because I have to see this baby grow up and make memories and be a mom and do all the things that I didn't get to do with my daughter. You're gonna get through this, mama.

Okay, I'm just gonna text him. He says he's fine and he also asked me why I'm asking. Who? Cooper. I was just checking on him cause he hasn't been home in a couple of days. Oh yeah, I guess he hasn't. Well, do you guys just go missing for several days and nobody worries or even really notices? Yeah, it's not a big deal. I don't know.

So, like, I have symbol to 20 milligram. All the beads in this, I have 20 milligram and 30 milligram. All the. Are the beads in the 30 milligram the same? There's just more of them in the 30? Cause I'm about to start, like, gathering all the beads into one container and I don't wanna mix them up if they're different. So make sense. I think they're all the same and that there's just more beads in the 30s, but I don't know. So pharmacy talk, let me know.",

But sometimes the classroom can feel like a battlefield in a war between teachers and kids. And now, as we reflect on the 2023 to 24 school year, we just wanted to come together with a special message for our students. Y'all won! Y'all won! Absolutely, y'all won! Y'all rude and y'all nasty. Not only can you not read, but you are on drugs and spectrums that did not even exist in 2006. On top of that, speaking riddles. Drizzler, Gia Cheeks, phantomtex. Look, COVID broke something we can't fix. But as for me myself personally, I have officially endured my last scuba di toilet. I am retiring. Come here, Damian. This is Damien. Tell them, young man. When I gave you a D on your math quiz, what did you say? Oh really? Cause you thought it was pretty funny in November. What did you say, Damien? Uh, I said you had a funky neck. That's right, he said I had a funky neck. Hell no! Y'all won! This is Jay, this is Kendall. These two got in a fight in my classroom and when I tried to break it up, they turned on me. I got peaced up by two 12 year old non binary asexuals. Y'all run! Come out! Sometimes I like a little packet of Crystal Light in my water and The kids just couldn't let it slide. Tell him what you said, Haley. I said you drink Crystal Light packets because you can't afford real lemonade. Yeah, then I found out the kids started go fund me for me, called Help Our Broke Single teacher buy some lemonade. It raised $10,000. Yeah! Y'all won this year. I live by one word. T S I D D A H N. That spells sit down. I say this word about 628 times a day. For example, if you don't sit down. Or perhaps, Kiara, I thought I told you to sit down. Or sometimes. I'm not gonna tell you again, Jennifer. Sit down. Anyway, kids, I give up. And there is liquor in this thermos.",

    "voice_to_text": "tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entire every time I tell somebody this story they have the most horrified look on their face and when I tell you I have tried to record this video 10 time and either the audio wasn't working or TikTok wouldn't keep my recording so let's hope this one works and I'm gonna tell you what happened to me in 2022 so this happened when my son was about five months old him and I were sharing a room now let me say this first he was sleeping eight hours completely through the night I was getting enough sleep I was sleeping the best I've ever slept currently and he's toddler right now so this is not sleep deprivation I wanna say that first and foremost and there are other people who are involved so let's get into it I was about to go to sleep for the night and I was scrolling on my phone and I'm at my parents house by the way at this point so I roll over in my bed with my phone to face the direction of my bedroom door which I had kept open before all this happened I hear somebody walking up the stairs which I assume is my brother because he had lived there too at the time but he stops at the top of the stairs and he kinda just like peeks into my room just a little bit and I know it's him because it's like his face and his his height and his hair like he had an afro at the time I that was the outline of my brother and so I look at him and I'm like what are you doing and he doesn't answer me he just keeps staring at me and I say again like what the fuck are you doing like why are you just staring at me at this point because it's dark I could only see the outline of him or it it moves in front like right center of my door and it's just staring at me and I look at him like Sam what what do you need this all happened in point zero zero zero five seconds okay so as soon as I realise that that is not my brother I sit up in bed like jolt jolt up in bed and as I do that I'm still staring directly at whatever it was it just disintegrates like sand into the air I don't know how else to explain it I sound crazy I know just sand just disintegrates and disappeared I don't go to sleep that night I'm wide awake freaked the fuck out but I don't say anything until the following week so at this point I shut my bedroom door because absolutely not I'm about to go to bed again I'm scrolling on my phone and I roll over once again to face the direction of the door this time in the pitch black it's the outline of my son's father and at first I was like why are you just standing there cause he was living with us at the time and then I realized in my brain do you stag and spend the night that night he's not supposed to be here and how could he get in my house at 10 o'clock at night when everybody's asleep it's the the exact same thing I grab my phone I turn the flashlight on but this time I saw like this again 0.005 seconds just like the super pale face no eyes no nose no mouth but like this menacing feeling attached to it and again just like sand gone so at this point I'm not a super religious person but I feel like I needed some Jesus Christ in this moment so I go to my parents I tell them what's been going on my parents were not a believer before this story um I've always had weird things happen to me throughout my life with paranormal stuff and they just don't believe me but I asked um my mom to get one of her close friends a close family friend to come pray over my room because she's done that type of work for years she goes and prays over people's houses who have spirits attached to them so to her is just to like entertain me and make me feel safer so the family friend comes over and she's like I'm gonna go pray over your room and see what's going on and I was like perf um she goes up there she's up there for like an hour for a very very very long time but who am I to judge I don't do seances you know what I mean I don't I don't know to sum it up with you when she did come back downstairs she talked to my mom for a bit and then she leave my mom told me that her friend told her that of all her years doing this she's never walked into a room or a house and got instantly chills all over her body and that's exactly what happened when she walked into my room she said she prayed over it for that long amount of time whatever was there was gone she uh rebuked it I guess in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but she said if it does come back she she like told me certain prayers to do to make it go away my parents from that day forward are complete complete believers in the spiritual realm I am as well I that was like so terrifying I haven't seen it since please Lord that was the wrong hand but you get it like I don't wanna see it ever again but yeah that's my uh terrifying story and I don't have any explanations for it I have so many other ones that also have witnesses to it but it's already super long so this is what I'm gonna keep it as but yeah uh so that's my unbelievable ghost story",

    "voice_to_text": "one time my house ghost had to fight another ghost or entity or spirit that had entered our house this started because my mother she worked at the hospital so you know the hospital spirits and all other sorts of things like to linger around it's one of those things where they just linger and then I get one of them decided to follow her home when I didn't come into her house well our house goes Joseph did not like that and I'm not sure that whatever had followed my mother home was good um by any means because the house we can always tell when something in the house is Joseph versus something else cause number one and there's a energy around Joseph that you just feel and you know it's a it's funny because I must say it's familiar and then I know people are gonna jump on and be like oh this familiar spirit this money trying to trick you Joseph has been with me since birth since before I was born Joseph was in the house we just happened to move into his house Joseph is still in that house I can go visit that house and Joseph will welcome me with open arms it's a bit overwhelming since I haven't been there in a while but there is a energy around Joseph that we know and sometimes Joseph actually shows himself to us and he showed himself a lot to us definitely when this other thing came in the house because I don't know that Joseph knew we can tell the difference between him and other spirits but during this time that this thing was in the house Joseph always let us see him and Joseph was a a older older white male I mean he he lived during the late 18 so he had that look worn look around him but still kind he didn't have those black eyes or whatever but um my mother came home and this is also um I found that later on and it's funny cause me and my mom actually talked about it the other day the issue was there was a lot of racism during that time with my mother being at the hospital so she had got accused of of stealing it turned out of course it wasn't her but it was just a really really bad period during that time my mother went through a lot of turmoil working there and this spirit came home we would be downstairs if you can hear upstairs like it was rumbling like bowling like sometimes it sound like a bowling alley sometimes it sound like people being body slam stuff being thrown around but if you actually went up the stairs you couldn't hear it which is weird you only heard it if you were downstairs and if you were upstairs then you heard it on the stairs but if you look on the stairs nothing there but it was really really bad like during that time and one you know sometimes it would be so loud you know my mom she would sit on that front porch just to get away from it because it was you know too much we'll come I'll come home you know from playing all day beating the street lights home and my mom be sitting on the porch so we know you know it's a lot of activity going on in the house more than normal so avoid that but the ghost I guess it was Joseph was over it this ghost had to freaking go and I think there's also the ghost that slapped me but that's a whole other story um this ghost had to get out of our house Joseph they fought so hard upstairs we were in the dining room they fought so hard upstairs that one of our ceiling tiles I don't I really haven't seen a ceiling like this outside of an old hotel where they had the squares in the ceiling for the little small squares about 12 by 12 for the ceiling tiles but they were fighting so hard up there that one of the ceiling tiles fell down while we were eating dinner and fell into the living room but it was so bad and you know we really didn't know what to do about it at this time this is the time that um my mom because it had got so bad this is the first time I actually seen my mom worried to my mom really my mom has seen spirits all of her life and it's passed down of course through her kids so seeing ghosts is nothing but this whatever was going on during this time really concerned my mother so she called over someone to try to cleanse the house Joseph ran that person off that person has never step foot back up in our house but Joseph ended up getting rid of this other ghost I mean it was just a fight it was a fight that had to be fight I don't I felt like it was a battle not of souls but of over something but it was crazy because after Joseph whooped up this ghost and tore up the of course they were fighting in my room so when I went upstairs my room looked like a tornado um went through it after this final battle um him expelling and ghost but there were several days after that Joseph was not around and of course neither was other ghosts but then when Joseph showed back up it's like he was so tired I guess exerting all of that energy babbling the other entity and everything that it took a toll and like either he just couldn't show himself to us for a while or he just needs to recharge but he finally came back but he was tired and he looked like he had been through a fight but then he finally got his energy back but yeah Joseph did not play about us anything evil coming at house you can be human you can be a spirit you can be whatever I don't care how much you say you you love god and that you don't believe in this if you are not about the right Joseph is not letting you be in our house and for all those who will sit there and be like the dead don't do this the dead don't do that save it because I know what I have experienced all of my life",

    "voice_to_text": "when I was 21 I was alone in my apartment one hot summer day when suddenly there was a brisk knock at my door so I answered the door and there was a woman who was like in her late 50s long brown ponytail Mickey Mouse T-shirt and she was breathing really heavily and her face was red and she was leaned over with her hands and her knees and she was like I'm not feeling very well get a glass of water from you and I was like yeah girl come on in because you know I'm an objectively intelligent person who's particularly fond of sesquipedelian prose but I never said I was street smart and back then my anxiety was more the like I think I have rabies for no discernible reason kind of anxiety rather than that everyone's a threat anxiety that I've since added into the mix so invite her in and she sits at my dining room table and I bring her a glass of water which she promptly chugs and I go on the kitchen to refill her glass of water and suddenly she's right behind me so she starts opening my cabinets and she's looking all around my kitchen and I'm so stunned I'm just standing there doing absolutely nothing so this apartment was pretty big it was a three bedroom two bathroom apartment that I only paid $570 a month for and off the kitchen there was a really long hallway that LED to the the bedrooms so she starts going down the hallway and she opens the first bedroom door which had nothing in it because I did a cheap apartment but I didn't actually have any stuff to put it inside no money so she's like why don't you have any stuff in here and I'm like I just don't have any stuff so she keeps going and she opens the next door which is a bathroom the next door which is a closet and she starts to open the second bedroom door but luckily I finally snap out of it and I'm like hey stop so she's like I'm sorry I wasn't trying to be nosy it's just me and my son wanna move into this apartment like so I was just just looking around so I kind of corral her back to the dining room she sits down and I give her the new glass of water and the living room the dining room are like an L shaped configuration so she kind of turns in her seat and looks towards the living room and she stares at it like sort of confused for a minute and suddenly she pops up out of her seat and she yells you don't have a TV and I'm like no I don't and she goes you don't have a TV you don't have a DVD player you don't have a stereo you don't have nothing and I'm like no and she goes well what do you do for fun and I was like well I was just reading a Wally Lamb book I got at the library crying like so when you leave I'll probably go back to that and she yells well that's stupid and then she leaves she's gone so I go back to my book and I'm sitting on my couch and I still just kind of think she's like a thirsty little weirdo with no ill intentions but like an hour later I look out my screen door and I realize that she's standing in the parking lot with this younger man and they're looking in windows and they just look really sketch and suddenly I'm like I think I just had my joint cased (that's Robber lingo) this woman was Harry in the policeman's costume the man is Marv and I'm the proverbial Peter Mccallister so I immediately alert the authorities and I tell the responding officer absolutely everything and I'm like hey make sure you jot down the part where she called me stupid cause I think that was actually a hate crime and he like sighs really heavily he puts his pen down he's like honey why did you let a stranger into your apartment and I was like I don't know homie I'm just intrinsically philanthropic and he was like okay well like let's not do that anymore and I was like I I'd already gotten there on my own yeah um so he looks around my apartment and he's like checking my windows and he's like well if I was a robber this apartment would be my prime target because you can slide these windows open really easily from the outside and I was like you can and he was like yeah so he tells me that I need to get broomsticks and cut them to size and like fit them into the window so that way they can't be slid open from the outside um and I'm like yeah I will definitely do that but then an hour later after the police officer had left he comes back with a bunch of dowel rods and a jigsaw and he just cut them and put them into my windows for me and he probably saved my life or the very least prevented the fact of my 10 inch television",

Because it says operation refers to instance when divine entities such as saints, Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ himself makes himself known to a person. And then it has the audacity to say to use extreme prudence, meaning skills. Because if you don't know what you doing and you approach a demon, then you know you can get possessed yourself.

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

    "voice_to_text": "I just picked my daughter up from dance class, and her stepmom has been telling everyone that she's her biological mom. Not just like, oh, yeah, mom, like, casually, just in, like, the middle of, like, nothing conversation of, oh, I'm. I'm the one picking her up. Her stepmom has been telling everyone that she is her biological mom. Like, having conversations about when she was pregnant with her. So I went into class today, and one of the other mothers came up to me and said, you must be Delilah's stepmom. And I go, no, I'm her mom. I gave birth to her. Weird. And she goes, what? No, no, Stephanie gave birth to her. Stephanie was telling us all about the preeclampsia that she had, that she had a seizure after she was born. This woman stole my birth story. My birth story that I went through. She's out here telling people that she was pregnant with Delilah, and she had preeclampsia, and she had seizures. She had to stay in the hospital with magnesium drip. Excuse me. And I go, excuse me? You've got to be. You got to be joking me. And she goes, no, like, we've all heard about Stephanie and how she gave birth to Delilah. And I was like, Stephanie wasn't even a picture when Delilah was born. Like, Stephanie was in high school when Delilah was born. But I can't believe that somebody would actually do that. She went on to tell People, how she picked out the name Delilah. Like, talked about how this woman is, like, trying to be me. So this woman goes on to tell the story of how I picked out the name Delilah for our daughter because it was me and my husband hanging the hammock in the backyard, swinging just on, like, a nice fall day. And hey there, Delilah came on the radio. And I already liked, like, the radio show, um, Delilah, the night time show. And so that's how I picked out the name. Stephanie had come to dance class and told all the other moms that she had picked up the name Delilah. Just like that. Explain the day, the whole thing. I don't know. She must have heard it from my ex husband, but I'm fuming",

random\u00a0old\u00a0white\u00a0women\u00a0in\u00a0corporate\u00a0America being like the biggest bullies you've ever encountered like so rude for no reason it's something that nobody on this planet prepared me for and we need to talk about it cause like why for what why is a random 45 year old woman named Linda beefing with me for no reason at all let me be clear when I start a new job I am a people pleaser like I am overly nice I want everyone to get along because I don't wanna keep going through the whole repeated pattern of like oh we're like a big family like toxic corporate work culture thing that keeps happening and it's literally the reason like I do freelance work now I don't wanna deal with these weird dynamics in workplaces cause recently I went down a side of TikTok where it was like women of colour coming forward and sharing that white women in corporate America were some of the worst people they have to deal with and I fully support them because they truly are their reasons for feeling that way are probably a lot different than mine but they really are and I genuinely don't know why because like is it good old fashioned misogyny they still genuinely like believe there isn't enough space in the corporate world for all women so they have to turn it into like a weird competition constantly I've worked in a number of them now and there's always at least one woman in there somewhere that is just determined to make your life miserable one job I had my boss was a woman and I noticed that everyone they hired for our department they purposely hired both women and women who were like super super young and I mean like they were either still in college or they had just graduated like that year they had to be 21 because she had a tendency to really infantilise all the people who reported to her and like wanted to be like a mentor that people looked up to but kinda like we're never on her level and I remember one day it's uh left out somehow that I was actually 24 and she thought the whole time I was like 20 or 21 and it was just a little bit awkward that was only where the problems began to start though because then one day when she was out of the office and like her boss though was in um he walked in on me doing some random work cause I got bored I finished all my work so I logged into the back end of the website we worked in marketing right but I have a degree in like uxy and all that other stuff and since I was bored I was fixing the coding and whatnot on the back end of the website asked my boss if I could do it she was like sure you got time cause the website was really messed up and he walked in you know we were chit chatting we were having a good time he saw that I was doing this and asked me about it and he was like really impressed he didn't know that I could do this and I was like yeah I mean no one's ever really asked me what my background is here at the company and literally like a few minutes later after he leaves I get an email cced with like my boss and other people that I've been promoted essentially aka they're just gonna pay me more but essentially the message of the email was like oh we see that you have a lot of value that you're important to the company and we like wanna make sure that you stay here and that's when the problems with my boss who sat above me really started I don't know exactly why but she started making my day to day life very difficult with like menial things for no reason like she would write up all the random mistakes that happened in the office not always mine not usually mine some of them were hers too and she would report me to HR so I'd have to go to HR and I don't know how to argue that like my boss is saying I did this ironically after that I then got written up and sent to HR for asking too many clarifying questions about stuff that I should know however I was just trying to make sure we didn't have any more mistakes at the company like it started to be a running joke in our department cause I was chill with everyone else in the department that like at any random given moment I could be just sent to HR to be lectured and yelled at or things that really just didn't make any sense it was like a funny running joke in the office because like everyone else was also starting to have problems with her so I felt pretty comforted in that fact but even back to the point where I was like crying in the bathroom at work most days and she still yelled at me for doing that because it was unprofessional but I specifically remember one day our big boss came back from a lunch with one of our co workers and so he was hanging out in like our office cause literally like six of us shared an office it was a really weird setup but we were all hanging out having fun we were joking we were laughing he and I were like shooting jokes back and forth and we were laughing our butts off I thought it was like a really good day and then I look over at her in the corner and she's giving me like the evilest look I've ever seen in my life and I don't know why I can't figure out why but I know that I'm about to be off once he leaves the room but after he leaves she literally just like packs up and leaves for the day and then the next day I come into the office and of course I get called into HR and she has told HR that everyone in our department all like seven or eight of us apparently have written up that they're uncomfortable with my behaviour at work and I'm sitting here bawling in HR cause I have no idea I everyone hates me essentially is what she's saying like no one wants me there like and I don't know what to say to that and I'm like could you give me some examples like I I don't wanna make everyone uncomfortable like could you tell me what I could do to change they can't give me a single example because there are none I remember I'm bawling she says go take a walk before you go back to the office because like I don't want people seeing this and I was just like no I went straight back to the office where all our co workers were bawling they're like what happened like what did you get written up for this time there's like apparently every single one of you filed a report about me and everyone's looking at each other going literally no one in here has ever complained about you once and they were all so sweet and understanding and comforting to me in that moment like I knew they were telling the truth but I did not wanna continue to fight this grown lady and our HR over this so I just wrote like my 2 weeks notice and I turned it in the next day and left the company and I won't lie slowly but surely pretty much everyone left after me because they also had these problems but I've definitely experienced like stuff like this in other companies too and I just don't understand like do they just not think we can all coexist is it because it's like marketing and like marketing is considered a young person's game so they feel threatened like I don't know but it's wild and no one tells you that this is going to be another thing you get to deal with later in life",

As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief. And especially when this is happening while this genocide is taking place in Gaza. This mass murder of the Palestinian people is unacceptable. And the danger that the occupation of Palestine is causing for Jews. And on top of all, why in a synagogue? Why in a holy place? This is either a political move or a financial move. All of this is embarrassing for Jewish people, and as I said, dangerous to Jewish people as well. We should be very careful. Never allowed the completion of Zionists, would you? If one criticizes Zionists. I appreciate that, and I'll tell you why. Because I appreciate the people that define the right definition to what they criticize. Rather than criticizing Jews, which I discouraged to do. I visited Gaza. Yeah, and they did meet me. We are here to teach the world.

Anybody who is teaching, uh, in a university, or anyone who is, uh, putting content on social media should be held responsible for what they include and what they exclude. And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East, is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted. Pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there.",

I have whatever you like. And I'm sure he probably made some kind of joke like, I'll take the peach, a juicy one. I really don't know, but all I heard her say was, you're a miss, ain't you? And it was like the most Uncomfortable, awkward conversation ever. Anyway, she's sitting there just mixing his drink up. Probably think about spitting in it. He decides to take it upon himself to show her a photo on his phone of his little pee pee. Yo. Yes, he showed her a photo of his little pee pee. Okay, that's so sexual harassment. Of course, the owner was like, no, that ain't happening in my stower. And I put the dude on blast. Like, if you know this guy, he's disgusting. This is what happened in my stower. It's at the end of. No, it's not. It gets even better. It seems like biscuit here calling someone into marrying him, like, two or three days after this whole incident. Did she find out about it? Yes, she did. While I have yet to find out her response, his response was, I was just trying to enjoy my last few days of freedom. I got so many questions right now. Some weird people in this world, y'all.",

Like, I've never just fully stood up and left and said, leave me alone in the middle of the date. But there's a first time for everything. I still can't fully believe that this happened. So we went to go get drinks and appetizers, and this all happened at like a minute 24. So we had drinks but no food. We like, just started talking. I knew pretty early on in the date that I wasn't that into him, but I still try to keep an open mind if I go on a date and like within the first 10 minutes and like, this is probably not someone I would date, cause you never know. Sometimes people are just nervous. They take a second to open up. Generally speaking, I just was not feeling it. But we're just making conversation and we start talking about like, what we like to do on the weekends. And he's like, oh, I like to go to church. And he says, you're Jewish, right? Because on my profile where we matched, it said that I'm Jewish, cause I am. But he said it really loudly and we were in public. He was like, oh, you're Jewish, right? And just generally with the culture of how things are right now, I don't Tend to like, scream that I'm Jewish in public places because people are insane. So I kind of made a joke and was like, I am, but I don't have to, like, scream it in public places. Very light hearted, just kind of poking fun at the fact that he had, like, said it quite loudly. He proceeded to spew the most antisemitic, offensive bullshit I've ever heard in my life. Like, in this monologue, the phrase I would be embarrassed to be a Jew came out of his mouth. So I don't really know where he got the audacity or why he went out with me, if he hates Jewish people because he literally knew that I was Jewish, or if he just wanted an opportunity to say a bunch of anti Semitic bullshit to a Jewish person. Not really sure what he was getting out there, but I got up and left because I just. I have a zero tolerance for that. So that was a first. Um, as I was walking away, he was like, let me know if you wanna play pickleball sometime. I was like, what part of me, like, literally leaving this date 27 minutes and makes you think that I wanna play pickleball with you? Like, actually, go fuck yourself. So, yeah, I don't even know what to say. Normally my stories have some kind of lesson at the end where I'm like, but then I Learned. But I'm, like, just really angry. About this one. So see ya",

It has officially been a year and a few weeks since we seen my niece. My niece is my brother's child. Now, I can say it probably is my fault that the girl is mad at us. It probably is. But the situation wasn't even that deep for her to be taking it to the extent that she's taking it. So since I felt like it is my fault, I've reached out to her. Now that it's been a year, I feel like somebody got to be the bigger person, so I reached out to her. Of course. Of course, I got no response, which I already knew. But I'm just trying to figure out, like, when can everybody put their feelings to the side and, like, just do what's best for the child? Like, my brother is not at a place right now where we can do joint custody or go to court or do anything like that. So us as his family, we want to step up and be there, because we know he physically can't. And it's like, why is. Fuck us for what we do. And here's the text message that, um, I sent her and that she didn't reply. And I felt like I was very, you know, nice about the situation. Like, it's been over a year. Boo. She has a Whole another side of family. Even though my brother, your baby daddy, is not doing his part, why shut the whole family out? Why? So at this point right now, I'm just wondering, like, what's next? What do I do? Um. Like, what's next? Like, what is there to do? Keep begging you? Like, keep hitting you up? Like, keep trying to reach out? Like, she's about to be two in September. We missed her first birthday party. Is a whole lot of milestones that were missing at this point because of my brother or whatever the case he got going on. And why should we, his family, be the one that has to, you know, suffer? Or even a child? Because the bigger picture is, the child suffers. Is a whole side of family that she doesn't even know. Because of argument, altercation that adults had, that adults could have talked out. Um, so, yeah, I'm at a point now. I'm like, you know, what should we do? Should I keep texting her? Should I pull up to her house? What do I do?",

And I feel like this is something that I have to do, because y'all just expect authenticity for me, and I feel like that's what I need to do. So pretty much, um, I am on kidney dialysis.

I haven't been doing what I was supposed to do. Take your protein. Listen to your body and take your protein. Um, so I am on kidney dialysis. Nothing is wrong with my kidney.

And when I woke up and they took the tube out my mouth, well, I woke up, they took the tube out my mouth, and literally, seven doctors or MDs could not believe that I was up and just up talking, so. And fun fact, my parents are making me move in with them. Haha. I'm so. I'm technically been in a hospital for 4 weeks now. Yeah.

A plan is currently being worked on by the superintendent to introduce year round schooling to Philly. Instead of one huge summer break, students will now get smaller breaks throughout the year in addition to holidays. The goal of this is to end the summer slide that happens where kids forget stuff over the long summer break. But it's not gonna happen just yet. First 20 schools are gonna be selected to test run this year round school program. And then for this upcoming school year, things will look mostly the same with expanded after school programs. Then the year after that, the 20 schools that were selected will begin the year round school calendar. We don't know which 20 schools will be selected yet, and we don't have any specific details on what a year round calendar will look like, so I'll update you when that stuff comes out.",

Sis said rise king and he did 12 likes. I love this trend. God damn. You won. She at girl. What kind of seasoning you used on this one? Now let's flip the roles real quick. If black men was coming out here, posting on this app, showing the before and after of they white wives and they other race wife saying they put seasoning on them, cause all the seasoning really is like you, you. You could just tell they've been involved in black culture and not a little bit culture. That's really all the seasoning that they put. But if black Man was doing this with a white wives and a Hispanic and Asian wives, Oh, my god. We wouldn't be able to breathe. I'm black. My daughter black. Her mama black. She got four black grandparents. But if I was in these comments asking, oh, what season you put on that one, man, what? Y'all will be giving me hell. And don't act like y'all wouldn't",

Next to him is his mother, Islam. Next to her in the back is Nesma. She's nine. And in front of her is her sister Sana, who is five. In the foreground on the far right is Ahmed. He is the father. I've been in contact with this family every day for the past week. And I have received updates and many, many photos before and after. We've had video chats. We are in constant contact. First we need to raise $150 per person, coming to $900 total for updated passports. Then we need $5,000 per adult, $2,500 per child under sixteen to cross into Egypt. And then we'd like to raise provisions for them to sustain life for as many months as we can after that. I've put a thing to my thing in my thing where you can find me and you can click and go do the stuff. So I don't have a huge platform, but there's. There's a big pocket full of you here. So if y'all can donate what you can, that would be amazing. Um, I really wanna help this Family. And I want you guys. I hope that you guys can help me help them. So let's do this.

Because the reality of it is, we're no longer those same people. And if you're a victim of childhood trauma, it's probably imperative that you get rid of some of those people from your past. When you grow up in the fucking war zone, in your home, you know, people constantly yelling, drinking, doing drugs, hitting, fighting, all of those things, your mind as a child is kind of, you know, unstable. You know, you may be prone to violence or anger issues or cry a lot. You may be prone to having friends who control you, manipulate you, all of those things. And you don't know that because you're a kid. You're going through so much trauma that you don't know how to process, um, your feelings. You don't know how to decipher who's really your friend or not, because you're so used to toxic relationships. I had a best friend of over 20 years. We fell out for about 5, 7 years, and we reconnected recently this year. It took me less than a month to realize that she was not healthy for me. You know, she was still doing the same things that she had been doing 10, 15, 20 years ago. You know, she was still going to the same places, doing the same job. And although consistency is beautiful, Like, so is evolution, you know, we're all growing to become better humans, better versions of my. Of ourselves. And if I find someone still doing the same things that they were doing when we were kids, still thinking the same way, still having the same problems as they did when they were children, that's a big red flag for me. But the biggest thing that made me not wanna be her friend anymore is that she kept reminding me of who I used to be. I'm not ashamed of the little girl that I had to be to fight through trials and tribulations. I'm not ashamed of the things I had to do when I was a young woman, the struggles that I had to overcome into adulthood. I'm not ashamed of any element of who I was or who I had to be to become who I am today. But what I'm not gonna tolerate is folks, you know, down talking the old version of me, reminding me, like, oh, like I haven't changed, like I'm not capable of change. And it just put me in this uncomfortable kind of dark place, and I just didn't wanna be a part of that. You know, I want people in my corner that are seeing the changes in me, knowing who I am today, respecting who I am today, and not constantly trying to belittle my accomplishments by reminding me how far I came from when I was a kid.

    "voice_to_text": "The Micah Miller's cause of death has now officially been released as of about 15 minutes ago now according to the Robeson County Medical Examiner Micah's cause of death was revealed to be a self inflicted firearm wound he went on to say the base on the nature of the wound that is consistent with a self inflicted you know wound and it was not in the back of the head as been rumoured and speculated now Doctor Johnson who releases information was not the on call medical examiner the weekend that Michael Miller passed away however he did say that he went to the scene to help assist the on call medical examiner now I definitely wanna know y'all thoughts on all of this but before I do this is also something that's pertinent to share with you guys now this was actually sent out to the members of Solid Rock Church which is the church that Pastor John Paul Miller is the head of and what it's saying is basically they have released him from all functions for the time of healing counsel guidance and pursuant to our governing instrument now here's what I'm going to say I'm gonna say that this is my personal opinion so take that for what it's worth I am still not fully convinced that Micah took her own life however let's say that this truly was a self inflicted wound I would still argue that with the abuse that is coming out what we have seen that Michael went through that John Paul would still be responsible for that death given everything that he put this woman through and if I am off base you can tell me that but that is my personal opinion",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. I'm not sure how many of you are aware that content creator Aaron Hadtimer has started an initiative where she is partnering up other creators and influencers with families in Gaza who have Gofundme's in order to help raise money and evacuate as many people as possible. We all know that no one person can do it all, so she is assigning some of us volunteers, our adopted families, to maximize reach and help raise as many funds as possible. When I Learned about this, I knew I wanted to participate, but the algorithm doesn't always favor me, so I'm gonna need a lot of your help in the upcoming weeks to try to reach my adopted family school. This is the Shaheen family. A father, a mother, two sons, and their respective families, including two very, very young children. Their daughter, Amani, was lucky enough to leave Gaza, and she is organizing this gofundme on their behalf. Family is currently in the south of Gaza in a building that's housing over 80 other displaced people. There is not enough food or water, and they all take turns sleeping because there is also not enough mattresses or blankets. This includes the babies, Yusuf, who's only three and a half years old, and baby Ahmed, who is just a year old. Ahmed has osteomalycia, which obviously can't be properly treated where they are. I will be posting about the Shaheen family until their goal of \u00a360,000 is raised. I am Begging you all to give what you can, even if all you can is $5. There are enough of us on this platform to truly make a difference. Even if we all pull together, we can get this family out of Gaza through the Egyptian border, which is a money's ultimate goal. Please help by liking, commenting, sharing, reposting, and go to the link in my bio to find their gofundme. I know that we can't help everyone everywhere, as much as we may like to, but we can help here. Let's help this family, please.",

    "video_description": "this is from the perspective of an independent unsigned solo artist who would need to hire session musicians to form a band. the winner doesn't only have to pay for travel and accommodation for themselves and their band, but they would also need to pay the musicians they hire - unless they're lucky enough to not have to pay them as sometimes musicians will agree to do these things for free, for example if they're your friend. all of these plus various unexpected costs that pop up. this whole 'play for exposure and do it for free' really contributes to the exploitation of artists - it's not fair, we need to start getting paid for our time and efforts, and stop going to these awful promoters for gigs and opportunities. sure I love what I do I love singing on stage and writing songs etc but I'm reaching a point where I understand what I'm worth and I'm less willing to entertain things like this. and lots of other artists are as well and I'm here for it. dont get me wrong there are some instances where I would gig for free but in those instances I would get compensation/value from something else, whether that's free food and drink or the opportunity to work with some really influential people. #livemusic #promoters #newmusic #singing #independentartist ",

Which comes out to about $540 US Because this video is over a minute long I am hoping we can raise more money just with YOUR engagement but here's what I need you to do: I need you to watch the ENTIRE video -  I know people are busy I know this is an app where you wanna consume a lot really quickly please be patient, hit the 2 x to go faster, please watch the entire video.

And stories like this are the exact reason why I look at you funny. Man makes miracle recovery after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and he was left underwater. After being hospitalized for more than two weeks, a 26 year old man from Louisiana is officially off life support. Doctors described Christopher Gilbert's survival as a miracle after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and left underwater for nearly ten minutes. Gilbert and a group of his friends were at a lakefront restaurant when he ended up in the water, leaving him with significant rain damage and on life support. His friends, right? Family attorney Claudia Payne said Gilbert's friend group initially reported to police that he had fallen into the lake. However, after an investigation was conducted, it was said that he was allegedly pushed into the water by a girl in the friend group. Gilbert's legal team is demanding and arrest be made. They also want the restaurant owners to be held accountable for not keeping him safe. So far, no arrests have been made and activists are demanding justice and answers. I'm not even an activist and I need answers. I want answers like now. But let's get into the real story, you feel me? A white woman pushed An aspiring black doctor into a lake knowing he couldn't swim. The woman also lied to his parents and the police saying he fell into the lake. They also watched him for 10 minutes struggling before bystanders who did not know him intervened. Uh huh. And I know when said friends concocted this little plan, cause this was definitely premeditated. I'm not hearing it was premeditated. When they sat there, got together, and made up this little plan of what they was gonna do, they did not think of the possibility of him surviving it. They thought he was going to drown that way. They already had the story that they wanted to tell. It was already set in stone. This man was on his way to be a doctor. He was on his way to make a change in this world. A black man on his way to greatness. And they tried to stop him from that. You would like to donate to Chris's cause? I've already donated. The link to his gofundme is under this thread on Twitter is still up, so just type in that name and you'll be able to find it. Mr. Chris, we see what's going on. We know what's going on, just like you know what's going on. And we are behind you. We as in black people. We are behind you. I promise you.",

You know, if you don't learn anything else from crackheads, they are living proof that where there's a will, there's a way.

You know, whatever they identify as, they somehow knew that there was a generator on your mother's roof. They knew that they could get their hands on that generator, possibly sell it and buy some crack. They went out of their way to climb up to this roof, get this generator, climb back off of the roof with a generator. Let's just stop and picture that you're climbing off of a roof, you're scaling down somebody's house with a generator. Or because you want some crack. That is dedication. And we give crackheads this negative stigma, and for good reason. But there's good things about them too. You can learn from a crackhead. Okay, go follow your dreams. Go make some goals, bitch. Go follow them. Those New Year's resolution to forgot about. Go, go pull it. Pull it up in the notes app. Go back to those resolutions and go. Go fix something.

So my husband and I were talking about the comments on this video where this comment was left, and, like, he was a latchkey kid and was left alone starting at age 5 during the day. And I was sharing a different situation in which we were left alone as very, very young children. And maybe it's because we lived in Germany. And that's why I was saying, like, hey, Europeans, what. What is your experience? Because I think it was much more common in Germany in the early eighties that when you put your kid in the crib at night, like, they're expected to be in bed. They're safe. They're in a crib. Nothing bad is gonna happen to them. So you can go out on a date. You don't need. You don't need childcare. You don't need a sitter. They're in bed. What's gonna happen to them? They're definitely not gonna have issues in the middle of the night. They're definitely not gonna get out of bed and need a parent. They're in bed. We told them to stay in bed. Why not have a date? And you definitely don't need a babysitter. Why would you pay someone to be supervising your kid who is just sleeping in bed? And my husband, the lash key kid, thought that Was wild. So, Americans, was that something that happened to you, or was that kind of a European experience? And Europeans, is that something that y'all still do today? Because I know here in America, we would never consider, like, once our kids are tucked in for the night, that we can just go out and do whatever. And there doesn't need to be a responsible caregiver in the house. I certainly could never imagine having left my infant at home while I went out on a date, like Home Alone. Thinking about how parents justified that as good parenting is. Yeah.",

    "voice_to_text": "And you're talking about Drake in Atlanta and is not like us video. It like resurfaces memory. That is just wild. 2016, I'm a sophomore in college. I decide finally, okay, maybe I'll rush. For the very short period of time that I was involved in the sorority, obviously I was in the group chats, and there were pictures that circulated of Drake visiting our sorority lodge in the middle of the night. I can't remember if somebody had dmed him on Instagram and he responded or he just took it upon himself. I have spent the past few days trying to find those photos. I can picture them. And it was our sorority lodge. He was in front of it taking pictures. There were pictures of him with girls that I knew. We are 18 in these photos, so I guess too old for Drake, but he, he was happy to come visit. Looking for these photos, I decided to look up like, Drake visiting the sorority lot to see if somehow they got leaked. I found this. This story should encourage college students maybe not to drink quite as much and pass out. You never know who may pop by your dorm room. In this case, it was Drake. People paying a visit to course Drake University on his idle leg of his Summer Sixteen tour. After rocking at the Wells Fargo Arena dressed in college gear, he shared his views of the school's sign on Instagram. Also 2016. Also, it's the same sorority he went around visiting. Like the theta sororities way they fucking spin it is weird as shit. Because I guess everyone's trying to just justify this grown man going, it's not that they all drank and passed out, it's that it was 4:00am. At least I know for the photos and videos that were from my sorority, it was 4:00am. See there going door to door, surprising unsuspecting sororities. Nice try, Drake. Take a look. Kappa Alpha Beta. I'm out here waiting on you. Waiting on you. Fucking weird. Where were you girls? What the fuck? Another reason not to drink too much and pass out. You know, I'm here for you. I'm here for you girls. So fucking weird as I had completely forgotten about all of this and then listening to just them talking about Drake in Atlanta. Like, you know, I've had friends, They see Drake at the club or they see him in a restaurant in Atlanta. Okay, whatever. But that's not this. It was like well known. It was well known. If you really wanted to, you can get one of the new recruits to DM Drake on Instagram and he would come and visit. Like, I feel like I'm going crazy cause I cannot find these photos, but I was not expecting finding that news clip of him doing it at Drake University. By the way, again, same sorority. Before y'all think, oh, I'm conflating the Two. No, that I remember looking at these photos cause it was specifically outside of our lodge with our sign and him on our campus at 18:19. I thought it was really fucking cool. 27, I'm so creeped out. Especially with the sorority sisters being asleep. That clip at least he was going around a bunch of college campuses, I think, visiting sororities in the middle of the night.",

    "voice_to_text": "So in lieu of recent videos that I have done, I have a couple stories for people now. I advocate for the clients. I think it's important for clients to be educated, but I will also stand up for artists, because education and the truth are invaluable. So I got a couple stories. About 10 years ago, I tattooed in Florida. And in Florida, you can tattoo minors as low as the age of 16, as long as you have parental consent. High school kid comes in, big Samoan. He wants some Samoan tribal. I do my best. He's happy, she's happy. All is good. I go over strict aftercare with every client I tattoo, especially in the last 10 to 15 years, because I noticed a trend. Wash the tattoo three to five times a day with gold dial antibacterial soap. Uh, let it air dry for about 15 minutes. Then use a regular amount of white unscented lotion. It's not a cupcake. You do not need to ice it. Anyway, this kid gets his tattoo. So two to three weeks later, him and the mom come back in, and she is very upset. She is demanding that we pay for doctor visits, medicine, and she wants her money back for the tattoo. The kid lifts his sleeve up, he's keloided. Uh, there's a clear infection. And the shop that I work at, we took health standards pretty serious. So I start asking questions. Well, come to find out, This kid wasn't taking care of his tattoo the way I told him. He was also picking the scabs causing the keloid. And after further conversation, unbeknownst to the mother, he'd went to football practice, put on dirty shoulder pads with a sleeveless shirt on. And they wondered where he got the staff infection from. Second story. I did a tattoo on a young lady's foot. Part of my aftercare is do not submerge your tattoo for 10 to 14 days. And when I say submerge, I tell them I mean a pond, a river, a swimming pool, a hot tub, a bathtub. She comes back in a week later, her tattoo looks terrible. Come to find out through conversation, she went to the beach the next day. She thought it was okay because when I said, don't submerge it in a body of water, I didn't list off the beach. So don't be so quick to blame the tattoo artist all the time. Because some of you don't know how to follow fucking directions. Have the day you deserve.",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entirely true. When I tell this story to this day, people do not believe me. When I was a freshman in college, I was going to a private school in Pittsburgh. I was leaving the next year. I was going to a different school. So my friends and I, some of us were leaving, some of us were moving, whatever. We decided we wanted to kind of hit all the different spots in Pittsburgh that we really like. So we went to, like, Mount Washington, for those of you don't know, it's like a really nice lookout over Pittsburgh. And there was a place near our school, and it was called the fountain of youth. It was essentially just like a well that people in the town used to go to when it was in use. So we went there. It was night time. It wasn't like midnight. It was like nine or so. It wasn't super late. Um, we went there, and the way that this well was set up, it was, like, carved. There was a piece carved out of a rock formation, and then you'd walk in and then get water out of the well inside of it. So the. The people who are, like, shorter or smaller, they went inside and, like, I'm tall, so I wasn't gonna, like, go in there, but other girls were going inside and just, like, checking it out and seeing What it looked like. And the rest of us were standing outside taking pictures, just like, messing around, waiting, hanging out, you know, talking. The girls inside, one of them said, hey, I can kind of hear, like, rocks moving around in here. It sounds like there's something else in here. And we were all like, okay, well, that's probably an animal. So just like, come out. So as she's like, leaving and coming out and saying, like, I can hear something in here, the girls who are outside, my. Me specifically, my phone died. Turned off completely. It was at 70, 80%. It was not anywhere close to dying. Turned off, died. Other girls phone started dying. Then we heard a growl. And it did not sound like a animal. It sounded more like a human being. Trying to mimic what an animal sounds like when they growl. And we found this out later. That the girls inside the cave heard the same exact thing. Coming from inside the cave. We heard it outside in the woods. We all run and book it to the car. We get back, we're all like, we're done. That's it. Whatever. I'm going to take a shower. I'm changing. And I see in the mirror, handprints on my shoulder. Like someone just grabbed it like that and left those prints. I tell everybody, check yourselves, because I just found this on myself. The one girl who was in the well lifts up her Shirt, I look, she has three scratch marks down her back. I was like, nope, we're done. I started praying. I said, if there's something attached to us, get it away from us. I want no part of that. And that was it.",

    "voice_to_text": "hi everyone my name is Britney and myself and hundreds of my neighbors need like desperate help um we are facing something that is quite literally unfathomable unimaginable and um I apologize if at any point I get emotional during this it's been a really hard um since finding out that this was gonna be happening context will be in a second but um yeah I just hope that you have however long this video is please take the time just to watch it if you can to support um and if anybody knows anything or anything that we can do um that would be great I bought a condominium back in 2022 and this was a huge deal um I was 21 years old and had the opportunity to own a house who in this world would not want that right I realize that not a lot of people my age get to have this opportunity so it's something that I don't take lightly it's just great right and it was great um up until April 23rd of this year when everything kind of started going completely downhill also I might be looking off to the side a little bit because I have numbers and I wanna share them with you all so that you can understand like the gravity of this situation so when I bought my condo I was paying my mortgage payment and then a $315 HOA fee monthly not yearly monthly fine whatever right after I moved in couple months we were approached myself and all the other owners were approached by a company that was looking to buy us all out of our homes and turn our condominium complex into an apartment complex at the time they offered many of us amounts that didn't really make sense for us to want to agree to this and they also were not taking into consideration people who had fully renovated units versus people who had regular units and they were giving offering us the same price so as a community we banded together to fight for that and fight against that and it didn't go through at the end of 2022 we elected a new board of directors and then we were informed that we would have an increase in our HOA fees from $315 a month to $414 a month so understandable also I'd like to say that the amounts that I provided so far are specifically for my unit I live in an 810 square foot unit and those are my fees in December of 2023 so fast forward a year we were notified that our HOA dues would be increasing from $414 a month to $651 a month and most of it was due in part to insurance and the Surfside condominium collapse in Miami and laws that were passed to ensure the safety of our community at this time uh several owners realized that the board of directors were not who I guess we thought I'm not 100% sure on that honestly um but the main thing was that they got together to create a ballot to recall the current board and elect actual residents who live in our complex which should be already a standard but it is not so once we found out the board of directors wasn't I guess who we thought we elected um it was discovered who they actually were and they have a company one of them at least is an owner of a company who has done this to multiple condominium complexes all around the Orlando Florida area which is where um this is all happening all of these people as well are on aboard at another condominium complex in another area of Orlando and they are doing the same thing to them as well so some of us signed a ballot to recall the board some of us didn't and we went forward but on April 23rd that's when we were provided a letter in the mail that literally pretty much has changed all of our lives and will change all of our lives if it actually passes so because of the Surfside collapse there was a law created that condominium complexes have to fully fund their reserves which fair understandable right if something happens we wanna be able to have the money whatever and I guess in the years past they have waived this the board of directors in the previous years waived this so nobody had been paying the fees so there's a lot of millions of dollars missing that needs to be made up so our board of directors put a plan in place that will be voted on by them not us on May 15th and I'm recording this on May 3rd and they get the vote we don't get a vote we don't get a say and they will be charging the following fees so first there will be a special assessment fee which will help to begin to fully fund our reserves and this fee would range from $11,148 to $22,104 my 810 square foot unit home would be assessed a $15,569 fee 50% of this would be due June 30th and the other 50% would be due July 31st obviously this is distressing in and of itself because who has thousands of dollars lying around to be due in literally two months like I don't know where I personally would come up with the money like I have a full time job I work 40 hours a week but I do not make enough money to have that much money saved up I I don't and it's not just me there's so many families that live here and like elderly people and just it doesn't matter who we are it's it's just really hard to think that these are real people like with real lives that are being affected so on top of the special assessment fee they also would be raising our monthly HOA dues effective June 1st these dues would range from $1,486 to $2,590 for my specific unit 810 square feet I would go from paying $651 a month to $1,824 a month and this is effective June 1st if they pass this on the fifteenth I genuinely hope that somebody can provide guidance on this like we understand that the fees need to be paid and that the reserves need to be funded and all those things but the takeaway here is that like in two months nobody can come up with this money nobody and on top of coming up with that money then have an increase in dues that much personally again this is in Orlando Florida so I've like reached out and also I used to uh rent an apartment here and there are 100% apartments that I could go right now and rent for actually less than the $1,800 but about that much for like a comparable unit and to top all this off I'm still paying my mortgage so I still have a mortgage payment on top of this these exorbitant fees so I just I come to you the community of TikTok I\u2019ve really not ever made anything like this before so I'm just hoping that somebody can help like give advice provide guidance help us because it's and it's not just me like honestly like I've to be so real and honest with you guys like I've never felt so sad and like scared and just hopeless in my whole life like I feel hopeless honestly like if we don't recall the board and make sure that everything halts I don't look I'm gonna have to sell the house I worked so hard to buy in the first place and I'm scared that I won't even be able to buy a house ever again you know and I know I'm really privileged to have this place in the first place but honestly with everything that's happened to us it's it's like is it worth it and at what cost cause this is causing many people to to freak out like literally so please please I beg of you honestly if anybody can say anything in the comments down below message me on here Instagram wherever please I just I really need help and my neighbors need help and my community needs help and I want to hopefully be able to provide some sort of help for these people and myself",

You think to start on Monday, you think to start on Wednesday, you gets pushed back to Thursday, gets pushed back to one week later, then one month later, then you forget and you don't do the thing at all. How many of you have had a moment like that before? And then the next moment, you see somebody else has launched that thing that you were thinking about. How many of you had that moment before? But you see it, you see on supermarket shelf, you see it on the internet. We are human vessels who can use this non physical, this non physical energy. We can use it through us. When we're using it, it will stay here. If we're not using it in and out using it, it will have to move somewhere where it gets attention so it can start flowing again. Are you guys understand what I'm saying? Right? In this room, you can have a lot of ideas. I'll bounce an idea of you, you bounce an idea of me. The bouncing of ideas. We're using the energy. We're using the Qi, we're using the flow, right? Qi means energy. Okay? So we allow it to flow, but if we are no longer here, there's no attention here. So where does it go? It goes somewhere else. Where there's A vessel which will pay what attention to the energy? And it will be used there. Okay, so how does it work? Is very simple. What happened? Well, the energy was with you at that time. It was moving. It was flowing through you. If you could ground it with your physical skills, you would have been the manifesto of that energy into this physical realm. You would be in the greater. But because you didn't, you didn't give it the attention it needs. It needed to find somebody who could hold that capacity and make that big energy into a physical reality. So that is how energy is flowing all of the time. It's one collective energy, one collective library. Somebody's gonna do it. I don't know who's got a big enough vessel and equipped enough to make that happen, but somebody's gonna do it. Or you can be the one that one day the energy came to me, said hi, and I said bye. So I have had that idea before. Yes, I have. But I said bye. If you have had that idea before, what if I was to tell you you can look it from different perspective. What if we can say universe chose you?",

And all for the sake of getting three cry face laugh emojis. Is it worth it? You got that fucking right. It's worth it. Couple months ago in our group, one of our closest friends, his dog died, which is obviously devastating, but not as devastating as the memes we made. He didn't even tell us his dog was dead cause he knew he'd make fun of them. We had to find out from his wife's Facebook page. She did a sad little post about it. We all scream, grabbed it, put it in the group, were like hi, your dog dead? And he was like yeah! And we were like, ah, that'll teach you to love something. And then we found this dead dog. For an hour now. The reason we made fun of this dead dog isn't cause we were glad the dog was dead. We love that dog. It was such a good dog. I miss that dog. The reason we made fun of this dead dog isn't because we find dead dogs funny. Very rarely do we find dead dogs funny. The reason we made fun of this dead dog is for the same reason that most people make horrible jokes after something bad happens. And it's not because they're evil, and it's not because they're malicious, and it's Not because they're heartless, it's because the joke pops into your head and that's it. Something bad happens and you go, oh, no. And your brain goes, say this, though, and that's it. And if you don't say the joke, it's not like it fucks off. It just sits there again, funnier and funnier, funnier, funnier. And it begins to roll your brain. And that's how you get brain cancer. I am a scientist. It's. It's like having diarrhea. Holding it in doesn't achieve anything. You just have to admit that you're not well and be like, I'm very sorry, I'm incredibly sick. I have to get this out of my system, otherwise I might explode. Ah. Thank you for your patience. Sorry for your loss. So we spent an hour just making silly jokes about his dead dog. I say we. I didn't. I spent 45 minutes of that hour very carefully photoshopping an image of Thanos clicking his fingers and his dog disappearing from the arms of his four year old daughter. And you'll. You'll never convince me that that's not the funniest thing I've ever done in my goddamn life. Five cry face laugh emojis from all nine boys. I build a perfect gang. You never say that. Never happens.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm outside the Boeing facility here in Renton, Washington. It's after midnight. I got a bizarre scene happening here behind me. 12:01. Boeing decided to deactivate the security access cards for all of their firefighters and all of their EMTs, as well as pull their parking passes and remove them from the property. They say that they're going to a contingency plan while trying to negotiate a contract. That contingency plan, a large part of it is you, the taxpayer, because now they'll be calling 9 1 1 and calling rent and fire out here. Is they don't have enough staff on hand anymore. They say this is part of a contract negotiation. However, this is the same company that now is in one of the biggest PR crisis ever, now that they have planes that nose dive out of the sky and kill everybody on board. Door plugs falling out of planes. Recently, a ramp fell off one of their planes, and in a bizarre twist of fate, landed near the property of a lawyer suing them for the door plugs. Here's the story. This has been brewing for a little bit, as a union for the firefighters and Boeing have been in contract negotiations. What makes us unique, though, is that the firefighters said they're happy to continue working during negotiations. That aren't striking. But Boeing said, take our last offer, or we will remove you from the property. Which is also a problem, as Boeing's facilities are Only approved for construction if they have on site firefighting abilities to a certain level as cities can't take the whole workload. Tonight there's one chief on the property instead of the usual five to six firefighters. Obviously, I feel passionately about this one, and I do have some level of bias because if you didn't know, I'm also involved in the firefighting in EMS world and my other life. I'll have more info on that and this shortly.",

He was older guy, you could tell that he had a mental condition. Every. Every fucking employee in the store was laughing at him. I'm shaking, I'm so mad right now. Every employee in this damn store was laughing at him. And there's this little bitch ass cop came up in here just now and removed him. He was standing in line behind me just getting a little SIM cord. Wasn't bothering anybody. Whenever the cop walked back in from escorting this man out of the store for doing absolutely nothing, for having mental issues, I asked that cop, I said, sir, what was he needing? I'll get it. Boring. He wasn't bothering anybody. I think he's got mental issues. He said, yeah, but he might have been intoxicated, you know, you never know. And I said, this is what the fuck I do know. I have a special needs son. Is this the way we're treating people? He said, well, maybe you need to open up a clinic, motherfucker. Who y'all? I'm. I'm. Hmm. When you see somebody acting like that with somebody, say something. Fucking say something. Don't join in and laugh with them. Walmart and Hammond, Louisiana. You fucking pathetic. Put Our shit up. I'm like nothing from here. Let's go. And, sir, the one that they, um, decided to run out of Walmart tonight. I'm sorry that you got treated that way. I don't care if you were an addict. I don't care if you were an alcoholic or has special needs. Nobody fucking deserves that. If you're an employee for Walmart and Hammond, Louisiana, and you witness this tonight, if you were a customer and you witness this tonight and didn't stand up and say anything to these motherfuckers, you're just as fucking pathetic as that damn runner cop was",

Now, keep in mind that this is before cell phones. And also to note, I didn't have a wallet to make a pay call. Anyway, so I walked half a mile to a phone, and I called home, and no one answered. So I started calling my friends, because back then, we had to remember phone numbers. And so I called the numbers that I remembered until I finally got someone on the phone, and I said, hey, I got left here. Can you come pick me up? And they're like, yeah, yeah, I'll be there in, like, 30 minutes. So they came and picked me up and took me home. It was my high school graduation.",

    "voice_to_text": "You know, I love a whistleblower more than just about anything in the entire world. And an ER nurse is suing her former employer to Nova Healthcare in Clarksville, Tennessee. It's a federal lawsuit, I assume it's a wrongful termination lawsuit. Suing them for $7.5 million, claiming that it is retaliation after she refused to change documentation in patients charts. So the lawsuit claims that there were two cases in particular, one in which a male patient died of cardiac arrest in the triage area due to a lack of open beds and proper monitoring. Um, and she documented that there were not enough beds available. And the lawsuit claims that this was a violation of the Tennessee Public Protection Act and is an MTALA violation. The supervisor directed her afterwards to change her charting, to omit it because, quote, it gives a lawyer a case on a silver platter. And, quote, and in the second case, the patient was exhibiting signs of sepsis, needed treatment, was waiting for a pickline and treatment. Um, and I believe that they ended up dying because of a lack of treatment. And she documented there was a lack of safe staffing that LED to this, and she was told to omit that from the chart and refused, and one month later, she was terminated. So I am so glad that this nurse has, um, lawyered up. I am sure that the attorney is pointing her towards OSHA and the NLRB and all the things I'm gonna follow this case. Put someone put me in touch with her. Because, you know I love a whistleblower more than anything. And I hope she buys an island and retires after she wins this case. And never change your documentation. Your documentation is your documentation.",

They don't care that your babysitter didn't show up. They don't care that you just bought a house. This is coming from someone who sat on the executive board, with the CEO, with the C O O, with all of the higher UPS. They don't care. They don't care what you have going outside of work. It is about the result. It is about the deliverable. And the sooner you remove the emotion out of the work that you do, the further that you can go. Because when you start to think that they care if you had a bad day, then you give yourself an excuse to have a bad day. When you think that they hear that you're doing really well in your personal life, you give yourself an excuse. When you remove the emotion, you will go further. Show up, be passionate about the work that you were doing. If you are. If you don't care about the work you're doing, do the bare minimum, but take the emotion out of it. And stop people thinking that people care. It wasn't until I understood this that I doubled my salary and was able to get promoted. It sounds cold, but it's true.",

She said the school have decided that any people getting satisfactory or lower in any of their subjects are just not allowed to. To come. They have not being invited. Where do we stand on this? Oh, why call it satisfactory if it's not satisfactory to you? Yeah, this is the term that they used if it's satisfactory or lower. I think it's disgusting that schools are doing this in a world where we're trying to teach our children to be kind to each other and to just, you know, do their best. Do their best. Yeah. And then first thing and. And I heard with this. With. I read with this school that they like charging the. The children \u00a31 to go to this thing and then, you know, somebody's given a pound and then they get uninvited. Take your pound back because you're not invited. I think that's really mean, really nasty. Hi, Greg. Yeah, and a lot of parents have spoken up saying that with these children have missed out a lot due to Covid and everything else. And this really shouldn't be a Celebration of exam results. Like this should just be a Celebration of school. I finished school. Yeah, it's finished school. I think it's What it's doing is promoting more anxiety and more upset and, you know, I, I remember I wasn't allowed to go to my, it wasn't called a prom, it was called the, the end of school disco. But because of my upbringing, my, my religious upbringing, I wasn't allowed to go to like, parties and, you know, listen to that sort of music and, and stuff, so. And I've always, I, I, I was at home crying and thinking, oh, what are they doing? You know what, what are my friends doing that I went to school with? Yeah, I, I had a big FOMO, um, time and, and it was like, I think I, I felt it was unfair as well because that, we had a conversation, um, last week about, are your siblings treated differently? My brother was allowed to go to the end of school. Ah. Ah, cause he's, he's a boy, so it was kind of different. But with a girl, I don't know what they thought I was gonna do, but I just wanted to go, you know, to have my T-shirt written on and take some phone numbers for my friends. Is that a book? Yeah. I've never been to one because back in my day we just didn't have them at all. So you wore t shirts? You have. I never got to go to one either. What? Oh my god, yes, absolutely. I was on the committee that helped organise let me Tell you. And it was a very, very good one. Right, that is it. I am sorting this. We're having a Loose Women prom. What about?

And my question is, which states that abortion is okay to remove an ectopic pregnancy? Can you explain to me why that exception is in there? To me, it would be common sense to put that language in here. But a child who is in fact living out part of his or her early life as the unfortunate circumstance of being an ectopic pregnancy is in fact still a unique human being with its own DNA. And I wonder, I guess I just don't understand why we've created an exception where we allow those children to be murdered, but not the others. Remember, our goal is to protect unborn children. The implication, or the unstated implication, would be we want to protect unborn children, except those who are the product of rape or incest or those who happen to be in an ectopic pregnancy. And I wonder how we square that with the idea of justice for all and that we're killing a person because his daddy was a rapist or an ancestral creep.",

Maybe if black mothers would stop having random children with random men without being married and having a family to keep that child in, there wouldn't be so many black children to adopt. Also, while you're on the internet running your mouth, how many children can you adopt? Probably zero, because you don't qualify. Because you have to have a family. You have to be financially sound. See, this is how the process works. First they reach out to the immediate family, any blood relatives, and try to get somebody to take that child. That didn't work. Then they try to find a child which a family they can connect with. Same race. That didn't work, and they had no choice but to put the child with a white T family who was willing to take the child. So instead of asking why are YT people adopting black people, why don't you ask why there's so many black children up for adoption? Aren't y'all the most educated? Aren't y'all making the most money that any other group of black women have ever made? So why aren't you adopting black babies?",

If the week before you menstruate, you are so depressed that you can't function, you have debilitating anxiety, you struggle to get out of bed. Or on the flip side, you have insomnia and cannot sleep, you're prone to bursting into tears, and you have thoughts about. That's not regular PMS. You have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. And I know that this doesn't apply to everybody, okay? I know that it doesn't apply to everybody. But I am saying this because, oh, my god, I wish when I was 20 years old that there was someone who looked me in the eye and said, you're not insane. You have a mood disorder. My first doctor was basically like, you can go on the pill or you can go off the pill. We don't know what's gonna happen. Good luck. Hey, hey. There's gotta be a better way to figure that out, right? Every doctor between her and the last one that I went to just told me that I should exercise more during the week before I get my period. And I said, during the week where it's impossible for me to get out of bed. And they said, yeah, as hard as it was for me to get a diagnosis, I know that there are people out there where it's a million times harder for them because they don't have the privilege that I do. Okay, So I'm looking you in your eye and I'm telling you, you're not crazy. You're not wrong. It makes me fucking furious that there are states out there who believe that they understand a human body with a uterus so well that they can enact laws about it. Meanwhile, I'm running around town for half a decade trying to get a doctor to even look my way for something that makes me wanna, oh, once every three weeks, stop writing fucking bills about us and do more research.",

And I write about that in my last book, The Laws of Human Nature. You can see that in certain people at a very early age. Great psychoanalyst Melanie Klein identified the greedy baby at the age of six months. Wow, that was already sucking so hard on the mother's breasts. And she saw that this type of baby turned into the type that was actually very aggressive in life. So it's inbred very early on. People like that have patterns of behavior they cannot control. But those people with those kind of intentions, who are very manipulative, I believe very firmly, ultimately they hit a wall. They piss so many people off. They don't know the soft side of power. They have no self control, cause all they know is grab, grab, grab, push, push, push. They don't know when to yield, they don't know when to step back.",

You think it would have motivated me, but that wasn't what motivated me. We had a birthday party for my daughter. We did this pinata. And I'm over there, I'm doing pinata. And somebody took a video of me. And I go back and look at this video and I'm like, there's a fucking lollipop kid right there. But the problem was the lollipop kid was me. Cause I was 350 pounds on a 5 foot 2 frame. Fucking Willy Wonka lollipops. I said no, I said, I don't know who that is, that's not me, that's not who I am in here. But it was me. And that was. That was. That was the key. That was the. Oh, wait a minute. I really gotta do something, cause I don't like that. I would like that if I was watching The Wizard of Oz. I would like that if it was watching Willy Wonka. I don't like that. That's me. And I was 350 pounds at the time I stepped on the scale yesterday, I was 1 93. So what What was your key? Because it's not. It's not people saying, oh, you need to lose weight. We know that. It's not the doctors telling you, oh, you're unhealthy. We feel that.

    "voice_to_text": "I asked annexers if you left at 18 or were kicked out, and that comment thread and the subsequent follow up video to that have almost 35 comments of Gen Xers and elder millennials talking about their experience of being booted out or leaving right after they graduated from high school because of the way they had a toxic relationship with their parents. And this was a really common sentiment in those comments. So if you were a Gen X or an elder millennial, I'd love to know did you feel that you were wanted by your parents, or did you feel that they treated you as nothing more than a societal obligation and a tax break? And if it's the latter, how did that shape you? How did that change your life, and how did that shape the way you relate to children and families? Because I've seen a number of folks commenting that they chose not to have kids specifically because of how they were treated as children, and that the coldness and lack of affection from their parents really made it difficult to have relationships with other adults as well. So did you feel that you were wanted by your parents, or did you feel like you were just an obligation?",

    "voice_to_text": "I really think boomers and also Silent Gen see money as a weapon. Or rather they think withholding it is a threat that will get us to comply. This is a comment on my video. I talked about how I totally understand why the adult children of boomers and Silent Gen parents do not wanna care for their elderly parents, especially if they were toxic, and how we're not obligated to do that. So I took care of my elderly father through the process of him having dementia, and in doing so I joined a support group for adult children of aging and dying parents. An elderly parents threatening to disinherit kids unless they gave their free labor to be caregivers was a pretty common refrain. And I wonder what that says about the kind of relationship that Boomer and Silent Gen parents have with their kids and with Bunny. It really speaks to how broken that parent child relationship is that they think we only care about them for their money. Because maybe they only care about us for what we can give them in terms of labor. I think it's really telling.",

Many years ago, a year into our relationship, lockdown hit and we were forced with the decision to lock down together or not. It was also during this time that my amazingly brave dad got diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and the years that followed turned out to be the hardest years of my life, juggling work and being a carer full time. I've been teasing my boyfriend about getting married, but I just knew it wasn't the right time as my focus was making my dad feel comfy and safe in the last year of his life. I knew dad loved my boyfriend as his only communication with us at the end was a thumbs up and he would always do that to my boyfriend when he came to see him. Very sadly, but extremely peacefully, my dad passed away on November 5th, 2023 with me. I can't cope. I can't cope with the parent once. I cannot deal with them. I was extremely emotional. But to come downstairs on the morning of my birthday to see a story book, my boyfriend and maid of our life together tipped me over the edge. Can't get up, can't get up. On the last page of the book was a picture of him and one knee. Two weeks before my dad died, my boyfriend had the moment my dad alone told him his plan and My dad gave him the strongest thumbs up he'd ever given. Oh, my God.",

You cannot even get in. You can't even get in the conversations and the places that she is going to. You cannot even get there. So what's with all of this hatred? It. It. It is blowing my mind right now. But, yo, rent free, we live in your like. This is called perpetual living. You've been your secret tonight. You've been your bossy, bossy, bossy money. Not tonight.

I'm lying about my whole life savings that Mike isn't even gonna make it past the first round. Okay, hear me out. Like, Jake has been doing this for 3 years and he's already knocking out pro boxers. And Mike's last fight was an exhibition and those punches looked more like soft kisses. I don't know, I think this is his easiest match yet cause he obviously has more power and skill and like this fight's gonna get ugly quick. If you're smart, lock your bets and now and hammer round 1 TKO and thank me later.",

What the hell are y'all so mad about? Why you always claiming that everything is about white supremacy and racism? You know damn well it's not.

We worked together, we lived together, we went to school together. Again, I'm gonna ask you, what are you so angry about? That ain't self inflicted, is it? Because Donald Trump came down that gold escalator, you cried, you told us he's racist, and we told you, no, he's not. Hey, we just went on, y'all, 30 years of co signing for him telling us he wasn't racist. It's gonna take more than a because I said so to convince us. Come on, it ain't too late.

It's three movies in the from the future that haven't even been mentioned. Guys, the first movie is called My Lawyer is a tornado. And it's literally a tornado that's a lawyer, and he always ends up messing everything up in court, and he's basically an accident's attorney. So, I mean, you can imagine where that's gonna go. I don't wanna give anything away or the spoilers or anything, but it's called My Lawyer is a tornado. It's coming out in 20. Whatever. I don't know. It sucks. It's a sucky movie. On to the next number two movie that's gonna come out is My Sister's Crimes. And it's about conjoined twins. Literally, they're attached by the hip. And one of the conjoined twins is a murderer. And guess who's the investigator behind the murders? It's her conjoined sister. And she's trying to figure out the crimes of her sister. And the murder is literally attached to her hip. I mean, it's a mind boggling freaking movie with a huge plot twist. Guys, I'm excited for you guys to see that one. That one's really good, actually. This movie is gonna freaking absolutely be a classic. Starship Santa. After societies collapse and everybody on earth has to move to spaceships out in space to survive. Santa still has to go deliver his packages and his gifts to people. So he creates a sled that's also like a spaceship rocket thing, and he's out in space delivering all these gifts. It's the Christmas spirit, but in space. And it becomes an instant classic. Top three. Better than Home Alone and jingle all the way and Christmas Story. Guys, I'm excited for you guys to see these movies. And those are the posters that I just showed you.",

They're bisexual. And then you have other women who only date white guys. I've been doing a lot of research, and I can't find out the signs. And if the crazy thing is, with black women or mixed black and white women, it's very easy to see the sign. Black and white women are black women, right? They were either adopted by white people, they. That if they were biracial, they were only raised by, like, the white side of their family. They just had a lot of white friends growing up, and they kind of just, like, assimilated. But with white people, it's not that simple. I'mma give you the perfect example. I know a girl, white girl. She. Both parents in the household, right? Both her parents are white. She grew up with white friends. Her best friend that she's known the longest is white. The other one is also white. But check this out. Are you ready for this? She said that she was in middle school, she was watching Camp Rock 2, and the. The black guy, the one of the lead actors or whatever. She said she saw him for the first time, didn't know what it was about him, but she loved it. And then from then on, there she Was just chasing men that looked like him. And then as she got older, she realized that she just likes melanin. Now I have a theory. White people, you can fact check me on this. I think it's genetic. I think if you see homegirl, she's into black guys. There's a 99 point 99% chance her mom was also into black guys. Now I'm not saying white guys aren't like this, I'm just saying it's a lot less common. If I see a white guy who strictly into black women, I'm gonna assume he went to HBCU. Haha.",

They'll show them kind of slowly counting down from ten, 9, 8, and just kind of slowly drifting off as they get closer and closer to one? But, you know, that's all bullshit. My brain always thinks of, like, the worst possible case scenarios, right? And so when I had surgery recently, I. I said to the anesthesiologist beforehand, I was like, well, what happens if I get to zero and I'm still awake? Like, do I signal, or what do I do? And she was like, oh, that won't happen. And I was like, I'm not. I don't mean that like an insult. I'm not. I'm sure you are amazing at your job. I wanna be very clear that I have confidence in you or wouldn't be doing this. But I was just wondering, like, how far. How far do people get normally before they fall asleep? And she was like, they get as far as I let them go. And I'm. You know, even in this moment where I'm genuinely terrified they're gonna find out that I have, like, the worst case scenario, uh, from the surgery in my mind, I'm like, I bet I can. I wanna see how far I can get. And so when. When they're ready to put me under, they say, start counting. And I go. And I wake up an hour later. I didn't even. I didn't even say the word 10, maybe you all already knew this. Okay, maybe I'm just completely was out of it, but I. I just. I just thought that was really interesting.",

They played a video, him getting my like, three niggas. Surprising information about the music industry and what he's been involved in over the past couple of decades. Many people already know that Chris has a controversial reputation, but his latest claims are shocking even for him. He's accusing Diddy, another big name in the industry, of pressuring artists into being gay. According to Chris, these rumors aren't just whispers. Other people have also come forward to confirm them. These revelations have caused quite a stir, especially because they touch on sensitive issues within the music business. It's unclear what the full impactivation for a long time, and some of his older collaborations have only added to the rumors. A notable example is his work with Blood Orange, also known as Devante Hines, on the song hope. In the music video, there's a scene where two actors share an intimate moment while Diddy sings about wanting a specific kind of love. This raised questions about what he was trying to express, leading fans to wonder about his personal desires. These moments, along with other hints and rumors, have kept Diddy's personal life in the spotlight. Despite all the speculation, he is not publicly clarified his sexuality, which has only fueled curiosity. People continue to watch his actions and collaborations closely to figure out what might be behind The scenes. Yeah, I love this drink. I like when you like this, daddy, daddy. I like when you scrambling and scraping shit. I like that. Diddy's personal life has drawn attention on more than one occasion. There have been rumors that he's romantically linked with Will Smith, another celebrity who has faced speculation about his sexuality. These rumors gained momentum when it was reported that Diddy hosted gay parties where he and Will Smith were seen having a wild time. In 2016, social media buzzed with claims from Alexis, the ex wife of actor Will Smith, who said she divorced him after catching him in bed with record executive Benny Medina. The timing of these allegations couldn't have been worse. Will Smith and his wife Jada had just announced they would boycott the Oscars to protest the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Alexis, Will's ex wife, claimed that on the set of the movie Six Degrees of separation, will allegedly threw a tantrum when asked to kiss another man. Despite the various claims, the rumors about Will Smith's sexuality persist in the media and on social networks. Diddy and Will Smith aren't the only prominent figures in hip hop speculated to be gay. During an interview, 50 Cent, known for his bold opinions, took aim at Jay Z, comparing him to the late painter Basquiat, whom he referred to as gay. Meanwhile, rapper Rick Ross recently voiced his support for the LGBTQ community, adicating for more representation of gay artists in hip hop. In a Positive tone Ross encouraged gay rappers to follow their dreams and be themselves. However, 50 Cent stirred controversy by posting suggestive photos on Instagram hinting that both Diddy and Rick Ross might be gay, leading to a wave of online debate and speculation.",

    "voice_to_text": "All right. Easily the worst thing about being fat is dating as a plus size bitch. Let's talk about it. So, number one, men, for some reason, some men, not all, think that, like, you're entitled to thinking that they're attractive. Like, hold on. Like, if a man came up to me at a bar and I said that I wasn't interested because, like, I didn't think he was cute or whatever, they kind of act like it's insane that you're not attracted to them because the you're fat and they were throwing you a bone. Genuinely, I've had really ugly ass men act like they were doing me a favor by flirting with me. Just because I'm fat does not change the fact that you look like you were hatched from an egg, buddy. Like, I don't know what to tell you. Also, dating apps. Not funny either, because I am so terrified of, like, fatfishing someone. I don't even know if that's a thing. Whatever. I put full body photos on all my dating profiles. I like to share my Instagram or, like, YouTube so they can, like, literally see me and know what I look like. And yet I've still canceled so many first days because I was like, oh, my god, what if they don't know I'm fat? Also having to be worried about everyone that matches with you or picks you up in a bar, whatever. That they're just, like, fetishizing fat people. That's. There's Just so much to think about when it comes to dating as a fat, and I. I'm tired. Also, the type of men that love fat women are, like, gym bros. I don't know why this is a thing. Are you looking for, like, a new client to train? What? Like, I mean, I don't mind, but, like, I just think it's weird. Also, I hope that this is just me, because honestly, it would make me really sad if other girls feel like this, but why does having a crush on someone who doesn't like you back make you feel like a fucking monster? Like, I literally feel, like, Grody when I think about the fact that, like, I'm like, oh, my god, this person must be so grossed out that I have a crush on that. Like, literally. What?",

I absolutely do not think you should text that man, kiss that man, go on the walk in the park after dark with that man. You should probably never do that. But with that man. Until he texts your phone and says look at this. And it's him slaying a dragon with a dragon's head in your honor. And he says, I did this for you. I don't think that you should even entertain the thoughts of getting to know him until he beats up all of your exes and wins. Like, successfully beats them up. And then sends you evidence of them begging for your mercy. Cause he did that on behalf of your honor. You know what I mean? I don't think that you should even take him seriously until he brings you a hand plucked bouquet. And that's what I think that this summer should consist of. Nice. For what?",

    "voice_to_text": "There are certain things that your employer cannot do. My name is Craig Levey and I'm an employment law attorney and here are three examples. First, your employer cannot prevent you from discussing your wages with your coworkers. The National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, is a federal law that states that employees are allowed to discuss their wages with their coworkers, and companies cannot retaliate against employees for doing so. So if you are an employee that is covered by that law and your company has a policy that states you cannot discuss your wages with your coworkers, that is unenforceable. Second, your employer cannot terminate your employment because you complained about something illegal going on at work. For example, many employees complain about sexual harassment or discrimination at work and are retaliated against because of that. There's a federal law to protect you in that case, and also many state laws. Also, there are federal and state whistleblower laws which protect individuals if they make certain complaints that categorize them as a whistleblower. And third, your employer cannot terminate your employment because you make an OSHA complaint stating that they aren't in compliance with certain health and safety standards. Far too often I see employees make complaints with OSHA and the company responds by retaliating, often terminating the employees employment.",

I go out with my friends. I don't drive. Okay? We're obviously drinking. So I'm like, I'm gonna Uber home. Whatever. I live in Miami Lakes. I was in Coconut Grove. I get into this Uber with this woman, and she starts taking a super weird route. Did not make sense where she was going, but I was like, maybe, like, she's taking backstreets. I'm not sure what was happening. All of a sudden, I end up at Miami International Airport. Okay, there's no, like, way that, like, that's a stop on the way to my house. Number one. Number two, if you work at an airport, if you know about airports, you know that that's not, like, an area that you pass through. Like, that's. That's. You're gonna go there for a reason. So I really do believe that I was in a situation where I was about to get human trafficked. So. Because I'm realizing this as you're calling me from the phone, and I. And I'm like, I feel in a very sad situation. And I asked the lady, while I'm on the phone with my friend, I'm like, I feel that. I, like. I'm like, ma'am, like, why? What's up with GPS in Spanish? And she's like, cease by. My heart sank, my heart draw. I was ignorant. It was like a movie. Like, I generally. I have goosebumps. Like I'm freaking out. Like, I'm freaking out. Long story short, she was. I end up asking her again. I'm on the phone, my friend. She's like, oh, I don't know. This is, like, the route that it's taking me on. And we're, like, entry, like, departures, arrivals. I literally manually unlock the car, hopped out of the car, and start running. I'm on the phone, my friend around there. I was like, you need to get somewhere where, like, there's people, you know. Then he starts chasing me in her car. She's like, I have four kids. Like, you're safe. Like, you're safe with me. And I'm like, if you don't get away from me, I'm gonna fucking call 9 1 1 right now. I end up seeing, like, the parking department of the airport, and the security guard was like, is everything okay? Like, it seemed like if you got into a fight with a boyfriend, I know that was Uber. She's like. He was like, do you live, like, by the airport? I go, no, I live maybe lakes. He was like, there's a lot of huge trafficking that happens, and, like, there's airport hotels, and she probably was gonna take him to her portal. Long story short, I'm home and I'm safe, and god was with me today. But I wanted to share this video because you don't know, like, who's out there and what The heck is going on? And statistically, Miami is one of the hotspots where you were trafficking. I'm really blessed I'm okay and I'm safe. But just please be careful. If you're gonna get an Uber, make sure you're with someone. Um, and just, like, please be safe. Love you guys.",

There wasn't a confusion with their tickets. There wasn't a mistake made.

When I was 7 years old, keep this in mind. 7 years old, we had a little joke session at school where we could all share jokes with each other. And people were sharing normal jokes like, why did the Eminem go to school? Cause he wanted to be a smarty. Ha ha ha! And then it got to me and I said, well, back in the First World War, there was these two best mates called Tracy and Susan. And Susan goes around to Tracy's house on her birthday. And then the postman comes and he says, I've got a telegram for you, Tracy. And Tracy goes, oh, what about? And he goes, well, it's a singing telegram. And she goes, oh, go on, sing it then. And he goes, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Tracy, happy birthday to you. And Tracy says, all post, you've made my day. And then on Susan's birthday, Tracy goes around Susan's house and the postman shows up and says, I've got a telegram for you. And Susan goes, oh, sing it. And he goes, I don't think I should sing it. And she goes, oh, go on, sing it. He goes, it's not really a telegram that I can sing. And then Tracy goes, go on, you Did it on my birthday. Sing at the flipping telegram. And so the postman goes, da da da, da, da, da, da da, Charlie! And the kids are dead. I was jazz handling for a solid 20 seconds to a very confused room of seven year olds and presumably very concerned teachers.",

Being down in sales is not gonna be signaling the collapse of the car market. What's gonna be signaling the collapse of the car market is their inventory issues. I know everybody's been saying the car market is gonna crash for years, but this is a huge sign from Carmax. Again, $5.6 billion in sales is the least of Carmax's problems as this year is looking grim for them. Now we could say that's something to do with Brooke situation. But we'll move on and actually talk about inventory, as inventory has one of the biggest issues for Carmax today. For example, they're buying less cars. They bought 14% less cars from consumers, meaning they want less inventory. Let me show you why. Ask you a question. This is a car that Carmax is selling right now. And they have a lot just like this. The 2024 RAV4 Hybrid XLE listed at $39,998. Would you buy this car knowing that you could buy a brand new RAV4 XLE right down the street for 38,543? And that's before negotiating. I'm getting like three to four thousand dollars off these on a consistent basis. People are not gonna buy these cars from Carmax and it's not Because Carmax is being super greedy. They overpaid for a lot of inventory, and they're about to feel the pain. The new car market has already collapsed, but the used car market is coming next. Expect used car prices to drop drastically throughout the year as Carmax's prices start to fall.",

You were holding a coffee, a bottled coffee that you clearly got from a Bodega or a corner market, and you were drinking it, and it was a chameleon cold brew. Concentrate. I don't think you know it's concentrate. It was the large format concentrate. I feel like you saw it and you were like, Wait, that's, like, such a big cold brew. I want that coffee. This morning, you're drinking, like, 32 coffees, and you're a walking human time bomb. You're going to ruin the pants you were wearing, and they were, like, nice. They were like Bonobo socks. Not really my vibe or taste, but those are, like, running you like, what, like 68 bucks? Let's not. You need. I almost said something to you. Not everyone they get does a good job of separating the concentrate bottles from the individual serving bottles, and you have fallen victim to that. But you are going to Kool Aid man through a wall later if you don't stop drinking that. You can't be doing that. You're probably thinking, wow, this is really strong. It's a little bitter. Yeah, it's supposed to be caught with water. That's like, 32 coffees. I need you to party on to turn around and go help him. Um, if you're walking on gates out, drinking a coffee in a white sweater and blue pants, that Was concentrate your drinking. Concentrate. Um. Okay.",

Something that throws me off when I first meet people, or even when I go out with people, are people who will never, like, shut nobody down for you.

What's her number? And you all out of my year, girl, give him your number. Give him your number. You don't like me? You. You think I'm desperate as fuck? If someone who you have fucked with in the past wants to fuck with me? Why would you tell me to go fuck with the. I don't want them. Like, bitch, I don't want nothing you touched. No, I'm cool. I promise you, I'm cool. If a man who, you know, after he came up to me and I declined because his breath stunk, I said, not his breath stink. And you said, yeah, did, bitch, when he was talking to me and he asked me for your Instagram, that shit was stinky. Well, why would you tell him? Come over here and talk to me. Something about that pisses me off. Why would I want a man who you slept with? Why would I want a man who you dealt with any time in the past? Or who wanted you first even though you don't want them? Why would I want a man that you don't want? Those type of people literally look at you as left because now you're cut off because you're weird. Literally, if your friend know a man, I shit he look like shit. They will not try to put you on with them. They would literally be like, nah, she cool. I know my homegirls would never. I'd be like, not a cool, I promise they good. And the men be mad over that. And you know, there be a little stigma. Oh, the fat friend, annoying ass fat friend. I'll be that.

I just want shot. I just want y'all just hear me out. I just want y'all to slow it down and realize that social media isn't real life. Pull up all you fucking stat. One in six women will be attacked by a man her lifetime. Only 1 in 1 million people have a chance to be attacked by a bear. Let's think about this. You live with and walk past in your life, probably hundreds of thousands of men. You will probably never fucking just walk past a bear. All right? So no shit. Okay. I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, Chance, and I'm gonna walk up on a Kodiak bear. What the fuck? Limb to none. Ever in life? Never. You go to the zoo? Fuck you talk about? That's one. That's proximity. The way y'all bring this shit up is ridiculous. The way that that should have been, the way that question should have been asked. Would you rather be in the lost in the woods with a bear that wants to kill you or a man that wants to kill you? The bear that wants to harm you or a man that wants to harm you? But you could get the real fucking answers. I never hit a woman violently. I never put a violent Hand on a woman. I never sexually assaulted a woman. No, none of that, ever. Now, I never even called a woman out of her fucking name. Not to her face. I think all that is terrible and wrong, but y'all acting like men are scarier than bears. You ain't watch enough nature documentaries, baby. Oh, watch the one where they trying to get the pictures of that big ass bear any. And the light from the flash scares them and. And a startled bear. I swear to fucking god, the earth moved when he got startled. Let's go. Just go watch a few fucking videos. The way y'all be. The way y'all. Boy, you dumb as hell.",

So being a 54 year old male teacher giving your cell phone number to 4 6th graders total. Uh huh. So they can call you anytime they need. Meanwhile you are sending good morning text, good night text, how was your day text. Sending songs that remind you of them. Uh huh. To me, this is very inappropriate. Very inappropriate. No school teacher, male or female, should be giving a student their number. Period. It's very unprofessional. I think it's very tacky. I think it's enticing a minor. In my personal opinion, it is my opinion. But how about this? Was your child and you found out? Not good. Child told you you were going through a child's phone, you found the messages and you confronted the child. Cause the child, the child is so innocent to a degree that they put the teacher's name in the phone. Mr. So and so child has never sent one inappropriate message, but has received dozens. I mean, dozens of inappropriate messages you reported to the school, and the school in turn pulls all four girls in. Well, pulls several. Several girls didn't find out. Four girls particularly have the number. Nobody else. Just four girls. Those four girls all admit to being treated so much differently than the rest of the students. But here's. Here's the. The plot twist. The teacher is being called A victim in this. And the four students are be called. Are we are called. Four students are being called suspects in the whole situation. The teacher cannot be charged with anything because he's done nothing wrong. But give his cell phone number out. Even though I think for a 54 year old man to be texting a child that he's not related to. How is your morning? Beautiful. Sweet dreams. Beautiful. This song reminds me of you. Beautiful. Body like a Back Road. Is not a song you should send to a child. Uh huh. You were made for me. It's not a song to be sent to a child. And that's worth it. In Patty cake, Bakerspan or loop Deloo. My darling. I don't think you should send a child any damn thing. I'm just confused how the sheriff's department thinks this is. Children are suspects and this teacher is a victim.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so we have to talk about this. If you're unaware, this is the public school grading scale in California, and this is fucking insane. So according to the grading scale they're using today, 84 to 100 is an A, 64 to 84 is a B, 44 to 64 is a C, 24 to 44 is a D, and anything below 24% is a fail. And if this is how we're gonna grade children today, let's just fucking sell everything to China, cause we're fucked as a society. I don't know about you, but as my name says, I'm an older millennial. I was born in 83 and graduated high school in O2. When I went to school, this was my grading scale. Fact this looks like it was on fucking Parchment does not help my complex about being old. But regardless, let's look at the fucking difference. So to get an A, I needed A 95 to 100, B was 88 to 94, C was 80 to 87, D was 70 to 79. 69 and below was failing. Let's be real, that means the only people that would be passing for my time is the people who are currently getting an A. And about half the people who are getting a B. The other half of B as well as everyone else would have failed. And for me, on this scale, C is where it gets ridiculous. There are plenty of people out there in my time who were just C level students. They weren't especially smart, but they also weren't especially dumb. No, for me, see, was always just the average people. I figured that the average people were able to answer about 80% of the shit they Learned correctly. But now you can get more wrong than you do right and still have a C. You have to think that's what 44% means. That means that of all the questions you were given, you got 56% of them wrong. You got more wrong then you did right, and you're still a C student. That is fucking stupid. And D is even worse, because getting a D in California means that you got 76% of everything wrong and you're still going to graduate. You have to get 77% of everything wrong to fail. Here's the thing. I don't ever wanna work with someone who got 77% of everything wrong. I don't even wanna work with somebody who got 56% of everything wrong. Right now in California, these motherfuckers are graduating high school. This is the future generations of our society. We are gonna have a generation of people in this country who are graduating high school and college while getting 75% of everything wrong. And that is fucking horrifying.",

Artists nationally are struggling to fill their books, and when they do, they're littered with last minute cancellation. But why? Some artists have made videos claiming that it's social media suppression. Some have ranted saying that it's an over saturated market with too many tattoo artists and tattoo shops. I don't think it's either. So what can we do? Will lowering day rates and offering deals remedy this situation? Will changing the dated, industry wide outlook on how we use social media be the solution? Or do some artists need to swallow their ego and start doing small tattoos again for a much more affordable price to make sure they make ends meet? This isn't the first recession the tattoo industry is faced and it won't be the last. We have to adapt and overcome to get through this together. But the question is how?

I dated this guy and he was just the best ever. And I, I kid you not, I think one of the biggest catalysts of our breakup was that his mom wanted him so bad. So I think. And he was like my mommy. And I was like, okay, the mommy. Oh, that's weird. No, he had like candles and shit all around his house. That was like your mom and his house, like, not. They didn't live together. Like, your mom is the window to your soul and shit. Oh my God, she. She. She hated me. How old was he? He's 23, I think now I'm 25. Over two year difference. But it was just. Dude, it was so nuts. And parents love me too, which I know is surprising cause parents like me too, like. But I, I really. I love. I think cause I never had parents to begin with.

    "voice_to_text": "I just rejected a guy in Kroger and the security guard had to escort me outside for safety to my car story time real story that just happened just now I'm literally shaking so if my word is mumbling that's because I'm still trying to process what just happened to me so I simply went to Kroger minding my business to go get some fruits and some veggies to prep my meal for me and my kids and I noticed that there were two guys around just lurking they really wasn't doing anything but because I have my baby my focus immediately start paying attention to their asses and I'm like okay I don't wanna be judging people they might just be doing their own thing but I'm still gonna keep an eye it is sad that we have to do this as woman but again your intuition is never wrong so don't ignore it when you feel like something is up so while I was minding my business picking up my fruits and stuff with my baby in the cart one of the guy just kept passing my cart and I was like okay this is weird but he was picking up some bananas I'm like okay maybe they're fucking shopping that's what I'm thinking so as I left the fruit aisle to go pick up some yogurt one of the guy pat me on my shoulder and I turned around and well I didn't know it was one of them but when they pat me on my shoulder I turned around I noticed it was him and I said hi and he said hi and he proceeded to ask me where is the cocoa industry in the store and I said I don't know where is the cocoa I don't know and I was like maybe you can ask somebody in the front and he was like so can I have your number and I said no I'm sorry I you cannot have my number and I started pushing my cart and you know when somebody pulled your shoulder like okay you need to come back I'm not done talking to you that's exactly what he did so I said excuse me you don't touch me like that you don't don't do that shit like that is very disrespectful don't touch me so I immediately just forget about the yogurt and everything and I stop pushing the cart towards the register he proceeded to follow me to the register like close to the register and I was like dude what do you want and he was like I'm just asking you for your number so the other guy I saw coming towards me I mean coming towards us and I was like okay this is not looking good let me just leave this shit inside of the grocery store and head to where the security guard is so I told the security guard what was going on and he was like okay I would escort you out in a minute just stay right here so he walked up to the guys and he was like I don't know what he asked them but they started laughing and it was like look at this mother effing clown trying to question me that's exactly what they said to the guy the security so the security was like okay let me escort you out and he was like do you want any grocery I said no I don't want any grocery because I just wanna go home with my kid because I have my baby so he while he was taking me to my car the guys they walk out the store as well and they started yelling at the security guard they started calling about his name and he was like don't pay attention to them because if they come at me I will be able to protect you and your kid and I'm so grateful for that security because he didn't have to but he did I end up being in the car safely and I pulled off and I drove around a little bit before head like come straight home because I didn't want nobody to be following me cause I don't know if they was following me or not but my thing is why is it so hard for men to take rejection when a woman says no why is it so hard for you to respect that shit respect when a woman tell you no it's a reason why she said no she's just not interested and for her to feel unsafe because she said no it's crazy like what happened to respecting people boundaries what happened to respecting people period why do I have to think about you taking my life because I said no I just don't understand y'all so please ladies be safe out there and men start acting like men now please if a woman says no respect that respect her no",

Okay, so I went to get my haircut in the little waiting area, waiting for my stylist to be ready, and this girl comes up to me and she says, your stylist is just finishing up, so I'm going to shampoo you. And I was like, okay, great, sounds good. Like, that's a normal occurrence, right? Um, so I go back to little hair wash station with her, and she's washing my hair. Everything seems normal. And then I start noticing, like, all the other people who work there are, like, looking over at us and, like, sort of whispering, and they're like, this one girl goes and grabs another girl, and they're, like, talking amongst each other, and, like, I'm like, something is up. Like, what is going on? So then I see one of the girls go and grab the manager, and she says something to the manager, and the manager looks over, and, like, it's this weird look on her face. And she comes walking over to us, and she says, ma'am, what are you doing? And at first I think she's talking to me, and I'm like, what? And then I realize she's talking to the girl who's washing my hair, and the girl just says, sorry, immediately stops what she's doing, and runs out. And I'm like, what just happened? Well, apparently that Girl washing my hair didn't work for the salon. The salon has no idea who she is. They apologized profusely, which, I mean, it wasn't their fault, I guess, but I'm so weirded out. Like, what just happened? I, I, I have no words. But anyway, they got an actual employee to come and wash my hair, and then I got my haircut.",

So were y'all just, like, living in non paranoid households? Like, I feel like, I don't know, just like a fun thing for teenagers to do, but no, not me, not. I had never got to experience that.

Let me explain. Okay? Let me explain. Okay, so if we go back a few years, right? I was working at, um. I was working at a freaking, like, call center, right? I was working at a call center, and a friend of mine found this job on Craigslist. So he found his job on Craigslist, and the job was doing quality assurance and, like, performance improvement, all of that stuff, all that jazz, right? And so one by one, we started applying, and we all got the job. Fast forward. I was like, I was in the job. It was paying this, like, $12 an hour or whatever, and I was in the job, and I started researching, like, what we were doing, and I was like, wait a minute. People get paid a lot more for doing the same exact thing we were doing. Like, a lot more. So I started teaching myself over the years how to do everything. I did it. I would spend nights on YouTube, learning how to interview, learning how to write my resume, learning how to do Excel, learning how to do Powerpoint. And so I was, like, on my computer, I was literally, like, downloading everything and, like, practicing with how to do all Of this stuff, learning how to present myself as, like, in an interview, learning what to say, learning what each interview question means, learning how to basically say. Learning how to do better as far as, you know, answering situational questions and things like that. So, listen, so as I'm learning all of this, right, I'm perfecting my. My resume along the way. And so I start applying for, like, more jobs. And, you know, I would say it was weird at first, because it wasn't that I didn't have that much experience. I got my big break. I got my big break when I got my very first seeing Emma's job, working at IT company. And I had just. Just came from a freaking call center, bro. I came from a call center, and they hired me. That was my very first cute, like, real quality job. Did it. Did it. And YouTube. I Learned everything from YouTube. And so I Learned was like, okay, well, you know, I need to fluff up my resume, make myself a. Look a little better than what I am, make sure I position myself as a leader in this field. And, baby, let me tell you something. YouTube got me here. YouTube got me here. And now look at me. Now look at me. YouTube. If you want it bad enough, you do anything to get it. True story.",

So, of course, I got started making them right away. Mixed together all my dry ingredients and my butter before going out to harvest my strawberries. These were perfectly ripe. I can't believe I actually grew these here. So I grabbed those and then got some milk and eggs for my chickens, and I diced up my strawberries, added those to my bowl, added a bit of lemon zest. Did you guys know I'm proficient at juggling? Added my chicken, milk and egg eggs. Really combined everything. Then formed it into a little disc on some Parchment paper before cutting it into eight little triangles, added a bit of egg wash for some shine, and got started on my glaze, which was just powdered sugar, lemon juice, and some homemade vanilla extract. I personally love a dollop of whipped cream on a scone. Whipped cream on anything is good. So I whipped up some of that by hand. We did the goods, added a bit of embellishment, and then had a little taste test, and these were delicious.",

residential adviser and his name was Petey and again like Sam Petey and I are now going on like almost 20 years of friendship because we're old and Petey was step two into unlearning all of the harmful things I had learned in my childhood and young adulthood even it's funny because you know those two friends who share one brain cell that they ping pong between each other that is basically my friendship with Petey we are not- somehow if you put us together we are intelligent individuals, separately but put together we have made some of the stupidest decisions have come up with the stupidest scenarios to be in to this day that we talk about both back when we were in school and as adults and I'm really quite thankful to those two in particular but even after that after I graduated from college and I became friends with quite a diverse group of friends and people and I think it's also partly because I'm autistic it's hard for me to relate to different people in the world and it's much easier for me to be apathetic about things which is also why my handle is goodbye apathy to remind myself that apathy is not a good thing and that yes you can be introverted but friends are the community that teach you that there is a much larger world out there and that your worldviews may be absolutely incorrect especially if you grew up with bias and inherited stereotypes and all these things drilled into you and I'm also gonna be honest and say I probably wouldn't care that much about Falasteen if I hadn't known a classmate from Falasteen also when I was in elementary school and I remember her because she was one of the very few like very very few people who was incredibly nice to me and didn't make me feel foreign and other I spoke with her recently and she sent a picture of her birthday party that I forgot I had attended but once she sent that picture I remember distinctly that no one else had invited me to their birthday party until she did and it sticks out to me as a memory that I forgot until she saw the picture and while my friend is safe while all of my friends are safe for now it's why I care about Falasteen it's why I post about anti Blackness within both the East Asian community and specifically the Korean community because it affects my friends and if that makes me selfish if that makes me weird that's fine this is how I relate to the world through my friends who I know what I've learned through my friends and I especially remember one incident from college that truly cemented how Petey and Sam go through the world and it's one Petey and I went to the library together it was late at night it was kind of chilly so Petey was in a hoodie and he had the school lanyard with his school ID around his neck and the white librarian stopped him and stopped him only and said I'm gonna need a secondary form of ID and I remember just pausing in shock like why are you asking he when he is clearly a student here and she said oh you know that lanyard could be faked it could be yours meaning me and I was like no no no no no I think I think something's wrong here I think what you're doing is very racist why would you assume that only me is the legit student when we both have backpacks we both have hoodies on we both have lanyards what is the difference between him and I our race and ethnicity and that taught me so much without Petry having to say a single word just seeing one moment in his life and it sticks with me now nearly 20 years later that this is reality for a lot of different people that I didn't give a shit about until we became friends so there's no moral of the story there's just- sharing my journey from where I began to where I'm at now and I continue to unpack things year by year I'm not done by any means but I wanted to share that because that to me means a lot more than sharing some historical figure for Black History Month that I don't know too much about this is what I know and this is what I've experienced okay bye",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay off, Carnival is not playing around with the drunk sniffing dogs and trying to no longer be the Walmart of the cruise ship. So before work, here are three recent changes I've noticed as Carnival tries to move away from being the ratchet cruise line. First, no twerking. I noticed on a recent Sailaway party, every time someone started twerking, the cruise director shut it down. Number two, no fighting. Carnival will now hit you with a whopping 500 dollar fine and I've heard a ban for life if you get caught being rowdy. And 3. No more ganja. This has been a recurring issue on Carnival and has happened every single cruise I've been on where the smell is overwhelming all day, every day, everywhere. But now Carnival's not playing around with it. There's drug sniffing dogs at embarkation and even at some of the ports. Getting back on the ship today in grand turf, everyone who was carrying a bag had to set their bag off to the side and wait for this good boy to come along and sniff and check their bags. I've heard of many situations where passengers have been caught at the ports, and if this happens, you're stuck at the port and you have to find and pay for your own way back home.",

    "voice_to_text": "Incoming unpopular opinion I cannot be friends with non confrontational people. And the reason I say that, I agree with this wholeheartedly. Because people who are not so called confrontational are usually passive aggressive. So usually when they have a problem with something in a friendship, instead of addressing it, they kind of go around it and say little snide remarks or just hold it in and probably talk about you with the other friends. I truly don't believe that someone that is non confrontational can keep it 100 with you. Because when there is a issue of when you express an issue in a relationship of friendship, whatever the case may be, even at work, that person is non confrontational. When an issue is is being addressed, they are going to run from it instead of just sitting down and talking about it like two adults. They will run from the issue because they're non confrontational. And people who are non confrontational, let me just. I don't know if they make good friends. Ah, ah, let me just give you a scenario. Say for instance that this friend who is non confrontational witnesses another group of friends talking bad about you, right? They are not going to address it. They are not going cause they are non confrontational. I need a friend. What? Who y'all talking about that? Cause I know that's the kind of friend I am. Wait, what? I'm not gonna wait to talk to the person That. Oh, I heard someone. So. I don't like. I don't like that. What did you say? What? What did you say when they. When you heard that? Did you just listen? Because that person is not confrontational. How loyal can they be? How real can they be to you if they are non confrontational? It's just. It just. It's just not my cup of tea. I don't think they make the best friends. I'm not telling you to be rah, rah. That's the thing. You don't have to be rah, rah, but you gotta be a little. Huh",

You don't wanna be caring around that negative energy. Uh, I do. It brings me joy. Um, like, if I thought I could earn a living holding grudges, I would quit comedy. I would run out office space and open up my own little Gregory. I would just sit in there every day from 9 to 5. I would hold them. I probably wouldn't even take lunch breaks cause the hate will fill me up on the inside. I would take over other people's grudges. That's how much I enjoy it.

September 16th. Okay. September 15th. September 15th. That Virgo. That's still Virgo, right? Virgo, yes. Okay. Virgo. Okay. Las Vegas, 40. Virgo. What you do for a living, boo? I am unemployed. Well, do you have any kids? No kids. No kids. Do you think you're in a space to date with, like, not having a job? Right now? I am. I prefer it that way because I want a man that'll take me at my lowest and help me. Help build me up and that'll build my loyalty towards him. What kind of man you looking for? Um, just kind of goes into what I was just saying. A loyal provider. A loyal. Provide. A loyal provider. So, yeah. Provide for you right now that you're not, um, working. Well, even in a relationship? Every time I'm usually in a relationship, I typically don't work, but, like, I'm a helper. If he has a business, I'm there to help him with his business. Um, whatever he needs. That's usually my place. Kind of like an assistant to pay all the bills. Typically, yeah. But most of the men I encounter, their. Their manly men, so they prefer it to play. Um. What are your deal breakers? Besides being a provider? Deal breakers? I have a lot of deal Breakers. Um, nymphomaniacs. Uh, for people that are not aware, it is men that like to have sex too much. I think there is a lot to life more than sex. So let's not indulge in that. Let's go out, enjoy ourselves, enjoy each other in other aspects. Um, man with multiple baby mamas, that's a no, I. I'm okay with men with kids, but just know, multiple baby mamas. Um, what else? Oh, like ghetto man. I have like, all the gold teeth. Sag their pants. I can't do it. Like, I'm from the hood, but I've been asking bald a little bit, so I just can't go back to that kind of lifestyle. Um, what else? Oh, 50 50 men? Absolutely not. Um, I feel like if you wanna go fifty fifty, you're looking more so for a roommate, not for a partner, not for a woman. Um, the. The world is in fifty fifty. I always say, women have periods, women have babies. So life isn't fair. Life isn't fifty fifty now. Okay, I want you to respond to this, cause this is gonna be a statement. You had a long list of deal breakers. What would you say to the person that would say you're currently unemployed? And that's a lot of deal breakers for a woman who can't even technically take care of herself at this moment? Well, just because I'm unemployed, it doesn't make me lesser of a person. And it doesn't tell me That I need to settle. So those are things that I still need and I still require. Just because I'm unemployed, I'm not supposed to be like, oh, yeah, now I'm okay with smokers, I'm okay with ghetto dudes. No, I. I absolutely will not, um, lessen my standards. Would you date an unemployment, um. Again, because I look for the man to be the provider. As a woman, I wouldn't. So you want a man to accept something that you wouldn't accept, right, right. And everybody has their preferences and what they accept and what they don't. But as a woman, I wouldn't date an unemployed man, because how is he to provide? Well, some men that are. That are able to provide one women that can provide for themselves. A lot of men that like to provide for women, they do it as an honor, because they know she's out here and she called herself down. This is accomplished. That I've heard at times that men don't mind providing, but they also wanna be your daddy. And if they feel like you can't take care of yourself, why is it now my responsibility to take care of you? Well, those are the ones I'm not looking for. I'm looking for a man. I'm looking for a man that's open. He understands where I am. He understands my capabilities and my abilities. He knows that if he has a business, I'm willing to contribute and help him run it. So I have a lot of attributes that would be beneficial",

    "voice_to_text": "Closest you've ever come to dying. On April 21st of 2017, I was in my neighborhood knocking on doors and introducing myself to the neighbors. I was 1/1 year Realtor trying to get my business going. Toward the end of a 4 hour day of door knocking, I approached the door and rang the bell. Almost immediately I felt nauseous and knew I was about to pass out. I wake up to the sound of a lady speaking to 911. She was spelling my name to the 911 operator. I always wear my name badge when out. As I came to, she asked if I wanted an ambulance. I said no, I'm just dehydrated. The lovely lady was a retired nurse in her late 60s or early 70s. She had her husband drive me the 3 blocks back home. I began drinking water but passed out a couple of more times. I called my girlfriend and asked her to come over as soon as she got off work. Not wanting to fall down again, I went to my bedroom and laid down. She arrived with Gatorade and I drank part of one before throwing it back up. I passed out a few more times. I live with my older sister who was returning from a business trip that evening. When she got home, I spoke with her about passing out multiple times. That afternoon. My sister insisted that we go to the ER. We all piled into my truck and My sister drove. I passed out again during the drive to the hospital. The ER nurse got me on a table after checking me in. By this point, I was feeling very hungry, having missed lunch, and it was now well after 10 p m. I explained to the staff that I had passed out at least 10 to 12 times today. The medical staff went into the hall to discuss my case. Impossible treatment. I felt the nausea again and told my sister it was starting again. She had not witnessed me passing out yet. She ran to the door and called the medical staff. When she turned around, my heart had flatlined. The ER staff immediately performed CPR, including shocking me with the defibrillator. When I came to, I looked at the nurse and said, it happened again, right? She asked if this is what I had been experiencing all afternoon. I confirmed it before passing out yet again. The episodes continued for the next several hours. When they finally got me awake again, the cardiologist explained that I wasn't passing out. I was actually going into cardiac arrest each time due to an issue with my vagus nerve. They decided that the best course of action would be a pacemaker. I can only imagine the pain and fear that my family went through that evening. My part was pretty easy. Heart stops, pass out, CPR and wait back up. The one benefit of dying more than 30 Times in one day is that I now have a much greater appreciation for life",

    "voice_to_text": "my mom survived a serial killer, and this is her story. okay, so my mom is attending college, and she was walking out of the library when a very handsome man with a beard approached her. it was raining really hard, and he complimented her cute polka dotted umbrella. anyways, they strike up a conversation and he mentions that because he's a photography student, he notices things like cute umbrellas. he's got an eye for it. but the university my mom is going to, they had a dress code, and beards were not allowed for students to have at that time. and so she had a little red flag like, hmm, if he's a student here, how does he have a beard? so the conversations winding down, and he offers to hold her umbrella and walk her to her car because her hands are full of books. she says that she really didn't want him to walk her. she just had this weird feeling, um, but felt awkward saying no, so she said yes. as she starts approaching her car, she said that her stomach started getting the butterflies, and it's like she just knew not to go to her car. and I think it's worth mentioning pausing the story right here because I work for a nutrition company, and I learned that your gut has 500,000,000 neurons, and your brain has one billion or a hundred billion, I don't remember. okay, I just looked it up. a hundred billion, neurons are in your brain. 500,000,000 are in your gut. and that's why they call your gut your second brain, because they are totally connected. so if you have a gut feeling, you have to listen to it. so they're walking in the parking lot, and he's asking, okay, so which car is yours? which. which direction do we walk? and my mom just can't take that feeling in her stomach anymore. she goes, oh, shoot, you know what? I just remembered I have to meet up with a friend. no need to walk me to my car anymore. I actually have to go back to the building. she then says that he acted a little bit annoyed, but he smiled and asked if he could call her later. that because it's close to finals week, he had one final project where he needed to photograph somebody and thought that she would be perfect and he would love to connect with her. my cutie mama is the biggest people pleaser you will ever meet in your entire life. maybe that's where I get it from. and she couldn't say no, but instead, she decided to come up with, like, a loop around where I just moved into my new apartment. so I don't remember the new phone number, but if you can look at my parents in the phone book, you can call them, and then we can connect. my grandma and grandpa have very unoriginal names. there's at least 10 people with the same names in the phone book. so she figured, one, he's probably not gonna spend the time looking in the phone book, and 2, she's not. he's not gonna figure out, like, which number is theirs. so my mom scurries off and thinks that she's avoided some weirdo, but, you know, didn't really think much of it until later that night.",
