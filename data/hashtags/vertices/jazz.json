where the f is all my jungle is the person digging that's me trying to I just had to I just did one the other day showing Jason a whole bunch of Jackson Vine I didn't realize I had that many Jackson Forty fives no hold on talking about signing records and people being on it I have a fantastic story just let me find the record okay this might take me a minute I've been looking for already five minutes I might hold on hold on okay so um it's the it's Maynard Ferguson's Conquistador album and I know it's in here I know it's in here that it that's chameleon that's that's chameleon okay the reason I'm I'm that's Dead Kennedys um Beatles White Album very Corsten okay I know what's in here it's got to be this one I've already looked Richard Pyre that punk oh speaking of autographs that's one this is a the time that Kubert signed the record backwards he meant to sign it to DJ Rufus with ah hold on Rufus is my middle name and was my original DJ name before I switched it to the funky trumpet actually signed it DJ Kubert Peace DJ Rufus which is backwards he meant to sign it DJ Rufus Peace from DJ Kubert and as he finished like literally as he finished he goes oh shit I grabbed it and was like nope nope it's mine now uh weird flex but I actually talked to Kubert on the semi regular basis nowadays about jazz which is again weird flex to say but we don't talk about djing we talk about jazz let me ah speaking and and this is why I'm trying to find this this album haha okay so Maynard Ferguson Maynard Ferguson can keys to door one of one of like my favorite albums right one of my favorite albums I had it signed I walked up to Randy Brecker Randy freaking Brecker when he played at our college and I ended up playing long story short got to meet Randy Brecker and doctored him into Kappa Kappa Psi as a brother like he is a brother of the Alpha Road chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi because of me hi um I had Randy sign this album to which he immediately looked at me and was like I didn't play on this why why would you have me sign this this album and I am I I I was very confused because I'd always looked at the back of this album and I knew that he was on here um it it says let's see Peter Erskin who's a different and we'd actually perform with Peter Erskin like the year before but uh there's one hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on ah see it's not on any of the credits you have to look down I we we just I just made another video about bogarting music blah blah blah no you had to look down here on the other side where it's like additional players George Benson Bob James uh Ralph McDonald John Faddis Marvin Stamp and Randy Brecker I had to literally point out to Randy Brecker that he had played on this album and even he then then looked at it again was like oh my god I did the look of confusion and then relief and then like memory he he immediately followed it up with yeah well back then we were doing so many recordings which means that he was probably in a studio recording something else and just happened to be like the same way that Dan Rackroyd ended up on the we are the world or yeah we are the world recording he just happened to be in that studio that day or whatever no Randy Randy Brecker Randy Brecker of the Brecker Brothers who had performed on this album didn't know that he was on this album so when I went to have him sign this album his at first he didn't want to sign it like I'm not joking at first he he actually handed it back to me he's like I appreciate it but you know I'm not mayor and I'm like I know you played on this I mean almost as if like dude do you not know that I know who you are look at Maynard's face ah look at me Maynard was a legend Maynard was a legend there's so many amazing stories about Maynard Ferguson and as a trumpet player this dude was the end all be like we we still we we always will have DOC Severance and we will always have uh people like um Alan Vizzuti Marie Marisse Andre um you know JB Arben this dude this dude not only did he invent I mean when they call the super bone the look it up it's not a dirty word it's an actual instrument the super bone this invented it that's why we call him Maynard Fucking Ferguson MF I've met so many people from the MF orchestra in my lifetime and they all have one thing in common they're cool as so back to Adam and Jason's original video um it doesn't sometimes it may not be coming a may not come sorry my stuttering is getting to me I'm reliving this moment as I'm talking to you guys sometimes sometimes when you want somebody's signature on an autograph signature on an autograph thank you ADHD sometimes when music is so important to you you know what I had a point to this and now I'm just reliving this moment the fact that I walked up to Randy Brecker and handed him an album that he was on and he didn't even remember recording it but then you know it's and again it's not like oh here's George Benson here's a Robbins here's Dennis not a Mark Colby no he's not on here he's not on the theme from Star Trek or Mr Mellow or gonna fly now no no no no he's over here in the side credits like you you don't get this stuff with streaming you don't get this stuff with Spotify I listen to YouTube Music a lot oh god I said the name of the algorithm so then no one's gonna see this video it's also almost 10 minutes long no one's gonna get to this part anyway so my point is uh when it comes to autographs on albums get them get them get them all I just literally made a video about how we are the the protectors and and curators of history with these things every single record that I own is a story multiple stories the one I mean for God's sake I'm sitting here as I'm talking to you I I should have I should have probably just turned the record over but let's go ahead and turn it back up this is the sing 2 soundtrack no pastel but sorry man dude I got goose bumps just stay with me please happy Sunday stay with me one two three four you are how does that make some go this is what music that's not digital I mean it's it's a record but it's understand it's a it's a pressed record this isn't like a vinyl control disc this is an actual record this is what we get if I get the chance if I were to ever get the chance to have Taryn Edgerton or Scarlett Johansson or Nick Crawl or Reese Witherspoon or anybody sign this you bet your ass i'mma do it if I can get even Nick Offerman to sign cause he was he was the dad to the maybe piggy no under and god let me get Bono's signature on this you best believe I would be buried with this album are you kidding me this actually has Bono and Scarlett Johansson singing together yeah get your autographs and if you do get this get get tear nerd turns autograph and then send me a picture of it so I can cry myself to sleep at night cause I don't think I'll ever get a chance to meet Taryn he's like one of my favorite actors and has been since I first saw him in Kingsman had no idea he was that talented are you kidding me",

    "voice_to_text": "Mommy, are you aware of the Drake and Kendrick Lamar beef? Was so confusing. I did not get it. Well, that's. I see a lot of people, like, reacting to these videos like, oh, my god, this is such a good explanation. LA LA, LA, you know, whatever. But every time I see one of these types of videos, it reminds me of something my mom said years ago, which is that every time white people want to understand something, black people naturally do. A newology is created. I think that a lot of people would be surprised if they looked at history and discovered how many allergies were created solely because people that were not like us wanted to understand so bad why we doing what we doing. And I've been a little torn over the past couple days because the fact that I'm hearing people say things like, this is not important. And in the grand scheme, I understand why people think that, because it's certainly not the most important thing going on in the world. But I think that people should definitely be paying attention to what is happening within this specific situation, because when the people who are not like us begin to apologize things, it isn't long before what they believe about those things becomes canon. And when their version of what they believe about it becomes canon, it slowly begins moving away from black culture, black style, and our authentic understanding, sense and practice. The intellectualizing of it from people who are not like us is what makes it static, because it removes us from it. That's what happened at jazz. That's why in 2024, you can have people done near ready to riot over Beyonce making a country album. Because when a group came in, intellectualized it, and then snatched it, it became stagnant and it became theirs. This is how that slowly begins to happen. And no, it isn't as important as many, many, many other things, but it is a part of our culture, and it is important. A lot of people have questions about colonization because they don't really understand how it works or what it looks like. This is it. Live right in front of you. And I know it's not everyone's intention, but this is how it start. And that is why Kendrick Lamar hates him. That is the point. Everything else, there are many things that rest on top of it, but that is the root.",
