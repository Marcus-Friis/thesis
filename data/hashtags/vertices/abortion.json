    "voice_to_text": "so if you're pro life anti abortion anti planned Parenthood see even when they try to apologize it doesn't come off as genuine or it's just a bunch of bullshit that's the older millennial trying to apologize for the things he said when he was drunk in which he did say that he was pro choice and that's the reason why he was okay with unaliving mentally challenged people now all of a sudden he's not pro choice and he's only apologizing to people that are pro life anti abortion and anti Planned Parenthood his apology is a giant virtue signal at this point but what's funny to me is when people talk about like the sanctity of life that's all they care about is just the word life they don't care about everything that goes into the life the experiences the environment and all those thing they don't care that that child didn't ask to be born they didn't ask to be born in a poverty into a country into a religion into the parents that they have in the family search they don't get a choice in any of those things they're just thrust into life but when they try to do make choices for themselves about who they are and who they wanna be like trans issues then they're looked upon and called ridiculous or unmoral or trying to destroy the fabric of society always like to hear when these people talk about like well isn't just the experience of life worth it yeah for some people that are doing really good but you know there are a lot of people that unalive themselves ask those people how they felt because if their life was so bad that they decided to unalive themselves and continue living that speaks volumes about the experience of life right the fact that unaliving oneself is such a widespread thing I I can't give any weight to the experience of life argument and no I'm not trying to say it's okay just to have abortions willy nilly or whatever but the vast majority of reasons why people are anti abortion make no sense he also keeps referring to as murdering babies which is just a bunch of nonsense because the technical definition of what's inside the womb is not a baby it doesn't become a baby until it leaves the womb inside the womb it is considered a fetus yeah we have words with definitions for a reason it's the same argument y'all like to make about trans people it's like we have male and female for reason and definitions don't change yeah well in this case the definition of a fetus is a human life inside of a womb he likes to use the word babies because it's an appeal to emotion it's a logical fallacy the older millennial isn't sorry that he said those things he's sorry he got the backlash from saying those things because no matter how drunk I get I have never ever said the world would be a better place if we just unalived the mentally handicapped he's not sorry for that that dude honestly thought he was making some like philosophical broke point and people would support him and it turned out that they didn't so now he's backtracking if you don't know what a grifter is then you just saw one because I also remember him saying I don't give a shit what anybody thinks I'm gonna say what's on my and then he apologizes for what he thinks you know I've heard conservatives say people that do that are called weak and liberals because they don't stand on their convictions but I digress here the vast majority of abortions are not done because somebody wants to go on vacation but then again at the crux of this argument is the simple fact that conservatives are trying to tell people what to do with their bodies and using government force to do that because at the end of the day when we look at law and how personality is defined in the United States Constitution and how we practice all these things together because at the end of the day we don't treat them the fetuses like human beings we treat them like a fetus when we look at the Constitution and the laws and everything surrounding all of the stuff is a fetus unless in the case of like somebody who intentionally tries to unalive the mother and they knew that there was a fetus inside but for the most part doesn't have Social Security card can't get insurance on it can't register it for school or anything like that you can't there's nothing fetuses aren't separate from their mothers at that point you can't claim it on your taxes calling it a baby or thinking of it as like a a baby only advantages those who are anti abortion because like I said before it's an appeal to emotion it gets you to think about a baby outside of the womb and you trying to do harmful things to that but do you really wanna know how to get people to answer a question about whether fetuses or anything inside of a womb is like worth the life of one baby on the outside you ask them this hypothetical there is a lab that is on fire and in a petri dish there are hundreds of potential fetuses and then there is one crying baby which one do you save most people are gonna say the crying baby they don't care about whatever's in the petri dish and that's what type of response they're trying to get at when they call they the baby inside of the womb or say that you're murdering babies or whatever anyways the older man millennial isn't sorry he does not fucking care dude it's just another wannabe trash can at this point",

    "voice_to_text": "The Indiana Attorney General says that abortion reports should be public records. I have more on this story. You can go back and watch the last video if you want, like, the full info on what the Indiana attorney General is up to. But the short version is that he wants to bring back individual abortion reports and make them publicly available in the same way that birth or death certificates are. He's saying he needs them because that is how. Making those publicly available to third parties is how he figures out who to prosecute. So the new bit of news is that an Indiana anti abortion group, voices for life, is now suing the state. They're suing the. The state health department for the right to access people's abortion reports. They say that it's the right of private citizens to look through these reports to look for evidence of wrong doing that they can then turn over to the attorney general's office if they see something sketchy. What this means, essentially, is that they want to be able to comb through people's records. People's names wouldn't be in them, but there would be identifying information, especially if you're from a rural community. Um, they want to be able to comb through these reports, scour these reports, look for anything that they think that the AG can. Can use to target abortion providers and clinics. And by the way, they're not, um, finding stuff that is like, oh, my Gosh, this. This clinic put this person's health and life in danger. No, they're talking about. They, um, filed this report 12 hours late. They, um, you know, miss this small requirement that the licensing board in code, blah, blah, blah. Says, like, they're going after these little petty things, anything to make abortion providers lives miserable, right? And they are willing to completely, just. Just decimate our privacy in the process. So make sure to, um, check out the newsletter. The. The story is up there, but it's. It's bad.",

But when he says, keep throwing them away. Because have you noticed that Planned Parenthoods are in the most poverty stricken parts in America? Like, for example, I live in Georgia, so there's Planned Parenthoods in downtown Atlanta. Okay, y'all realize that the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, is a relative to Charles Darwin, who invented Darwinism, survival of the fittest. She wanted to use eugenics to make a perfect race. So by making a perfect race, she, you know, created birth control, um, to make a perfect race, which, um, would take out, um, pretty much everybody that wasn't white. So survival of the fittest, um, if you had this trait, or this trait, or this trait, whatever it was, um, she was gonna use the idea of eugenics to create a perfect race. Um, so that's why when you see, um, Planned Parenthood, you see them in specific communities, um, and it's targeted. That's why. That's why there's so many Planned Parenthoods in, um, I guess you say more poverty stricken, um, cities and areas. Because Margaret Sanger wanted to create a perfect race. And by doing that, she was destroying every other race and allowing women to access free healthcare and free, free, um, maternal and, um, pregnancy care. No, she wants you to have an Abortion, that's why",

They dont even realize where they stand in the argument of a woman\u2019s right to choose. #politics #abortion #prochoice ",
    "voice_to_text": "I actually agree with these college kids that Palestinian children matter. He then, of course, goes on to make this abortion argument about how do they. Do they think that the children in the womb of Palestinian women also matter, right? Oh, sick burn. But here's the reality. Um, conservatives, or at least pro lifers, tend to make this argument. And it tells me that either they are pretending, which is possible, or that they don't actually understand what the pro choice argument is when it comes to, um, abortion. It is the right to make a choice. You don't have to have an abortion. No one is telling you you have to. It is the right as a human being for a woman to make her own choice. Ironically, the pro life argument is gotta have, you know, gotta have this kid no matter what. And I don't agree with it, but at least that's consistent with what the title that you use. Ironically, though, the vast majority of pro lifers are for exceptions, right? Therefore, exceptions of in the case of rape or incest, um, or, you know, possible death of the mother. I would argue, and people don't like to hear this, but I would argue those people are actually pro choice too. Because if you can make a choice in certain situations, then you're for choice. It doesn't mean that you always choose abortion. It just means that you make a choice other than keeping the Kid, in every single instance. So people who are like, I'm for exceptions, guess what? You're in the same fucking group as the people who you rail against. The problem is, you don't ever see any nuance in your argument. You only see it as those guys bad, us good. And that's the problem. We're not all cavemen. We can be smarter than that. But you're making terrible arguments. And sometimes you don't even know what side of the argument you're on or the side that you're arguing against, which is pathetic. And this guy, uh, that I stitch, um, just so people know his history, he used to work for the Trump administration, but he was fired because he's such a gambling addict that it made him a basically, um, an easy person to flip by a foreign asset. So they fired him because he couldn't stop, uh, betting all his money on a fucking pony or whatever. So this guy is not a moral center for anything. But again, people like him don't even know the argument that they're arguing against, nor do they barely know their side of it. Pathetic.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

That's why, for the majority of American families, suddenly coming up with thousands of dollars to fly out of state for emergency health care is out of the question. For our client Samantha Casiano, who's earning $15.80 an hour and raising four children in a mobile home, the cost of an out-of-state abortion to terminate a pregnancy with fatal complications was simply out of her reach. Instead, Texas's extreme abortion ban forced Samantha to carry her doomed pregnancy to term and then watch her baby Halo die a painful, traumatizing death. Economic inequality in the US is already at an all-time high. Abortion bans force low-income people to endure unspeakable trauma\u2014unnecessary trauma\u2014at the hands of the state. We can do better. We MUST do better.",

I am 29 years old, and my partner and I live in East Texas in a mobile home along with my four children. I'm a document processor, and I make 1580 an hour. And 2022 we found out that we were pregnant. I was excited, um, until. Unfortunately, we found out that my daughter was diagnosed with encephalie, which meant that her skull and her brain was never going to fully develop, which meant that she was incompatible with life. My doctor said my only option I had in Texas was to carry on my doom pregnancy until I was able to give birth. My doctor was only able to give me a prescription for antidepressants and a funeral home paper of where I can bury my daughter. We called clinics in New Mexico and Arizona, but financially, it was out of our reach. So having to get a rental, extra childcare, gas, food, hotel stay, and then missing work, we quickly realized that it was impossible. I had to remain pregnant and carry Halo for the rest of my pregnancy until I went into labor. I carried Halo for several months. Once Halo was born, all we can do was hold her tiny body and watch her change colors to her death. She went from Pink to red to blue to purple. It was cruel and inhumane. These are inhumane abortion laws.",

    "voice_to_text": "What happened yesterday at a Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and how does it directly correlate to the work we do here in Swan? Yesterday there was a large and peaceful Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and it ended with extreme police violence, excessive use of force, and the arrest of two Palestinian organizers. To use amplified SoundOn public property in the city of Orlando, you need to require a permit. And because this person did not have a permit for the megaphone, the police thought that it was justified to unannounced go into a crowd of peaceful protesters, including families, the elderly, children, and journalists, and start pepper spraying indiscriminately into the crowd and to violently arrest two protesters during this event. They felt that this was justified because of one megaphone and one use of amplified sound at a peaceful rally and protest for the Palestinian people. Now, how does this relate to what we do here in Swan? You may have seen in some of our videos that our protesters on public city of Orlando property use amplified sound, such as cones, to be able to scream towards the clinic and to be able to scream at our patients. We have asked multiple times for Orlando PD to act on this and to stop them from being able to use these cones. We have recently Learned, just last week, that OPD Legal has said that they will not take a stance on this and that they will Not prosecute any of our anti abortion protesters for using amplified SoundOn a public sidewalk in the city of Orlando, likely sending your baby straight to hell. To that we could do for you just a week after learning that OPD will not take any legal cause against our protesters for using amplified sound towards our clinic and to harass our patients right up the road. At Lake Yola in downtown Orlando, protesters were brutalized and violently apprehended by OPD simply over a megaphone at a peaceful protest. There were children in strollers that were pepper sprayed, elderly were pepper sprayed, journalists were pepper sprayed. This was indiscriminately done into a crowd of over 1,000 people without warning or without any sort of announcement that they were going to start pepper spraying individuals if they did not disperse. There was no dispersal warning before this was done. And yet our anti abortion protesters use amplified sound every day. And we have verbal confirmation that OPD legal will do nothing against our anti abortion protesters. Carden, Michael Carden. This is about the head first footage for police department. He called the city attorney and they said for now they're not, we're not doing anything with it. I hope this video serves as a stark reminder that the police's only function is to uphold the interests of the state and that our state in our country is financing and benefiting off of the genocide of the Palestinian people. Fuck OPD and Free Palestine",

Do you agree with the point of view that if we continually restrict the freedom of marriage as a legitimate social option, we do this to people who are of fertile, ripe, fertile age and may have. May have a pregnancy and a baby involved. Are we not, in fact, making abortion a much more desirable alternative when marriage might be the right solution for some freedom loving couple? All disrespect intended, representative. Little girls who get their periods are not ripe and fertile. And suggesting that you marry them off to the predator who got them pregnant is not a way to solve for abortion. That was Representative Jess Edwards out of New Hampshire, whose idea to curb abortion is to force children who become pregnant into marriages. If you're like me, you might have some strong feelings about that. Some. Some. Some feedback. Because according to Jess here, it is better to force a child not only to give birth, but also to be married to the predator who got them pregnant.",

People have died in countries where abortion is restricted. Savita Halipanavar, a 31 year old woman living in Ireland whose baby had zero chance of surviving, died in 2,012 because she was denied an abortion due to the country's strict laws at the time. Her death received worldwide attention. That repealed the Eighth Amendment that made abortions illegal unless the pregnancy was life threatening. Then in America, states with limited access to abortion had maternal death rates that were 62% higher than states with unrestricted access. And we're still not seeing any change. But unfortunately, 40 Days of life founder and president Sean Carney didn't stop there, even though most of us wish he did. You know, my body, my choice. You can't really go streaking in most parts of our country and tell the cops, my body, my choice. We have to wear a seatbelt, you know, for crying out loud. I don't know how he went from point A to point purple, but just to summarize what my body, my choice means, since it seems to be a hard concept for some people to grasp, it means you should decide what you want to do with your body. So, yes, if you want to streak, you made the decision that will probably and rightfully land you in jail if you don't. Want to wear a seatbelt, for crying out loud? Then yes, it's your decision to possibly suffer injuries that could have been avoided. But at the end of the day, it was your choice. I hope that clears some things up. No one benefits from abortion except for bad, irresponsible men. Actually, I think the women who are experiencing medical emergencies.

Maybe if black mothers would stop having random children with random men without being married and having a family to keep that child in, there wouldn't be so many black children to adopt. Also, while you're on the internet running your mouth, how many children can you adopt? Probably zero, because you don't qualify. Because you have to have a family. You have to be financially sound. See, this is how the process works. First they reach out to the immediate family, any blood relatives, and try to get somebody to take that child. That didn't work. Then they try to find a child which a family they can connect with. Same race. That didn't work, and they had no choice but to put the child with a white T family who was willing to take the child. So instead of asking why are YT people adopting black people, why don't you ask why there's so many black children up for adoption? Aren't y'all the most educated? Aren't y'all making the most money that any other group of black women have ever made? So why aren't you adopting black babies?",

It is so nice for Sleepy Joe to be so upfront and honest with us. Y'all remember when they told us that they had put together this voter fraud organization before he got elected? It was supposed to be the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of the United States of America. Pay attention, folks.

Um, most seats have some sort of abortion reporting law. Um, Indiana change theirs. They used to have, like, individual reports to the state about each individual abortion, but since Indiana passed its ban, um, there are such a few amount of abortions that if they created individual reports, people would be able to figure out who they were, essentially. Especially if you're talking about someone in a rural community. They could essentially, like, reverse engineer, um, identifying information. And so they said, you know what? Um, we're not gonna do that. We're not gonna put out individual reports. We're gonna put out aggregate reports. The AG, though, is all upset because he says, I won't be able to arrest and prosecute anyone if I don't have publicly available individual reports. And so he doesn't care that people might be able to identify the people in these records. Um, and this is part. This is what I write in the piece. This is part of a much, much bigger strategy using abortion reporting, um, as a way to intimidate, shame, stigmatize women who. Who get abortions. Uh, it's.
