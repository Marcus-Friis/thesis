Our GOAL should be that no child should ever have to worry about getting pregnant EVER and yet this white entitled woman, having proven that its \u201cpotentially not fatal\u201d does what exactly? Give more ammo to pedophiles? That being pro-life means that your child or teen or adult or any fucking adult who is harmed sexually is not important at all compared to the bundle of cells that they have in their bodies that they do not need nor want? Are y\u2019all fucking insane? The point of being pro-choice is the choice part, goddamnit. Children shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being parents when theyre still kids, and adults shouldn\u2019t be forced to have kids just because the state and the federal system deems their bodies as properties and places of child birth rather than a human being who is going to have to brunt the weight of life. This whole anti-abortion rethoric is sickening and lets not forget that there are people out there who need abortives just to live comfortably.  And what, were getting rid of condoms now too? You want more STD\u2019s to spread, children and adults to be harmed, and unwanted babies everywhere??? The state and federal system doesnt care about the damage that this is going to do to the people at all!!! Because I\u2019m not all that intelligent and knowledgeable about politics, but even I know that removing the option\u2026 is just going to cause more death, more famine, more people and children on the streets, and so so SO much WORSE!

So you think the Catholic teachings are against greed, gluttony, lust, envy, wrath, sloth, and rainbow flags? Yeah, you're truly fucking special. I also thought it's funny how he talked about the truth being of the utmost importance because the truth is the minority now, and then tied that to Catholicism. Yeah, Republicans will go to their grave swearing that Jesus existed without a single piece of evidence, but then when an obvious misogynist like Trump is accused of sexual misconduct, it's where is the proof? This might be a difficult thing to get your small little brain around, but just because you believe in something doesn't mean that it's the truth. Also, given those very believable accusations about you and the Mao cheerleader, I think it's borderline insanity to get up on stage and call Biden a hypocritical Catholic. Cause if you can't be Catholic and pro choice, you can't be Catholic and pro cock. But now if you are gonna criticize the Catholic Church, I would say the problem isn't priest taking photos with their dogs, but more so the systemic pedophilia. And that is a truth about your religion. There are articles, police reports, statistics, and of course we have these comments about women which are so outdated and traditional even addressing them is just Like, because if you want women to stay at home, which I'm sure many of them would be happy to do. Actually, maybe you need to speak to the men in the room and tell them to step up as providers. Because how the fuck do you expect women to be homemakers? Most of the men out here want them to split the Bill. Ah yeah, the baffling paradox of how women stay at home with no jobs, but also don't be a gold digger. I do think we should give Isabel her props though. Not for being a homemaker or a wife, but for her job as a full time beard.",

    "voice_to_text": "If we go back to March 1982, and Senator Joe Biden was on the Senate Judiciary, he voted in favor of an abortion Bill, and that vote helped move that Bill out of committee. And the Bill was to state that abortion should be a state's rights issue. And the point that the older millennials trying to make here is that Joe Biden has changed his stance on abortion since 1982. And because US liberals aren't going, oh, Joe Biden, you are terrible for doing that, makes us hypocrites. Of course it doesn't make us hypocrites. It just points out the difference in the mindset of the conservative mind and the progressive mind. See, as a progressive, if you were to ask me this morning when I woke up, hey, Joe Biden voted on a Bill in 1982, which is now 42 years ago, that, uh, was about abortion. And what do you think Joe Biden stance on abortion was back in 1982? 39 year old Joe Biden, I would assume. I would say, well, you know, Joe Biden was 39 years old. Much younger, much more connected to the indoctrination he probably felt as a child. You know, 39 year old Roman Catholic Joe Biden, I would expect. In 1982, when the abortion issue was still kinda getting started and still navigating its way political, and what, what each side felt about it, I would assume that Roman Catholic Joe Biden in 1982, 42 years ago, would have been against Abortion. I assume that would be the case. And because I'm a progressive, I don't think that makes me a hypocrite. I actually expect people to change their beliefs on social issues as they go through adulthood and experience life and view the way things are. And taking tons of data, I expect them to analyze that data over the course of their life and change their minds about social issues. But in the mind of a conservative, the point of being a conservative is to, despite all the things that you observe, despite all the data that you analyze, it's actually to not analyze that data. That's why they say, you know, don't send your kid to college, they'll get indoctrinated. Because the whole purpose of the conservative political mindset is to go through life continuing to believe the same exact things that you socially believed when you came into adulthood, the same things that you were taught your whole life. The actual indoctrination needs to stay in effect. It doesn't need to be changed by all the things that you experience in life. And if you change the way you feel and you feel different 42 years later about a social issue, that makes you an inconsistent sellout if you're a conservative. So no, I'm not shocked that 39 year old Joe Biden was against abortion and that 81 Joe Biden is for a woman's right to choose. Because as a progressive, I believe the whole purpose of Life is to get better with age, not just stay the same miserable asshole.",

    "voice_to_text": "so as we all know that the 6 weeks abortion ban in Florida just went into effect yesterday so before I talk about what I really wanna talk about I want to remind you all that the abortion measures will be on the ballot in November in Florida so please go out and vote and make your wise hard and make a change to this really draconian law that they just put in to effect now the rest of the video is actually for pro lifers and I'm only gonna talk to pro life for women because I really don't think men has any business telling us what to do with our uteruses as long as since we are not telling them what to do with their testicles so I don't think that even even count so pro life for women I want to just talk to you about what you just did having this draconian abortion ban in place in all these red states now including Florida and supporting these people who actually did that to us for starters I wanna mention that the banning abortion in these states and putting in criminalizing laws against medical care providers will only result and is resulting into these Obgyns and the care providers moving out of these states because nobody would want to work in a state where there is a constant fear of being criminalized for your you know the service you're providing so that you're gonna have less and less Obgyns to go to uh when you need them so don't you think that you will be pregnant at some point or you are going to need doctors you're not gonna get them that's what you did 20% chance of every pregnancy to result into a miscarriage I had one uh before my son and uh nothing that I did to cause it but you know what's gonna happen to you if you end up in that 20% group and have a miscarriage in these red states they're gonna arrest you first and ask you what you did to cause it lot of these times when miscarriages happen and you might need medical intervention to to actually remove all the fetal remaining uh to a procedure called DNC because lot of the times the body is unable to expel out all the fetal remaining and you need medical intervention you're not gonna get that you know what's gonna happen the remaining fetal remaining inside your body can get your body going to sepsis and eventually you're gonna die you know what else he did there's a chance that your pregnancy does not happen in your uterus and it happens in a fallopian tube and this this particular pregnancy is a nonviable pregnancy and it's called um ectopic pregnancy it's nonviable because the fetus cannot really grow in a fallopian tube it ends up with your fallopian tube being ruptured and the mother losing their tube if there is not timely medical intervention happening you don't think you can make it into that group ectopic pregnancies are very common it happens to a lot of people and you know what else is a possible the the possibility of that woman getting a second ectopic pregnancy increases after having the first one talk about the odds right you don't think you can make it into that group you know what else you did you might have a really like a smooth pregnancy up into the second trimester maybe up into the third trimester one out of 25 pregnancies end up having preeclampsia a condition in which the mother's blood pressure goes up to an extend that it can cause seizure it actually starts to cause organ damages like kidney damage and liver damage and you might end up losing those organs and the only process uh that can actually prevent you know like permanent damage to your body is medical intervention which is basically providing a C section removing the placenta and the baby you know what's gonna happen you're not gonna get out of that you don't think you can make it into that group it happened to me everything was fine up until like 38th week so you're not gonna get out of that you will not get any essential medical care when you are pregnant and you want that baby so bad you're not gonna get out of that you not only took away the abortion access from these women you took away essential medical care from yourself that's what you did I hope that helps congrats",

Do they think that the children in the womb of Palestinian women also matter, right? Oh, sick burn. But here's the reality. Um, conservatives, or at least pro lifers, tend to make this argument. And it tells me that either they are pretending, which is possible, or that they don't actually understand what the pro choice argument is when it comes to, um, abortion. It is the right to make a choice. You don't have to have an abortion. No one is telling you you have to. It is the right as a human being for a woman to make her own choice. Ironically, the pro life argument is gotta have, you know, gotta have this kid no matter what. And I don't agree with it, but at least that's consistent with what the title that you use. Ironically, though, the vast majority of pro lifers are for exceptions, right? Therefore, exceptions of in the case of rape or incest, um, or, you know, possible death of the mother. I would argue, and people don't like to hear this, but I would argue those people are actually pro choice too. Because if you can make a choice in certain situations, then you're for choice. It doesn't mean that you always choose abortion. It just means that you make a choice other than keeping the Kid, in every single instance. So people who are like, I'm for exceptions, guess what? You're in the same fucking group as the people who you rail against. The problem is, you don't ever see any nuance in your argument. You only see it as those guys bad, us good. And that's the problem. We're not all cavemen. We can be smarter than that. But you're making terrible arguments. And sometimes you don't even know what side of the argument you're on or the side that you're arguing against, which is pathetic. And this guy, uh, that I stitch, um, just so people know his history, he used to work for the Trump administration, but he was fired because he's such a gambling addict that it made him a basically, um, an easy person to flip by a foreign asset. So they fired him because he couldn't stop, uh, betting all his money on a fucking pony or whatever. So this guy is not a moral center for anything. But again, people like him don't even know the argument that they're arguing against, nor do they barely know their side of it. Pathetic.",

A 13 year old victim is forced to give birth over confusion about the state's abortion ban. She was just 12 years old when it happened, and yet, because of Mississippi's archaic abortion laws, her mom didn't know whether she would qualify for the exemption. And even if she did qualify, it's unlikely that any physician would have performed one anyway, given the high penalties for doctors who violate the state's abortion ban. And so now, at 13 years old, this little girl in seventh grade has an eight month old child. This right here is the direct result, the direct result of what Donald Trump did to the Supreme Court.",

They look at everything emotionally,  not logically.  Nobody's going around trying to mrd3r babies. Duh.  25% of pregnancies result in miscarriage anyway.  Why is that? Do they think about that?  I would expect people who care about life to think about that deeply,  jeez! One in four.  That's a lot. And that's not talking about abortion,  that is just miscarriage.  This is when, you know, the kid doesn't make it.  Why does this happen?  Do they think about it?  Do they care about it?  Not that I've noticed.  If they did, they'd be looking at things like, \"Oh.  All of the crap that we put into the environment (all the plastics, all the pollutants,  all of this) it results in men having lower sperm counts,  it results in women being unable to get pregnant,  it results in birth defects,  it results in miscarriages.  All of this terrible pollution that we have,  that is a really big problem,  but we're just going to keep on voting for politicians who want to screw up our environment even worse.\" And I don't get that.  It's so completely inconsistent.  You either care about life or you don't, is how I see it,  right? They obviously don't care.  So (they need to) shut up about people that,  you know, can't carry a pregnancy the whole way through.  Shut up about the fact that their bodies are not,  you know, necessarily ejecting these failed pregnancies and that they need an actual medical procedure to help them out.  They just have this whole emotional thought of 'oh everybody's trying to mrd3r babies! \ud83d\ude2d' No.  That is far, far,  FAR from the truth.

Then he goes on to say that Isabelle, his wife, has no regrets about giving up her dream of having a career. Isabel's dream of having a career might not have come true, but if you ask her today if she has any regrets on her decision, she would laugh out loud. Now, his wife is truly happy with that decision. I absolutely support her. I think being a wife and mother are beautiful things. I think addressing women specifically and saying, this is your purpose is really unfortunate, to put it mildly. You know, she is happy and healthy. They have a great marriage, great family. Then I'm all for it. For them. I fear that may not be the case, but I. I pray that I'm wrong. Also, by the way, this is his company, MD Keller, for which he is a co founder, and the college where he gave this commencement speech. It is listed as an organization that his company fully endorses. Now, there is something he said that I actually agree with. It has to do with men being absent from their homes. But I'm sure we have different thoughts on why that is. Here's that clip. Absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other Countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the. He also spends quite a bit of time arguing for traditional Latin Masses. And I understand he's talking at a Catholic church. Seems a little odd to me. Why is he arguing so hard for this, like at a college graduation? It just seems kind of out of place. I don't know. Just like, a little odd. Last clip about cost of living is extremely important that you actually think about the places you are moving to. Who is the bishop? What kind of parishes are there? Do they offer the TLM and have priests who embrace their priestly vocation? Cost of living must not be the only arbiter of your choice. That's pretty rich coming from a multi millionaire. It doesn't have to worry about the cost of living all that much. Anyways, just wanna share some clips with y'all.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Because she's proposed a federal database to collect information on pregnant people. That's right. She wants people that become pregnant to put all of their personal information into pregnancy.gov and trust that it's not gonna be used for nefarious reasons in a country where there states that literally want to give those same people Let them eat cake penalty if they end their pregnancy. Couldn't possibly be used against us. Because this Bill has absolutely nothing to do with supporting moms, despite the fact that they call it the Moms Act, and has everything to do with stopping people from ending their pregnancy. So what's more, this Bill itself is going to make sure people are not getting the best possible cared resources. They're only going to get those that are in line with the anti that word propaganda. The Bill specifically forbids any entity that performs, induces, refers, or councils in favor of that thing from being listed in the database. Which would, in fact, eliminate swathes of OBGYN services and health clinics across the nation. Rather, they want to collect your information and send you to places like crisis pregnancy centers. You know, like ones that will see you, give you an ultrasound, tell you everything's a okay, and it turns out you have an ectopic pregnancy and you almost on the life Yet that actually happened. Because they don't want you going to comprehensive medical clinics that can offer actual care. No, they want you going to places like crisis pregnancy centers where they don't actually have medical licenses, and they will just scare you into staying pregnant.",

People have died in countries where abortion is restricted. Savita Halipanavar, a 31 year old woman living in Ireland whose baby had zero chance of surviving, died in 2,012 because she was denied an abortion due to the country's strict laws at the time. Her death received worldwide attention. That repealed the Eighth Amendment that made abortions illegal unless the pregnancy was life threatening. Then in America, states with limited access to abortion had maternal death rates that were 62% higher than states with unrestricted access. And we're still not seeing any change. But unfortunately, 40 Days of life founder and president Sean Carney didn't stop there, even though most of us wish he did. You know, my body, my choice. You can't really go streaking in most parts of our country and tell the cops, my body, my choice. We have to wear a seatbelt, you know, for crying out loud. I don't know how he went from point A to point purple, but just to summarize what my body, my choice means, since it seems to be a hard concept for some people to grasp, it means you should decide what you want to do with your body. So, yes, if you want to streak, you made the decision that will probably and rightfully land you in jail if you don't. Want to wear a seatbelt, for crying out loud? Then yes, it's your decision to possibly suffer injuries that could have been avoided. But at the end of the day, it was your choice. I hope that clears some things up. No one benefits from abortion except for bad, irresponsible men. Actually, I think the women who are experiencing medical emergencies. Or those who simply do not want children are benefiting from abortions. The only true irresponsible factors in this case are the lawmakers who pass such strict abortion bans. That place hundreds, if not thousands of burden people at risk every day.",

The court to recognize that women in America got a fundamental constitutional right. And then Trump took it away. By the way, the deal he made, all he did. Now, in America today, 2024, women have pure rights than their mothers and their grandmothers had. It's all President Trump. The dark death, light. I don't think we're gonna let get away with it. To you and folks, in a sense, I don't know why he's. We're surprised by Trump. How many times he have to prove we can't be trusted. You can't. Trump bragged how proud he was. Everybody took credit for it. He said, there has to be punishment for women exercise in the reproductive freedom. His words, not mine. It is so nice for Sleepy Joe to be so upfront and honest with us. Y'all remember when they told us that they had put together this voter fraud organization before he got elected? It was supposed to be the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of the United States of America. Pay attention, folks. If you listen carefully, they actually admit their crimes out loud. It is always fun when they say the quiet part out loud. I just hope that they're brazing attacks on all of us comes to an end quickly before it is too late.

I couldn't agree more, but what they do is not actually right. they talk about options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. this feels very legit right? this must be like a real medical clinic right? wrong. they talk about how abortion is \u201cno small matter\u201d \u201csome women deeply regret going through with their abortion\u201d when the reality actually shows that five years after most people have an abortion, 95% of them are absolutely pleased that they did and do not regret it but that's just facts they don't like \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they say they're gonna provide the usual pregnancy testing ultrasound in a non-judgemental way and remember\u2026 nowhere on their website do they say that they're motivated by religion or they want to actively get you to not have an abortion but let's talk about the website behind the website\u2026 which is this: So this is not the patient-facing website. this is the website you can find when they talk about who they really are, how to get involved in donations and very blatantly their mission \u201cempowering women to choose life\u201d they say that they have helped 6,000 clients and had 1,318 gospel presentations \ud83d\udc40 I didn't know you needed a gospel presentation when you came in for a pregnancy test. um that's so interesting and religion if that's your thing is totally fine but nowhere outside this building or on their website today at all have any sort of disclaimer that this is a Christian organization that they're gonna find like present the gospel to you when you think you're just coming in to pee on a stick. they also claim that they are committed to offering \u201caccurate information\u201d about abortion procedures and risks yet they absolutely don't. they are known to spread misinformation you saw about abortion pill reversal.  okay so one more time if you're confused: the Downtown Pregnancy Help Center aka free pregnancy testing not a real clinic and friends don't let friends go here for medical care advice counseling anything like that \ud83d\udc4f",

Worse yet, she ignored the overnight desperation texts her 8-year-old son sent about his brother, prosecutors allege. #massachusetts #25yearold #mom #3yearold #todler #died ",
    "voice_to_text": "This is such a difficult story. That three year old was already having serious health problems when he was left alone with his siblings in this Chelsea apartment building. A growing memorial outside the Spencer Street Apartments where three year old JL Guardado Prodensio was found dead Sunday morning. His mother is now charged in his death. Jennifer Perdencio emotional in court today as prosecutors alleged that she left the toddler in the care of his seven and eight year old siblings even though she knew he was sick, suffering from a seizure disorder and was vomiting blood. The defendant went out that night to a bar in Revere where she drank alcohol for a number of hours and then she slept at a friend's home, a boyfriend's home in Somerville. The prosecutor says Perdencio had taken her son for medical treatment twice in the past week but still left him overnight even as his brother sounded the alarm. At some point during the night, the eight year old brother of the alleged victim sent a text to the defendant, their mother, expressing concern for the well being of his brother, the three year old, and actually attaching a video. But the 25 year old did not return home until 10 the next morning to find her youngest son had died. Prodancio's defense attorney says his client is severely distraught over the loss of her child and is cooperating with police. Neighbors at the apartment building are stunned by the Tragedy. I remember the little boy because he was so cute. Very sad because he's only 3 years old now. Perdancio is being held on $100,000 bail. She is due back in court for a probable cause hearing on May 2nd. We are live in Chelsea tonight. I marry Slatna. WCB New Center fire.",
