    "voice_to_text": "I'm gonna have a RANT okay so skip this video if you don't wanna see like um if you don't like the kind of angrier content that people make but it's interesting looking back at this with the context of everything that's going on now at the time it was so easy for the right wing followers to villainize um Jeremy Corbyn and use this to undermine his um his you know place in the race to be prime minister um and it just it makes me so sad because I remember at the time so many people my age were desperate for Labour to come into power and all of the turmoil we've personally experienced as a country since then at the hands of the Tory party in facilitating people who pursue power for the sole purpose of their own greed of fulfilling their own greed um and the consequences of giving those people a platform that we've all experienced over the past what's it been 12 years but also how quickly that plight was dismissed and having Jeremy be like \"oh he's anti Semitic\" and this whole inquiry of anti Semitism in the Labour Party I'm not saying that's not justified because we like to rule that shit out anyway but you know now the people in the Gaza Strip the people in Rafa Palestinians have essential uh uh they're having their own Holocaust um they're having their own genocide and it's it just seems so hypocritical these people at the time that was so vocal about Jeremy Corbyn and you know him being disrespectful about like the Holocaust and stuff like that and it I guess the point I'm trying to get to is the people who voted *Conservatives in back then have facilitated the trauma that's happening in Palestine you and I guess it comes back to the issue of critical thinking and just being fed what you were told by the parties you choose to believe and I don't wanna like say like oh Tories are responsible for what's happening in Palestine but kind of yeah because when you undermine something in order to further your own party in your own pursuit of power you facilitate stuff like this happening um and people who you know said that Jeremy was anti Semitic um and took that side of the debate it it's part of the reason why Palestine is getting so little support now why so many countries are more concerned with um the anti Semitic side of the debate as opposed to the fact that you know 15,000 children have died um and millions of people are displaced and if if there's any message that there's gonna be to this video it's just genuinely think about the content you are consuming because all of it is intentional all of it is to make you behave in a certain way every advert you see on the TV every advert that comes up every two seconds on TikTok um a corporations that so much larger than you trying to influence your attention to further their profit the governments are corrupt and now um it's just sad to see that you know the labour we are exposed to today is nothing compared to what we could have had access to back then and what sorrows me is if Labour had come into power back then how many Palestinian lives would have been saved in this conflict how many children families would have a chance and still be alive today if back then we'd set the precedent of supporting these people instead of now where the the Labour Party is so twisted in order to respond to the Tories and have a chance against the Tories because the British people are an absolute mess these days and the only way to have a shot at being in power is trying appeal to those awful twisted ideologies that you know we have all been infected by it doesn't take a genius to see videos of like children's broken bodies and people screaming in grief their homeland being burnt dying of sickness no hospitals and for you to go that's fucked up and despite a lot like you can't trust a fraction of what's in the news these days anything um any random article is designed to detract us from these issues so we get distracted so we forget the Tories will focus on things like the transgender about the women's bathrooms debate um to detract from these real issues and give us other things that they can control that we can focus on and we can hate um if anything it's just uh a plea for people to instill critical thinking to look at the content you're being fed and being like okay what's the agenda here is this true you say there's articles you've made claims where is the truth what has this been you know investigated has this been substantiated um you know the when they actually investigated the Labour Party for anti Semitic claims back in I can't remember what year this was going on um they didn't find anything because the Tories and made it all up to stir a load of bloody chaos um and ensure that Jeremy didn't get into power because it was easy to turn this against him because it was radical for the time and again how many Palestinians would still be alive today if we had dismissed that um that doctrine back then and given Jeremy Corbyn the support that you know we wanted to give him and having labour as you know the party in power how much better off what we have been facing a global pandemic um with a sturdier and better supported NHS how many of our own people would still be alive today and just remember with the upcoming general election is it still happening who knows? that your vote is gonna um is gonna dictate how the next 10 years looks and um how the situation deteriorates from here",

If you have money to donate, go to his page and click on his gofundme. And even $5, um, if you can donate that. But if not, just interact with his video. Like comment um. Favorite share. Um. He actually reached out to me on Instagram to try to get the word out about his gofundme, um, because he is trying to evacuate his family of 13 people. I think the fact that he reached out to me on Instagram really says something. Me only having like 530 followers, not having a huge following just shows how very desperate he is. So please, please, please go back to his video and interact as much as possible. Thank you.",

Wages are so stagnant that people can hardly afford groceries; Target recently (basically) admitted that, \"yeah, we inflated our prices for funsies\" and now they're deflating them because of all the complaints about people being unable to afford shit. And this is what you're talking about? THIS is the most important thing you think you could possibly talk about at this point in time?! There are families in Gaza that don't exist anymore! There are entire genealogical pools that have been *wiped off the face of the earth*. There are people in Rafa begging for help. We are watching the wholesale destruction, slaughter and eradication of an entire people group; but you think strangers' genitals and which bathrooms they should use is the most important thing we can be fucking discussing right now?! What rock do you live under? What do you smoke? What do you drink? Because I would love some. I would love to be so detached and delusional and completely unaware of the world around me, so that I can be just as oblivious and focus on things that don't matter, just like you. I would love that! But no, instead, I wake up every day thinking about Palestine and how I'm unable to fucking help anybody because I'm broke, how all of my money has to go to rent, otherwise I will end up homeless. My thoughts are consumed about the deteriorating life of every American in this country, and how we are just watching a genocide happen in full goddamn view of everyone and God,  and you are sitting on your butt, in your bathroom, with your 4 inch baby pink acrylics, talking about genitals!! I think what hurts me the most is that there are so many people just like you, who literally don't give a darn about how the average American is this close to homelessness with every paycheck, and how there's entire families just gone, off the face of the planet. I hate you, but in a way I envy you. I envy the fact that you can hear all of this shit going on, hear about the misery and the frustrations and the unhappiness, and still be wholly consumed by whether or not somebody has a weenie. I don't know how.. but somehow I envy that.",

Hamas is only one faction (from the culture of Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region) of Israel's closest enemies that wanna completely wipe them out Israel simply wants to remove them from power and before people start spewing the Hamas propaganda one has to consider how much the Palestinian people have suffered under the hand of Hamas Yes we want the safety of children but it won't happen until Hamas is gone",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm just trying to get some clarity okay I'm gonna try and give the Alphonse angle here as best I can for me this is a very simple decision Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden let me tell you guys why most people who have reached the conclusion that they're not gonna vote for Joe Biden primarily I'd say about 60% of people who changed their vote away from Joe Biden is because of the war between Israel and Palestine specifically Gaza  completely understand what's going on in Gaza is an atrocity it is genocide there's no other way to put it and the fact that the United States is supporting Israel in this madness is outrageous and I don't blame anyone for choosing that to be their single issue voter deal deal breaker I get it but here is where I kind of come into complication when Donald Trump was president now I want you guys to think about this when Trump was president he moved our embassy to Jerusalem to do nothing more than antagonize the people of Palestine right to prove a symbolic point that Jerusalem belongs to Israel if you listen to the rhetoric of the Republican Party present time and I believe it is a reflection of how Donald Trump thinks all you hear the Republican Party say is support Israel without question we must throw all the support give them all the military aid financial aid at our disposal so that they can defeat the enemy in Gaza there is no one that I've heard thus far in the Republican Party that has tried to be a voice of reason as it relates to Israel and Gaza that to me lets me know Donald Trump would not just support Israel in their actions but in bolding them at least the Democrat Party if we just look at it from a bare minimum standpoint at least in the Democrat Party there are voices powerful voices that are calling out US support of Israel and the need to withdraw when Joe Biden spoke at Morehouse just a few days ago he said himself that he is working on a ceasefire granted a little too late an action should have been taken far sooner but I can at the bare minimum if I'm just grasping for things here respect that at the bare minimum this administration can recognise the wrong that is being committed I'm not saying that they moved as quick as they needed to but at least they recognise I don't believe that what happened with Donald Trump Donald Trump is the definition of I'm gonna dig my heels into the sand and I'm gonna dare you to move me he loves opposition and the amount of opposition to Israel that is growing in the United States would only push Donald Trump to support them more I guarantee it something else to think about and this is more on a domestic front overnight the Supreme Court turned women into second class citizens it happened because we had Donald Trump in office for four years and he had the opportunity to put not one not two but three conservatives on a Supreme Court that fulfilled the Republican Party's wet dream of overturning Roe v Wade really think about that do you really wanna give that man an opportunity to add another and another and another you never know what could happen tomorrow to any of these Supreme Court justices do you really wanna give a man like Donald Trump that opportunity do you really wanna give the Republicans as a whole an opportunity to push policies such as Project 2025 that would literally roll back the years that people like Martin Luther King Malcolm X and so many others fought for us to have greater freedoms project 2025 would roll that back overnight do you really wanna give the Republican Party that type of control and power and opportunity really think about this young voters Joe Biden tried to cancel student loan debt a lot of you guys when it didn't fall through blamed him when you should have been blaming the Supreme Court why because it is a super majority of conservatives on the Supreme Court who ruled that Joe Biden trying to overturn our cancel student debt was unconstitutional you put Donald Trump back in office kiss it all goodbye at least Joe Biden now is making incremental cancellations of student debt Donald Trump would do none of the aboves so my point here is yes what's going on in Gaza is terrible and US support for Israel is out of line and I don't stand behind it at all however I'll take that reluctantly because I fully understand the latter would make that vary issue 10 times worse and also ding us here in the United States over the head this is a man Donald Trump who said that on his first day of office he'd be a dictator that's not something the leader of the free world should be joking about a man who just recently released a campaign ad that had the words that we have not seen since the days of World War Two in Germany let that sink in let that really sink in at the type of person we're dealing with here and sure you guys can vote for a third party candidate but let's keep it a buck let's keep it a hundred here R F k has no viable path to the White House and sitting out out of an election what are you doing like what are you actually doing protesting protesting how by not voting you're not hurting anybody but yourself these president's former presidents are gonna go off and make millions you not voting ain't hurting nobody but yourself and that's the how fun thing on that",

And what you have done to them since October 8th is horrifying. The IDF at this point is no better than Hamas. No better. If that bothers you, that makes you uncomfortable, that you really need to think about that. You go on to say that this was the second deadliest event in in Jewish history, first being the Holocaust, which is a disgusting time in our fucking history. That is reprehensible on every fucking level. Where a literal genocide was taking place in front of our fucking eyes. What is the saddest times in fucking history? And anybody, anybody that says differently is cold hearted and fucking blind. With that being fucking said, and when you say never again, and you see the things that are happening in Palestine. 250 Israelis lost their day on lost their lives on October 7th. 33,000 people in Palestine are dead since October 8th, and that number is still rising. So no, absolutely not. We're gonna hold them fucking accountable. We're holding everybody fucking accountable. And this is a sure fucking Fireway, Biden, for you to get out of office. Donald Trump will be our next fucking president. And it won't be Because we want him. Because nobody's gonna come out and fucking vote for you. But you have allowed to happen in fucking Palestine.

So this video and account I've just stitched, is that from Tanzania? So Tanzanian reached out to me asking if I could share her page, um, and share the fundraising link for her family. You can watch the video that I've just stitched for more information on this. But this is about RAF's family. They're trying to evacuate 15 of the family members, but 5. Only 5 of the immediate family members at the moment. A lot of rehab family members are sick, and they need support and medical support, and they need to evacuate safety from Gaza. So if you can share, donate, anything with that page, even just go follow Tamzim and start reposting her videos. Literally anything helps. Truly, no family should have to be going through what these families are going through right now. And remember, it's gone to the point that we can't look the other way just because we're privileged enough to do so. So please, just repost, share, like, comment. Anything you can do helps.",

Not only that, but Israel had a petition against them signed by a bunch of former EOC members and contestants to not compete because Russia didn't compete either. And what did the EOC say? We are not a political, political competition. We do not do politics. And what is Israel's response to that? They write a political propaganda song about October 7th, calling it October Rain, with the EBU telling them several times to not only change the title, but also a bunch of lyrics. So what is. What is the argument about that? I bet that now you will argue, but she didn't write the song, she. She just performed it. She just performed it, which in it alone is Already pretty bad, but let's, let's, let's, let's ignore that she probably didn't write the song and just performed it. But let's, let's look at her harassing other contestants with her team. For example, photographing Bambi Thuk after they explicitly told Israel to not photograph them in any shape or form. Or photographing and posting the door of Greek contestant marinazari into their Instagram story with a marking tag. And let's not ignore the whole just Klein situation where after yours, Klein wasn't allowed to perform, an Israeli team member was harassing him for not performing. Mocking him or her mocking the audience for booing at her. Like the the Israeli contestant mocking the audience for booing and. And making fun of the whole situation. let's talk about her not being allowed to talk to other competitors because the Israeli government was fearing that if she talks to too many of the contestants, she might change her mind about her whole political stand, which in it alone is a. Is, is, is a hard statement. Or let's not talk about the whole thing with Israeli supporters using several credit cards to vote hundreds of times in different, in different countries in support for Israel. So I don't, I, I am not for booing any Jewish artist off stage, but if this Jewish artist is waving an Israeli flag, makes fun of other contestants, makes fun of the audience, makes fun of the people, and it's just such an asshole. To be around. I think. I think we're allowed to boo at her at any age.",

If Democrats actually cared about defeating Donald Trump, they would force him to get a ceasefire by using the full powers of the presidency (like HW, Carter and Reagan did) and then force him to step down as the candidate to have a contested convention so they can nominate a pro-ceasefire/progressive candidate to unite the base. But Liberals and Democrats continue to support and prop up Biden as he still allows a literal g*nocide continue to unalive Palestinains every single day. Its 2016 all over again, except even worse.

And then, theres our american government just sending the people doing the bombing our money that they take from us.  #artists4ceasefire your redins are really making my job easier, love spotting it on the celebs!  #doyourpart #gaza #palestine #ceasefirenow ",
    "voice_to_text": "if we want to influence celebrities to speak out on Gaza her video makes it make so much sense so if you're anything like me you don't really know what's going on over there I really had no idea all that was going on in Gaza until the whole block party started and everybody started blocking celebrities and then the Hayley Bailey thing happens that's what really sparked my interest in what the fuck is going on and why is everybody so mad I don't watch the news I don't watch any kind of like world news I watch TikTok and that's it because I don't in my mind I can't do anything about it so I'm not gonna fuck with it okay well that's kind of like we can't do that no and I am in no way an influencer but I do have 12,000 followers which is more than like most of the surrounding towns have in population so in my mind I'm like oh shit maybe I should say something about this because in my mind I'm thinking I'm nobody um it does not matter what I have to say about it but at this point I'm seeing all these people bashing celebrities and people that have a platform for not speaking about it and I'm like okay I have a platform it may only be 12,000 people you know but I still have a fucking platform that I worked really hard for by the now being a mother what this lady said makes so much sense because I have really tried to re parent myself so that I can parent my children the correct way which is helping them learn how to be normal human and in that process I have Learned that beating kids um taking stuff away you know all the negative reinforcement that all the corporal punishment that we were raised it doesn't work I mean some of it might but not really it doesn't really teach them how to be grown UPS how to manage the stress how to not make those mistakes and what she says is you reward good behaviour which is I am all about when you are doing nothing but pointing out everything that's wrong or everything that the celebrity or person or kid or whatever is doing wrong that's not going to make them want to do right that just makes them feel less than and make someone crawl in a hole and not do what you want them to do so I did a quick Google search of celebrities who have supported Gaza or who have donated or spoke out something to that effect because I think it's better to shine a light on the people that are doing something instead of just forcing people to speak about it or block them that's kinda like a double edged sword like they'll speak on it yeah just like Haley did her little apology thing but did she mean it do they mean it do they really want to help or are they just doing it because you're forcing them to you're forcing their hands so like to me that's not if somebody was like let me give you $20 I know you you look like you need $20 I wanna help you let me give you $20 okay I would feel one way if somebody was like here's this $20 the world's forcing me to give it to you here's the $20 I get it it's still gonna be helpful and I get it but it's like you're doing it out of spite practical I understand how scary it is to get on the internet and voice your opinion when there are other people that could possibly not agree with your opinion believe me I fucking I have an entire the Kelsey show it has over 8 800 posts I have posted and most of them are about my event and at first it was very scary to start posting about them so when people were getting mad at celebrities I'm like I feel not how they feel but I understand why they're not talking about it but at the same time I'm like maybe you should grow a backbone and not worry about the bag so much and maybe spread the word because at this point I I've done the research now it's not fucking good and people do need the word does need to be spread and these celebrities have ungodly amounts of money to help the people it should not be on us the normal people of the world who have barely enough to get by to try to support these families when these celebrities are out there just living their fucking best life on their yachts and fucking private planes and giving a dollar or two or making a simple fucking post I get that that that's good I'm glad people are doing that but fucking syndrome so I made an entire list of all the celebrities that I found online that actually have started donating and have been outspoken about it and they are supporting and calling for ceasefire wearing the so since this video is already 4 minutes and 30 seconds of to me just fucking bitching and ranting I love it I'm gonna go ahead and start a whole series of celebrities who have donated to goth or spoken about because I think people just want the celebrities and the influencers to do their influencing job and spread the word and I get that so I'm gonna start a whole series of celebrities who do support Gaza and do make the the noise and do all the thing maybe that will get more track and maybe that will get the people who aren't you know saying something to do something",

Kicking them out of school and housing right before graduation. Literally all these college presidents and nonprofit CEOs and education leaders\u2014All they care about is their donations. Money. And proximity to power. Because they aren\u2019t speaking up and when they do speak up, it is to call the law down viciously on teenagers and young adults exercising their free speech in the face of some of the worst ethnic cleansing of their lives. But watch how these young adults move. They refuse to be silenced when we are talking about genocide. Babies blown apart day after day by a ruthless, brutal army. Hillary Clinton and all the war mongers invested in weapons companies will try to tell us what we see with our own eyes is propaganda, but they are on the wrong side of history and we will never ever let them forget it or live it down. These students? These students are on the right side of history and I am so damn proud of them and I stand with them. #students #college #career #VCU #harvard #columbia #CUNY #protest #gaza #freepalestine #palestine #war #uwmadison #uwmilwaukee #calpolyhumboldt #UCLA #ASU #Emory #Penn #Tulane #FSU #ohiostate #USC #NYU #CCNY ",

Like Lizzo spoke up and you guys are like,   are   bashing   them   Like   Lizzo   spoke   up   and   you   guys   are   like well, it's very interesting   it's   very   interesting the timing. Uh,   timing   Uh well, you're a little late   you're   a   little   late and you don't wanna even listen to what she's saying.   you   don't   wanna   even   listen   to   what   she's   saying Like if the point is not to make these celebrities speak up,   if   the   point   is   not   to   make   these   celebrities   speak   up then what really is the point?   what   really   is   the   point It seems to me that it's just   seems   to   me   that   it's   just for people to make themselves feel more or less superior than others.   people   to   make   themselves   feel   more   or   less   superior   than   others To be honest, it's also useless.   be   honest   it's   also   useless These politicians that are Enabling these genocides to happen   politicians   that   are   Enabling   these   genocides   to   happen are probably rejoicing right now   probably   rejoicing   right   now because the attention is diverted to blocking the rock.   the   attention   is   diverted   to   blocking   the   rock I just can't get on board with this.   just   can't   get   on   board   with   this I just need the internet   just   need   the   internet to shift their focus on something that actually matters   shift   their   focus   on   something   that   actually   matters and change that actually changes something.   change   that   actually   changes   something",

    "voice_to_text": "hello I'm one of the poors you pissed off let me explain to you the reason why people are so fucking pissed off with you because after watching your apology I don't really think you understand why you went to the Met Gala a place that has been known for its historical extravagance and is extremely exclusive guest list consisting of only celebrities or anyone in the 1% with tickets that cost up to $75,000 while dressed as the representation of French aristocracy itself during the French Revolution Marie Antoinettes while lip syncing the infamous line let them eat cake from Sophia Coppala's Marie Antoinette film but for me as an American student who has been learning European history ever since I was in middle school let them eat cake is supposed to be a representation of the ignorance of the aristocracy while the masses were starving the French aristocracy decided to ignore their plight their calls and pleas for help and instead decided to surround themselves in the gilded halls of luxury do you understand how ignorant you sound when you reference that fucking quote at the Met Gala when there is a genocide going on when there are a lot of people who would benefit from getting the coverage that you have with your 10 million followers I'm sorry 9.9 million followers in your apology you stated that you are a normal girl just like anyone else I don't know what to tell you but just because you didn't get a personal invitation to the Met Gala from Anna Winter herself does not mean that you are one of us sure you're human but you're human who's able to affording $17,000 in rent and yes you probably worked really hard for the position you're in but the fact of the matter is that you are a 30 year old woman you're an adult same as I I know to not say something so fucking stupid and tone deaf when I'm in a clear position of privilege when people are struggling just to fucking eat when you mention in your video that you weren't very educated on the topic of Palestine even though you don't outright say Palestine because you're treating it like it's Voldemort I can at least level with you and say that I understand where you're coming from to an extent now I wasn't completely educated on the topics of Palestine and the complicated relationship between Israel and Palestine but I got fucking educated and I myself have been really quiet about Palestine up until recently so you can call me a hypocrite for this and part of that is because I'm thousands of dollars in debt and I'm far too broke to contribute to the cause and I fucking hate myself for that and all I can do is talk about what is going on in Palestine so I decided to let the more well spoken people with a larger following take over the discussion which I see is the coward's way out now I can admit that but what about you you Haley are at the nexus of a discussion about the complete worthlessness of celebrities people are pissed because even though you are a d list celebrity cause let's face it that's what you are because you were sitting on a pedestal of privilege that allows for you to have the capital and following to actually make a difference that being putting your money to use by helping people evacuate from Gaza these people these families who are being torn out of the tapestry of history by the oppressor and yet when these people are reaching out to you asking for help you just go back to your slice of cake and call it a day that's why people are fucking pissed at you Haley",

    "voice_to_text": "stop blaming famous people for your problems everyone's talking about oh the Met Gala yeah this is actually so crazy to see cause there I feel like there's a period of time where I was on TikTok and I used to like I don't know if I was following Desmond but I would actually see the videos a lot and I felt like I would watch them almost religiously and I don't know Desmond's pronouns I'm probably just gonna say Desmond the whole time I'm sorry but just to see this kind of take from Desmond after like I know I was a fan probably when I was in that high school I'm about to finish college now it's like crazy so basically in that video Desmond just says like oh like if you're hating on celebrities for being at the Met Gala um and when there's a genocide going on in Palestine you're a hater and you're deflecting from a problem and that the Met Gala in total probably raises about $350 million or I don't know if he said like 35 I don't know one of those numbers just a high number and he said that if every person in America gave 10 cents it would have the same effect so if we all did that instead of hating on celebrities and it would fix the problem that calling out celebrities for not saying anything about Palestine is hating and that we're deflecting and it just means that we don't wanna act on our own now before y'all even yeah just know that I do donate e sims for Gaza so yeah never too much on me but I mean I don't know why Desmond is acting like it's like they're acting so obtuse obviously people are saying that people with more money should be doing more about Palestine um I'm sure that you know about like equity but if I have like no or almost no um like spending money spare money like all of my money goes towards taking care of myself I'm not saying like this is the case for me obviously but people that have less means obviously will give less or just speak out about things when they can and people who have more should give more listener to understand also I'm pretty sure people's criticisms are that like or at least what I saw on Twitter um was like the media coverage of the Met Gala when Rafa which is like designated as a safe zone was being bombed heavily at the same time that the met was the Met Gala was going on because they knew people would be like tuned in or at least Americans be tuned in and same thing happened during the Super Bowl so people are upset because a safe zone in Palestine is being bombed heavily as the Met Gala is happening and the media coverage was just covering the Met Gala and not the genocide that's going on in Gaza I don't see how calling that out is deflecting from the behavior in fact people can do both people can donate and so call out that behavior then doesn't goes on to say that blocking celebrities does nothing or like influences and it literally does like that's their livelihood if 50 million people decided to block Zendaya I'm not saying that I'm blocking Zendaya or whatever I'm just saying if 50 million people decided to block Zendaya her engagement would go down like she's now worth less because like that's part of her job posting on Instagram and you know being liked is part of her job if she's not liked and people suddenly decide to like hate her then you know she's an she's an actress um movies are gonna say we don't watch Zendaya because then people are not gonna watch her film because people hate Zendaya because of this and that's what get celebrities that have the means to do something to speak out and to do something I'm not sure why this is such a hard concept um I'm pretty sure it's not I think that people just don't want to admit that their silence their lack of help and their lack of empathy quite frankly is like something that needs to be reassessed handled even",

    "voice_to_text": "as a traditional egalitarian American Jew it is always really reassuring to see moments and takes like this from other Jews because it can be so isolating in this world to have ambiguous or not perfect love and adoration of the state of Israel and what really changed for me and how I got here was the fact that in 2011 after college I did economic development with Bedouins in southern Israel I was about 10 minutes outside of beersheva I was within the 67 border and I just saw first hand how dehumanizing the occu Pa tion is and how horrific it has been for people even those that are considered Israeli citizens um and so in this Bedouin town called Lachia uh I was there and everybody had water tanks that I thought was kind of weird until I realized sometimes the water just goes out sometimes you're mid shower and you're just shit out of luck and this is the desert like water you can't just like run to a spring right there's just not a river to go to I Learned that a lot of what the organisation as part of was doing was literacy because for decades like literally after the founding of Israel there were no schools close by for Bedouins and traditionally Bedouins the men would go and roam with the herds and the woman would stay near the house and do a lot of the farming and so men would go to school because that felt kind of akin to what they did previously but it was a lot harder they didn't feel comfortable sending their women and so there's like whole generations of women that are illiterate and they're having to do a lot of catch up because the state wasn't bringing schooling close and affordably to them there's also a lot of ancestral claims of land in the desert by Bedouins and because those claims aren't recognised when people build houses they're considered like unrecognised and the state will come and demolish them they won't provide any services and they will come and raze their homes to the ground um this was happening all over the south while I was there um and it's really traumatizing to watch that oh and on top of that like I would travel around Israel like I had weekends off I had holidays the number of like terrible things that people felt comfortable saying to me was astonishing they were like why are you working with better ones when you can work with Jews they would you know talk about just how more like animalistic Arabs are um it was baffling to me and incredibly insulting because these people had like taken me into their homes they had welcomed me they had been very very kind to me and like it was just so wild to be watching Jewish Israelis like spout this nonsense that like people used to say about us all over like the irony was not lost on me and the thing is that most American Jews do not get ever get an experience like I did they might go a little bit into like parts of Jerusalem but they're not spending time really in depth of Palestinians they're not having conversations they're not building relationships and that's on purpose that's that's on purpose um so they're only seeing one side of it they're only getting one narrative and it has been so built up that this state is so key for our safety that it's the sort of us versus them thing that like if they have a chance they're going to wipe us from the face of the earth like all of this has been so built up that I think even now even now when you see some of the most horrific things happening in Gaza like people are still you know doing what about October 7th what about the hostages what about this like two wrongs don't make a right and it's deeply deeply hurts me as somebody that like believes that my Judaism is about showing up well in this world like my practice is about both connecting to the divine but also like connecting to the earth connecting to people and like what we leave behind matters and like this state all of those things is is now my Judaism and for community that often relishes discussion relishes debate and has such a welcoming kind of large tent perspective the radical hard lines that I'm seeing within Jewish spaces around this topic like it's not often safe to even have just to be able to say like I have an ambivalent relationship to Israel like I don't see it as my homeland or I like even just having some critical discussions of what the state is doing is considered radical and like that's not it shouldn't be like this and my hope is that we're finally getting to this moment where we can really start reclaiming that like Judaism does not equal Zionism they're two different ideologies there's lots of people that have an overlap but that doesn't mean if you criticize Zionism you criticize Judaism one is not the other these are apples and oranges for God's sake and for 2,000 years we have been living all over the world and as an American Jew and as a Jew of the diaspora that's the Judaism that I have really fallen in love with is this idea of what does it mean to have a relationship with god my people my faith no matter where I am um and one of my favorite prayers is the kedusha which is about how God's holiness is everywhere and bless the place of god and I think about that a lot which is we do have a lot of liturgy around Jerusalem around Zion but what I really think about is how do we bring the divine in here and now and what does that look like and it does not look like what the Israeli state is doing in Rafa it does not look like what's happening in Gaza",

I'm hoping I can give to multiple families but I'm only one person. the whole flying to the UK thing doesn't really matter, I don't care I don't really watch for him going to different countries; especially UK. At the start of the video it was at about [$2,000*], they are about $75,000 away from their goal. I hope this helps push it further into the algorithm, however it seems like my account might be shadow banned, because I can only reach about 200 people and then it's gone. But if you can, I hear that copying the link a bunch of times and commenting five words will help the algorithm push this a little bit further. Do what you can to help these people and to [FIND*] people who can fund it at this moment, because it is very important that we help these people escape what we are funding. Remember, our taxes are going to the horrific things that are happening to them, not trying to guilt anybody, but it's just important that we do what we can and give what we can to the the right things. Because we're forced to pay taxes that are ending up doing these horrific things, but we can make the choice to spend here and there on the the right thing to help these innocent people. \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49all eyes on Rafa\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49 \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49free Palestine\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49",

    "voice_to_text": "Today's blocks of the day are one. Rihanna, you've been a little quiet from your mansion. I've seen several TikToks like this today about blocking celebrities, and I love it. I think it's brilliant, because these celebrities and their just brazen commitment to staying tone deaf, like we saw at the Met Gala in the midst of the times that were in, is getting ridiculous. But I keep seeing videos like this where they're like, let's just go for that top, top celebrities like Rihanna, Drake, Taylor Swift, Beyonce. And I think that's the wrong strategy because these are A list celebrities that a lot of people are very deeply attached to. And getting enough people to be on board to block somebody, say like Taylor Swift, is gonna fall flat on his face. But if we can start with one lower level celebrity, say that maybe not everybody knows about or is as attached to, but they have enough clout to where getting enough people to block them would send a message, I think that's gonna be a lot more effective. Because a highly concentrated move like that, as a collective, would start to create pressure on the celebrities at the top, like, they could be next. I mean, if we can't create enough meaningful pressure on a lower level celebrity as a group, how are we gonna do it on a higher level one? Because, y'all, in order for a movement like this to have any potential of having the Impact needed to spark change. We have to be organized, and we have to be smart about it. That means making it simple. We need to make this as simple as possible so that more people will be willing to participate. And in my personal opinion, I think that that celebrity should be the celebrity that probably started this whole idea in the first place. And that's Haley Bailey with her let them eat cake video. That video captured the entire embodiment of the scale of just how out of touch these elites really are, and that's why it makes sense that's got to be her and my ideas for the next seven days until next Thursday on May 16th, nobody blocks anybody but Haley Bailey. If we're gonna do this and have results, our targeting efforts have to be laser focused. And she's sitting at about 10 million followers right now. we're gonna need hundreds and hundreds of thousands who are willing to block Haley Bailey daily. We just put all of our focus and all of our concentration on Haley Bailey alone for the next seven days. And if we can achieve that, then maybe as a group, we would start to get more of a momentum to go after celebrities more like Drake or fiance or Taylor Swift. So starting now, let's all work to get as many people to block Haley daily.",

What I find so funny about this is the fact that she paid 75 K to go to this event. 75K, not including the cost of her dress, the cost of hotel, the cost of traveling to New York. I think this is how that. I really don't care. Not including those expenses, that is $75,000. That is the amount of money that people pay for a car, down payment on an apartment. That is life changing money. That money could set someone up for comfortable, comfortably for a long time. I work a 40 hour work week. Most of the time I work at 2 to 10, 62, 73, whatever. Those shifts normal to me. I'm used to them. I'm probably never gonna own a house. That's just. That's just being realistic. I will never own my own house. This isn't the main issue. The main issue was her saying, let them eat cake while children in Gaza and Rafa are starving to death while their families hide from bombs. While children are being trapped in cars or under rubble, while their parents carry what is left of them in plastic garbage bags that you carry your groceries in. It's surreal. We can't even protest against our government as to what's going on. Students of colleges are protesting on the campuses that they pay Money to go to. And they are getting shot with rubber bullets. They are getting maced, they are getting tear gas. They are getting attacked by Israel supporters who are dragging them to the floor and beating them so badly they need to be hospitalized simply for enacting their First Amendment right. If you are still thinking that both sides to the story are wrong, they're not. Because when you have one side that is being protected by the police and you have one side that is actively being attacked by the police, you know which side you need to be on. All eyes on Rafa. All eyes on Gaza, all eyes on Palestine. We need to keep talking about this because the more that we talk about it, the more attention it gets, and it needs all the attention it can get right now. Stop allowing the government to distract you. That is what they are trying to do. Stay the course. Keep on it.",

I'm a black Muslim myself I know I don't look like it but I'm Muslim but I'm more worried of the fact that like through this  little Met Gala,  IS NOT REAL ARE bombing RAFAH as we speak and let's be honest I came across your video as the only video about Palestinians being racist to Afro Palestinians that's how you know it's not the main focus they are being k!l!ed!!!!!  and that right there should be our main focus by the way I like your makeup but back to the point that should be our main focus and just to add one more thing one more thing I don't think all Palestinians are racist.",

Look at what's going on in Rafa. 1.5 million Palestinians sought refuge there. They all funneled in there, half of those children. Today they had leaflets dropped on them by the IDR with QR codes on them, telling them they had the day to evacuate or they would be considered enemies and unalived. Meanwhile, they're just trying to distract us with these weird fancy dresses at the Met Gala and Drake and Kendrick. Kendrick Lamar. Meanwhile, there's 1.5 million people that could be unalived. There's a genocide going on and our country is just looking the other way. I might not have a large platform, but if all I could do is a single mom is talk about this, I would regret not talking about it one day. All eyes on Rafa. This is the most disgusting thing to see, and I feel so fucking helpless. Shame on everyone who attended the Met Gala. It's disgusting. So disgusting. 650,000 of those people are children.

    "voice_to_text": "It doesn't help gossins to stop sending money for bombs. Guys, this just reminded me of a thought I had recently. Horrible thought. Um, so we already know that the American taxpayers money is going um, funding the ammunition bombs in Gaza. Um, and of all the things that I have kept Palestinians in my heart, of all of the pain they're experiencing, a specific type of pain that I never considered. Because honestly, it's just, it's still kind of unfathomable to me that such a scenario even exist in real life. It's extremely dystopian. Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine. This feels like one of those, like, I, I. Oh, man.",

You know in countries that Westerners look at as Muslim there are Christians there too and  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 just means \"God is great\" or \"Praised is God\" or \"Blessed is God\"  (depending on context/ dialect/ scripture or even Aramaic phrases included in Arabic dialects) It depends on whether someone is saying that to praise God in the context of Islam or to praise God in the context of Christianity you will never know unless you know that person specifically and it is racist to assume someone who looks Arab saying \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 is automatically a Muslim that could be arguably an anti-Semitic view considering Arabs are Abrahamic descendants of Ishmael now for Christians across the United States I want you to know we in the messianic community stand with you besides rallying for jury nullification in jury trials and appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court if they try to bring people up on charges for it; while citing the First Amendment believing in the New Testament and believing Yeshua Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected from the dead is a branch of Judaism I would go all the way up to the international levels to advocate for any person who claims they are a Jewish convert even Palestinians who have trouble immigrating to Israel over any suspected Christian prejudice this branch of Judaism is speaking of is Messianic Judaism hello I'm a Messianic Jew I consider myself the same as a gospel believing Christian because I believe in the unmerited Grace that Yeshua Jesus gave us in accordance with Ephesians 2:8 in fact Christian and Messianic both have the same meaning and word root Christian means to Christen as with oil Messianic comes from the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 which means to annoint as with oil this word is one in the same our history as messianic Jews was firmly established almost 2,000 years ago in foundation during the time that the authors of the New Testament were alive fifty one days after our Messiah died on the day of the Passover sacrifice (John 19:14) people from every nation under the heaven were present in Jerusalem (Acts 2, 51 days after Yeshia died) to receive the Spirit of God that is the spirit of the Messiah who came and died for our sins on the day of Pentecost which is the Jewish festival of Shavuot by which converts and physical Jews became a part of the messianic faith and this receiving on the Spirit accordance with Acts 2:5 and Acts 2:11 I'm a messianic Jew who does not support the integration of heavy rabbinics into the doctrine of faith and encourage those who call themselves messianics or Christians to read the book of Galatians and also Matthew 23 and Jeremiah 23 to see what I'm talking about At a leadership level we are responsible to examine those doctrines and see if they are relevant to scripture but if they are not relevant with scripture and confuses the context of scripture in accordance with the Jewish Tenach (Torah, Prophets, Writings) and Jeremiah 8:8 and Jeremiah chapter 23 they are not from God and we do not count them now regardless of race or one status with conversion in an Orthodox synagogue or how they define a Jew race and ethnic status does not matter to us although we do not replace the nation of Israel I will make that clear this is not replacement theology and we do NOT embrace that we do not embrace that as someone who literally lives at the furthest reaches from Jerusalem in the world, literally the ends of the earth I believe even if someone lives so far away from Jerusalem or ethnically different than a Jew or Middle Easterner if they accept Yeshua as the Messiah they too are taking it to our faith and are given the same spiritual blessing of being delivered out from sin and from the confinements of sin of this earth the same way that Jews were taken out from the confinements in the land of Egypt we are Messianic we as messianic Jews keep the appointed times of Leviticus 23 practice physical circumcision and the dietary laws however we know that even as Moses received The 10 commandments on Mount Sinai it is also said in the same instance in Hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 -He makes unmerited Grace- Exodus chapter 20:6 \"He makes unmerited Grace to those who love him and keep his commandments\" Deuteronomy 6:4 - 8 tells us to love God with everything that we are John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God our commandment is to love and keep the word of God all 66 books as Messianic Jews Christians are grafted in and we are one in the same (Galatians 3:29) we came into the faith the same way the Christians did (Ethnic Jews who embrace the gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) - such as myself) as sojourners lost and the noble memorial of the price Yeshua (Jesus) paid for our sins delivered us out equally we are all strangers no one is better than the other because of his ethnicity. In the 37 chapter of Ezekiel, one of the infamous prophets of old Ezekiel, was taken out to a valley of dry bones by the hand of God and told to preach to an impossible situation and tell the dry bones that God's Spirit will come into them and they will live Ezekiel 37:4 - 6 so the dry bones became his flesh that is the nation of Israel coming together in 1948 but there was no breath in the bones (Ezekiel 37:8) so Ezekiel prophesied regarding the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) as he was commanded by God to say to the Spirit of god (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) come from the four winds (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) [Holy] Spirit and breathe upon the slain so that they may live (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) in the same chapter (Ezekiel 37) so let us speak the word of God and let us all come and look to the one that was pierced (Zechariah 12:10) for the transgressions of all mankind  that was set before us by the One who created us God knew man would make mistakes and that our greatest defeat is our own sin and it was necessary for Yeshua the Messiah to die we all pierced him as humanity (because our own sin is our greatest defeat) and anyone that believes in Him will not perish (John 3:16) but have everlasting life (John 3:16) John 3:16. We eulogize the price that was paid for our own sin as one eulogizes upon a firstborn upon an only child Zachariah 12:10 (and John 19:34 - 37) we remember our going out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05df \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of confinements of this earth and its wickedness on our own (by our own choice) just as the children of Israel were delivered out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of Egypt all the days of our life as it's written in Deuteronomy 16:3 in Hebrew let us rise up from this valley of dry bones as spoken by the prophets of old in the Spirit of god and in salvation as one every time someone comes to the Lord he rises up in a vastly and joins a powerful army that will not be defeated and more and more people will rise out of this valley of dry bones unto the coming of the Messiah himself.

    "voice_to_text": "And because like.. What if you're just minding your own business and then like.. the members of enhypen just walk in ? Euhhhhh I thought about this..before. I think.. Ummm..I genuinely don't know. I feel like I would be.. Knowing myself I'd probably be like.. Like.. in shock ! Cause I'm not a lucky person dude ! Things like this will never happen to me. And no, that\u2019s not just what I like, I'm just.. (I\u2019m not sure what I said here, but this is what I heard, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense \ud83d\ude2d) I- Let's just say.. I think I'm very unlucky.. to the point where I say I'm cursed. Let's just say that. Okay..so if that were to happen to me\u2026 It will be like God telling me\u2026(aish - meaning: Ah shit) it would be like.. Dude just..ahem, I don\u2019t wanna say it out loud. But..like I would..I really\u2026 Okay, I went through the comments under that..video, that I'm stitching right now. Anddd, it sounds like no one would really approach them, out of respect. Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay.",

And I think anybody that signed one of those missiles, whether they were 7 or 70, should be charged with international hate crime and publicly executed. Because there's no greater sign that you're not under any dress, that you have time to sign the missiles, that means you're completely on the offense. These people are fucking sick, bro. We know the majority of people being killed here are children, and you're signing missiles. Putting heart sign is just like bread. These are real demons. Not to mention. Not to mention billions, billions of US tax dollars that's going to that. Y'all just pulling up. You know, the thing is, is that I haven't really posted much about this stuff because protesting awareness is not enough. Whenever people, whenever y'all are ready to completely disengage from this system, then I'm with it. Cause protest. Like, bro, we've been. People been protesting since October, and they ain't stop shit. They stop sending our fucking tax money over there. They ain't stopped shit. We've been boycotting shit, they ain't stopped shit. They still signing missiles. The only thing that can happen. Like, bro, first of all, this life is not permanent. This life ain't permanent. What you got to lose? What? Like, what are we. We're holding on to comfort. And it's like, if you care that much about people dying, and you know that, you're actively, you're a participant, too. I'm a participant as well. I go to work every day. My fucking tax dollars paid for some of those missiles that got signed. That just is what it is. Um, but until they're not gonna. We're not gonna engage in a violent rebellion, because most people don't have a capacity for violence, which is why this is so outrageous. But also, people don't wanna give up their comfort. So, I mean, yeah, you can protest and bring awareness to it, but that ain't stop the bombs from dropping. And nobody. Y'all just ain't ready to disengage from the system completely. You don't want to see this shit collapse. Let's just be real, cause it don't. Like, does it stop with Palestinians? Does it stop in the Congo? Does it stop in Sudan in about 10 years? What's your job gonna be worth? Are you. Are you. Is your job gonna be valuable to society? Or will you be better fit to be doing prison labor? It's a question you need to ask yourself. And pay attention what's going on and tell me it's not a possibility you might lose your job, lose your fucking house. Lose your job to AI, lose your job to a robot. Lose your fucking home? Can't pay your Bills illegal to be homeless now you're a prison laborer doing the jobs they don't wanna pay for. Honestly, man, you might just keep buying the Pop Tarts.",

    "voice_to_text": "Putting info graphics on your Instagram stories is not enough. It's time to go banned for banned. I've seen a lot of videos from creators talking about how much they care about the genocide happening in Gaza. And that's great. Spread awareness, but also throw some cash. That's why I'm challenging all of the content creators that are tagged and put right here to throw a bag to help a family in Gaza. It's easy to do. Just go to Operation Olive Branch. They have a link in the bio and you can click a spreadsheet to find out where to donate your money. They also share stories of families who desperately need aid that you can donate to directly to. Like their gofundme. I click their story. I seen Abdul Kareem's family needs to get the fuck out of Gaza right now and escape into Egypt. That's nine people who desperately can benefit from getting this money. I don't have a lot of money. I made $24,000 last year. This year's looking like the same, but even I can pull together $100 to donate to help somebody. So that's the challenge is going ban for ban for Rafa. Tell these creators to put their money where their mouth is and, you know, try to help somebody.",

    "voice_to_text": "Peter who incidentally has not had anything to say about the ongoing racist genocide over the past I am really gonna do my best to be civil only because only because my nieces are on this platform hi Chloe hi wisdom Auntie is not gonna come out of her character today but we're gonna get some things settled I knew one of y'all was gonna try this mess and it had to be you so you gonna get what you asked for today so this is a creator who has accused me of working for the Zionists being paid by the Zionists to make a video refuting the Khazar theory which postulates that the Jewish people Ashkenazi Jews actually come from a a western far far uh Western European tribe called uh the qazarians so this is the idea that the Jewish people do not actually they're not actually descended from the region uh where current Israel is located so I did a video on this about a year and a half ago in response to a bunch of crap that went down on my page which I will not get into here it's a year and a half ago so definitely predates uh October 7th but this creator is saying I have been paid to make this video by a bunch of Zionists apparently and they also made a bunch of false statements in the video about me supposedly not having spoken about Gaza at all uh they referenced an interview that I did with a biblical scholar named Dan Mcclellan a podcast that we did about the video that I did on the cause our theory and saying that you know he I mean I was more insulted by half the crap that they had to say about Dan Mcclellan calling him a theologian Damatella is not a theologian he's a biblical scholar and he's a Bible translator and he's a historian he's not a theologian for gonna say but I'll let Damatella defend himself if he chooses to do so but this is the problem with people who don't leave TikTok this is the problem is that I have posted no less than I would say about 10 videos where I am discussing various elements of Gaza so right there you lie you let you let just let them lies just roll on out your mouth and then I'm gonna have to show you the receipts uh for the fact that I yes I've spoken many times on my position uh on Gaza and have also done so uh a million times on Instagram first video I posted was of a a doctor named Gabor Matte who is very Jewish doctor who is very critical of Zionist policies they got a lot of push back and a lot of flack for posting that here's a follow up video I did to that one here's a kind of a long form video that I did kind of talking about what my current place in the conversation was very clearly a delineating my position on Gaza here's another video that I did clearly criticizing the US's policy towards Israel what does that say let me see if I can make that out clearly my heart is with the Palestinian people this is a video talking about my compassion towards the Palestinian people of Gaza here's me sharing an informational video that Vox did on the history of the conflict between Israel and Palestine over the many thousands of years here's a video of me discussing how much more compassion was shown to the aid workers that were killed versus the Palestinians who were dying everyday not to mention the many many many myriad multiple stories that I have shared on my Instagram page since October 7th you all might recognize bison here she is an on the ground Palestinian reporter that does updates constantly I have paid attention to her page from the beginning I share her content at least a couple of times a week in my Instagram story and this is the problem when you base the entirety of your opinion about someone's political viewpoints or anything about their character on what you see online more specifically what you see on TikTok TikTok is not the world you don't even know what I'm doing on other platforms let alone in my actual life you get on here with your your self righteous condescension you are uninformed and you are completely misguided but I highly doubt that you care and let me add a note to that just just let me add a little bit just a little bit more flavor to this pot don't get on here telling black female creators who do justice work what we need to be posting about like do not ever do that it's just a bad practice all around first of all you wrong as sin you're wrong these are lies and then secondly you don't know the cost you do not know the price that we pay to do the work we do you do not know the mental health struggles that many of us deal with in the background the price that we pay to be able to consistently put out content that speaks from a specific point of view that only we can speak from we cannot go silent as black women we are already silenced in this world so I save my energy for the things that are extremely meaningful to me that only I can speak about there are things that only I as a black woman can speak about from this specific point of view and so I save my time my energy my research my mental acumen I save all of that for the battles that require my specific voice so how dare you or anybody tell me as a black woman who is on here fighting for the marginalized everyday what I should and should not be posting about I am of the opinion that no one should be telling anybody what they should be posting about but least of all a black woman who is doing justice work on this app how dare you how dare you don't you speak about a black woman like that you keep my name out of your mouth I spend 60 70 sometimes 80 hours a week putting together thoughtful deep pieces on things like medical racism black art and Zionism within the black church and all kinds of very topics only for you to come along and say I'm supposed to be posting about what you think I should be posting about you post about it you believe whatever twisted up theory that you want to I'm not here to debate that theory with you I have plenty of family members I could do that with at at Christmas time now I'm gonna be doing that with you but I will say that the reason that you saw those graphics from that organization in my video is because they were high quality graphics and there was literally like you said the first three searches that came up were their video and my videos because there are not a lot of videos online about the cause our theory so as a creator as a storyteller if I have a story to tell then I need to be able to find imagery that goes with that story their video was among many sources most of my sources were academic in putting my video together about the Kazar theory because your politics have LED you to another place and you're investigating all of the what ifs and the I don't knows about the Kazar theory you do what you do child I'm not trying to get in your way but do not accuse me of having any kind of a political motivation for coming to the conclusion that I came to which is the conclusion that the majority of academics have come to about the cause art theory I've taken plenty of smoke about that from my own people you can just fall in line knock yourself out with those conspiracy theories I will not be wasting any more time talking to people like you about that I have lost many Jewish friends and followers because of my constant posting about the genocide in Gaza in my IG stories so many inboxes so many people dressing me down and now here you are accusing me of the opposite thing just leave me out of your research cause if the kind of research that you did on me and what I've had to say about Gaza is any indication of your ability to find the truth your research skills could use some help but in the meantime just keep my name out of your mouth and stay out of black people's business",

    "voice_to_text": "There's been reports of clashes between the Egyptian soldiers and the IDF. Apparently, the IDF sustained seven injured personnel, whereas the Egyptian side sustained one casualty. And we ask Allahu Akbar to accept this person as a Shahid. This news is something that you will not find. The mainstream media. Egyptian forces have been having constant small skirmishes along the board with the IDF for the past few weeks now, but you will not hear of this. Why? Because the media outlets and the governments especially, they want to create an image. They want to paint an image that, you know, nobody is really bothered to the point that they will attack the other side. And this is not true. Many times we have seen the Egyptian soldiers due to what they can literally see in front of their very eyes. In your offer, the emotions get the better of them. The Akira gets the better of them. The Iman moves them to a point where they realize, I have to do something about this. This is how soldiers are trained. This is how soldiers are raised. We see an enemy, we deal with them. Unfortunately, this has only been limited to a few individual soldiers here and there who decided to break their chain of command and go ahead with it anyway, with or without the rest of the support of the army. The only way to go forward or success for this ummah, is to break that chain. Of command. It's disobedience to the one who enforces disobedience over us. We require disobedience to those in power. Stop this ummah from taking her out. And this is why you will never hear of these things in the mainstream media. Cause they wanna create an image. Everything is shush hush. Everything is honky dory. Nothing going on, nowhere in the world. Let's just maintain the status quo.",

    "voice_to_text": "if you've witnessed great violence and suffering in the past 24 hours and are struggling with intrusive thoughts I wanna offer some coping strategies some healing practice that I've Learned from engaged Buddhism actually don't like the term intrusive thoughts because an intruder is someone you want to keep out and build a wall to keep out and uh Buddhism teaches us that uh when we do have these like memories of terrible violence that come up um it there to be welcomed in that if we build a wall uh either by trying to distract ourselves trying to forget pushing the thoughts away using substances to try to forget um all these things just create more disorder and more anguish Yesterday I saw a video of a man  holding a baby uh that no longer had a head and that is not an intruder but that image keeps coming into my mind  because it has something to teach me and I want to honor what um what I need to process from that memory and I want to honor and learn what it needs to teach me and so it may seem kind of counterintuitive but the way to heal from violence whether it's violence you yourself experienced or violence you've just witnessed um is you do when it comes up you welcome it in and you breathe through it um it helps if you can close your eyes obviously not if you're driving a car if it's safe to do so though when that memory comes into your mind close your eyes and you want to get uh centered in your body so we do that by breathing and deep slow breath start by inflating your belly uh it helps to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth if you're not too stuffed up and it can help uh when our mind is racing uh with uh you know the sounds of screaming or just like it's like white noise like in a panic um it can help to have some language to repeat ourselves and um last night I was really I had a very sleep last night last night I was really struggling with this um and I wrote I wrote down sort of a meditation that I'd like to share with all of you so we I said to myself breathing in I acknowledge this memory breathing out I grieve for this memory breathing in I acknowledge my heart's suffering breathing out my suffering is empathy for the suffering of others breathing in I know I am alive breathing out my life's purpose is to ease the suffering of others if you are a parent um I have a baby as you guys know and it's been really hard for me over the past 24 hours because every time I hold my baby I am having that memory come back up of that person holding a baby um and so I invite you to add this one which is breathing in I love my baby breathing out I love that baby too I'm gonna try not to fight the feelings that come up but feel the love that I have for that baby in its fullness and finally if you really wanna get radical in it there's one more that um might maybe bit more controversial but I think this one's really important um it's breathing in I know that I am human breathing out I know that all people are human and with that meditation I invite you to try to welcome in an understanding of not just the full humanity of the victims but also the full humanity of the people who have done this of the people who make jokes about it online the people who are profiting off of it because I think there is a there is an instinct to call them monster I mean my favorite insult for scion ists is calling them a funding ghoul okay I can't be all high mighty about this all the time it is comforting it is comforting um to think of them as monsters it takes a lot of courage to recognise that they were born in their shoes the same as the victims in Palestine are born in their shoes and that's a lot to hold but I don't think we get out of this uh through more dehumanization I don't think the dehumanization in the world can be healed unless we confront the reality that the people doing these things are they're also human beings um so that meditation has been part of what I need to learn from from this uh the memory of this video which I will carry with me for my entire life we are forever changed every time we see this violence and suffering we're forever changed by it and if we try to fight being changed by it if we don't try to do this healing work and this acceptance work what is probably gonna happen is we will lash out at the people closest to us and none of us need that right now I know especially as a parent there is and there is a instinct um if we're not if we see other children suffering and then we don't heal that and honor that and then our own children um Express maybe the least little you know they're whining about something totally insignificant um there's a tendency to lash out even their joy might given us a tendency to lash out because how can you be feeling joy when there is so much suffering in the world um and so we have to do this um this breathing healing acknowledging welcoming work allowing the memories when they surface to wash over you and not and not trying to fight them and push them down um is is really important work and it's not gonna take just one time these are these are big big horrors we've witnessed these are deep moral wounds I've done this practice maybe 50 times in the last 24 hours and maybe I'm going to need to do it hundreds more um there's no right or wrong way to do this track practice you don't have to like say all the things in order take these if they're meaningful to you um write your own if if that works but the the practice of stopping and breathing and allowing the memory and the emotion to wash over you you will not be destroyed by it you will not be destroyed by feeling the feelings that you need to feel about this and then when the wave has passed it is okay to find comfort and calmness and stillness it is okay to delight in your children who are still alive um it is okay to enjoy the blessings of this world and it's like and in fact you must you need those things to sustain you um you need to be whole in your heart in order to keep doing this work long term because I'm I'm very worried about the number of people in my comments just saying I'm breaking apart I don't wanna live in this world anymore I don't know how I can go on living in this world anymore um I want you here I need people with heart like you here the fact that you are suffering like like I said I acknowledge my heart self like your suffering is empathy for the suffering of others and it's precious and beautiful and we need I need you here I want you here my mashbuka I love you um please stay please stay donating money alone will not free Palestine donating money alone will not make this memory of what you've seen go away um but it is one small good act of radical love that we can do in this moment and um I'm asking you to donate to the family at the first link in my bio if you are so moved we here are digital community this mishpocha it's amazing I love all of my followers but for those of you who are really struggling I also really want to encourage you to if you don't have it already find an in person community that's organising around Palestine that you can um be with it really helps it really helps to have comrades um and I've gotten very close with my JVP comrades through this um you know join if you're students and for justice in Palace time join the Palace tinny Ann Youth Movement or Juice Voice for peace if none of those fit you your local leftist organizing anarchist peace organizing anti racist organizing group um that may be a place where you can find community of people who are all engaged on this and so they're all seeing these things and feeling these feelings and going through it together um and I think that that can be really powerful but I honor the power of this digital community too and as always you're amazing you're my mishpocha and I love you",

We are protecting Israel from cyber threats so you can peacefully watch TV from your home. So that when they try to destroy us. So when terrorists fire rockets at civilians. So when Hezbollah launches missiles towards Israel. So that when terrorists attack. So when Hamas tries to infiltrate our shores, we are here to defend. They're doing their part, are you? Join the mobile infantry and save the World. Service guarantees citizenship.",

    "voice_to_text": "My name is Lex. I'm a nurse from the state of California. And today I wanna talk to you about Doctor Adam Hammelly. This is Doctor Hemoy. Doctor Hemoy lives in the United States and was a former US Army combat surgeon who is now in Gaza. Earlier this week, he posted a message for President Biden, and I think all of you need to hear it. As a US Army combat surgeon, veteran and international crisis first responder, I've built my life on service in the belief in the US government. I took a hippocratic oath to help people, whoever they are, wherever they are. When the call came in December 2,023, the doctors were needed through the World Health Organization. And being specialized in combat trauma and reconstructive surgery, I signed up to serve. I have never in my career witness the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza. I arrived in Rafaa as a part of a team coordinated by the WHO. We understood the dire conditions and plan to leave together in two weeks. On May 13th, in violation of international law, our team of medical professionals were denied exit. I want our president to know that we are not safe. When the call came in to evacuate, I was asked to choose to either evacuate and leave my team behind or stay with them. I could not, in good conscious, leave my team behind. That is not what I was Taught. That is not the Soldier's Creed. We don't leave Americans behind. This is against our values as Americans. As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team. And as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans. This burden falls on the international community and President Biden to use their full influence to ensure medical personnel can continue their critical work without being put in harm's way. We worry that the European hospital we are currently in will suffer a similar fate of Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, where humanitarian workers, patients and civilians were massacred. As for our patients, it is with a very heavy heart that we will ultimately leave them behind without care. And this responsibility remains in the hands of the international community. We entered with a commitment to be relieved with another medical team, and now this, too, is being denied. The people of Gaza deserve more than their burnt out, collapsed medical healthcare system. To my wife, daughters, and son, I know that it hurts that I am not coming home this weekend, and I am sorry, but I know that you are proud. And I am upholding my oath to never leave anyone behind. This man is a hero. I just ask, um, if you are still watching, that you pray for this incredible doctor, um, for both his safety and that he can complete his mission in saving lives and providing care. I would be so proud. If that was my dad, if that was my. My husband, my colleague. Whatever. Um. Doctor Hawami is a hero. And I, too, pray that European hospital is protected, because we have seen what Israel does to hospitals.",

The crimes include starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, willfully causing great suffering, serious injury to body or health or cruel treatment, willful killing or murder and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population. As well as crimes against humanity of extermination and or murder, persecution and allegations of crimes of committing other inhuman acts. It's alleged that these crimes were committed in the context of the ongoing ARM conflict and as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza pursuant to a state policy. Unfortunately, these crimes continue to this day. My office submits that these individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. We have reached that conclusion based upon interviews with survivors, many eyewitnesses, experts from satellite imagery, statements from Israeli officials, including the two individuals subject to the present application.",

Israel invaded Palestine over 75 years ago, and you're assuming that we just now started paying almost a trillion dollars for our military. Now, it's been decades. We have been a militarized power for decades. At this point, half a. Probably over half a century. Way over half a century. We have been paying close to $1 trillion per year for our military. Just keeps climbing every single year. It didn't just start. So I'm gonna ask you very politely this time. Would you consider yourself an intelligent person? Would you consider yourself an intelligent person? Because I don't understand how you would come to the Assumption that. Oh, the war, which is not a war, it's literally a genocide. It just started in October. Now all of a sudden, Americans don't have money. Their taxes are just going to the military. It's been this way for. For as long as we can remember. Also to be. Let me note this down here. Um. There are other race. Races besides black and white. Only white people say stuff like that. When I called you out for you being a pasty pal and gave that answer, that let me know you're a pasty pal. If you were any other ethnic background, you would have let me Know, straight up, hey, I'm such and such. But palm colored people who don't wanna admit they're palm colored do this, they deflect and, you know, go every which way to not address it. You're palm colored again. Are you an intelligent person? I would hope so, cause this is a stupid question.",

    "voice_to_text": "The other day, me and my friend were deciding where to eat, and she was like, I know this amazing Middle Eastern place. And I was like, yeah, but what kind of Middle Eastern food? She was like, I'm pretty sure they're Lebanese. They do Lebanese all of this stuff. My friend is Lebanese, by the way. No hate to the friend. Love you. We got to the place, my friend ordered her food, and I was looking, and I was like, like, what is? Like, I wanna know where this place is from. So I was asking recommendations from the people that work there, and I was like, what is this place? Like, what kind of food is this? She was like, oh, it's Middle Eastern food from all over the Middle East. I was like, yeah, but specifically what country? Like, are you Lebanese? He was like, we're really from all over the place. We have Moroccan food, we have Lebanese food, we have everything. So I was like, might as well be specific. Who owns this place? And then she was like, oh, a Israeli couple. When I tell you. I was literally about to explode. I was so angry in front of this woman. I looked at my friend, and I was like, well, I'm not eating here. And then I turned to the woman, and I was like, by the way, all of this food is Arabic food, not Israeli food. You need to be so Careful where you're buying your bloody Middle Eastern food. The trick is, this is how they trick you. They will say Middle Eastern because they know that if they say Israeli, people won't come to their place. So if places Israeli, they will try to avoid acknowledging that is Israeli as much as possible. Which is why everyone needs to do as much research as they can before they enter a bloody place. Especially if they're selling Arabic food but are reluctant to tell you specifically where it's from. If it's an Arabic place, we will tell you specifically. Lebanese, Jordanian, Palestinian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Algerian, we will tell you specifically where the food is from. If it's an Israeli restaurant or an Israeli cafe, they will avoid it at all costs. This is the fake Middle Eastern like cafe place by the way, so people can avoid it. I'm so tired of Israelis and Zionists stealing our food, stealing our culture, stealing everything we have as Arabs and Palestinians. Other masquerade us, destroying our homes, killing us, genociding us, killing our children, destroying our families, destroying our homes, destroying our land while profiting off of our culture. Please, if you have any drop of humanity inside of you, don't go to or eat at Israeli anything. Israeli cafes, restaurants, anything. And by the way, Israeli food literally does not even exist. There's literally no such thing as Israeli food. They just stole our food. They stole Palestinian food and rebranded It",

What are American words worth these days? What is American influence worth? I think American influence is worth quite a bit. And it is because of American engagement and American leadership and American diplomacy, specifically by this secretary and by this president, that we have seen things unfold in a certain way. We have seen humanitarian aid be unlocked. We have seen things like this new maritime corridor be accomplished. I'm certainly not trying to say that it is enough, but it is a step in the right direction. Let's not forget that at the beginning of this conflict, there was close to little humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza at all. And it is because of Secretary Lincoln and President Biden that we are trending in a different direction. We know it's going backwards. The fighting has returned, the borders have shut. People are being displaced repeatedly. Things are plainly going backwards, not forwards. We have been clear that there needs to be some progress made as it relates to some backward steps in the past couple of weeks. But there has been a sustained period in which we saw an increase of humanitarian aid, and we can continue to work that directly.",

So when I asked people about the worst thing about being displaced, they all answered me the same thing. This is not a normal displacement. This is the second neck bear. So what is the first? Nickname. I mean, the nickname. In 1948, more than 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were destroyed, and more than 800,000 people Palestinians were displaced. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the whole cities of Palestine were forced to leave their homes and villages to Gaza Strip, Westbang or to the de support.

In true Australian fashion, he loves a good ham and cheese toastie with a barbecue sauce. The real question for y'all though is if part of your cheese starts molding, do you throw it out or do you just cut off the mold and continue to eat it? Sorry to all the Australians because they made the most pathetic little cheese toastie with the last bits of bread I had. However, it was incredibly delicious and I definitely make it again. Jake says the sign of a true cheese toastie is that it's squish, and that made mine very crispy. Like listen to that crunch for lunch. One of you actually suggested chapagetti with spam for Jake's Day. I've never made this combination before, but it was delicious. Chapagetti is an S tier instant noodle in my book. Always. And I added some spinach for a healthy colon. And lastly, Jake's favorite Korean dish is kimchi, so I made that for dinner. However, I realized I was out of tofu at the very last second, so I tried substituting that protein with eggs, which was weird but good. I'm so sorry Jake for these janky meals. I obviously flopped my grocery run. Either way, this was delicious and I still thoroughly enjoyed these. And let me know which member I should eat Like next",

Like the video you are literally commenting on then a playlist entitled I am speaking on this with a little watermelon at the end. I thought that would make it clear. Notice how it says part 14? You open it up, you notice that I've been talking about this since November. Is very first video I highlight a 19 year old girl who survived the attack on belly and just days after October 7th was calling for a ceasefire. This video from November I talked about how Zionism doesn't actually provide you a safety. This one over here from December I talked about one way we could have a single democratic state in what is Israel Palestine in such a way where it protects all the rights of the Palestinians and Jews who currently live there. My most recent one before the fundraising started was this one that came at the end of March, where I talked about multiple different ways that we can prove that the casualty numbers coming out of Gaza are in fact accurate. Again, you don't even have to go to my page. This was literally on the video that you are watching. Anyways, I don't make this just about me. There is another family trying to get Out of Gaza who has their gofundme, LinkedIn my bio. This is actually the fifth family I've been able to put up. Thank you guys so much for donating to the point where we've been able to get this far. Unfortunately, donations have slowed down a little bit, so they've been on my page for about three days now. So I'm hoping this will help speed things up a little bit and get them to their goal. They're currently 38,000 reaching their goal. So here's what I'm gonna ask you to do. If you're still watching and you have at least $1,000 in your bank account, I'm gonna need you to go to the link listed in my bio and donate just $5. That's it. Otherwise, if you have less than a thousand dollars, please just go to the Venmo that I've LinkedIn my bio and just send me $1 and I'll donate it for you. If you don't think this $1 Nations help. This is my current Venmo balance. It literally cannot transfer it right now because I've actually exceeded the maximum amount that allowed to transfer in a week, which I think is like $15,000. So yes, these small numbers are absolutely adding up. I'm just waiting for Venmo to let me transfer this to my bank account, at which point I will send it to whichever family is listed in my bio. So please, thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "Duke students walked out during Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech. Here's what we know. Prior to Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke University, numerous graduating students walked out in protest of his support for Israel. Following the conflict in Gaza in October, Seinfeld took to Instagram to declare his unwavering solidarity with Israel. Subsequently, he joined other prominent figures in signing a letter to President Biden urging him to reaffirm his support for Israel and take all necessary actions to support the release of hostages by Hamas. Since then, Seinfeld and other supporters of Israel have faced criticism from social media users who accuse them of endorsing what they perceive as the genocide of the Arab population. And Palestine isn't the first instance of Seinfeld drawing criticism for his actions perceived as anti Palestinian. In 2,018, the comedian sparked backlash after visiting an Israeli military camp where he participated in war simulations depicting Palestinians as targets and terrorists. At the graduation ceremony, a group of graduating students brandishing Palestine flags staged a walkout as Sandfield was announced as the commencement speaker. Their departure was accompanied by audible disapproval with booze at going through the venue. Eventually, Seinfeld's introduction was completely overshadowed by chance in support of Palestine. This walkout occurred amidst a wave of student protests that have engulfed college campuses nationwide since April, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of students across the country.",

Israel is thousands of years old and 76 years young \ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83e\ude75 It\u2019s a harder birthday this year with 132 hostages still being held in Gaza but we continue to pray for their safe return and the end of this war EVERY SINGLE DAY! #independenceday #yomhaatzmaut #jewishtiktok #happybirthday ",
    "voice_to_text": "It's Israel's 76th birthday, and I got a box from Leva Olam. Every single month, I get one of these boxes. It's a subscription service. I pay for it myself. And I always love unboxing it with you guys because it helps support small businesses throughout Israel. And I have a feeling the box this month is all about Israel's birthday. So let's open her up. Oh, yeah. I was right. Check that out. This package is dedicated to the many people who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for Israel's establishment and continued existence. First up is this book, heroes of Our Land. This booklet is a collection of letters of fallen soldiers, generously released by their families. There's something ceramic in here, so let's see what we've got going on. Okay. It's a ceramic plate. Oh, this is gorgeous how it has the map of Israel right in the center. Something mango in here. So let's see what this is. Like a mango jam. Look at gorgeous color. We have some lightly salted Israeli almonds. I wanna try one now. I love almonds. Oh, how pretty is this packaging? Hmm. This package says the sweetness of Israel. See what's inside? Some kind of dessert cookies. What we got here? Oh, we have pistachio covered pecans and coconut and white chocolate cashews. Yeah, we're getting right in here. Oh, my goodness. Hmm. That is amazing. You're not ready for this. Oh, my god. Hmm. Oh, my gosh. These are so Good. And we have some dates. And Israeli dates. I'm telling you, there is nothing like them. And last up, we have some skincare. And this is probably my favorite part of the package besides the food. I always get the best skincare from these packages. This one is a toning mask. And here we have an eye cream. Okay, there you go. Let's put a little of this eye cream on now. Why not, right? Oh, it smells so good. I may have too much on my hands. It feels so good. Yeah, I put too much on. Just use very, very little. It contains extracts of plants grown in the Judean desert. I literally have Israel on my face right now.",

The first is like, fucking duh. UN revises Gaza death toll almost 50% less women and children unalive than previously reported. It's almost like we could have told you that the Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by a Hamas, it's full of shit. But now that the UN finally decided to do some due diligence, now we all know it to be true. Then, of course, there's Ashley Biden, who wanted so bad to ensure that the woman who stole that diary went to jail. She wrote a letter to the judge confirming it was her diary. And then Snopes, which is the most left wing fat checking site in the world, confirmed that the things written in that diary about Joe Biden, they were true. Says it right here. So, yeah, another thing we knew to be true, but social media didn't like us talking about it. And lastly, the MCU is currently at 6,065 members with more than $3 million raised. And we're certainly not stopping there. But there you go. There's your shit we already knew news report.",

You wanna boo a 20 year old girl just because she's from Israel? Yallah, go ahead. But if you threaten and harass a singer to a point where it's not safe for her own parents to watch her perform, that's not activism. You're not doing shit for Palestine with that. You are using the suffering of the Palestinian people as a platform for your trash behaviour. Don't pretend this is about your protest. It's very important to protest for the rights of Palestinians and to put pressure on all parties involved. But when you're attacking artists at Eurovision, and not just there, just sometimes because they're from Israel, or even just because they're Jewish, you're not doing that for Palestine. And this is happening. I had to cancel multiple shows because it was not safe for me or the audience. And I'm just a shitty comedian. All you are doing is delegitimize an important protest with your bullshit and you deserve to be called out for that.

Marie Antoine war zu diesem Zeitpunkt einfach 13 Jahre alt, als ihre Eltern entschieden sie nach Frankreich zu schicken, um einen Jungen zu heiraten, der circa 16 Jahre alt war, damit Frankreich, ich sage mal, k\u00f6nigliches Blut besitzt. Marie war nicht gerade die intelligenteste, aber sie war h\u00fcbsch und sie hatte 1 ganzes Volk, das ihre Kleider N\u00e4hte, ihre H\u00fcte aussuchte, die passenden Schuhe dazu und alles drum und dran. das Schloss, in dem sie lebte, hatte eine riesige K\u00fcche, wo jeden Tag viele Speisen, Getr\u00e4nke, Kuchen und Kekse und vieles weitere vorbereitet wurde. man sagt eine Kette, eine diamantkette von ihr hatte einen Wert von 15 Millionen Dollar. ja und jeder K\u00f6nig und jede K\u00f6nigin lebt doch so, denkt ihr euch? aber zu dieser Zeit litt Frankreich unter einer Hungersnot. Frankreich war Arm, das Volk hatte weder essen noch trinken und sie mussten Unmengen an Steuern zahlen, um nat\u00fcrlich diese ganzen Schl\u00f6sser und Pal\u00e4ste weiterhin funktionieren zu lassen. es Kam zu einer Revolution, die Menschen klagten, wir wollen essen, wir wollen trinken, wir brauchen Brot. diese Nachricht erreichte Marie Antoinette. und man behauptet, dass sie sagte, ah, sie haben kein Brot, dann sollen die doch Kekse oder Kuchen essen. let him eat Cake. und sie hat das nicht b\u00f6se gemeint. sie hat das gesagt, weil sie es nicht verstanden hat. ja, okay, du hast kein Brot, dann ist doch Kuchen, dann ist doch Kekse. sie hat in so einer Scheinwelt gelebt, dass sie nicht mal wusste, was es hei\u00dft, kein Brot zu haben. und hier merkt ihr, wie weit entfernt sie von der Realit\u00e4t lebte. und das soll zeigen, dass die Celebrities nicht verstehen, was passiert beziehungsweise sie wollen es nicht verstehen. ihnen ist das alles egal. sie sind die Marie Antoinette der heutigen Zeit. sie leben in Pal\u00e4sten, in schlossen, in H\u00e4user und essen den Kuchen und k\u00f6nnen nicht verstehen, was es hei\u00dft, dass die Menschen kein Brot haben. und hier fing alles an. hier fingen wir an, die Celebrities zu blockieren. und warum blockieren? weil diese Infos an TikTok, Instagram, Facebook bla bla bla. kommen. und die merken, okay, der oder die ist unbeliebt und dadurch erh\u00e4lt er oder sie keine kooperationsanfragen mehr. ihre macht wird ihnen genommen, wenn wir ihnen den R\u00fccken zukehren. und ich glaube, es ist verst\u00e4ndlich, warum wir ihnen den R\u00fccken zukehren. mal schauen, was der Kuchen ihnen jetzt bringt.",

So that's attached. I put a hyper link in my bio which links directly to the UN, World Food Programme for Gaza, the Freedom Fund for modern slavery efforts, and then doctors without borders. Definitely go check that out. Additionally, I've been hearing through the Grapevine, as in seeing other videos, that Kim Kardashian and a lot of other celebrities have been apparently losing like millions of followers, so this movement seems to actually be working. Check out the hashtag right there. You can use it to grow the trend. Additionally, I pinned three videos on my profile basically describing why I've been personally blocking celebrities for a while now and just my rationale about how you can use this to support small creators, underground artists, what not. But, uh. And then check out those two creators talking about all this and Operation Olive Branch. And without further ado, today's blocks of the day are 1. Logan Paul 2. Zendaya 3.

    "voice_to_text": "What happened yesterday at a Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and how does it directly correlate to the work we do here in Swan? Yesterday there was a large and peaceful Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and it ended with extreme police violence, excessive use of force, and the arrest of two Palestinian organizers. To use amplified SoundOn public property in the city of Orlando, you need to require a permit. And because this person did not have a permit for the megaphone, the police thought that it was justified to unannounced go into a crowd of peaceful protesters, including families, the elderly, children, and journalists, and start pepper spraying indiscriminately into the crowd and to violently arrest two protesters during this event. They felt that this was justified because of one megaphone and one use of amplified sound at a peaceful rally and protest for the Palestinian people. Now, how does this relate to what we do here in Swan? You may have seen in some of our videos that our protesters on public city of Orlando property use amplified sound, such as cones, to be able to scream towards the clinic and to be able to scream at our patients. We have asked multiple times for Orlando PD to act on this and to stop them from being able to use these cones. We have recently Learned, just last week, that OPD Legal has said that they will not take a stance on this and that they will Not prosecute any of our anti abortion protesters for using amplified SoundOn a public sidewalk in the city of Orlando, likely sending your baby straight to hell. To that we could do for you just a week after learning that OPD will not take any legal cause against our protesters for using amplified sound towards our clinic and to harass our patients right up the road. At Lake Yola in downtown Orlando, protesters were brutalized and violently apprehended by OPD simply over a megaphone at a peaceful protest. There were children in strollers that were pepper sprayed, elderly were pepper sprayed, journalists were pepper sprayed. This was indiscriminately done into a crowd of over 1,000 people without warning or without any sort of announcement that they were going to start pepper spraying individuals if they did not disperse. There was no dispersal warning before this was done. And yet our anti abortion protesters use amplified sound every day. And we have verbal confirmation that OPD legal will do nothing against our anti abortion protesters. Carden, Michael Carden. This is about the head first footage for police department. He called the city attorney and they said for now they're not, we're not doing anything with it. I hope this video serves as a stark reminder that the police's only function is to uphold the interests of the state and that our state in our country is financing and benefiting off of the genocide of the Palestinian people. Fuck OPD and Free Palestine",

    "voice_to_text": "And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there. Huh? Where should they go then? Hell, who should they listen to if not the primary sources that are live video footage of children blown to bits, mothers wailing in agony, trapped under rubble? Should they listen to politicians who routinely lie to them and write laws that favor themselves and their corporate and lobbying donors who investigate themselves when accused of crimes against the American public, only to surprisingly state they've discovered that they've done nothing wrong? Should they listen to mainstream media who, not to go out in foil hat on you, is bought and paid for, used by the rich and powerful to sway the public into believing a chosen narrative? Should they listen to Hillary the hawk, whose rap sheet in the Middle East is far from favoring peace or at the very least, the interests of American citizens? The woman who said, and I quote, that Americans should get over themselves if they're not happy with the candidate options for presidency? The woman who left American citizens to die in the Middle East? Now, it would be dishonest to pretend that social media can't muddy the information that people are getting because there are So many people posting videos. People with biases, people who are ill intentioned, people who are well intentioned but confused themselves. But this isn't 2001 anymore. This isn't 2012 anymore, where we'd have to wait for a sterilized press release from our oligarchs to have any insight on what's happening around the world, our involvement in it, and take it at face value. It is all at our fingertips. And no, possibly muddy in the beginning, it all comes to light eventually. Now, if I were you and wanted to win people over in some way, and I know you're one to double down on whatever behavior contributed to your past losses instead of seeking to improve it, hence why your communication style with the American public hasn't changed since you lost to Trump, even though it should have. I'd pick a different strategy than whatever that was.",

Their function in society is to entertain us, and that is all they do. That's why they're here. The government doesn't care about what they think you do. Just why y'all are so pressed that you're blocking all of them. Because they haven't spoken out. Y'all even blocking the ones that have spoke out. Which means y'all are coming from a place of hate. You're a hater. You're. You hate on people who have more than you, and that's why you're never gonna have more than you have. Because if you can't be solid in yourself and you hate everybody else so much cause they have what you don't, how you ever gonna get out of that fucking space? Let's put our actual brains into play for a second. You are claiming you don't want them on your timeline. Okay, but you're a part of this movement, which means, generally, this thought probably stemmed from this movement. I'm sure you probably weren't saying this two weeks ago. I doubt it. I highly doubt it. You was probably listening to your Taylor Swift being happy or whatever the fuck it is you listen to. If, let's say, Taylor Swift decided tomorrow to say something, would you then, like, unblock her and be happy? Oh, wait. Actually, let's make this a little better. If Taylor Swift says something, In December, would that have made you want to go and do something? Like, did you need them to tell you to do it? Do you really need someone else to tell you that you should be donating to a cause that you claim to care about? Get the fuck off my page.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm a little confused. People can explain if they want, but I will explain how I understand it, which is that if I donate up $60,000 to save the children, then I have 0% of that money. If I don't donate it, then twenty five percent of it will go to the US government and I will have 75% of that money. So I like the situation where save the children gets 100%, I get 0%, versus the situation where the US government gets 25% and I get 75%. If that sounds like something that is bad or that I'm doing in a self for a selfish reason, then I can, I will happily. Please help me understand that there. You could say it's for a selfish reason, cause I've said that I'm doing it out loud and so I'm getting social capital for it. That's a legitimate criticism. Um. And it is why I usually do not talk about my donations when I'm doing large donations to save the children or doctors without borders. Because it seems weird to me to like say, hey, I'm doing this, please give me social capital. I wanted to do the match to save the children. I think I'm just gonna stop making content for a little while because this is very strange to me. But I wanted to get the money, save the children. Because in Gaza there are a number of people who can do a border crossing per day. Except By the. The Egyptian government. And we can't make that number go up. The vast majority of people will not be able to leave Gaza. And the vast majority of children in Gaza won't be able to leave. Save the children is on the ground building impromptu hospitals, delivering medicine, delivering food, bringing doctors in to help care for people. We need to do both. And so I thought it would be good to do both. Like, I'm sorry I take it down a notch, Hank. It's fine. People are gonna misunderstand and misinterpret and, like, it's fine. Uh, you. Like, you can't make everybody happy, but, like. But I do. Like, I. I do think it's important to understand that we need to do both. We need to help people get out of Gaza, and we need to help people who are in Gaza. And I thought that, and I. I think, and I continue to believe, and I think most people continue to believe that it is good to do both. Like, we have not. It is good. We have to do both. Okay. Okay. I think I'll just step back for a little bit.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi, I just wanted to make this video real quick to clarify my thoughts on this subject as a lot of people been asking me to do such. I'm going to use as coded of language as I can in this video because every time I previously try to make a video on the subject matter, it's either gotten flagged for a view or taken down, or just completely suppressed by the algorithm. I do not support isn't real. I don't believe isn't real is a real place. I believe it's an American colony made up by the United States of America so they can kill brown people and steal their land under the guise of it technically being a different country, but it's actually just the United States and sheep's clothing. Because that's all the United States of America has ever done since its inception is kill brown people and steal their land. I do not support isn't real in any fathomable way, shape, or form beyond its capacity to crumble. I am very pro watermelon people, and I have been ever since I first Learned about what this conflict even was. Back when I was in high school, I used to run a Taylor Swift Stan account on Twitter and one of my mutuals named nayama ended up going to prison for several months because she refused to join the IDF. She said she did not want to murder children. I repeat, it is illegal to not want to murder children and Isn't real. So if you're defending it, that's what you're defending. In conclusion, fuck isn't real. Fuck The United States of America's government. Fuck Amy. And if you get down with genocide, fuck you, too. You're a disgusting, vile, reprehensible human being, and I hope you die and rot in hell, you piece of shit! Harm yourself.",

    "video_description": "A group of students stood up and walked out of VCU\u2019s graduation ceremony on Saturday morning in Richmond as Governor Glenn Youngkin (R - Virginia) delivered his commencement address. Prior to the event, multiple groups, including the school\u2019s NAACP chapter and a group called \u2018Not Welcome at VCU\u2019 said graduates were willing to walk out of the ceremony when Youngkin spoke.  VCU students who spoke at a recent Board of Visitors meeting said they were upset with Youngkin\u2019s perceived interference with VCU\u2019s now rejected racial literacy requirement.  They also expressed objections to Youngkin\u2019s views on LGBTQ+ rights, healthcare, and his response to police breaking up a pro-Palestine protest.  \u201cYes, VCU has a bipartisan tradition of inviting gubernatorial speakers to commencement,\u201d explained one student in the meeting. \u201cBut progress has never been made without challenging tradition. And our students and faculty cannot truly be Rams. If we were not headstrong, and we\u2019d not headbutt that which we do not like.\u201d Earlier this week, Governor Youngkin responded to students saying they would protest the commencement saying, \u201cI firmly believe it can be a great day of celebration. I think that anyone who thinks they\u2019re going to disrupt this for their own personal goals, I think is misguided.\u201d",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm so sick of people just like begging influencers to like apologize for things that like don't need an apology like tell me why y'all literally harassed Haley Bailey into apologizing for using a viral TikTok sound about eating cake that like thousands of other people used like what's happening it's quite literally a sound about eating cake but also if somebody did do something wrong to you you can like let them know but why would you want someone to apologize if they don't like sincerely mean it in their heart if someone doesn't apologize for something and like you force it out of them that's not a genuine apology if somebody did me dirty in real life I would get upset and then I would tell them about it and I would hope that they would apologize but like if they didn't apologize I wouldn't want them to even pretend like they're sorry because that would be like more hurtful to me that they can't be honest and I would find a way to move on without needing them to say sorry because if somebody's not truly sorry they're going to make the same \u201cmistakes\u201d again also let's normalize saying \u201csorry if you got offended\u201d because that's not offensive at all sometimes the only thing you're truly sorry about is offending somebody else and that's a nice thing like something that personally offends you might not personally offend me so if someone goes hey I'm sorry that like you're upset over like this one thing that I did I feel like that's nice and that's like okay it's so wild when people are like oh like this person only apologized because I got upset at them I'm like well yeah that's how it works usually I literally just watched Haley Bailey's entire apology video and wow she really gave the people like way more than they deserved to be honest those are my personal thoughts about influencer apologies what do you guys think about influencer apologies let me know in the comments",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, y'all, if you've been keeping up with the situation in Gaza at all, you would know that it's getting exponentially worse. Palestinians have nowhere left to go. Like, truly nowhere left to go. That's a harrowing thought. UN is calling this nothing short of a humanitarian nightmare. And they are so right. While activism is not the main focus of my platform, it still means a lot to me. And I can't change how little I've spoken about a cause in the past. All I can do is change how much I'm gonna talk about it in the future. I've connected with Erin Hatter. She's doing a great job over on her front. And I have some organizations and I'm gonna plug at the end of this, as well as giraffe wallow. That's my sister. I mean, there are so many inspiring people on this app who are inspiring me and so many other creators to be better about how often we're posting about Palestine right now. I wanna call to action. All of my followers keep donating, reposting, sharing. I'm doing so and will continue to do so as best I can. It's also important to stay updated. I have some update accounts, and I'm gonna link it. It's gonna be a long description, so if you've been looking for links, now is the time. I try to post credible information and sources on Instagram Stories every day when I can. Okay, and here is my list of Organizations and charities that I would recommend donating to. First of all, I'm reading off my list. Sorry. Uh, the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, UNICEF, Doctors without borders, uh, World Central Kitchen, helping to get food to people in Gaza. Um, WHL. And lastly, head count if you are not registered to vote. If you're an American and you're not registered to vote, please do that head count. Rock the vote. So many different companies. Make it easy and make it simple. If you've never previously voted in an election, now is the election to do it in. If you, like me, do not feel represented by your government that is funding a genocide. Please, probably now is the year to vote. Stay informed. Keep talking about Palestine. Call your representatives. Thanks, guys.",

    "voice_to_text": "hey guys I know what a lot of you guys want from me right now is answers and I want nothing more than to give them to you so hopefully I can answer every question that you have about what happened on Monday night about a week and a half before the Met Gala I was contacted by E to see if I had any interest in being a pre met gala host there are usually three hotels that celebrities leave from to go to the Met Gala I was stationed at what's called the Mark I was supposed to do content with celebrities and on air about their departures to the met the met is one of the most exclusive events in all of fashion you have to be handpicked by Anna Winter herself to go that's the only way that you get there I was not I was not invited by Anna Winter I did not hold an actual invitation to the Met Gala I was involved only as a host meaning that the moment that the last attendee left the hotel I went home and I watched the Met Gala coverage from my couch with my friends that is also why you haven't seen any photos of me on the white and green carpet for the Met Gala because I was working at the Mark and I literally wasn't even invited to the Met Gala so security would have definitely dragged me out I paid no amount of money to go to the gala because I wasn't invited since I was little I have idolized the met I love the costumes and the design and it has always been one of my biggest dreams to be invited to attend after entering content creation I was told that those dreams are nearly impossible if you are not in one of the inner circles of fashion so when E reached out to me with interest in being a pre met gala host I immediately said yes because I just wanted to get even remotely close to it just to like see the thing I had idolized for so long I was at the Mark which is on 77th Street and the Metropolitan Museum is on 82nd Street so that's about as close as I was allowed to get to the Met Gala people that you saw behind me in my videos were people that were lined up outside the Mark to do the exact same thing as me which was get content with celebrities as they departed for the met the dress that I wore was made by hand by friend Mark is one of my nearest and dearest friends I met him back when I was modeling and we just stayed friends so then when all of this red carpet stuff started happening for me I reached out to him and he started help me in and make dresses for me by hand out of literally the kindness of his own heart I have never paid him a cent he has never paid me we just work on the dresses together because we find it to be really fun every single dress I've worn on a carpet this year has all been made by hand by Mark I have not paid anyone anything I haven't bought dresses I haven't paid designers Mark is the only person that I have worked with Mark does not have a factory Mark does not employ a bunch of people to work on these dresses every single dress he has made for me he's made by himself with no one else's help by hand out of literally nothing more than the kindness of his own heart and he's one of the only reasons I've even been able to do what I've done this year because I wouldn't have had the dresses to go to these events if it hadn't been for him this now brings me to the audio that I used for that particular video and first and foremost before I say anything I need to apologize I am so so so sorry that I chose a sound that you guys could ever possibly feel was malicious in nature if I had thought for even one second that the sound would be received that way I never ever ever ever ever ever ever would have used it when I film my TikToks I love to use trending audios and sounds that people are currently using and this was one of them the sound has been used in over 110,000 TikTok videos it's the current trending audio of a glow up trend in the United States and abroad it's also been used by different makeup artists in the last couple weeks to create Marie Antoinette looks let them eat cake it's been used by big and small craters alike with no negative feedback or no negative discussion in the comments let them eat cake let them eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake the sound choice truly had no deeper meaning I never would have chosen a SoundOn purpose to highlight wealth disparity or eliteism I never even thought it would be taken in that way because I wasn't elite enough to even be invited to the Met Gala because I'm not elite I'm a normal person my dumb self just used an audio that I thought was viral and trending and that people recognised from the Marie Antoinette 2,006 movie Let Them Eat Cake I didn't think that much into it and for that I am so sorry I did not do my due diligence like I'm so stupid because the things going on in the world today are weighing heavily on everyone's hearts innocent men women and children are dying people do not have access to food and water people are being kicked out of their homes there are so many things going on in this world that are just wrong I know that this situation is very complex I also know that I don't know the right thing to do or say a lot of the time which leads me to the question everyone is asking which is why don't I talk about it and it's simply because I am not informed enough to talk about it in a meaningful and educational way I do not have the background knowledge to educate or discuss in a meaningful way I grew on social media as a comedy creator and I love comedy I love making videos and that's how I gained my platform but that doesn't mean that the second I started gaining followers on the platform that I automatically knew the right thing to say when it came to world affairs or wars or disputes or death or destruction or crisis I still am just that same girl who wanted to post her first comedy video a year and a half ago on TikTok but I do know that as somebody with a big platform it is my responsibility to always try to be a positive voice and to always try to better myself and be a good example for my audience because I never want to let them down at the end of the day I want to make sure that my words are used for good and when I don't think that I'm informed enough on a situation I try not to comment until I am confident that I am actually informed in the things that I'm saying are true if the pandemic taught me one thing it was that sometimes celebrities and creators need to sit down and be quiet so that other people's voices can be magnified the people that are actually well educated and informed on the situation they're the ones who should be speaking about it just because somebody has a following doesn't mean they're necessarily the right person to speak on the issue especially if they are ill informed or uninformed on that issue I do all of this on my own I don't have a fancy team that selects my sounds or edits my videos or posts my videos or writes the caption I don't have an editor I post everything myself everything that you see was probably filmed by either me or my boyfriend edited by me and then posted by me and sometimes I am dumb and sometimes I mess up sometimes I don't correctly anticipate how people will react or feel to something and for that I am truly so so so so sorry it breaks my heart that a video that I posted has added to any of this it breaks my heart that a video that I posted has made anyone feel less seen or less heard so again from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry you do not have to accept my apology but just know that I am so sorry and I really hope that this sheds a light on all of these issues and opens up a very important discussion at the end of the day I am glad though that an unintentional mistake has now been the catalyst for discussing wealth and Equality world crisis and will hopefully bring about the leaders whose voices should be heard in this and again I'm sorry it is my job as a content creator to apologize whenever I make anyone feel unseen or unheard even if it's unintentional and just know that no matter what I love you thank you for being here and thank you for watching this whole video if you made it this far",

The goals of operations like this are fairly straightforward. Their attempts at terrorizing Palestinians living under Israeli occupation while simultaneously making their lives incredibly difficult. And it's a reminder that the sort of colonial violence that is employed by the Zionist project against Palestinians extend simply beyond, like, simple brutalization and murder. Israeli occupational forces and Israeli settlers have gone out of their way for decades, try to create conditions of life on the ground that are so inhospitable to Palestinians that Palestinians either die or leave. The goal of that being to create and maintain what Israeli planners view as more favorable demographic compositions in the areas in which they're colonizing. And as a result of these operations, you often times see the demolition of Palestinian roads, of Palestinian wells for water, of Palestinian homes, of entire Palestinian villages. It's a constant daily violence that is waged openly against Palestinians living under Israeli occupation and Palestinians living outside of Israeli occupation who are denied their ability to return home from the lands in which they historically been ethnically cleansed from. These bulldozers, by the way, are also a representation of ongoing US complicity in Zionist settler colonialism. As these bulldozers are actually manufactured by Caterpillar, an American company, this bulldozer is, in effect, a result of capitalism, settler colonialism, and ultimately, imperialism, something that I think is worth thinking about is we continue watching Palestinians suffer under a brutal and repressive Israeli occupation. But, yeah, is always free Palestine. Islamu alaikum, and have a great day.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi everybody! It seems like a lot of people want me to fly to the UK for some reason. But here's the thing. As fun as that sounds, just buying an international plane ticket is a very extreme thing to do, even for myself. However, I'll do it. I'll buy a plane ticket to the UK, but under one condition. I will buy a plane ticket to the United Kingdom if and only if you help me raise enough money for my friend Ahmed to get his family out of Gaza. Ahmed is in Canada, but he has 16 family members that are still in Gaza, most of whom are children, including a Newborn infant. Because he needs to move so many people. Right now his goal is at $200,000, of which he is very far away from. However, it seems like quite a lot of people want me to go to the United Kingdom. If just 1% of the people who watch me just in the past week donated $1, he would already have 160,000. Here's what I need you to do. If you have at least $1,000 in your bank account right now, I need you to go to the gofundme that's linked to my bio and donate $5 to his family. If you have less than that, I need you just go to the Venmo that I've LinkedIn my bio and just send me $1. That's it. Just $1. At the end of each day, I'm just gonna donate The entirety of my Venmo balance. I'm gonna keep all my Venmo transactions public from this point forward so you can see exactly how much money is coming in. Just to be clear, I've spoken off by myself personally. If you have security concerns, I can let you know that all these people have been vetted and verified through Operation Olive Branch. And all of this is being organized by Aaron Hatter, who I'm going to link in the description. If you're a creator of any size. I want to adopt or advocate for another family. Just go to the link in her bio where you can sign up. Remember, all he wants to do is get his family resettled in Canada. That's it. Regardless of where you stand politically right now, there is absolutely no reason why you should not want this to happen. right now, I need everybody to donate either the $5 or $1, like I mentioned earlier, because if you want me to go to London, we're gonna have to do this first. I wanna be clear, I am not joking here. If we get to that 200,000, I will fly across the Atlantic.",

As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief.

They stopped in October when she doubled down on being a Z I O N I S T and decided that only one country's G word was something that she cared about. But the reason why I want you to block her now is because she is literally having the worst week ever. First she got booed, then she got interrupted by protesters. Followed it up with like an all lives matter type statement. I understand blocking a celebrity that has been silent, but blocking a celebrity that has been a hypocrite is so satisfying. She talked about the Armenian G word up and down all on the show, on her Instagram, but took the whole other side for the G word that's happening right now. That's crazy. Kim Kardashian is very aware of what the people are saying about her at any moment in time. Her face when she got booed at the Tom Brady roast. She was so offended. Also it has been so quiet. Not getting consistent ads for skin by Kim and skims has been so great. That's why for Blackout 2024, I nominate your number one to be Kim Kardashian!",

    "voice_to_text": "Look at this. Read it very carefully and think about it. This is literally the United States Congress members sitting in their offices thinking, how can I just come up with a Bill and introduce it to make Israel see me? How can I serve Israel and lick the asses of Netanyahu's government so I can have a brighter political future? Like, this is the most stupid Bill that can be introduced ever. Like, to send people to Gaza for 6 month on community service, punishment, whatever, just because they are protesting at the universities. You seriously have to be the dumbest politician ever in order to think of such, like, a Bill to introduce. Seriously, you don't know that even asylum seekers who are coming from Gaza cannot be even sent back to Gaza, even if their application is being rejected, because there is no way of sending them back to Gaza. There is no airport, there is no port and thank to Israel, and Israel actually doesn't want them to be sent back, so they do not allow them passing by from their airports also. So as a genius politician, how did you think about it? Like, yeah, let's send people back to Gaza. Let's send this little Gazans to Gaza to experiment 6 month. This is the person that is introducing the Bill. I'm gonna write his name in the caption. The problem is, this Bill might pass, and it's literally embarrassing to see those American politicians ignorant About anything. And to see them for the last 7 month and a half, competing. Of servicing another country, a foreign country, while the American people and the taxpayers are telling them to do the right thing. They are going against the American people. Well, and that's because they want to satisfy iPad and their sponsors. And why they are competing. Who's gonna show more strongly the support for Israel. Because clearly they know the stronger you support Israel, the longer and the powerful your political career is. So let me know what do you think of this Bill in the comments. Don't forget to share this video. Put it in your stories and duet it. And check the link in my bio. See you next video. Ciao.",

Block every celebrity at the Met Gala. Block them all. I think this new trend where we start blocking celebrities on social media. Have been silent and complicit these past few months, is an absolutely genius initiative. But you know what? I think we can do more, and I think we can really hit them where it hurts. Let me explain how. You see, we know that these celebrities only care about their money. So what we're going to do is go after their businesses, like clothing lines or makeup lines, in order to really affect their sales. Let's start with Kim Kardashian, because I honestly cannot stand any person in that family. What we're going to be essentially doing is going to her online stores. Kim's selecting as many products as we can. Skincare, makeup, it doesn't matter. Just select as many products as you can, and then afterwards, we go to her online shopping cart right before purchasing, and then we just leave it there to sit. Abandoning your item to an online shopping cart can really affect that store sales. What it essentially does is that it limits the availability of this product to other customers who are actually interested in purchasing it. Second thing it does is that it can really confuse the store's marketing team into Their insights of customer behavior and patterns. Essentially, they won't really know what is actually popular and unpopular, what is actually in demand and what is not in demand. So let's get out there and start blocking these celebrities and putting as many of their items into shopping carts without actually buying them, because together, we can actually bring these celebrities down.",

I'm gonna pause in case you need to absorb that. I'm sorry to those that didn't know. And I'm so happy that past the hat has taken off. I'm so happy we can highlight Operation Olive Branch. But did you know Operation Olive Branch was a bunch of volunteers that are folks of color that have been posting about this for months? And it took me for someone to notice them. You guys know that Middle Eastern creators, black creators, Muslim creators were posting about this since the beginning and they have failed to get traction. And it took me posting about it obsessively for people to start getting on board. Whether you know it or not, voices of color are being erased. Voices of color that are awesome people that are doing the most to help. And it. It just sucks that it took one white person to get it going. And I am very grateful for all your support and all your love, but you guys need to be directing that at creators of color that have been doing this work since the beginning. And I also wanna say to white folks, first of all, text your mom back. She wants to know if you wanna get that shirt at Old Navy or not. You can wield your privilege. Look, At what happened when I did it. How it took a white person speaking out to finally get traction going. Understand that you can use that, too. And this also goes to dude folks and straight folks. While it's not fair, you hold a majority of the power. Use it. Morning time. Aaron here. First and foremost. My tummy hurts. So Megan Rice and Zam actually made really, um, poignant videos about this. I'm going to tag them in the comments. And what I want people to do is also tag other careers of color that they know are talking about Palestine or other atrocities around the world so we can follow them and support their work, too. Please. I want you to do it so badly. My tummy is hurting.",

You've already killed up to 40,000 people, and a large number are innocent civilians, women and children. Out of that Hamas number that you just gave, more than 14,000 are terrorists that we took out. So how many civilians do you believe you've killed? We. We don't have exact figures, as you know. It's the fog of war. If you know exactly how many Hamas terrorists you've killed, you must know how many civilians you've killed. Otherwise, you're prioritizing the lives of terrorists over innocent people. I said around 14,000. Whereas Hamas will come out with precise numbers. Court, you can. You can use the ballpark. As far as the Hamas figures, which I reject, is being false. Well, if that's false, why would you give me those I had? I gave you the numbers that I had. No, you told me. I know you know how many Hamas terrorists you killed, but you doesn't have any idea how many civilians you killed. I'm just permused. Why wouldn't you keep count of both? I can tell you definitively that our aim is to go after Hamas. You're an official spokesman for The Israeli government. And you have no idea how many civilians you've killed? I don't. I don't have the information. You literally have no idea how many civilians you've killed? It's not that I don't know. I'm not authorized to give the information. I don't have the information. That's complete nonsense. Why are you authorized to give me the number of terrors you've killed, but not a number of civilians? I just find it astonishing that the moment I asked you how many Hamas you killed, you could tell me immediately. And the moment I ask you about civilians, you haven't got a clue. Literally, that you're not even prepared to issue a ballpark number. And I, I think people will find that staggering, particularly given that you are insistent that you're doing everything you can to avoid killing civilians. You come on here as the official Israeli government spokesman and. And you. You don't wanna be asked how many you've killed, cause you don't know. Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds? We're in the fog of war. We're fighting for our very existence. No, you're not foggy when it comes to killing terrorists. You're only foggy, it seems to me, when it comes to killing civilian",

I will continue campaigning for this family until they reach their goal, but I need your help in order to reach that goal. So please donate if you can. That is the most important thing. But if you don't have the means to donate, please repost this, share this, share this with your family members.

Over the last 6 months, more than 124 people in my family have been brutally killed by the Israeli occupation forces. For the last six months, I have to wake up to messages of my cousin being shot on his bike, of my aunt going blind because she can't get medicated for her blood pressure, of my entire uncle's house falling down on them. Everyone in that home died. Jesus. I like to see photos like my family and body bags make the rounds on Twitter. I have to see my last name scroll on them in black ink. This morning I got the news that the home that's been sheltering part of my family for the last 6 months has been fully evacuated. Last night, pamphlets drops all around their neighborhood. Last night, their next door neighbor was bombed, and everyone in that home was killed. The pamphlet said, you have to leave now. You have to evacuate now or face the violence of the Israeli occupation. My ox foot's been broken for 6 months. She's never received treatment. Most of my cousins are sick, hungry, tired. There's been no food, there's no water. They've been drinking sea water since week 3, trying to survive. And they've now evacuated the structure that was keeping them Out of the fucking cold, by the way. No windows, no doors. All those are pulling off my bombs now. They're headed to Morossi, a coastal, quote, unquote safe zone in Gaza. Hoping they'll find a tent to sleep in.",

They always have, like, walnuts and cheese in them. And salads. Middle Eastern, Israeli, Palestinian salad, whatever you wanna call it. We all eat the same thing. This beautiful Greek salad, mushrooms, cauliflower, and then literally, like, you just make your own salad. Oh, there's some zaatar and olive oil over here. Then we have hot dishes. So there's eggs, scrambled eggs, shakshuka. Look at these beautiful quiche over here. These are actually really good. I don't know what that is, but I think I'm gonna get it. Eggplant. Is that like eggplant? Parmesan, mushroom, barakas, lindses. Look at that mushroom with chili sauce. And roasted potatoes. Then all the fish, tuna, herring, salmon. Oh, my god, look at this smoked mackerel. Their tuna salads are elite. They are so good with all the pickled vegetables, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, peppers, tomatoes. And one of my favorite things to eat in Israel, because it's just better than everywhere else I've ever had is cheese. This is labneh, cottage cheese. No idea what kind of cheese hold this is. Maybe Brie. And then olives. You guys know I don't eat olives. But that's okay. I'm not gonna yuck your yum. Sometimes I do, and I'm sorry for that. And they do have some sweet. There's some Pancakes and waffles and broccoli. Interesting. But that's over here, granola, yogurt. Lots of different kinds of yogurt. Oh, look at that. Holiday dates. And just dry fruit and nuts. How beautiful. And more cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Gorgonzola. Is that what that is? And over here we have fruit as well. Then some pastries, croissants. Look at all these beautiful cakes. And then just gonna take you back here for a minute. If you can see the bread and that toaster over there. Wow.",

They're indiscriminately bombing this area, dropping leaflets from the sky, telling them it is no longer safe to be there. They have to leave. Where are they supposed to go? Literally, where they supposed to go? There is nowhere else for them to go. How can you look at this visual demonstration and not call this a genocide, not call this an ethnic cleansing, not call for a ceasefire? So we need you now more than ever to keep posting, keep sharing, and do not stop talking about Palestine.",

I would be emotionally manipulating you. That is exactly what's happening in Gaza right now, and most people agree with that because it's obvious. And if it's not obvious to you, then you either have another agenda you're pushing or you've been emotionally manipulated. You're being emotionally manipulated. You should talk to somebody about that. Ideally, that person is not some woke terrorist apologist therapist.

A livable places in. In canunas. They cannot live in canunas. There is no places in Canunas even to but a tent. So the thing is, Egypt, America, and the whole world warned Israel to not enter Rafah, because entering Rafah will result in maybe the hardest crisis ever in the history, because Rafah contains 1.5 million people. But now Israel already started the military operation already. I don't know what to say, but keep an eye on Rafa, because none of us will leave. We'll have any other places to live.

But the fact that they've stopped playing the game, the fact that they have stopped allowing us to delusion that we have free speech, tells you that what we are doing is working. If our speech was not such a threat to them, they would not risk radicalizing even more people. Finally, they're bombing civilians in Rafa in the middle of the night, right? Now. So please use the hashtag all eyes on Rafa and repost as many videos on this as you can. Do not let this go unnoticed. Unseen.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I'd like to announce, after eight long hours of negotiation yesterday with Chancellor Wilcox, Provos Elizabeth Watkins, and Vice Chancellor Haynes, in partnership with Doctor Christine Victorino and Hibba Naslaud, we have decided that we have gotten to an agreement that robustly meets our demands, which LED to the dissolution of this encampment. Today is our love letter to the people of US up and to the people of Palestine. We have watched them stead, fastly, and patiently and bravely stand in the face of the oppressors, in a way with Grace and in a way with faith. Inspired by them, we decided to do the same this Monday. And I can say that we are the first in the UC system so peacefully we have on this campus that shares our vision of justice, that shares our vision to be progressive, that shares our vision of protecting our students. We have decided to dissolve this encampment without a single arrest, a single one of you being put in harm's way, so we will no longer be complicit in the crimes perpetrated against my people. Yeah! We have four very clear demands going into this. First, we demand a transparency. We needed the university to disclose all of their investments and endowments, specifically as it relates to arms and weapons manufacturing. We can say that the university has agreed to make it entirely transparent which companies we are investing in and the size of those investments. And we will Continue to call for transparency moving forward. Following that, we called on this administration to end their silence. Chancellor Wilcox has recognized the death toll and Liza. And we will continue to figure out ways for this administration to support you students here. Next, we called on divestment. I am confident that we have outlined concrete, legitimate steps for us to no longer be complicit through our financial. Through our financial engagements at this university. We are going in the right direction, and I am confident we will fully divest from weapons and arms manufacturing by the end of next year. Actually, I'm not gonna make any promise. Lastly, we call for our full academic boycott. Students at UC Riverside will no longer be able to walk the lands that I am prohibited from. At this university. Will no longer be able to see my Holy Land that I embarked from. As long as there's an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, students at the university of California, Riverside will not walk the land that I am banned from. Yeah. I just wanna thank every single person who has invested in this encampment anyway, materially, emotionally. To the people who Venmo, to the people who dropped off food, to the people who slept here, to the people who sent words of support, to the medics who volunteered, to our legal observers, to our police liaisons, our media liaisons, to every single person who offered support, every single person who visited, to The children who blew bubbles. To the people who drew the talk, to the people who put up the signs, to the people who stood that fast with us. I want to thank you, because this is your win. No, this is all yours. I want to. I want to also say.",

The website is now inaccessible. Uh, they're also banning any device used for providing content. That includes my mobile phone.

Our internet access provider, the guy that simply hosts, uh, Al jazeera.net, uh, is also in danger of being find if they host the website. The Al Jazeera TV channel completely banned. Transmission by any kind of content provider is also banned and holding offices or operating them in the territory of Israel by the channel. Also, once again, any devices used to provide content for the channel can be taken away by the Israelis. It's a wide ranging ban.

And capcities across the US, moreover, are continuing to be invested in and built in order to continue to police and to essentially be centers to quash any rebellion towards the genocidal settler colony known as America and the violent occupation of Turtle Island by the American Empire. But I think something that gets lost here is people like to source the locust of policing outside of the American settler colony. This is not new. The Zionist state is not teaching the American occupation. Crack down and violate and police and kill and suppress individuals in the United States, most notably black indigenous people. Policing comes from slave patrols. Entire white society would participate in quashing slave rebellions. This is not new. This is how the structure of policing emerges. Slavery is legal in the United States through the 13th Amendment. With the prison industrial complex. The IOF and the Zionist state, moreover, are modeled after the American settler colony an occupation of Turtle Island. It's not the other way around. It's not that policing in the United States needs to learn something that they don't already know. Policing emerges from slave patrols. The United States is the Locust of violence the Zionist state is the client state which models and iterates and replicates and is funded by American empire. So we're not here to just divest from the police. We're not here to defund the police.

    "voice_to_text": "New York Times opinion released a fucking humiliating article today about the student encampments. It includes the quote protesters have demands, including divestment and cutting off ties with IZZY. But ending relations with IZZY doesn't help Gauzens. And on the contrary, it's useful for universities to have exchanges with a broad range of places, including those whose policies we disagree with. Doesn't help gazens to stop sending money for bombs. Guys, like, at this point, are you just, like, lying for fun? The top comment on this article, thank god. Was a great MLK quote. To sum it up, it's over the last few years, I've been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. The great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the this thing that I'm not gonna say, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action. There's another line in the article that stood out to me and many commenters. You know, I admire your empathy for Gauzens, but what about the risks to commencements? Oh, goodness, you're right. Commencement speeches in G Slide clearly carry the same weight. Shut up, Nick. No meaningful changes ever come about by asking nicely. Nice to know you care more about property damage than human lives. Isn't this the exact same thing every old white pro war dude Has said about activists ever. The New York Times has had a lot of fumbles recently, but this guy saying that it's useful for universities to have exchanges with places whose policies we disagree with has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever read.",

It's kind of like that situation where you kind of wanna go up to them, but then they're also enjoying their personal time, so you don't wanna like intrude what I mean. But then it's kind of awkward to if you start recording them secretly because then they're gonna end up finding out and they're gonna be like, why the is fucking recording me? But then also I kind of wanna record because I wanna show my friends and I wanna have evidence backing up my claims saying that I saw in hyphen shopping at the same store I was. I don't know, it's kind of confusing cause I also wanna go up to them and be like, hey, can I get like a picture or something? But then they're also enjoying their personal time.

According to their logic, what's the difference between their beliefs and the beliefs of the Christians? Let me explain. Let's look at how the Christians belief and the belief of the so called salefiyah are similar. So the Christians believe that Jesus is god. And we know that I Sally, his salam is in the second heaven. So Jesus is in a place, he takes up space, he has a volume. The heavens is a place. And the wahabiya, the so called salafiya, they also believe that Allah is in the heavens. And they also say that Allah is sitting on the throne. Or they say he ascended above the throne. Referring to directions and places. Hello, Sunnah. We say Allah created the throne, he doesn't need it. And he's above everything in status, not in location. So you see, when I said Allah exists, not like we exist, he exists without being in a place, without being in a direction, that person called me a liar. So my belief, the belief of all the prophets is very clear. And their belief is very similar to the Christians. So wake up!",

That's where I come in. Police officers in Canton, Ohio were dispatched and referenced to a vehicle that crashed into a telephone pole, and police officers arrived on scene. They made contact with witnesses who inform them that the offender, later identified as Frank Tyson, fled the scene on foot and ran into a bar. He's in the BMW. He ran in there. He ran in where, right now? Yeah. And there's cars right there. All right? Yeah. He's in the BMW right now. When police officers arrived at the bar, they made contact with Mr. Tyson, who is causing a disturbance, and employees were begging police officers to remove him. Police officers then tried to escort Mr. Tyson from the bar and he resisted. Mr. Tyson thrashed and kicked, violently fought with police officers. Eventually, police officers were able to get Mr. Tyson into handcuffs without using any weapon systems. Mr. Tyson died a few minutes after being placed in handcuffs. The police did nothing wrong.",

The past few days, members of the administration have singled out people they recognize, um, and have written them disciplinary notices. So this is the beginning of administrative discipline that we see getting students in trouble for organizing, me being one of them. We don't know what police response will look like. In the next upcoming days, there are some big university events, and the administration has made it very, very clear that they want us gone. We will fight that until our demands are met, and we are here to stay.

    "voice_to_text": "The UCLA protest just recently got attacked by a group of Zionists. The Zionists attack the protesters with bear spray, fireworks and items that they threw at them, as well as, I believe, bludgeoning items. And the police who have been terrorizing these students, nowhere to be found. And we've seen this sort of behaviour before with the police and with bad actors outside of the police force. Back during the BLM protests, when they were happening much more frequently, there were uprisings of unsavory people who were larping as militias. One such militia showed up at a BLM protest that we all know about because it was the protest that involved Kyle Rittenhouse gunning down, uh, gunning down protesters. And what the police did was they knew about the militia. They were joking around and having back and forth conversations with the militia, and they were hurting the protesters towards the militia because the police wanted the militia to hurt the protesters because they couldn't. At least they couldn't without difficulties. And that resulted in Kyle Rittenhouse coming across the protesters and gunning three of them down, killing two of them and injuring the third. And I believe this is a method that the police are going to repeatedly use against the protesters at the college campuses. They're going to come in and calm things down. And by calms things down, I mean they're going to terrorize the protesters and then they're going to back off and let the Zionists come back and assault them, and it's going to be a continual cycle over and over again. Because the police aren't here for the American people. They're here to defend the rich and the most unsavory individuals to ever come out of humanity. And we saw this in Charlottesville, and we're seeing it now, and in its entirety. This puts all of our ability to protest and exercise our First Amendment right in a precarious situation, because if any of these protesters try to protect themselves or defend themselves, it will be seen as the act of anti Semitism. And the court system that does not represent the American people will utilize that, and they will use it to legally try to shut the protest down and try to incarcerate the protesters. The only silver lining to this is, much like the child graping IOF that these Zionists aspire to be like, Zionists are not very good at keeping their mouths shut when they do something wrong, evil, or illegal. So keeping an eye out for people bragging about this on their social media is key. Getting their names, recording evidence, and then using lawsuits against them would be the next course of action. But make no mistake, these kids are in danger, and the police have never been here for us.",

So you don't think that's intimidating to Jews or. I mean, I'm British. Israeli. So you don't think that's intimidating for people who are. Cause I'm Israeli and I feel intimidated being on a bus and luckily I have a British accent cause my mum's British. But had I come on with an Israeli accent, I would have felt quite frightened that you would have recognised me as an Israeli. Because that's intimidating. You shouldn't be expressing your political beliefs at work. You shouldn't. I don't. Come on, I don't. I don't go to work. I'm a teacher. I don't go to work wearing an Israeli flag dress. Do. Do you think that's appropriate? It. Yes, it was because I work in the public sector, as do you. That's not. That's not appropriate to wear. That's. That's your personal opinion. No, it's not my personal opinion. No, it's not. It's not professional. It goes against professional guidelines to express your political beliefs at work. Especially when that could potentially intimidate people. I find that intimidating. My mom's best friend's family died on October 7th. They were murdered by her Mass terrorists. I find that. I find that intimidating. I find that triggering. Well, I can't do anything about that. I'm sorry. You. You can do it. You cannot wear that at work because that's. It's political opinions that can be offensive to Jews and Israelis getting on your box. You work in a public center. You have. I'm sure you all have Jewish friends, don't you? Like you all, like in the 50s, you all have black friends, you all had Jewish friends. And your Jewish friends. Well, you're being offensive to me. I'm not being offensive to you. Yeah, you have Jewish friends who are happy with you walking around with that on. I highly doubt it, since most Jews are Zionists. Alright, yeah, yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. And you don't condemn Hamas what they did on October 7th. You don't. You don't condemn Hamas for what they did on October 7th? Yeah, because you don't.

Alliance's\u00a0working\u00a0definition\u00a0of\u00a0antisemitism which\u00a0states\u00a0that\u00a0denying\u00a0Israel's\u00a0right\u00a0to\u00a0exist

now\u00a0the\u00a0problems\u00a0with\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0something\u00a0I've\u00a0been\u00a0researching\u00a0for\u00a0quite\u00a0a\u00a0while way back in October when\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0a\u00a0Bill\u00a0stating\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018anti-Zionism\u00a0is\u00a0antisemitism\u2019 and\u00a0referenced\u00a0this\u00a0definition I\u2019ve\u00a0come\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0obvious\u00a0conclusion that this definition is used to shut down free speech criticizing\u00a0Israel\u00a0and\u00a0policies\u00a0in\u00a0governments\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0world this\u00a0definition\u00a0is\u00a0heavily\u00a0pushed\u00a0by\u00a0pro-Israel\u00a0lobbies\u00a0here\u00a0in\u00a0America because it literally gives these lobbies protections not\u00a0only\u00a0are\u00a0they\u00a0already\u00a0acting\u00a0in\u00a0Israel's\u00a0interests and on behalf of Israel this shuts down a lot of criticism of the pro Israel lobby in America because a lot of it is based off the actions of the state of Israel if you can't criticize Israel legally anymore you can't criticize these pro Israel lobbies the\u00a0author\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act\u00a0is\u00a0Mike\u00a0Lawler and\u00a0you\u00a0already\u00a0know\u00a0he's\u00a0funded\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC\u00a0$180,000\u00a0this\u00a0year\u00a0alone the\u00a0reason\u00a0this\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0being\u00a0pushed\u00a0right\u00a0now is so they can use it to shut down college protests and\u00a0say\u00a0that\u00a0they're\u00a0in\u00a0violation\u00a0of\u00a0Title\u00a0VI and\u00a0let\u00a0them\u00a0pull\u00a0federal\u00a0funding\u00a0from\u00a0schools who allow these protests to continue on their campuses when I was doing my research I came across something that was really interesting this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0Declaration\u00a0on\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0 which\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0IHRA\u2019s\u00a0definition their goal was to fix the issues with the other definition which\u00a0conflated\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0with\u00a0antisemitism the two are not the same and\u00a0fix\u00a0the\u00a0clear\u00a0bias\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0Israel that the other definition is being used for so a group of 200 scholars got together and wrote this definition that makes a clear distinction about what is and\u00a0what\u00a0isn't\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0and\u00a0antisemitism my\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0politicians\u00a0are\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0not\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0definition??\u2019 clearly protects free speech in a way that the other one does not the\u00a0answer\u00a0is\u00a0-they\u00a0don't\u00a0wanna\u00a0use\u00a0it they want to shut down criticism of the state of Israel that's why they use this one we have to all speak out against this act it's an evil act it's an act meant to shut down free speech it's an act meant to protect Israel this is not an American Bill it's an Israeli Bill pushed\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC using\u00a0a\u00a0problematic\u00a0and\u00a0biased\u00a0definition they\u00a0had\u00a0the\u00a0audacity\u00a0to\u00a0name\u00a0it\u00a0the\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act what\u00a0it\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0called\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Don\u2019t\u00a0Speak\u00a0Against\u00a0Israel\u00a0Act please help this video get out there repost and copy the link a bunch of

No offense to the religious folk or the man upstairs, but I just don't think he's gonna come pick up a shovel with me. Nor is Jesus Christ gonna wire my bank account and reimburse me for my construction costs. And before you yell blasphemy, just know I've been to more Sunday services and youth groups than I can count. But right now I'm not too worried about my own salvation when I'm driving by homeless, intense cities every day, knowing that my 25 thousand dollar tax payment this year went to wars and death. I think god is a gamer and we all live in a save file that he abandoned a long time ago. No shade to the church, but I don't have a shiny collection plate. What I do have is a willingness to work hard to start a business, to post my life on social media, to tattoo myself for viral views and TikTok live gifts. To film the battery and the most intimate moments with my fiance and post them all for sale. Cause none of this gets built without money. And I don't know if you've noticed, but everything's unaffordable. Corporate agreed with political backing is buying up all of our residential real estate just to rent it back to us at a profit. So I don't really care what Jesus would Do I'll stoop to any level to say fuck the people at the top of this human food chain",

And that's not okay. We want our Jewish kids who are behind these gates to understand that we're here, support them. But more than that, we are here because clearly there are 133 people that we are still waiting for, and we are patiently waiting. They can encamp as long as they want. We're not gonna stop coming and supporting the families and the people who need us to support them.

Yup. Yesterday, Palestinian officials uncovered two mass graves outside the bond hospitals in Gaza. These graves also constitute as a war crime, don't they? Deputy Prime Minister well, of course, we would expect the, the democratic government of Israel to investigate any allegations of misconduct, and that's exactly what they do, and it's exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge them to do. But I find it quite extraordinary that she seeks to draw parallels between the legitimate war of self defense of Israel and the conduct of Russia. Party Black 300 bodies, including the elderly and the injured, some of which had been stripped naked, mutilated, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UK's own arms policy states that if there is even a risk that war crimes may be taking place, then that is reason enough to halt the sale of arms. Stop the sale, given all we know. Why then, is the Prime Minister yet to do so? Stop the sale. Deputy Prime Minister well, we continue to urge the Israeli government to investigate any allegations of misconduct. The difference, though, is that we can trust the Israeli government, a democratically elected government, to properly investigate those things. And of course, we keep the advice under review. The foreign secretary Has recently made it clear that he is conducted, uh, a determination and has not changed his advice regarding, uh, export licenses. And I think that is the correct decision.",

    "voice_to_text": "Most of the bombs and most of the military equipment the Israeli government is using in Gaza is provided by the United States and subsidized by American taxpayers. The US military is not dropping 2,000 pound bombs on civilian apartment buildings. The US military is not doing that, but we are supplying those bombs. United States of America is not blocking the borders and preventing food, water and medical supplies from getting to desperate people. We are not doing that. But we have supplied billions of dollars to the Netanyahu government, which is doing just that. So this is not just an Israeli war, this is an American war as well. And yet, despite the massive financial and military support the United States has provided to Israel for many years, Natanya House! Natanya House! Extremist government has ignored urgent calls from the president and others to alter their military approach and to end this humanitarian disaster. In my view, the United States is unconditional financial and military support for Israel must end. And that is why I offered an amendment to this Bill to do, in fact, what a majority of the American people want us to do, and that is no longer to provide military aid to the destructive Netanyahu government. I would have welcomed the chance to vote for the humanitarian aid provision in this Bill. Terribly important that we stop feeding people not only in Gaza, but in Sudan and all over the world. It's an important provision. I wanna support. It. I believe very strongly that we should support Ukraine and help them in defeat the imperialist ventures of Putin and the Russian army. But I'm not gonna be able to do that because I'm gonna stand with the American people today who oppose more money for Netanyahu. What we are doing today is very bad policy. We are eating and abetting the destruction of the Palestinian people. What we are doing today is not what the American people want. And I say to my democratic friends, it is absolutely not what Democrats. A lot of Republicans don't want us to continue that as well. But a strong majority of Democrats are saying, enough with Netanyahu's war. You just can't give him another $10 billion for unfetted military aid. But I suppose in a little while, as things happen here in the Congress, we will ignore the needs of the American people. We will not pay attention to what they want. And then we are shocked, just shocked, that we have a 14% approval rating.",

And, uh, you know, one of the other things that Mark and I wrote in that piece is that the blood on the trauma bay floor and the operating room floor was dripping from our hands. And that's. I think that's accurate. We again, we provide the crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support. Um, your viewers are no surprise to that. And that makes us responsible. If our support stops, the attack stop. If our support stops, the occupation stops. It's. It's instant. It's been proven a hundred times. It's not hard. Not hard to see. Um, and so that's what I would say to people is if you want to stop participating unwittingly, uh, in these. In some of the worst crimes that I've ever seen in my life, then you need to organize and you need to raise the cost to people like Joe Biden, because that is the only thing they care about there. The US is attempting to manage the Middle East with the system that I put in place since the Arab Spring, and the Palestinians are just kind of an annoyance to that system. So I would say To people that you know. You know what's going on. So stop thinking about it all that much and just start acting. Go to, uh, go to your houses of worship, go to your community centres, go wherever it is that you go and talk to people and say, look, let's go talk to our congressman in person. Let's demand a meeting. If you're a veteran, put your uniform on and go. I've had several veterans reach out to me. Put your uniform on, go talk to your congressperson. Film it, put it online. Do anything you can to embarrass these people and to make it obvious to the world that they are not acting with normal human decency in mind. They're acting with purely cold, almost Mafia like political calculations. And, um, the only way that we are going to stop this is by raising the cost to them of doing so.",

I think you've lost the thread. It. It just to end on this. If you had a message for Christian leaders in the United States, whether in government or in churches, or just citizens who care about the religion, their fellow Christians, what would it be? It would be to remind them that when the state of Israel was created, it was not created on an empty land. It was created on a land that had, uh, millions of indigenous Palestinians there, including Palestinian Christians. And that that state they support, uh, that state they celebrated as a fulfillment of prophecy and the sign of God state to the Jewish people. For it to become a state, uh, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians, uh, were forced to leave and have never returned. Uh, churches were closed. A friend of mine did the research and counted more than 30 churches that were closed when Israel was created. Because Palestinians, uh, were expelled from, uh, the land. Our numbers continue to be in decline. Uh, so we're pleading that, uh, uh, come and listen. Come and talk to us. And my message to Christian leaders right now is there is a very, very brutal war taking place in Gaza. A war that I've described using the word genocide because it's a war that Has used even starvation as a mean. And fellow Christians are suffering because of that war. Uh, it's time that, uh, Christian leaders, ah, recognise that wars is not the way, whether in Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya. I mean, when will we learn that war does not help? When will we take Jesus's words seriously, uh, about being peacemakers, about being merciful, merciful. There must be, uh, other ways. Um, and so it would be an invitation to listen, to learn more, uh, and to avoid very shallow and simplistic perspectives that are not based on Scripture itself, but more based on, uh, political, uh, equations. Um, and I would plea right now, and I will continue to plea, that we need to stop this war in cancer. Uh, it's killing many, many children, women, innocent lives. It has to stop. There must be, uh, other ways. And as a follower of Christ, uh, we have to pursue the path of peace, uh, and justice. And we have to avoid simplistic, uh, polarizations. Good and evil. Come and listen. Come and understand what's happening. And I plead, as a Christian pastor from Bethlehem, I plead that you come and listen. Father, thank you for your thoroughly decent and sensible analysis, and I hope it's heard by Christians throughout the west. I appreciate it.",

I'm an optimistic guy, and I believe we can get better. Um, the endorsement that I made years ago with Biden was one I thought was the best decision for me at that time. And I thought back then, when we talk about hate, I'm in this position where I have some influence and it's my job then. I felt like that. Then it's my job now to exercise my influence and share with this. This is who I'm gonna endorse. Am I gonna do that again this year? That answers no. Now the real question comes to you guys. Do you genuinely believe these people mean what they say when they say they regret endorsing Joe Biden, or are they simply trying to save their own skins? Let me know.",

So on October 7th, Starbucks is workers union, also known as Starbucks Workers United, posted a pro Palestine tweet expressing their solidary with Palestine. Few days after the tweet, Florida Republicans, including US Senator Rick Scott, called for a boycott of Starbucks. The Orthodox Chamber of Commerce also called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that drinking a cup of Starbucks was drinking a cup of Jewish blood. On the same day as these calls for a boycott, Starbucks leadership said that they disagreed with the union's views and statement. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz met with the CEO and founder of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber to discuss the ongoing support of Israel and the condemnation of the union stores that support Palestine. The CEO of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber suggested to shows that he should close down the stores. Colts explained that it would be illegal for him to do so, but expressed his desire to close down every union store and terminate all the employees. The chamber suggested that Starbucks should take legal action, and then the chamber and Starbucks work together to release a list of all 300 Union stores and their addresses, putting all of these employees at risk. On October 18th, Starbucks sued the union for trademark infringement, demanding that Starbucks Workers United stop using Starbucks in their name and to also stop Using any other identifying symbols, Starbucks Workers United then sued Starbucks because the company has stated and implied that the union supports terrorism and violence. Because of Starbucks's ongoing support for Israel and them suing the union after a pro Palestine tweet, many people and customers then started calling for a boycott on Starbucks. So before your next Starbucks trip, think, is this a company that I really wanna support?",

The first one, then an interval during which aid workers got out of their vehicles, removed the wounded, tried to move to another vehicle, which was struck. And then a third strike. What? As they tried to move and escape in a third vehicle, at which point all of them were dead. How would the second and third strikes of these marked vehicles be a mistake? And why would the US not more forcefully set conditions on the use of US made weaponry when it is being used to target aid workers? If the first one was a mistake, the second two, we're targeted with the intent of killing everyone in that convoy. So how do you respond to that? First of all, there's an investigation going on, so why don't we let it get done and why don't we see what they find in terms of the decision making process that LED to this terrible outcome? Prime Minister and the IDF have noted that it was their error. If you don't like the word mistake. Their error. They're investigating it. Let them do that work and let them see what they come up with, and then we'll go from there. Two years ago, the IDF killed an Al Jazeera journalist. They said that that was a mistake, uh, that she was wearing a Mark Press vest. She was shot anyway. Investigated it, and they, uh, released the findings. Their investigation, which found that they were at fault. Go on. But my. My question, sir, is in that case, uh, these. The Israelis did not initiate any criminal, uh, proceeding in this case. If it's found that the marked convoy was deliberately targeted, if not with the first shot, but the second two shots with the US support, criminal penalties. As I said, we would expect that should there be a need for accountability, that accountability be properly put in place for whoever may be responsible for this. But again, that's gonna allow. That's gonna depend on the investigation.",

Get the hell out of the USA, and let's put an end to this madness by voting to restore law and order as well as world peace. I don't know what world peace means, but 35,000 people is not world peace. But this is why I read stuff like this, because you see who's liking comments like this? Like, we all know the underlying connection with Paris and her sister and their family, but liking a comment that basically says people should get kicked out of a country for not supporting a foreign government committing G side? And Caitlin, of course, posted a video of her confronting the protesters, caption this trash, and then commented this. This is the ideology we have here. And just a little PSA, let's not use this comment section on this video to just bash someone's, like, gender or identity or whatever.",

One of them, Alexander Temerko, has generously handed out over \u00a3730K to the Conservative party. On top of this, He\u2019s been helping to secure oil deals with Petrofac for the Bahrain royal family worth billions. Furthermore, renowned climate denier Terrence Mordaunt has spent 10K for him to vote on behalf of his anti-net zero think tank GWPF. Unsurprisingly it is propped up by billionaires such as the Koch brothers and those who \u2018tend to be richer than the average person and much more intelligent than the average person\u2019 He has been Legitimising climate denial since 2019 and making a fortune exploiting democracy. We refuse to sit back and allow the biggest culprits of the climate crisis to dictate the future of our planet and their dying industry. Liam, how can you justify chairing a net zero event, when you lobby your own government to push for more oil and gas?  #whodoyouworkfor #stoppollutingpolitics #oilymoneyout #liamfox #climateaction ",

Okay? \u00a310,000 from Terrence Morden, a notorious climate skeptic. And now he wants you to sit here and listen to him talk about sustainability as if there's nothing wrong with that. Liam, how can we believe a word that you say when you are in the pocket of the people obfuscating the reality of the situation that we're in? The ICC, who are here today, have been unequivocal in the condemnation of new island gas rigs. Right? And yet you seem to be representing the interests of the people causing climate breakdown. Who do you work for, Liam? Do you work for us? Do you work for the people who've come here because they genuinely want to see a green transition? Or do you work for oily billionaires and their apologists? Cause your bank statement suggests the latter. Am I the mad one here? Am I the only person in the room who thinks that this man should not be cheering a sustainability conference?",

That this is what is widely understood, but not supposed. Supposed to be said out loud. Jared, like the flesh of the children that he wants to build his luxury developments on, hasn't even fully decomposed off of the bones. I just wanted to really quickly read this paragraph that I saw the other day, just to give people a sense of what the construction of these kinds of cities and the development on Palestinian land really looks like. TEL Aviv serves as a coordinator point in a globally integrated imperial project. The money generated from the purchase of settlement feta cheese in Marina Del Rey. Costco helps to finance the dispossession machines of the Jordan Valley, where the Israeli dairy conglomerate Tanuva operates a food processing plant. Former Israeli soldiers recruited into New York private equity firms make tax deductible contributions to the 5 O 1 C 3 designated charitable non profit. Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces support the army that protects their second homes. Launder billions stream in from Zionist mining extraction in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the mineral magnates flee to Israel to avoid international sanctions. This is the story of all colonialisms. Settlers build their tall, shiny things on the embers of the societies they torch, enlist the dispossessed into the production and maintenance, export the spoils and bury their guilt in their families, splying out on terraces, declaring themselves home at last. Just to give credit really quickly, the piece is called hating at lush on TEL Aviv by Kaleem Hawa.",

That over here is Jared Kushner. He's married to Ivankatron. Yes, that Ivanka Trump. Love the dynamic, by the way, but that's besides the point. Recently on some podcast or interview, and he was asked what he thinks should happen to Gaza, and this man had the audacity to say the quiet part out loud. Take a look. Listen to what he says. Once Gaza's leave Gaza, and then I was never gonna let them back in. Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. And Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable. It's a little bit of unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out, and then there's not much left of Gaza anyway. Move the gazons out and then clean it up. This is why it is so important to continue to talk and for everyone to use their platform to spread news like this. Because their plans are far from over. They said it initially, they wanted to turn Gaza into a parking lot. And now they're already wanting to develop said parking lot with absolutely no remorse for literal human life.",

You can see the statue of Liberty down there. Oh yeah, you can. Even though it's cloudy, you can't see. I gotta have my hairstyles. This TV is cool. What is this laying around towards us? Come over to the kitchen. Gilmore Girls. Gilmore Girls. I grew up watching that show. I do TikTok live. What would that look like? There's an essential object about the heels for a live stream. Our one little bathroom here. She does the job where the magic doesn't really happen. I do make my bed every day. This was actually what I performed to the last arrows tour live. And hot dog suit. I can jump in heels better than I can walk in them. One last thing. So step back. This was while I was still single, so it felt like I was kind of like holding on to something that loved me. Oh, it's tough. It's hard. Sometimes I come up here and read. I've only done that once, but I like to say it. Just hurl up with a book.",
