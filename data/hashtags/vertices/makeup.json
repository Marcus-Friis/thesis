I was just clicking in my target cart for these products to recreate this lip. Alright, so I'm gonna go beat my face and I'm come back, I'll show you all the products, and we're gonna see if we can recreate this. I love. Like, it looks super cute. I love it. Um, if you guys want me to go outside. As for part 2, let's see if this glass is actually blinging out there. But I think it's cute. Okay, so now let me show you guys what I used. I use the lip liner from NYX. The color is new truffle. This is what it looks like. This is from Maybelline, the lipstick. The name of it is born with it. And this is what it looks like. And then I actually use the. My little battery percentage cut me off, but I use the mix, um, butter gloss. Yeah, yeah. Your guitar. You love your guitar. Yeah, he got a guitar, you guys. He loves it. Oh, yeah. So beautiful. I should have bought another one before you guys sell it out. But yeah, if you want a little price friendly. Not saying that she didn't have it price friendly, it's just, I know MAC lipsticks kind of cost an arm and a leg in this economy. Um, but this one was like five. I Believe this was four. I think this was either around five or four dollars too. But yeah, you guys should definitely check it out. Bye.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you have super straight lashes like I do, or if your lashes just fall flat every time you put on mascara, her tips are great. Let me start off by saying that. But I believe mine is better with any situation with hair. What is better is heat when it comes to curls or waves, you know? So just like with normal hair, you curl them and they last longer. You put in hairspray. Um, cause at. At least with me, I have thin hair and not a lot of it. So if I braid my hair and leave it the night over, and I take them out and then I go outside for maybe half an hour, it's straight as a board again. And that's not what we want when we braid our hair and leave it for the night over. And the same when you curl your hair. If the temperature is too cold, your curls are not gonna last. At least not for me in my experience. So at least if that what she did works for you, maybe this will work for thin haired people. I don't know. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove the mascara from this eye, but leave it on here. And then I'm gonna do what I just said. Well, I think. I don't think I said it, but I'm gonna show it so you can see the difference. Because this. These are not curled right now, but I'm gonna remove this, and then we're gonna do it. So this is what my natural lashes look like. There's not a lot going on. Very straight there. Long. Thank God for that. But they're very straight. And for this, you need two things. You need an eyelash curler and a lighter. It's not dangerous, don't worry, if you do it correctly. So what you need to do is do this, but not for too long, because if you do that, you're gonna make it too hot, and it's gonna burn, burn your eyelid. And then you're gonna put it on, and you're gonna do how you normally do it. Like this. I'll leave you there for a little bit. Then you can see they're like that. Wait a little bit for it to cool down. Let it take its shape naturally. Then you're gonna grab your mascara and put it on. I have a. The Colossal Go Extreme Leather Black Perfecto from Maybelline, New York. So we're gonna put it on the normal way. Already? Look, what the hell? I'm gonna let this dry, and I'll be right back. I don't know about you, but I can totally see a difference. It's fuller and longer and not so clumpy. As if versus when you don't curl.",

    "voice_to_text": "Miss Rihanna, please explain this shade. 1. Nobody can convince me that this isn't in retaliation to black people saying that majority of makeup brands are not inclusive enough and do not have shades for black people. There's not a wide enough range because if you have six out of 10 makeup companies that have your shade, why are you complaining about the four that does not? Me too. Like please stop trying to create issues where there's no fucking issue. Because you didn't have to go to fancy beauty, there's someone else that has your shade that has a product that's very similar to what Rihanna is selling. But because black people get on the internet and complain about how the shades are not inclusive enough and how the darkest shade is still too light for somebody that's not considered super dark. Baby girl, this is not an issue and we're not gonna sit here and make it seem like it's an issue. Go find another motherfucking brain because I'm pretty sure when you turn to the left, there's another brand that got your motherfucking shade. When you look to the right, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. If you look to the left, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. If you look in front of you, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. You all do too much. Stop trying to be on the level and complain and have so much issue as Black people! You all don't have our problems! You all don't have our problems! You all don't have our problems!",

    "voice_to_text": "hey Grace um I love all your content I just want to make a stitch with you about tips for uh winged eyeliner for people hooded eyes um you know I have actually a pretty similar eyes I thought I could walk you through some of the tips that I've Learned over time some of them from pros and some of them from YouTube videos um you'll notice that I have this blue line drawn on me I'm gonna try to talk through um some of like the sort of technical stuff I'm a designer for a living so sometimes it's easier for me to talk about things in a really technical way maybe I'll use some language related to the work that you do but what I did is I basically connected the corner of my eye to the tail of my brow in a lot of the sort of western looks people are looking for the wing that lifts their eye like this and so this is the shape that we tend to go for hooded eyes sometimes that line gets a little bit stuck underneath our hood my hoods are actually be behaving pretty well today so that's not really happening that much um so what I actually wanna do is I wanna figure out how to get this line without drawing it so if I made a look um straight to the mirror with my eyes relaxed this is how you always do makeup for hooded eyes this is how other people see you it's not how we used to see ourselves I saw you doing some of this stuff when you were doing your winged eyeliner and that's actually restore your eye shape so we're gonna start off by looking in the mirror straight relaxing her hoods even if we don't like looking at her hoods but that's how people see us and I'm just gonna smudge a little bit on the outside just to kind of get what that anger looks like I'm gonna take this blue on the other side too and just kind of show what happens on the other side when you do that so see how on this side that actually basically creates straight line so like drawing on that outer third gives us like the trajectory for the rest of the wing to go on so that's actually a really good tool as a starting point as you figure out like what your shape needs to be so this is not a liquid eyeliner this is just a smudgy eyeliner my lashes on the lower lids are too long and whenever you use anything liquid or gel it could get gets come to my lashes and it looks horrible so I would I personally recommend using something smudger in the lower lash line um now I have a felt tip i usually end up using a brush with a gel eyeliner but right now I'm gonna use a felt tip one thing you always wanna do with anything is make sure that the bristles are laying in the right direction so I'm spinning it as I'm going to get it to lay down flat um when you're using your liquid that you have that's more likely to display out and I'm sure you know from painting if your brush is splay out you're gonna get little lines everywhere and that's not gonna be the clean look that you're going for so the felt tip sometimes as they get worn in they tend to spray out a bit more but if using a brush or that liquid one definitely you want to make sure that you are you're doing this little trick now what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually instead of using the point of it I actually wanna use the flat side the brush so same thing if we're thinking about painting a wall and use the very tip of a brush to paint the wall it's gonna take forever you're gonna get weird lines so you lay it flat on the side of it to actually get more surface area coverage as your painting so I'm gonna actually lay this flat same thing straight in the mirror relax my eyes now I'm gonna use that line I created with the smudge and actually just use the tip of this or use the side of it to Mark the direction I'm going in so you can see there's a little gap there it's not totally perfect that's fine um I'm gonna go back in and just like fill that in a little bit um so I actually have that line going now another thing that you would said is that you don't like that it swooped over your eyelid one of the things I found since I have very little eyelid space is that I actually don't like to put eyeliner all the way across I like to start in the very middle of my eye so right above my pupil is where I will first lay the tip and I'll just lay this flat as close to lashes as possible uh some people like to put on mascara beforehand cause then the mascara makes like a lip for uh the liner to go on I don't tend to do that I have really thick eyelashes so I already get a lip so I'm just gonna press this I'll drag just a little bit and so there we have basically we did step one smudge step two stamp step three just line the line the lid now this is where we're gonna do the tip you talked about where you don't actually go all the way to the end you actually wanna start about in the middle and this is where you still same thing you wanna keep your eyes relaxed and you want to use the tip to draw in your shape now it's a little bit messy now that we have the shape drawn we can actually go in now we can like distort our eyes tracer down and we can fill this in um and then last what more this actually if you get really close up until like a you know size 10 magnification mirror you're gonna get a lot of really good detail out of this um now what I'm gonna do is this is actually longer than I tend to like it but I'm gonna make it a little bit longer just so you can see um what the next step would be um so I'm actually just gonna take any of this in the very tip I'm gonna just draw that out just a little bit to get a little bit more of a point um and then so that way we're getting the skinny point kind of outside of her hood and then we still get the little swoop that goes on to top of our eyes but we're still getting a pretty small um wing out of it now there's a little bit of messiness underneath there that's totally fine I mean every makeup artist I've seen talk about doing wings says that makeup artists make mistakes too it's part of the process um I'm gonna take just a cotton bud with some micellar water and clean that up um if you actually want a really sharp line you can actually go back in with concealer here I I know how to eat know how to do both of those so whichever one you actually feel I drop the the bud whichever one you feel more confident in the Q tip is gonna leave it a little bit softer on the bottom and um the concealer will make it really sharp so I'm not gonna stretch right now because I don't wanna distort the shape but I'm actually gonna just hold it in place a little bit and kind of twist this as I go back so I'm not dragging the pigment anywhere and I'm actually this is a little bit longer than I like so I'm actually gonna go and clean off a little bit of that tip that I added um just to kind of shorten it up a little bit and there you go and if you already have eyeshadow on and the top is a bit messy what I would recommend is you actually just take a little bit of a matching shadow and put a little shadow on it just smudge it a little bit cause it'll make it look really intentional but you can get the really sharp line underneath um yeah and that's that I hope it was helpful and let me know",

We all need to see our skin tone when looking for new products. #makeup #makeupartist #makeupartists #mua #beauty #makeupexperts ",
    "voice_to_text": "so there's a huge difference between following working artists and influencers who are only working on themselves she is right and it brought up a memory do you guys remember Peroscope like before Instagram had Instagram Live and Facebook Live existed we had Periscope and this is still in the era when like beauty blogs were a thing right I was still a working artist and I got all of my tips and tricks in a way that I was never able to before because they were these incredible working artists from California going live almost daily teaching free technique I would get product recommendations of like hey this is how I cut  Coz I needed to know how to keep my kids small because oh my gosh you know what it's like to lug a giant kid it sucks I need to be efficient I need to be cost effective and it needed to freaking work for my client and Periscope was giving me the opportunity to learn from women who had been doing this for as long as I have and decades longer dude I Learned how to do the perfect blow out I am not a hairstyles but I finally Learned how to do the perfect blow out thanks to someone on fair anyways I'm not big into makeup anymore I know what I like I know what my skin needs but when I need to investigate something further I go looking for a working artist who is about my age and I suggest you do the same I'm going to tag some content creators who are working artists that I really like below in the in the description um but I would also love it if you guys could drop your favourite working artists and aestheticians now please hear me I do not want to discount the importance of the beauty influencer because it is a really big part of how consumers receive information it's important but you are doing yourself a disservice if you are not listening to people with experience okay",

I saw you talking about Isamaya Beauty my current favorite makeup brand despite not owning many of their products because it is behind a heavy price tag like you said I just wanna offer a little bit of perspective because I'm actually a fan of your content I find your content so informational and good quality that it's actually influenced my own purchases in my very in my real life Isamaya French is the makeup artist behind Isamaya Makeup she's worked with everyone the gender is Brianna Bjork she's worked for YSL Christian Louboutin she's currently the beauty curator for Off White I have worked as a professional makeup artist um in a variety of settings these are some of the most lovely and fun and easy to work with eyeshadows that I've ever I've ever used and I think that has directly to do with Isamaya and her legacy of disrupting conventional beauty standard the best of the best in the fashion world celebrities have sought her out specifically because she has this perspective so it is not for the everyday woman or consumer you also say in your video that women are soft beautiful velvet and uh velvet fairy like creatures and they are but I would also like to offer the perspective that if I know anything about women it's that they're incredibly complex they are capable of a multitude of polarities and the emotional intelligence to have the nuance to carry them women want to be soft and beautiful princesses like you said but a lot of them also want to be disruptive they wanna pave their own path they wanna express themselves beyond the conventions of traditional womanhood and it's because of this challenging of the status quo that Isamaya has gained a cult like following in the celebrity fashion and consumer based world because it might not be for everyone but there definitely are women who want to be beautiful fairies and very docile and light but also they wanna express themselves beyond those limitations well I might not personally purchase the phallic looking lipstick bullet brands like Isamaya makeup artist like Isamaya they definitely have a place in the world beauty high impact low effort versatile luxurious and creamy edgy we can really have it all and I think we should as consumers I don't know",

As the alcohol evaporates, the fixative forms a film on the face to lock makeup into place same way Hairspray works. That\u2019s why Hairspray is an affordable dupe for setting sprays. another example would be using Gorilla Snot as a eyeshadow. Just because a product is safe for one area of the body, doesn't mean it's safe for all areas of the body because beyond shampoos, hair products typically are not tested to be eye safe, so just be careful when using some of these dupes.",

Second time I tried, it completely failed. So let's see if the third time is good. Got this eyebrow. You can still see it, but it's okay because we're going to be putting face paint over it, so it doesn't matter that bad or that much. Um, so it's. And there we go. I put less concealer on the side so it's more color corrected, so it looks oranger. But now we're gonna put on the face. My face is blue. Now let's continue with the. And all the candies are drawn. Now I just have to fill them in. Hey. Now I am going to add some mascara. The person in the video had false lashes, but I'm not putting. I don't know really how to put this on. I don't wanna mess up the look we're not experiencing with that today, so. Yeah, there we go. Now we're gonna add some lip gloss. Great. Is the perfect color. Perfect. Okay. And this is the final look. Um, I hope you enjoyed it. Was based off the song Bubblegum Bitch by Marina and the diamonds. Hope you have a great day.",

    "voice_to_text": "I commented on this video thinking that it could just be due to the types of products used like silicone base water base oil based you know sometimes they just don't go together some people are saying as a myth but there are some things that I do think this could be the first one would be make sure that you're washing your face prior to applying your makeup this is me just after I woke up um I have dry to regular skin and last night I just use this lightweight aloe moisturizer and these are the oils you can see how shiny my forehead is these are the oils that my skin is produced um just overnight just throughout throughout the night um there's even more oil that you can't really see around my nose so if I try and go in over top of this with makeup it's just gonna look weird and it's gonna go all over the place so what I do is I just go in with a simple just foaming cleanser um whichever one doesn't really matter just find one that you like this is the fanny cream one I like this one because there's not like any weird bullshit in it so if you have sensitive skin or any kind of allergies it's probably not gonna set you off so I'm gonna use that and I'm gonna show you the difference in my skin so now that I'm looking at it I don't know if there's too much of a visual difference but trust me there is it just feels different my skin just feels cleaner it feels less oily this is what I want I want a nice fresh canvas after washing my face I'm going in with my morning skincare which is literally just SPF you don't wanna over complicate your skincare in the morning because sometimes products just wear really weird under makeup you also wanna save yourself time don't make things longer than they need to be um I'm going in with the Larose Posay SPF 30 this is the anti helos um I've used uh several I've used many different morning sunscreens um I've used the Elf Hello hydration I really like that one Cerave lightweight moisturizer like that one Cetaphil Derma Control like that one as well um yeah minimum SPF 30 is what you want and you should you should be doing this every day if you're not already um the other thing to is moisturizers that are marketed towards like am use are probably gonna be a little bit lighter weight than ones that are just like a general moisturizer like um like for example the Cerave in the tub is a super heavy moisturizer and it's gonna wear terribly under makeup cause it's so heavy so you want you want moisturizers that are gonna you know gonna moisturize but you don't want them to be super thick because then it's just gonna it's gonna slide all over the place so my moisturizer was drying I went ahead and did my eyebrows just cause I don't wanna apply anything on this while it's still kind of like drying into my skin now I'm gonna go in with my face primer I absolutely love the Elf Powergirl Primer it's so good I just use it under my eyes um honestly the safe product cause truthfully I don't really like I don't really care what my cheekbone what like my jaw looks like so I just don't I just don't really go over that part of my face with primer I just do it under my eyes and kind of on the sides of my nose so my primer sets I do my eyeshadow and my lashes now this is the part where I get to do all of my face products um normally I do like to do just concealer and when I do that I'll probably use the Elf Hydrating Camo Concealer but for the purposes of this video I will show you how I do my foundation um I actually really like the Maybelline Superstay Foundation and the reason why I like it I don't normally like full coverage looks is because I've been into concealer as foundation for a while now and I realized a medium to full coverage foundation is probably gonna have a very similar consistency and it's gonna cost a lot less because a tube of concealer like the ones that I get are like point o five fluid ounces for like $6 this is an entire fluid ounce that normally for $15 but I got this on clearance for $3 because nobody uses this color cause I'm pale um so it works out so I'm paying like no money for this basically it's free yeah that's my girl math um so yeah so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I use my my Beauty blender I do put it right on the sponge sorry I know this isn't sanitary don't come for me um it just take a little bit like very little and this is gonna cover like this whole side of my face I do it very sparingly cause I realized too you know you gotta have enough product but you also don't want too much product cause then you get cakey and then I'm gonna just do that much just cause I do get kind of rosy cheeks and I'm not even gonna worry about getting under my eye cause I have concealer for that I don't wanna put too much product in one area do about that much and this is gonna cover the left side of my face and I bring that down over my jawline bring it up by my nose on my temple for my chin and then a little bit for my nose and I love using the Beauty Blender for this I absolutely love these things what you wanna do is wet them first you don't wanna use them dry and I swear like I've never gotten my foundation to look better I I have I used one of these and I never looked back I was like people like no I hate brushes never using a foundation brush ever again okay so there we go that's the foundation part I just do it around pretty much everywhere except under my eyes um because I'm gonna go in with concealer I go in with the hydrating camo concealer I just want a little bit and then I have some problem spots that I'm gonna go over and I do a little bit of my nose a little bit on my chin cause I get some red spots on my chin and now we can blend that out up under my eyes really got into creases in the nose bring it up onto my bridge just like that I did get a little bit on my lashes but that's fine cute okay I add fake freckles you don't have to do that I'm gonna do those now okay freckles done I'm gonna go in and contour I love love love love the Elf Halo Glow Contour and I'm just gonna do that all over my face and use the back of my beauty blender to blend that out and get up onto my forehead and as I do this it's just a lot of quick padding motions no smearing just pat pat pat pat pat and then there and then we'll do on the sides of the nose I just kind of squish it a little bit to kind of get it up in there and then I get down the middle again with the with the light end of the the sponge okay so now that's done last step for complexion if you want sometimes I'll just do powder blush but I'm feeling ambitious feeling funky today so we're gonna do liquid blush this is the Elf Camo Liquid Blush and I just use the side of the sponge to do this if you wanna be really fancy yeah you could probably get a sponge for each color but I don't care that much so we're just using the same one boom okay now last important step important step important step powder I don't I don't argue with me I fucking love this air swung by Conty it's also $5 I factor cost into how good products are if it's like $60 then it's like uh the five dollar powder that lasts me like so long uh yeah that's a good powder okay so take that I just blend it out under my eyes again cause I do have like kind of my under eyes will crease if the products not set so I just go under there fix that again now I'm gonna take the powder puff that it comes with and just get all over this face all over I'm gonna do a cut here so I did a few more things just to finish up my makeup um this is what it looks like done you wanna make sure that everything is powdered you wanna make sure you don't see any shine peeking through from the liquid products and then I will come back probably in another video and show you what it looks like after the entire day",

    "voice_to_text": "hey all my friends um I really wanna talk to you guys about bullying here on TikTok and the beauty community um we are all grown adults and we are all here for the same purpose we are here to create content and do makeup something that we all love and enjoy doing and there is a far too much bullying going on in this community and it really needs to stop I don't understand the purpose behind it I don't know what you have to gain from bullying somebody off of this app and attacking them on a more personal level you know death threats false police reports other kind of stuff like that seriously what do you have to gain from it you know um a lot of us here on this um app in this community are doing this um trying trying to make a living from it we all we want to go somewhere and and become somebody there's a lot of us um that are doing that and then there's some of us small accounts that are just getting started and really trying to um just get their makeup noticed or just make new friends um when I first came on this app I didn't come on this app to be part of the makeup community I just happened into it because doing makeup is something that I love um I've struggled a lot myself being bullied growing up and everything never felt like I fit in anywhere and then I found this what I thought was an amazing community I was welcomed with open arms I grew my talent I done things that I never thought that I would be able to do and it has just been amazing but here these last couple of months it's just gotten really out of hand um brands are being bullied individual makeup artists are being bullied um and it's typically by the same person or the same people if you watch Caroline's video you will see exactly who we are referring to here um and I really just don't understand it like what what is your personal gain what are you going to get from it what's happening is you are showing the world literal world the type of person that you are you are a nasty disgusting person because you wanna bully people what what is that what does that get what does that get for you you know bullying is gonna turn around and it's going to it's gonna come back and it's going to not be good for you the thing that we all need to remember is just to spread positivity be nice to people encourage people if you don't like the makeup that they do just scroll on you are not required to leave hateful messages and mean comments to people if you don't like it don't look at it if you think somebody's talent is better than yours then maybe step outside of your own box and try to do something that you wouldn't normally do because I can guarantee that you are going to be proud of yourself for doing it and the rest of us in this community are going to be proud of you for doing it as well we are all here for support and to spread everyone's talents around all over the place you know and it's not right to harass people because you are jealous that you didn't get something that they did all you have to do is work a little harder you know I never thought that I would be a part of a PR team but I started going outside of my box I started working a little bit harder and I got myself noticed and that's what most people out here have done they have put in the hard work to get themselves noticed and when they get accepted on a PR team it is a huge accomplishment for them whether it's a small PR team for a company that is just coming up or it's the PR team for a multi million dollar company out there it doesn't matter the size of the PR team what it shows is that person's ability to work hard and be part of a team and anybody can do that as long as they put themselves out there but you're not gonna do that by bullying people and putting people down and being hateful this is not the place for it we are grown adults grown adults we are not in high school anymore we are not in middle school anymore bullying is not something that ever ever needs to happen I think those of you that are bullying other people and being hateful really could benefit from digging deep within yourself go find a shadow work journal believe it or not I have one LinkedIn my showcase because I have one and it will really teach you more about yourself and why you do what you do and bullying is not something that you do naturally bullying is something that you do because you are hurt and you are in pain and you are either seeking attention or you're trying to bring other people down to hurt with you and that is not right in any kind of way it's not you know so take a little time work on yourself and find out exactly why you feel the need to bully other people and certainly don't get your family members involved in bullying people either because they are not part of the problem they're not and it's not right it's not right for you guys to go around and doing this kind of stuff to people what do you have to gain from it what do you have from spreading rumors about people or contacting their places of business or the companies they work for and getting them removed what does that benefit you seriously if you can answer me honestly and tell me what you benefit from that sure I'll hear you out you know but it's not necessary and if you are one of the people in this community that is being bullied and harassed and you just don't know what to do my DMs open I would be happy to help you and talk to you if you need a wonderful community to rally behind you we have one there are a lot of amazing content creators on this app that will stand behind you and they will stand up for you and they will help you so if you are struggling with bullying from anybody or harassment from anybody just reach out we will stand up and we will help you and we will try to make this bullying stop in this community this is supposed to be a place of love and support and kindness and it seems here lately that it's just falling to pieces and it sucks it really does but anyways this video is long enough and um hopefully this message gets out to the people that are doing it and maybe it'll be a big wake up call to them that they need to stop they need to stop it's it's just unnecessary but anyways um I love you guys I appreciate you watching um if you want to share the video or whatever I would appreciate it it doesn't matter I don't care just help get the word out um because the bullying needs to stop here on TikTok all right love you guys",

    "voice_to_text": "you need to throw these away immediately if you are using makeup wipes to take off your makeup you need to stop hi miss guuuurrrrllll I also am not a huge fan of makeup wipes but not for the majority of the reasons that you listed because a lot of them are very much wrong my name is Ava Perkins I'm a cosmetic chemist I agree to the fact that makeup wipes don't do the best job of cleansing your skin but the claims that it's going to disrupt your acid mantle or change your pH or um be really stripping because they contain alcohol or they create micro tears on your skin those things are wrong so let's start off with the acid mantle claim which also relates to pH what is the acid mantle the acid mantle is essentially a mixture of sebum and sweat and dead skin cells and water and lactic acid fatty acids all the good things and this basically creates some sort of like protective layer of your skin when you compromise the acid mantle you are basically kind of compromising your skin's barrier as well however I don't agree with the claims that makeup wipes are going to do this because the cleansing ingredients that are in makeup wipes are not harsh really at all the thing with like old fashioned soaps like that were used decades ago is that they had a really high pH and that could definitely do a little bit of damage to your skin but nowadays cleansers not even just makeup wipes but cleansers in general they're formulated to a pH that is very similar to your skin's pH but despite all the pH talk what really matters more is the harshness of the cleansing ingredients that you're using or just the harshness of the formulation itself and how do you know if your cleanser did too much well it's actually that stripped down feeling if your skin feels really tight and squeaky clean after you're done cleansing that is actually not a good sign that means you overdid it it doesn't entirely come from pH it can but like I said a lot of products today are not formulated how they were decades ago with a higher pH like that as far as micro tears I totally thought that was a thing too a few years ago until I was kindly called out by dermatologist that that is not a thing um and I tried to look up you know pictures of micro tears under the microscope like you had said I was not able to find anything to my knowledge I do not think that micro tears exist and as far as alcohol being uh an ingredient in makeup wipes they're not at least the ones that I've seen that are popular if you look at the ingredient list alcohol is not in there at all and so therefore won't be stripping to your skin listen like I said I don't think that makeup wipes are the best option for removing makeup or cleansing your face but sometimes they're the most feasible especially if you're coming back from a late night or if you know it's just too mentally draining to wash your face makeup wipes are much better than nothing but they're also not the best for the environment either so those are things to just consider but continue to live your life if you enjoy using makeup wipes who am I to stop you they're fine to use but just maybe not the best option okay goodbye",

    "voice_to_text": "Her feel like she was so ugly and horrible. This is kind of embarrassing, but whatever. I cried after three of my bridal makeup trials, and I'm gonna tell the story times. One of them, she just didn't listen to me or use the inspo pics that I showed her. I intentionally said matte eye makeup, and she puts all this glitter on my eyes. I told her, I want the tape look like the very, like, cut off line on my eyes, and she, like, smokes it out all over. She just did not put two and two together. Another one. I just did not look good. It. It did not. It did not go well. But this one, the last one, Sheena only, was so, so, so rude. She didn't do a good job. Like, it was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. She had the worst attitude I've ever seen. I walked in, she doesn't even say, hello, how are you? She doesn't try to get to know me. This is a bridal trial. Like, having a good makeup artist on your day is huge because you're spending the mornings with them. Like, their vibe and their energy is huge. She was so rude. Didn't even say hi. She commented on my skin and said I had awful skin when I don't have bad skin. Like, I may have had a few blemishes then, but she's like, I can't fix that. And I'm like, I'm not asking you. To fix my zits, I just ask you to do my makeup and it like literally melted off my face. It didn't last more than 30 minutes. And wedding makeup needs to last. It looked. It looked like a five year old could do it. And my issue is like, if you call yourself a professional makeup artist, you need to be professional first of all, and you need to be like talented. And at these rates that there trying to ask for three, 400 dollars for a trial, I spent, I don't know, probably two grand on makeup trials alone. And I look back at it and I'm like, thankfully I found my person and she's wonderful. Her vibe and energy is great and I'm really excited. But the process of this was just a horrible experience.",

After seeing that I knew I had to try this so Chelsea Thompson tried it I'm a little older than her so I have some mature under eyes but then she tried it on her mom who was pushing 60 and I'm like okay that's it I had my little chubby stick let's see if my concealer looks as good as theirs did I do have this little chubby stick it's not the lip balm I mean it can be used universally however you want to but it's a little bit thicker wider he just put it right underneath the eyes now here's the true test I've used an eye oil underneath my eyes before to prevent creasing with concealer and I liked it and it looked very bright and hydrated however with my mascara it would kind of smudge a little bit down here because it was so hydrated so I put it underneath the eyes this is no beauty filter or anything just to see kind of what I'm working with and also I'm gonna use my finger for this he said to put it anywhere you would normally crease and I do have nasal avial folds that will have makeup settle in over time if I don't truly focus in that area so that's where I'm going here I'm going like a little bit down my nose and then into those folds then I will apply apply my concealer you're up close and personal okay concealer I'm using hourglass vatness hourglass Vanish Concealer my tone or shade is sepia here here and carve out the cheeks just slightly and then I'm gonna use the BK Beauty Concealer Brush to blend that out it is blending out really well so there's no like sticky tackiness which I was thinking it would like stick and make it hard to blend this is blended out but not set yet I'm gonna use my Givenchy Prism Libre powder and Voila Rose and I use my beauty blender to try and keep that hydration going instead of a dry powder puff I use a damp beauty blender when you have mature skin it's all about keeping your skin hydrated and that's what's gonna make it look so glowy dewy dewy creaseless I can check it back in and see how it's wearing at the end of the day but set it's looking very pretty and hydrated I don't notice any creasing thus far makeup is done and the Aquaphor is on my under eyes and nasal labial folds so we're gonna see how this wears over time but it could be a staple so thank you Chelsea Thompson for posting moment of truth where test for this Aquaphor under my eyes it's been a full day of work I think it looks more hydrated than it usually does I have crow's feet so I have lines for them to settle into I think it wears pretty good all day",

    "voice_to_text": "So I posted that video recently, and that was me using how I did my old makeup with all my old product. But I'm gonna use my old products, how I would use that makeup now if it really came down to it. Cause a lot of people are hating on me, saying how I wasn't trying, but that was how I did my old makeup. So now I'm gonna show you how I would do using these old products, doing my makeup. Let me go take off my current makeup. I'll be right back. I'm obviously gonna use the exact same steps, but I'll be more reasonable. Just. I don't like smoothies. I feel like this collects so much bacteria. And I'm using the exact same old products I use. Like, if I'm missing a step, it's because I didn't use it back then. So I'm using all my old makeup. So I'll use a brush this time, cause I'm gonna try to make this look new as possible. It's not horrible, it's just a little too light for me. You actually just could not make me like this. But we'll try it out and I'll see what y'all are. What y'all are defending glossy A for. So now I use a brush, which I think back then I didn't use a brush. I can use the bleed blender for literally everything. But, you know, we're trying, and I'm gonna try to make this look good as possible. It's Not like, horrible. It just. It either disappears or gets really patchy. Like, does it look like I just bronzed my face? This is just pains me cause I love the Rare Beauty blush, but this shade, I mean, it's a very teeny, tiny bit. See how far? Like, it wants a little bit more than that. And I wasn't saying necessarily the products was what my issue was. It was fact of how I used to do my old me. The creaminess of this concealer is honestly amazing. Like, oh my god, it's so creamy. It's just too yellow for me, and it's not very covering. But seriously, let me know what y'all think so far. Let's see if this concealer may be good. Like, see, it just doesn't cover up that much. And the Sheglam highlighter, which I literally used this for such a long time. There's just something about liquid highlighters in that container just did not work right with me. But it is really pretty. And this isn't horrible, but if I had the option to use my newer makeup, I would obviously use that. Just my makeup wasn't really fulfilled back then. Like, you can tell I'm already missing like 10,000 steps. My new makeup is a lot more, like, better, but this mascara is just. It's just like, this is using my old products, and if I try to my makeup, this is what it would look if I used all the old products. But now, that old video was literally me trying how I did my old makeup with my old products. I'm actually not that big of a hater on this. I actually don't think this looks bad. Here's the final look. Oh, I also forgot lipstick, but you get the point.",

All of the product out of the container as much as is possible with packaging these days. Essentially, you're getting every drop, and in this economy, it's what you need. So good job, Elf.

Now,   I   might   have   to   respectfully   disagree   with   that   statement   Now I know that this looks like I bought it from a costume shop   know   that   this   looks   like   I   bought   it   from   a   costume   shop and it hooks on over my ears,   it   hooks   on   over   my   ears but it is actually the real thing.   it   is   actually   the   real   thing This is what I look like naturally   is   what   I   look   like   naturally if I don't do anything to my face.   I   don't   do   anything   to   my   face I get this.   get   this And it's the same for pretty much every single man out there.   it's   the   same   for   pretty   much   every   single   man   out   there Beards are not makeup. Beards are not artificial.   are   not   makeup   Beards   are   not   artificial They are what grows out of your face.   are   what   grows   out   of   your   face Now, I definitely agree with the idea that how you style a beard   I   definitely   agree   with   the   idea   that   how   you   style   a   beard or how you maintain a beard   how   you   maintain   a   beard is the difference between looking good and looking terrible.   the   difference   between   looking   good   and   looking   terrible And I also understand that some people think beards look great   I   also   understand   that   some   people   think   beards   look   great and some people really don't like beards at all.   some   people   really   don't   like   beards   at   all And their opinion of a man's looks will be dependent on that.   their   opinion   of   a   man's   looks   will   be   dependent   on   that So, yeah,   yeah I don't think this is makeup.   don't   think   this   is   makeup This is, this is as nature intended makeup would be.   is   this   is   as   nature   intended   makeup   would   be If I dyed it, if I trimmed it,   I   dyed   it   if   I   trimmed   it if I shaked it in some way or if I shaved it off.   I   shaked   it   in   some   way   or   if   I   shaved   it   off That's me doing something to change what I normally look like   me   doing   something   to   change   what   I   normally   look   like into an appearance that some people would find more attractive.   an   appearance   that   some   people   would   find   more   attractive But at the end of the day,   at   the   end   of   the   day if you think you look better with a beard,   you   think   you   look   better   with   a   beard grow the beard. You think you look better without the beard,   the   beard   You   think   you   look   better   without   the   beard shave It off. It's entirely up to you.   It   off   It's   entirely   up   to   you",

Everyone has hair on their face. Like, isn't that not normal?

Like, she's doing her makeup. You're talking about the hair on her face. But you, too, you have hair on your face. Matter of fact, you have a lot of it. Make a TikTok and let's talk about that. Hmm.

    "voice_to_text": "hi. I saw you went to prom, love that for you, you look like you had a great time and you looked great. um if you are still wanting to like learn how to work with your hooded eyelids, I would like to offer some tips as someone who thought for the longest time they had hooded eyelids, um but I've also done makeup on a lot of my friends who happen to have hooded eyelids as well. um also feel free to ignore this, do whatever you like. so one, you're gonna give yourself a higher crease. the easiest way that I find to do this is I'll put a dot of primer kinda in the center of my lid about like right here and I'll look up, like just roll my eyes up to the ceiling, and then when I look back in the mirror straight ahead, um wherever that dot goes, like however far it's reached, I make sure to draw whatever I'm trying to show over it, so that will be my new crease area. two,  I try to keep my eyeliner thinner. since you gave yourself more space by creating that fake crease, you don't wanna take it away by giving yourself a thicker liner, unless that's whatever look you're going for, like please do whatever you feel. I don't do this every every time I do makeup. but having a thinner liner again, not only doesn't minimize the space you just given yourself, but it also elongates the eye more. and three, if I'm wearing lashes I will either put my lash strip farther out towards the outer part of my eye rather than inner, or I'll try to get lashes that gradiate from smallest to large on the outside.  that way, again, I'm not closing off the inner part of my eye especially, but also it makes the eye look longer and it keeps it wider, and it helps build a shape basically. like I said, I don't do these all the time, I don't expect you to do those all the time, do whatever you feel and enjoy yourself cause it's your face, it's your makeup, do however you want, um but these are just tips again, like I said that have helped me especially when I am doing makeup um for people who happen to have hooded eyes.  and yeah. hope you have a good night.",

Hygiene, skincare, hair care for African American women should be, you know, taught more. Luckily, I grew up during a time where, like, to. It was. So it was coming up on 2,016. Around that time, YouTube was just starting to get popping. And I remember I used to come home from school because I wanted to know how to do makeup really, really, really bad. And I came from a home where nobody really wore makeup. Like, my grandmother literally was the only person who had makeup in the house. And honey, when I tell you it was an Avon palette, baby, she used to sweep, sweep, sweep her shit. Is that. That was her makeup, honey, that was. She'll this makeup. And I will see these girls with like, full beat down and lipstick and the brows and I was like, oh my gosh, I want that. So I used to come home from school every day for hours, and I used to sit in front of the computer and I used to watch Alia Jay Star Milan, baby, time to infamous. Like, I used to sit and I used to like, purposely search on YouTube, um, foundations for medium dark skin girls or contour tools just so I can, you know, learn it, cause I didn't have anybody that was that Taught me, like, still to this day, the skills that I Learned back then, I still use them today. And every time I do my makeup, people, oh, my god, who did your face? Who did your face? I did my face. So I appreciate them. They help me so much, like, with makeup, skincare, like, what I needed to buy. Cause I mean, I didn't grow up in a house where people did makeup like that. Like, honestly, for a large part of my life, I would have to say I was a tomboy, so I was. I wanna be girly and. And, baby, I still have palettes. I have so many fucking brushes, so many fucking palettes. And contour palettes, the highlighter palettes, baby, I was a buying shopping fool for that shit. But I. Those girls really don't understand how much they impacted our lives. Like, y'all raised us and y'all ain't even know it.",

    "voice_to_text": "To be the next big trend, my team are calling it complexion no eye. Let's get to it. SPF to my skin. Do not skip this because SPF is so important. Oh, my God. Oh, it just popped everywhere. It's literally all over me, guys. Very, very clumsy going ahead with this prep and perfect primer from Primark. It's quite moisturising, very soft on my skin. It's supposed to be like pop and tube, like a strobe cream Foundation. I'm gonna be using the H&B cosmetic. Little bit more warm on my skin and I like to wear it, especially during the summer. Blends so beautifully. Next, I'm going to bronze up my skin a little bit and contour using the made by Mitchell cupcake. This is actually the deeper shade. The reason I got the deeper shade is because I was obsessed with the blusher. Do you think that I should have got the medium as well? But I still make. It works. Just trust the process. Next, I'm gonna use these two concealers. This one's from Primark, and I really, really like it as an everyday concealer. It is so good. I'm just gonna show you guys how application is. It really, really works well with my skin. I'm also gonna use the H&B Cosmetics concealer just to kinda brighten it little bit. Now that's set for a little bit. I'm gonna use a beauty blender just to kinda blend that out. Just look at how amazing the Coverage is. I love it. For blush, I'm gonna be using the curve case. Again, look how stunning these blush colours are. I love the way it just melts into my skin. It's very pigmented, as you can tell. But again, just trust the process. Once it all comes together, I promise you, it's just gonna look. As you can see, it's not very blended. So I again, is just going lightly with my beauty blender and out the edge just so it's nice and smooth before we set it with powder. Next, I'm gonna set my face with the Huda Beauty Radiant Powder. Of course, my Fenty Bronzer to bronze my face a little bit more. Also use my NARS blush. This is the final look. I am super pleased with the way it's turned. This is something I've never done before and it will most definitely not be the last.",

    "voice_to_text": "Chanel has donated $4 million to southern Israel and specifically the IDF on top of the billions of dollars that have been given by the American government to support the genocide of Palestinian people the reason that I'm really disappointed by Darcy's choice to endorse the Chanel bag publicly is because she represents a specific population that holds Korean skincare beauty accountable for their mistreatment of people of color abroad so I know that she knows about the issue of the genocide in Palestine and yet it doesn't seem like she cares her videos garner millions and millions of views tons of followers and she currently sits at just over a million followers sorry a little under a million five I think she could spare one video talking about the Palestinian people and the families in Gaza specifically for something like this so for that reason she is celebrity No. 8 that I think that you should block for celebrity blockout or influencer Blockout 2024 furthermore if you'd like to support a family in Palestine I do have a family that I'm sponsoring that's Lara and the Abdalla family I posted multiple videos about that here's a screenshot of what's they're going through right now and if you wanna donate there's a \ud83d\udd17in my\ud83d\udd17\ud83c\udf32 and if you can't then I suggest that you follow like and share all of their posts they only have made \u20ac80 in a 24 hour span the other night I don't know how much they made since then but I know that they're very far away from their goal so do anything you can help thank you",

And then I saw Michaela unboxed her Birkin, and I remember thinking, hmm, they gave her a Birkin, gave Darcy a Chanel. And then I thought, well, maybe Darcy elected to. Maybe that's what's happening. But then I was like, well, wow, that's very interesting. And I must say that the only reason I purchased tear tear is because of miss Darcy. Um, she put it on her web page, and she talked about it being a great foundation, that they needed to expand the shade line. They did. And the shade line some somewhat. The first shade I purchased, it wasn't right for me. It was too dark. The second shade that I purchased, which was 40 Cinnamon, did work for me. Um, but I think that they could have did a little bit better, uh, with the equity and the handbags. They really should have sent them both the same handbags. And if it was a matter of Miss Darcy choosing the bag that she chose or that she got, then i'mma tell Miss Darcy, next time, i'mma need you to go for the gusto. Don't sell yourself short. Let them say no. Because Michaela could have just chosen the bag that she wants. She could have simply said, I want a Birkin. And that's What? She got no hate towards Michaela because I like Michaela. Yes, she photoshopped. We all photoshop, honey. I have the beauty filter on quite often, but. Miss Darcy, next time, I'm gonna need you to ask for the gold, baby. Ask for the gold. And tar, tar. Do better. Do better. She shouldn't have had to ask. You should have extended a Birkin to both of those beautiful young ladies. Until next time. Peace out. It just add tear. Tear. I purchase your foundation. I only have about 200 followers. Um, but, you know, I'll be down for a gift. Um, just hit me up. I'll take a Birkin. I'll take the Chanel. You know, I'm not picky. I did post video. Does that count? I actually purchased two items from. Does that count? I didn't, you know, help a sister out.",

    "voice_to_text": "About this 27 year old woman that dropped all of her children off to CPS a week before mother. Okay, I'm gonna give my opinion about this whole story. If you haven't already heard about it, go ahead and watch the whole first video. This is coming from a mom who's had a child at a very, very young age. And also, I had a mother who did not raise me, and my grandmother raised me. But we are gonna start off with this whole situation. Is this horrible? Those poor kids are suffering no matter what. Like, I could not imagine already going through a horrible and stressful situation, uh, with your mother dropping off at CPS, but then having it also go viral on TikTok. And it's gonna be like, they're gonna grow up and they're gonna see all this, and already they're probably seeing so much about it. So I know she's mentally unfit, and she just pretty much just had a mental breakdown over all this. But still, I don't think she'll realize she did the right thing in a way. But also, if she were to, like, fix up her life and try and get her kids back, it is gonna be very hard. Now, I'm not saying she shouldn't get her kids back. I just think it's gonna take too much time to rebuild her relationship with her children and earn their trust back. Because when you still think about it, what she did, She could have done privately. She could have not done all those lives and all those videos. And then maybe I would see more potential of her possibly getting her children back. But right now or anytime soon, I don't think she should. It's still better though that she picked to drop them off, because I could imagine possibly what their home life was going to be like if she already was that overwhelmed, that mentally stressed out, and she just couldn't handle anything anymore. And then they just feel like probably they're not wanted. Like it was it. And then like, who knows how much longer it would have just taken for CPS to come into the situation anyways.",

And he was like, I genuinely cannot tell when she was wearing makeup and when she wasn't. And he said that sometimes she would just come downstairs and he'd be like, oh my god, you look so beautiful today. And she's like, thanks, I'm wearing makeup. And he'd be like, oh. And then when they broke up, this girl goes and gets a nose job. Literally a whole ass nose job. And then he ran into her and was like, something's different about her, but I couldn't figure it out. He genuinely, like, she had face altering surgery to completely change her nose, and he didn't know what was different about her. So I don't know.

We then have real deal, which is more of a plum pink. And then we have got cutie pie, which I'm actually gonna put on my face cause I love the look of this. Let me know in the comments what shade of blush you like. Do you prefer a pink? Do you prefer a red? A peach? These blushes honestly blend like a dream. Just wait till you see them on. Oh. Oh, my.

Most of the time if you give them your phone number or your email address you can get a discount code. I do sometimes try to look for influencers with codes that work with the brand. I like to do that as well. You're going to save the most money when you buy directly from a brand's website. Sephora just does not offer affordable makeup in my opinion.",

Whoever started this whole water based water based silicone silicone is like the biggest marketing scheme that's currently happening in like the makeup community. Number one. Most of your products have both water and silicone in it anyways, so if it can't mix on your face, why can't it mix in the product and be okay? Also, if you're moisturizing or using sunscreen, it's probably water based too, not silicone based. So why can you put silicone primer and foundation on that and it doesn't peel? Why does it only matter for the primer and the foundation if you find something spilling on your face? There could be a million different reasons why, but I'll usually take all my makeup off and exfoliate my face and then reapply my skincare and it'll end up looking fine for the most part. I use water based primer and silicone in this and foundation and it looks good. So moral of the story just don't believe everything you see on TikTok and don't fall into schemes where now you feel like you have to label all of your different products or go out and buy different one.",

As someone who has big lips, I never thought it gave the illusion of bigger lips, but it does give the illusion of hyperpigmentation around the mouth. Maybe it's just me, because I'm a person of color, and lots of people of color who do their makeup have to color correct around their mouths to get rid of the natural hyperpigmentation. But to me, when you put contour or, like, a liquid bronzer around your mouth to give the lips the illusion of being fuller, it just looks like a 5 o'clock shadow or it just looks like the hyperpigmentation that POC people have to conceal when they do their makeup.",

Okay, I just seen this video and I had to stitch it immediately because I've literally been having the same problem finding the most, like, prettiest and blendable, like, black eyeshadow because my favorite eyeshadow is from a palette called Nightingale from pretty vulgar, and these hoes decided to just continue it, which I'm very upset by. Anyway, um, they discontinued this, and I remember I loved it so much. Like, it's pretty well used, I went ahead and depotted it. But this is clearly like, my favorite black eyeshadow, like, ever, and is because, like, it's more grayer. Like, it gives you, like, that black pigment, that blackness that just love. And like, I feel like nobody's been able, like, make a black like this. Like, at least that is blendable, cause as you can see, like, it has, like, little faint, like, sparkly bits in it that make it, like, blendable. But I can't find any other black like this that's, like, actually, like, truly black, you know, like, I don't know. Anyways, pretty vulgar, please bring back the Angel palette. I love that palette. I literally depoted it cause, like, my mirror broke in the palette, so I had to depart the rest of my shades. Please bring back",

What, did everybody know this and I didn't know this because I literally just found out from this video. Thank you to the creator. What you're supposed to throw. Okay, I'm gonna expose. Expose myself right now because I used to wear makeup a lot, and then I went without wearing makeup for years and years, and now I'm slowly starting to get back into it. But I did not know that you're supposed to throw the stuff out from before. Um, so everything that I have is pretty old. A lot of the stuff I have is old. And this is really bad, considering I just watched this video, and she's throwing stuff out every few months, um, to a year. A year? Um. You know how people have depression rooms? I think I have depression. Makeup, makeup collection. Because the way I've been hoarding these products, just thinking it was normal. Um, and my skin is terrible. You probably can't tell, except for this. Um, it's tech. And this is probably why. This. This explains it. Okay. I've had this for probably eight years. This also probably eight years. There's a fucking ant on me. This probably nine years. Nine years. Years. Not months. Years. This prop maybe the same. Not maybe. This one's probably a little less. This probably like five years. This one Also probably like five year. This is all. This is all random stuff. Um, yeah. This I know I've had for 10 years. I used this in high school. Anywhere near high school. This also probably like 10 years, and I use the stuff. Oh, my god. Okay. This I've probably had for, like, 13 years. I remember going to buy this in high school or junior high, one of those, and. Oh, my god, this is terrible. Do you see this? That's. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Urban Decay. Like, that is. That is terrible. I'm clearly a dirty makeup girl. I'm sure you can tell that already, but this. That is even bad for me. That is just. That is horrible. Um, this I've definitely had for, like, 13, 14 years. Terrible. This incomplete Inglot palette. I love Inglot, but I've. I know I went to buy this in my first year of college, as. That was 2014. That was 2014, when Obama was president. This is when I bought this is that. I never even finished it. Oh, my god. This is terrible. This is definitely the worst. Um, question is, will I throw it out? Will I change based on this information? Um, that's a different story. But I'm just glad to know if you have recommendations for what I should buy from the drugstore, because I am not gonna. About to buy. I'm not. I'm not buying a bunch of expensive stuff. You have any recommendations, let me know, because that is awful. That is terrible.",

Gargle your face, goofy goober power bottom. Still have a platform. You not only put on the darkest shade of a makeup company's foundation that looks like black face paint and did blackface, but you then tried to compare to Lupita Nyong'o. What is wrong with you? Money from the near video must be running on the last dime, because every time I see you on my for you page, you continue to bring up black people. Why? Last time I saw you on my for you page, you brought up black people, and I quote saying, blacks hate Taylor Swift so much. They have so much against her. I don't know that blase, blase lock that up and shut that down, because I know plenty of black people who listen to Taylor Swift's music. And actually, like, now you're on here doing blackface and slandering a black queen's name who can never be compared to the likelihood of your bottom of the barrel. You're colorist, racist, and you have a deep hatred towards black people that I don't know where it rooted from, but you need to do the hokey pokey and turn that shit around, cause we don't want it. Hopefully this can finally be the downfall of Kevin Leonardo, because I plan to slap something on the grill when I find that out. I'm not Playing",

All right, I've gotten so much backlash about this video, and I feel like there's a lot of people who don't know where it coming from. So let me just clear this up. Whenever I'm talking about no foundation makeup, right? I made that video at a point where I was talking about the people who smear concealer all over their face, and I mean, all the way up here, down here, down here, down here to here, and then smear a darker, shaded concealer all around their face and then call that contour. Um, I don't like that. I don't like that, personally. It's always been uncomfortable. It's a makeup pick of mine I don't like. And that's a personal opinion. Get it? Personal opinion. And I definitely just see the way kind of looks on other people. And y'all can say that it looks good, but again, when I'm seeing y'all say it looks good, I'm seeing on through a screen with retouch on real life. I don't know about that, sweetheart. Either way, if you make it look good, you make it look good. If you want to do it, you can do it. I'm not here to control you. I'm not here to boss you around. Do whatever you want to make. But there's something that's really getting on my nerves. The fact that some of you are coming and saying that, well, you Just don't have clear skin, so you can't do it. That's why you're mad. That's such a dumb way to think. Like, I want you want to hear exactly what you're saying. I want you to go back, look at your comment, and read it out loud and imagine saying that to somebody. You have hyperpigmentation. You're a black dot spotted hyperpigmentation acting face, bitch. And that's why you can't do. That's why you mad. That's exactly what y'all sound like. That's exactly what y'all sound like. So please spare me the whole, oh, but it looks good. What's that clicking such as? The funniest part, y'all will stitch me, trying to show me up, and I'm not showing up. You know, I'm saying, look, I'm sometimes just not, you know, some of the stitches have supported my hypothesis, some of the stitches have rejected my hypothesis. You know, I'm talking like a scientist, cause I need you to understand this. Like, it. It doesn't matter. It doesn't prove one thing or the other. It just says like, hey, this works for some people. This. This doesn't work for some people. You know, if you still disagree with me, by all means, do so. Right? Let's just all agree to disagree. Thank",

I just sprayed it on the back of my hand and you can see that it. It's. It's giving sun spots, but you can see that it's making freckles. I'm not gonna do this on my face cause I have a photo shoot. But it does work if you like this vibe. I added more. Honestly, I wouldn't want that on my face. But I will try it later in another video of it on my face. Have you guys tried this?

Hi Noelani from The Face Australia that was me 10 years ago in that last clip am I still modelling? This challenge was not like the America's Next Top Model where you can actually get a proper photoshoot and they pick the strongest this was one shot only so because of that one shot that aired I was essentially cancelled from the entire Australian fashion industry and I'm still cancelled I lost my agency I got dropped, all my potential work that I had overseas was dropped as well I lost our relationships with designers photographers was unable to do fashion weeks and I was unable to do editorials and even film work not many people know that there was another challenge which was the runway challenge I won that, it didn't air but that one shot did and unfortunately I'm still cancelled from the industry",

Gotta start with SPF before I do anything else. Also, how cute do these faux freckles look? I was so scared at first, but they actually look okay. We're going in strong with the by Ellie brow shape to do my brows. Her brows are quite full and dark. So we're gonna go in with the 3 in 1 from Primark, and we're gonna go in with this end. Now let's carve out those bad boys with the Pete Louise eye base, cause I'm gonna do some eyeshadow, too, just because I am not a typical hot girl, which I keep saying, but I'm not. Let's be honest, I don't see any reason why I can't look that good, because I am beautiful in my own way, you know? I was gonna use this to do that really neutral, gorgeous smoky eye. I'm gonna go with cool tones, actually, because I don't think the tones in that video are particularly warm other than possibly on her skin where her cheeks are. So this is gonna look so fire. Okay. So I don't think it's very cut. Crazy vibes. So I'm gonna go in with this gorgeous pink shimmer from the CRT palette just to give it a little bit of a glimmer in the corners. And then lastly adding A little bit of this pink heart highlighter from the Anastasia Beverly Hills Palette just here and added a soft brown wing cause I prefer the brown to the black. Base time and a bit of Coco Gold. I'm going over this today. Now, I have tested this foundation, but I've not actually fully used it yet, so it will be interesting to see what it was like. And don't worry, it is gonna match my neck by the end, I promise. Curve case mixed with the glow shine and I'm gonna put a little bit more glow shine over the top. I've seen people using this as all sorts bronzers, primers, neck thingies, so let's see if it works on top of makeup too. Yeah, it's giving a really nice shine over the top. She has the most gorgeous pinky blush, so I'm gonna go in with strawberry cream from the made by Mitchell Curve case and I'm gonna add something to it. I'm also literally placing that like right up to my nose and around you know it. It's the Beauty Crop Glow Milk Blush. And you do not need a lot of this. That was less than one pump. Look at that brighten the under eyes. Pink powder time has to be doll Beauty Blush. Bring it back to life. And done! I can relate to desperation. That's the only song that's been in my head for days and now.",

It should say secret scoop PR waitlist. And listen, I know I said everyone can get PR. And by everyone, I meant like, everyone ranging from zero followers to however many. So not everyone that fills out this form will get PR, but I will try to go for the smaller influencers because I know what it's like, and I know what it's like to be desperate for PR. And also, you guys don't even know what's gonna be in these mystery scoops. As much as I would love to give everybody PR, cause I wish I could, I really do. It's just this also is a business, and I have to make money somehow from it. And filling out this Google form will make it so much easier for me to pick the five first people. But yeah, obviously I'm really excited for this, but I'm also really nervous about it, cause I don't want people to get angry with me for not sending them PR. I just want you guys to be happy. I'm sorry. Follow the link in my bio. Thank you. Mwah, mwah.",

    "voice_to_text": "She's been going to all these events without wearing makeups. And have stylist. As women, we are taught our whole lives that your beauty is your currency. It's really all that you are. Worth trying to be so perfect. Just let go. It's not necessary, it's not attainable. To be the prettiest woman in the room, you all need to be like Pamela Anderson right now. I respectfully disagree. To me, makeup, which I love, is a way to enhance natural beauty and a way to express the personality of the day. Because there are days when my personality manifests stronger and days where it communicates somewhat softer. There are days when I feel like a warrior. There are days where I feel like a diplomat, like an artist, like a storyteller. That also reflects in my makeup. The only times when I didn't wear makeup lately, or lately, I mean, in the last 10 years, were, um, during the pandemic and when I was depressed. And nobody forced me to do it, for instance, at work. But when I do, I can see their eyes lit up. They pay more attention to what I say. So is it really freely to give up on makeup? Or in a way, isn't it empowering by using the tools that they recognize and by them in the society? As for Pam, I don't know what her reasons are. That thing with being the prettiest girl in the room, of course, It's absurd to think you're the prettiest girl in the room. It's not about competing. She was definitely the most noticeable, though, right? Going without makeup at public events, like when. When the code is black tie and long dress, and you go in pjs, you're the most. You'll be seen. You're the most noticeable. What if that was intentional? I mean, all the respect for everyone's choices, but, you know, if she did wear makeup at those events, she would have gotten a quarter of the attention that she got. Think about that. For the rest, everybody does how everybody feels. I, for one, love makeup. I do. It's wonderful to feel so good in your skin that you don't need it. But it's nice, isn't it? It's nice to enhance what you have. Beautiful. The symmetry of your face. By the way, makeup, you know, it has thousands of years of history. And ancient societies worried. The Egyptians, men worried at the court of France, the kings of France. It has many functions. It's not just pressure on women. Come on.",

I don't think that this was calculated at all but 2. even if it was I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0it's\u00a0weird\u00a0to\u00a0saythat\u00a0creators\u00a0calling\u00a0themout\u00a0for\u00a0it\u00a0um to say that consumers calling them out for it are like gullible or falling for it and you didn't say that but to say that like oh you need to know better and know that this is intentional and\u00a0they're\u00a0doing\u00a0thisfor\u00a0attention doesn't make it where it's on the consumer to then just ignore it I think it's still very important to call out behaviour like this especially if you think that they're doing it intentionally one of your key points is that there's just no way that this wasn't done intentionally because\u00a0there's\u00a0somany\u00a0meetings\u00a0and\u00a0somany\u00a0touch\u00a0points where they test out a product 1. this product was not tested on a human like this particular shade she\u00a0made\u00a0a\u00a0video\u00a0withit\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0bottle saying\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0hadn't\u00a0found\u00a0anyone\u00a0that\u00a0matched\u00a0the\u00a0shade so it wasn't tested on a human 2. I just feel like um which someone in the comments said these meetings are not made up of diverse people like I'm not sure why you think that there was someone in the room that was like oh yeah this this\u00a0is\u00a0definitely\u00a0racist\u00a0andthis\u00a0is\u00a0definitely\u00a0going\u00a0toget\u00a0us\u00a0attention this is perfect I think that she was rushed I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0she\u00a0doesn'thave\u00a0the\u00a0resources and I think that she doesn't have the knowledge I\u00a0feel\u00a0like\u00a0you're\u00a0forgetting\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0key\u00a0point\u00a0of\u00a0racismis\u00a0ignorance like I think when you start learning about racism and doing anti racism work it is easier to see these things but at the end of the day most people don't care to educate themselves so she just said oh I need to come out with a more diverse shade range let's make something that's darker than all of these other companies have come out with which\u00a0she\u00a0comparesher\u00a0swatch her black face paint to\u00a0Fenty\u00a0Beauty\u00a0andstuff\u00a0like\u00a0that she thought she was better because she went darker she wasn't actually trying to cater to a human being she's\u00a0trying\u00a0to\u00a0cater\u00a0to\u00a0theidea\u00a0of\u00a0diversity and when you're going based off of that ignorance you're\u00a0not\u00a0actually\u00a0doingit\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0care and so you're not actually going to do the research to realize that you're doing something wrong and\u00a0you\u00a0use\u00a0Pepsias\u00a0an\u00a0example the Pepsi commercial again it was not calculated controversy did it make their name go viral yes but again there were people in the room when you're out of touch these marketing executives CEOs older white men when you're out of touch with actual social issues you think on a very surface level the solutions to it are you know hand a cop of Pepsi and we all dance around and celebrate and police brutality is solved it's very surface level and pandering you know so I'm not sure why you think that they're so educated they knew that and there are people arguing in several comments in golloria's comments about that they do think that people that dark exist so I'm not sure why you think it is just this known fact that no one is black actually black and no one um there's no human walking around that dark because there are plenty of people arguing that there are humans that are that dark and I'm really glad that you know that I know that um other\u00a0beauty\u00a0influencersknow\u00a0that but\u00a0I-\u00a0I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0you're\u00a0again like\u00a0I\u00a0said\u00a0just\u00a0forgetting\u00a0the\u00a0ignorance\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0largepart\u00a0of\u00a0racism that\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0do\u00a0peoplenot\u00a0know but\u00a0they\u00a0don't\u00a0care\u00a0toknow\u00a0better and then you say that you feel like it's weird that people are asking you for your opinion that there are beauty influencers that are more educated and that you wish that they were asked to speak on it and I'm just wondering if you saw Javon Ford's video if you saw golloria's video I've seen a lot of beauty influencers calling them out and\u00a0making\u00a0very\u00a0goodkey\u00a0points um I mean the whole reason that we know that black was the only pigment used in the shade is because Javon went into the ingredients list so I just feel like it's weird to think that like you're the only one who has been asked to do this and I wish you had done some more research on that cause you also would have seen that golloria was involved in calling them out the first time for their lack of diversity in the shade ranges and\u00a0so\u00a0then\u00a0you\u00a0kindasay\u00a0that people like golloria and Sean is another creator I follow who\u00a0did\u00a0buy\u00a0the\u00a0foundationto\u00a0prove\u00a0to\u00a0people\u00a0justhow\u00a0black\u00a0it\u00a0is um you kind of say that like this is the point to garner sales I think a few hundred people buying the foundation to show that it is tar in a bottle is not going to translate to long term success it's not going to translate to returning customers and it's ultimately going to hurt the brand I wouldn't be surprised if Ulta did pull out if they were banned from Ulta at this point so I don't think that it is a good business decision to put out something that NBC puts in their headline as 'Tar in a bottle' quoting golloria that's not gonna be a good look I don't wanna buy something that's referred to as tar in a bottle so just because you might have name recognition does not translate to sales yeah I just really wanna hammer home the point of this whole calculated controversy thing I feel like always comes up when someone is being called out for something when something is going viral a lot of people call it clout chasing clickbaiting whatever it is I think that there are instances of that you know I don't I'm\u00a0not\u00a0too\u00a0familiar\u00a0withMikayla\u00a0Nogueria but I did see that video where she put on false lashes and apparently she came out later and said that she did that on purpose I mean first of all I think that you're giving people too much credit that like of course if I saw a bunch of people calling me out and saying that I was doing some on purpose I'd be like yeah gotcha like a lot of people do that and she may not have done it intentionally but I think that is at least an example of something that we can really say this is calculated controversy this is to drive attention and that's it because if you're doing calculated controversy where you're actually just doing racism it's still just racism and you still should be called out for it I don't think that people are falling for it by pointing out that no one is that black that\u00a0they\u00a0only\u00a0used\u00a0a\u00a0black\u00a0pigment\u00a0and\u00a0that\u00a0that's\u00a0nothow\u00a0makeup\u00a0is\u00a0made I think that that proves if anything that she has no clue how makeup is made how to actually test foundations because again like I said how do you fully go through the process and bottle something without finding a single human to match I don't think it's cause it was done intentionally I think it's cause it was done out of ignorance and it's interesting because you use her color changing blush as a point that she does know a lot about makeup and chemistry but again if you had been following -not following youthforia- but following black influencers and black creators you would know that they also called them out about the color changing blush because it did not work on darker skin tones I think that um you're giving her again way too much credit you think that she's this master chemist she clearly isn't because her products do not work for everyone you can be educated on certain points and still be ignorant of other things so clearly her um lighter you know light to medium deep all the shades before that are very diverse have a range of undertones have very um small differences in those first like 10 or 15 shades that are not represented in the five medium deep to deep dark shades that she's provided so to use the examples of her creating this color changing blush as her being an expert chemist does not translate to other things there are a lot more that goes into creating darker shade ranges and when you're creating a foundation in general a formula that works for a lighter shade is not going to work for a darker shade necessarily because when you add more pigments it um you know makes the formula work differently I\u00a0do\u00a0think\u00a0it's\u00a0good\u00a0tocall\u00a0out\u00a0and\u00a0say you know y'all should be mindful of who you're giving your money to don't go out and buy the shade just to swatch it for a video I agree with that but I also think that it's disingenuous to act like people calling them out isn't important I do not think that this is going to create returning customers and if you look into case studies around um that Pepsi commercial that you use in an as an example which you do admit it hurt their stock and it hurt their brand recognition I mean they were more widely recognized but not for good reasons and when you're trying to um market yourselves to a more diverse audience they're going to be the first ones to see these very uh artificial ploys for their attention and for their consumerism and so if you have notable figures like golloria that called them out it is going to signal to the community they're not making stuff for me and I don't think that any brand would want them want their foundation to be referred to as tar in a bottle and for them to be silent on this I think just continues to show how unintentional this was because you want to control the narrative when you do things like this yes you want people to speculate you want the attention but then you want to come in and control the narrative you want to say oh my gosh that's right I messed up like she did with the first time with the shade ranges not being inclusive",

    "voice_to_text": "we're some of the best and I'll go as far back to say like this isn't like just specifically to 2016 this is like 2014 to 2017 like that type of era if you wanna like knock out 2014 I completely understand so like 2014 to 2017 those maker reviews were fantastic and like I kind of miss this type of raw energy when it comes to reviewing things and like talking about things because there's not enough of it anymore everybody's trying to sugarcoat things everybody's trying to be really nice and I don't mean that it's a bad thing it's great to be kind kindness is free being mean can cost something really really big sometimes it's a life sometimes it's a friendship but regardless of what it cost sometimes it has too much of a high cost um in my personal opinion on this is that we definitely need to bring it back because these raw products reviews got us the change that people were begging for within the beauty community and now looking at me you probably don't think that I wear a lot of makeup but I actually do I have quite a few pallets in my room so yes I do know what I'm talking about but um those raw reviews got the change needed and some of y'all are really gonna probably hate me for saying this one but small businesses on here need those raw ass reviews because some of y'all be hyping your products up way too much and then when like somebody actually goes and buys it and it's really shit they feel doomed and they don't wanna come back and that's just the nature of it that's just the nature of the business that's just what happens so get yourself chewed up by a small creator that shit builds character I don't know but long story short yes hundred percent bring those types reviews back and go ahead and watch the person that I stitched because she does those same exact things and if you would you know be cool as fuck maybe follow them",

Because today it's all about you, rich. Not sure if you guys know, but rich looks. He came out with a palette. Now, I'm not sure how old this is. I found it on spoiled lips. But we're definitely gonna dip into it, and we're gonna see what he's talking about. Oh, look, he even signed it for us. This is the front, and these are the colors. Oh, look, we even got stickers. How sweet. We're gonna get these eyebrows right real quick. I pray my eyes. I'm not gonna lie. There's not a real color story to this. Like, it looks like we have, like, maybe one neutral color, and the rest are colors. So, I don't know. Let's see what we could come up with. So we're gonna go ahead and start with that neutral color. It's called Carmen right here. I don't know. I really got some high hopes for you, rich, so let's hope this works out. I'm gonna set this all over here, and then I'm gonna Blend, Blend, blend. So then we're just gonna go ahead and dip into that black color. Do, like, a little bit of a smoky eye with the color. Robert, I'm not the best at Smokey Eye, so we're not gonna blame him for that, so. Yeah. Hold on. What was his color story? I don't. I didn't really know what else to do, so we're gonna make it happen now. We're gonna go in with the one shimmer that he has right here, and it's called problematic. Hmm. Imagine that. Now we're gonna go back with Carmen, and we're gonna go underneath the eyes. What do you guys think? I really like the shimmer. However, for a 38 dollar palette, I think we're gonna give this a 6.5",

Okay, this is something I've been thinking about a lot, and if you're a guy, I feel like you need to be taking note, especially if you're the type of guy who, like, likes to dress well. Maybe you're, like, one of these guys who's, like, super into the moustache and the mullet. Like, you kind of like to be trendy and fashionable, but, like, you're also dating. But to be honest, even if you're not dating, like, if you have a girlfriend, she'll probably appreciate this, realising that what we kind of want is, like, feminine guys. Take Harry Styles for another example. Like, we all love him, so maybe you should be copying him. Like, I appreciate there's a lot of pressure for guys to be impressing other guys and, like, the toxic masculinity, even. Maybe not toxic, but just, like, that masculinity thing, it's pretty intense. So I appreciate why you might be hesitant to, like, wear pearl necklaces, paint your nails, flare jeans, fun prints. Like, sure, it might be a bit much. Like, Brad Mondo is a pretty good example of that. I mean, I think it's safe to say he's gay. I'm pretty sure. I mean, I could be overstepping with that, but I'm pretty sure. But he doesn't come to the table, like how I think we stereotypically have thought of gay people in the Past. He's just well groomed, trendy, takes the time to clearly think about what he's doing, what he's wearing, what he's saying, and not being afraid to tap into his femininity. Was also still saying pretty masculine. I don't know if anybody else agrees, but I'd maybe say that Harry Styles maybe sometimes is a bit more feminine than Brad Mondo is. But like, he's a good looking guy because he takes care of his skin, he probably does his eyebrows. It looks like he takes the time to like, make his beard really neat. Obviously he cares about his hair. And to be honest, as I say obviously, I realise that maybe some people don't even know who Brad Mondo is, but he's basically a hairdresser on TikTok who is very funny. So yeah, I think if you wanna be playing the game with the girls in mind, then that's just my advice. And also I should say yes, obviously there are girls who love guys who are super masculine. But I think. I really think you can do both. And I fully support finding your vibe, but maybe there's just something to experiment with.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is she the darkest woman in America? Because I don't see her in the Guinness Book of World Records. I had to get on here because of that video. Are you slow or what? There is not one human being in this world that is the color jet black. Jet black. Look at my hoodie. There's nobody this fucking color. There's nobody. Have you seen your phone screen? There's nobody that fucking color. There's not. I'm so sick of these black folks trying to. Trying to take up for this nonsense. Take up for this nonsense. It's ridiculous. There's no. That was pure racist. They asked for a darker shade, and they just said, here, here you go. Literally, the bottle shows one pigment, and it's black. There's no undertones, there's no oranges, there's no, uh, neutral tones, no. No yellow undertones. Nothing in it. Just black. That is pure disrespect. And that's why you turned your comments off, because everybody was eating you up, because you know damn well there's nobody that damn color. Nobody. That's pure racist. I seen two of the darkest women on TikTok try that foundation. It was still too fucking dark for them. Rihanna set the tone for makeup years ago when she dropped that Fenty Beauty. And she made skin. She made foundations for all skin tones and skin types. Okay, did she create a pitch black foundation? Fuck, no. So what does that tell you? She has the darkest shade in foundation. Rare beauty has one of the darkest shades in foundation, and guess what? It fits those people talking about the Guinness Book of World Records. What are you talking about? When you find a pitch black man or a pitch black woman that's completely just black like this, you. You. You put them, you. You take a video with that or you post it on. On TikTok so we can see it, because I've never in my life seen anybody that damn black. Black people are not fucking black. We're brown. Your hair is not black, it's brown. Your eye color is not black, it's brown when you put light to it. Like, are you serious? Get it together, as a lot of y'all need to go back to school and learn color theory again and how to mix colors. You can't mix that with nothing. You can't mix it with nothing. It's gonna turn into MUD. It's gonna look gray. It's gonna look stupid. Nobody's that color. And if anybody's that color, then we need somebody to make a white foundation, pure fucking white. Cause there. Cause, I mean, let's be real. There's no white person that's pure white. Like paper. Like, let's be for real. It's ridiculous at this point, these arguments going back and forth. It's ridiculous. Nobody's that color. End of story. And if that's the case, then they need to be all inclusive and make a white person make a white foundation. Pure white for The whitest person ever. Like, are you serious? Let's be smart here. I had to come on here looking a mess because you're pissing me off.",

She actually goes on to explain the problem with it later in the video. And I've already made a youth for you like, video about this and explaining why the foundation was messed up. But I think we need to do a better job of picking and choosing who we battle and who we take sides and who we argue with online.

And then I got dripped out, and I got bring the bling. Just like this beige color taking off what I already have. We gonna start off with she got money. Hmm. That's really pretty. Um, kinda gotta get in there, but I like her. Let's zoom in. I like her. Okay, next one we're gonna try is dripped out. Okay. This one might be my favorite so far. I would wear this every day. This is so cute. Tripped out. Okay, and the last one we're gonna do is bring the bling. This one I'm kind of scared for cause it's like, beige almost. Y'all, at first I was thinking I would probably just wear this on top of my regular lip combo. I love this. It's almost like a frosty, like, Y2K kind of look. Okay, I think this one might be the favorite. I'm not even gonna lie. Okay, the girl that I stitch said that she felt kind of a plumping effect. I don't really feel that, but what do you guys think? Which one was your favorite? They're only $6, so if you are at Ulta, I would say grab you one.",

The one thing I can always count on is for a black woman to get on here in Kanesha. Very sad word. Let me help you out. Nobody in the history of ever is black like midnight without any undertones. There are no red undertones, there are no yellow undertones. There's no undertones. That's just straight black pigment. So for the people that aren't seeming to understand that, and I don't even wear makeup like that, but I understand colors. I understand the color wheel. I understand blending of colors. It's not that hard. Why doesn't euphoria have a pure white foundation then? Like, you know, white out, the old school white out. Why don't they have that? It's the same reason that they should not have pure black. Because nobody is pure black. Even the darkest person in the world is not just pure black. They have undertones. Even if they have blue undertones, red undertones, yellow undertones, they have undertones in their skin. The same way with white people. There's no such thing as having white like that. Would. Can you imagine if there was a foundation and they came out with the color of my teeth? There is not a person that is the color of freaking teeth. Oh, well, I'll say white teeth. But how are y'all not understanding this? And to see black people, black women, Going hard again for an Asian company. Y'all make me so sick. Y'all make me so sick. Sick. Seek help. Because there's no way. There's no way that you're sitting on this internet acting like you are once again, once again running to the rescue of an Asian company who is clearly showing they're being racist. As a matter of fact, why does anybody even give that company any airtime? This is not their first Rodeo on their race racist antics. Stop wanting to be so involved with other companies that you beg for inclusivity and they throw disrespect. And then you're not the victim of the disrespect.

Every single person on earth has an undertone. Warm, reddish, blue, purple. That foundation has no undertone. To make foundations, there needs to be undertones in it. There needs to be reds, greens, even blues, whatever. That foundation has no undertone. A chemist came out and said, compared to the other foundations, this one only has black in it, has no other colors so that it has an undertone. That foundation was compared to black face paint because there's no dimension to it. It's just black. And, no, you can't mix it because it turned other shades gray because it's just black. I'm afraid that's just how color theory works, y'all. But what I'm not understanding is what you guys aren't getting. It was marketed as a foundation. You shouldn't have to mix it. You shouldn't have to use it as other things. You shouldn't have to use it as contour if it can't do this job. It's literally created and marketed as. It's. It's really that simple. It's really that simple.",

But this is a bad take, and if someone who doesn't really follow the beauty community because I don't wear makeup. Um, I've been following this because when I saw that shade, I was like, who is this for? And then I looked at the range, and it's not just the dark shade that's the problem. It's also that the range that they added, it almost seems like a Fu. Like they were like, oh, you want darker? Here is dark. That darkest color has no dimension, no undertone. It is. Has one ingredient, like, one color shade, and it is like a flat black. And people keep talking about Maya Kim. She tried it on. The last one looks like blackface on her now.

If we're being super, super technical, technically, the color black is actually a shade. And that's why, when it comes to skin tones, makeup, anything and everything, there's undertones, color theory. And I can grasp the concept of when watching Gloria's video and making it seem, or her making it seem like she is the darkest person, but I think. I think she knows that she's not and that there are beautiful people that are darker than her. However, those darker people are not making the videos that she is. And this is a series that not only brought her success, brought and shed light onto things that people have been trying to talk about for years in the makeup industry when it comes to brands and their lack of shades. The gist of it all is that euphoria did a shitty job. Not only was their darkest shade the literal color black, they didn't have a white color. There's no white like my color like my shirt. And then the shade before the black one. In between those two, they could have been easily a good 6, 7 shades, maybe up to 10. And then in this video, she also made a comment talking about how people could use that foundation to do, like, beauty marks or like, do like a country. I look you kind Of prove the point of it being literally black. And also to, like, from makeup artist, you cannot do that with foundation. It's gonna be a mess, because it does not have the formula and concept of eyeliner or eyeshadow stick. It's a cream in general, like, message of it all. What brands need to do is go to the. The point of it all. Go to these people, get darker skin tones to work on these shades. And also for brands, if this is also an issue for you, please learn undertones. Because I've seen foundations, working in Sephora and being a makeup artist, where it says, oh, yeah, this is neutral and it's warm. Regardless of it all, just a little euphoria fucked up. Like, that was straight shitty. And if they really thought that, they was gonna get a pat on the back for that. Come on.",

In order for a complexion product to be a complexion product, it has to be comprised of at least three pigments. At least. If you want to go on my profile and look at the previous video that I posted, it showed the foundation for the darkest shade to only have one pigment. And what is that pigment? Nitrous oxide. Black. It's literally black. And please, I'm very aware that there are black women out there who have very, very gorgeous, very rich and deep brown skin. You hear those that you hear brown. But that does not mean they are comprised of one pigment. Honey, it is very incorrect to be saying that. It is very common knowledge that in the labs that they need to make at least three different pigments. They have to use at least three to make a shade, okay? Because even though it's not common to the eye, and even the black women may not see it themselves because they don't know about color theory, they just wanna get a foundation that matches them. It doesn't matter how deep you are. Does not matter how deep you are. You are comprised of red and blues in your skin. Even if you are that deep, you're gonna be more warm or More cool depending on your skin tone. And might I say, I saw on her profile. Not gonna lie, I was peeking a little bit cause I wanted to see. It's a chemist on there. I would assume that you would know that it is biologically impossible for one person to be one pigment. You have to be comprised of multiple pigments. It literally is telling you. We're giving you facts. It's literally a fact that it is comprised of only one pigment. So at the end of the day, you're wrong. Incorrect. Next.",

It, in fact, exists for the brand to say that their entire makeup line is not actually for anyone with dark skin. They might as well have named the Damn Shade Shoe Polish. This shade was released purely out of spite and racism. You cannot convince me that there weren't at least, probably way more, at least three people at the absolute highest level in this company who fully intended this shade to be to be a joke about minstrel shows. Not only are they saying, hey, black women, are lines not for you, but they're also saying, even when we approximate your skin tone, um, it's actually for white people to, uh, then be part of the extremely long and horrific history of painting themselves pitch fucking black to mock your entire race. It's shoe polish. That was their intention. This is not a legitimate foundation shade. It is mockery. In response to being called out for trying to make a whites only makeup brand in 2024.",

You know, I'm trying to hurry up because fast food, right? When they come back again to be like, hey, we want ketchup. And I, like, I don't know. It's a petty part of me that I'd get mad and then I grab a whole handful of ketchup and then give it to them. It's petty, it's wrong, it's not right. Like, they're just trying to get their ketchup right. But that's what you, for years, like, seems to be doing, and it's bogus, because it's like, they're probably like, oh, we're just trying to be inclusive. We just want to make sure we get everybody, yada, yada. Nah, I. I don't understand really, what they're. What they're trying to do here. But people should not be punished or reprimanded for asking for the things that they want or they need. You can give it to them. Go ahead, give it to me. If you can't, then don't target. I mean, it's gonna be difficult not to target to that audience because you're in the US, and if your product is in the US, there's a variety of people that bearing, shape, tone, and you Should have kept that in mind when you made it.

Why you guys always so upset? Where's the video? And I saved it because I knew that it was gonna be missing by this morning. I think the part that really behaved me was in her comments. She was like, oh, my god. Guys, I totally get it. I. No, trust me, I get. No, you don't. You don't get it. It's the fact that you walk past hundreds. Hundreds, just like y'all did in the hair store with the Maya oil. Hundreds, just like y'all did with the Juvia's place eyeshadows and the blushes and everything. Hundreds. Y'all walk past all of those brands. You were like, hmm, yeah, no, this isn't gonna work, because I need every single brand in this store to cater to me. Y'all tell us to get over it, but then we try and tell y'all to get over it. It's, no, we can't do that, so we're gonna cause an uproar. Everybody know I am Fenty down when it come to my skin, okay? 50 down. And I'm gonna ride, and I'm gonna ride this very tone. Deaf. Very. Mmm. And if it wasn't that, why is the video gone? Where did the video go? Why was the video deleted? I don't. I don't. I'm tired. I'm tired. And then you say in the video. Oh, you. That you use Rihanna, that you use Fenty skin. And this time the third. So why not use it? Why go find something that you. You. And then it. Hold on. This part right here. Um, that's clearly not. She's not white. She's albino. What about. Never mind, never mind. You go get in there. Am I tripping? Like, I don't. I don't get it. It's like, as soon as y'all are not involved, it's like, we need to write. We need to write there's no way that anything on this earth is not gonna include me. Euphoria, make sure that we never came back. Okay? My L changed their hair oil. I got both bottles, old and new. Why are we rinsing out oil after we use it? What? Because of y'all. So once again, go use all those other hundreds of brands that you have to use. Can we have one thing? Do y'all not realize that Rihanna is black now? You have these other brands? Oh, we wanted to try it on our fair skin, um, our fair skin demographic first, before we made any darker shades. So what if Rihanna was doing the same thing, except opposite? What if she wanted to try out on Us first. Before she went into detail. And make it, if y'all. Yeah, I know she black. Forget it. I quit. Maybe. Maybe the color eyes is throwing y'all off. I don't know. I don't",

You can go into Target, Walmart, Sephora, Ulta. You can even go into five fucking below, bitch, and find your shade. As in us, we have to go on a hunt, on a deep search to find shades that match her skin tone.

Our Lord and Savior Mike Flanagan is going to save the day. It has been officially announced that Mike Flanning it is going to write, direct, and produce the new Exorcist movie and it is just going to take place in the Exorcist universe but not be a sequel to Exorcist Believer. If you didn't know, the original plan was that David Gordon Green was going to make a trilogy, but plans changed after believer came out and got pretty negative reviews. Well, Mike Flanagan said the Exorcist is one of the reasons I became a filmmaker. You know, he is just going to put so much, like, respect and love and care into this. I always say Mike Flanagan is a horror nerd just like all of us. I don't think he does things for money or to appeal to the masses. I think he does things because he loves the genre. I personally think that Mike Flanagan is the greatest director and just one of the greatest creative minds in the horror genre right now. After seeing believer, I literally did Not give a fuck about this trilogy. I could not care less. And that's sad to me because the Exorcist is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.

Well, I've said it for the longest time, but if I say it, you know I'm the fucking bad guy. But of course, when a post goes viral, when it gets 88 fucking K likes, then people wanna agree with it just because it got likes. But if I say it, you know I'm the bad guy. On some real shit, though, in my personal opinion, I truly think makeup is one of the biggest catfish slash scams in the history of time. You without makeup, without none of that shit on your face, with all that coloring on your face, that is the real you. You can argue with your mother, your daddy, your auntie, your uncle, it does not matter. That is the real you. Without makeup. No. Nothing. No, I know. What is them thing called lashes? None of that. That is the real you. And you cover it with pounds of makeup. As I started getting older, I found females way more or less attractive just for the simple effect of makeup. Seriously, everywhere you go, majority, like 95% of females that I see in public, they are wearing makeup. And it's like, I don't know what you look without makeup. Because you without makeup, that's the real you. That's what you actually look like. Like Seriously, when you see a girl with makeup versus without makeup, they look totally different.",

Here's me again with another weave style. And this is me with my natural hair straightened out, also following the European beauty standard. Here's me when I began to embrace my natural hair and started to see my natural curl pattern. And here's me with my natural hair in its natural state after washing it and letting it free dry. This is like a week or two after I actually started the process of my free form. And this is me in my hair like a month or two after I started my free form process. This is me four months into my free form process. This is me five months into my freeform process. This is the back view five months later. And this is my hair six months later. And this is my hair almost exactly one year after the last photo. I actually lost a lot of pictures when I had to get a new phone and didn't back everything up. But, yeah, you all get the point. The point is, that is all on purpose, baby. And if you don't get It yet? Go look at the playlist label Bush Hair on my page and you'll learn something. Y'all have a good day now.",

There's daughter's prom and riddling the daughter with bullets. And there's no other news towards other than the real Dax dot news. These AI photos. There's nobody from either side of the community. No local news, no community news, nobody sharing this story. This is fake. It's very obviously fake. You click on the con, the account, and all they do is post AI pictures with outlandish rage baiting stories. And I've seen several people, several accounts re share this story. But a simple Google search, there's no court documents, there's no news stories, there's no social media post outside of people reposting this story from the real Dax Dot news. Outrage baiting. And honestly, we have to be very cautious of this in United States. It is a election year. Stuff like this might seem like, oh, just rage baiting, just for engagement, just for revenue. But watch, these stories have more of a political change the closer we get to November. They're meant to do damage to a community. Be wary and please invest in a little bit of media literacy.",

Next, this video, this base right here. Immaculate. I remember waking up at like 4:00am to do this video to do my makeup before I went to this race. Long story. It was all going good until that yellow. Like, I don't know why that yellow was so patchy. There's many reasons a look wouldn't get posted. Maybe, you know, I got to the ends, I didn't like the look, or I got to the end and I forgot to record the last moment. Or I got to the end and something was a mess. This was a mess from the start. This is a look I did for my 75 hard YouTube video, and it hit for that, you know, I was trying to go a little bit fresher, a little bit more no makeup. Makeup. But it wasn't getting posted on its own. No makeup. Makeup is so hard, cause I'd be like, putting it on. This is my look for the Renaissance tour. And honestly, there is nothing wrong with the look. I just hated how my hair looked at the ends. Like, That's literally it. It gets real meticulous around here. And I can keep going. Look at all those dress",

When I have on makeup, girls be trying to talk to me. So I had to, like, sit down one day. I had to think about it. If you really looking for a husband, man, you ain't got to wear no makeup. Like, men are trying to see how you look. They ain't on none of that stuff that we be doing. They don't want you to get no wax. They don't want you to wear no makeup. They don't want you to wear no lashes. And at this point, man, I owe the man an apology. Men are really out here. Just really want to appreciate just how you look. You get what I'm saying? You feel me? But i'mma have to defend the women on this one, because we thought that y'all liked all it. Then I had to realize it. Dudes don't really be stepping to me. Not that they don't think I'm cute when I be fixed up, but it's like when I don't have nothing on, when I be, like, bald, nothing, maybe right there. And I'll be like, man, this dude lie. Like, he got to be. He capping. Then girls be trying to talk to me when I have on makeup. So I'm like, women, when we be putting on all that stuff, we Must be doing it for women. we must be doing it to meet the beauty standards of another woman. Women try to talk about women who don't have on makeup, but dudes really looking for women who don't have on makeup. And when I say makeup, I'm talking, like, the BBL audit. Dudes really don't be on it. For real. They really just don't. You get what I'm saying? So, ladies, I'm just letting you know, man. Hey, big dog, it ain't gonna be none. You listen.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I had a bridal trial today, and one of the questions that I always ask during a consultation is if you ever had your makeup done before, have you ever been in a wedding, etc. And she was telling me that she was recently in a wedding where a makeup artist here in Saint Louis made her feel like she was so ugly and horrible. She said that this artist in particular was, like, making her and all the bridesmaids feel really dumb for, like, spray tan their face, which I know that does make a foundation match harder, but if you're a makeup artist and you understand color theory, you should be able to work with anyone regardless. And then on top of that, she was telling my client that her eyelash extensions were ugly, and she hated them. Um, which sometimes eyelash extensions are hard to work with. But again, you're the professional. You should be able to handle that. Um, and then she told another bridesmaid that her lips were weird and another one that the makeup just didn't look good because she had too many wrinkles. We work in the beauty industry. If someone gets out of your chair and they feel worse about themselves than when they sat down, you should quit. And when these instances do happen, I like to know, you know, who it is, you know, especially if it's someone local. Because we're so busy, we send recommendations all the time. To other artists whose work that we love. And I just want to know, like, we see their work, we don't see the way that they interact with clients. So it's good to know these things about people so that we can feel comfortable recommending them. Um, in the icing on the cake was that she said this person was talking negatively about our team. Um, which. I mean, we're in the beauty industry. I think sometimes, you know, people just wanna talk. But, you know, we've had artists on our list that we recommend when we're booked that we've had to take off for that same thing. Like, you know, we heard from other clients that they were in a bridal party, and they were speaking negatively about us, and we're like, okay, well. And we're not sending you any business, you know, so I just feel like it's. It's a weird energy to be mean to your clients. It's also a weird energy to talk badly about other makeup artists in front of your clients. So stop that.",

By the way, can we talk about the fact that Raquel, Beyonce's makeup artist, used royal family in this look right here? Color of the summer. Now we are cutting the crease. Okay, 2016 makeup is back. Now we're gonna take. And that is going on, like, the sides of the blue on the lid, but leaving that center bare. I know it looks like trash until the last. Bear with me. Then on the center, I'm applying disco stick, and this just makes it magical. Royal family and dragging her. Did I mention that we're going extreme today? Definitely. Let me know if I should do a more wearable blue look for you, because I am aware that pretty much no one will wear this. I will make sure this color of the summer actually last in the summer.

Could it be print or would it be online only? #makeup #fashion #fashionhistory #beauty #blackfashion #fashiontiktok #magazine #fashioncommentary #beautytok  ",
    "voice_to_text": "What if I told you that the best black fashion magazine ever created was a publication that hardly anyone got to see? Suede magazine was a joint venture between essence magazine and Time, Inc. And it launched in 2004 with a focus on luxurious fashion for women of color. However, it did not last very long. The first cover, which came out in September 2,004, featured Alicia Keys, the second cover saw Eve, the third was Zoe Saldana, and the fourth and final cover featured Tyra Banks. As well as these glamorous, well known names on the covers, the brands throughout were luxurious Chanel, YSL, Valentino, Elie, Saab, and throughout the magazine there were these beautiful illustrations and detailed editorials crafted by creative director Richard Christensen. The rest of the team included Suzanne Boyd as editor, Ying Chu as beauty director, Ian Hilton as editor at large, and Agnes Kamak as fashion, market, news and trends director. I was recently reminded of suede magazine's existence when I chatted to Andrea Lewis, the creator of the Netflix documentary series The Black Beauty Effect. It was supposed to be Essence's Millennial Girl magazine. It was four girl millennial millennial girls that were young at the time. The black millennial girl deserves see herself on this really luxe level, deserves to see herself on this really creative level. So we're gonna create this magazine. At the time, suede magazine was described as a multicultural woman's fashion glossy, and others described it as a Black take on Harper's Bazaar. Even Time, Inc's editor in chief at the time, Norman Perlstein, said that suede was, quote, one of the freshest, most exciting magazines to come out in years. So what happened? At the time, there were rumors that essence was intimidated by the sheer sales that suede was making. But I think a far more likely explanation would be that the sales were low. It's really hard to launch a new title, and advertisers were promised a guaranteed circulation of 250,000. However, essence never revealed the actual new stand sales, given the fact they already had 40 people on the team. I just think money ran out, and it is a huge shame. Before I go, let me read you the manifesto that went out in the very first issue of Suede. Style is in our DNA, and we, the multi culti urbanistas, stand at a new intersection of street and chic. Our dial is tuned to the catwalk and the corner. We are fashion crazy. We come from the culture on the come up and use fashion to amplify who we are. We revel in the entire spectrum of black beauty and love the skin we're in. Feel it. Let me know. Do you know suede?",

I went to the drugstore this morning, and I was shocked by the prices. Is drugstore the new luxury? I don't know. And listen, here's the thing. I'm not cheap, but I'm also not delusional. $18 for a bronzer? That's not affordable. Twenty something dollars for a foundation? That ain't affordable. I say all this to say remember the days of foundation in the drugstore was like, $10. A bronzer would be five, pencil would be two. So I don't know if those days have just shipped and sailed and sunk, but I have hope. Any recommendations? Brand products? Let me know, because I'm not giving up on this tutorial. $18 for a bronzer? What is that? Bye.",

I do have lots of debt, but basically, by engaging, the TikTok Creator Fund is paying you per view. No wonder the government wants to shut down TikTok. They want to keep us down.

Beauty Blender. I need a headband. There we go. Taking the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer. My eyes just a little light. We're gonna let that marinate a little bit. And while that's marinating, I'm gonna do my eyebrows. Now let's blend the concealer out. And pray, trust the process. Usually that would cover up my pimples, but we're gonna do one more layer, and I'm gonna take my house Labs concealer, put that on top, and let that, like, sit for, like, one to two minutes. Okay, pop it in. See, is that not crazy lasers wear? Blend this out. I set my under eyes with the one size Ultimate Setting powder in Ultra Peach brush. Like this. And I'm gonna be, like, setting the spots where I have crazy lasers going on or where those pimples were. Love this stuff so much. It's the Bareminerals Skin Perfecting Powder Foundation. So I'm taking this and I'm gonna put this all over my face, and you're gonna Wanna, like, press in. I'm gonna do my eyes real quick. I'll be right back. This Is my favorite part. We need, like, some color house labs blush and dragon fruit days. So pretty. Best highlighter ever. This is the benefit cookie highlighter. It's so good. Feel like it's, like, low key underrated. Actually, this might be my favorite part. Drown yourself in setting spray. I feel like this makes it look less cakey. Benefit Urban Decay. This one's really good, too. What? Oh, my god.

Louise, but you guys are the reason why I grow. So I'm thinking we start developing products together. I document it, we film it. We come up with new flavors together. TikTok made me buy it vibe. We build collections together. You choose the color story, I will play shadows. You'll tell me I'm on the right track. I'm not on the right track. And we basically do it together because you're the reason for my growth. TikTok is the reason for my growth. So why we're not building collections together? You guys are obsessed with cosmetics. You love it. So you can start developing products with me. It's like you own the business with me. We. We produce products together. And, you know, I create formulas and trial them, show them, and you give me the yayo. Then. Now, what does this consist? What is your role? What is your job? Spec A part of being on my P. Louise CEO, TikTok. Well, I would expect you guys just to be totally honest. I will take on feed board from the comments, pick some at random every single month, and will start developing them products, will start making them products. Will start showing you among different skin tones. Will start showing you, you know, lip oils with glitter, sparkles in there and You know, reflex and do you like them? Should we develop them? What flavoured are they screaming to? Will start showing you the mold process and, like, really documenting what goes into owning a business, especially cosmetics business that's growing so fast. And you guys were part of product development. You're my product development team. Welcome on board. It's a fun part of what I do. And I think you guys will be really interested in, like, compliance, because, like, neon is banned. And just knowing that type of insight as to why we can't develop. And then lastly, a part of being on my product development team, I will send out, like, 100 of that product that we then begin to create. From the original video. Who commented and interacted. So 100 people get what we created together for free, which I just think is so much fun. I hope you enjoy the concepts and the idea. Like, TikTok made me buy it. TikTok made me make it. I don't know any other cosmetic company that is. Yes, they might take feedback on board, and they might take comments on board and take that into product development meetings, but they're not exactly taking you on the journey on how it's made. And they're not allowing you to have import, IE, add more glitter. Okay, but can it contain this ingredient? Okay, I love it, but can we add this into it? Yeah, let's do it. I'm down. Let me Know, if you down and you want to be a part of this product development, TikTok made me buy it.",

    "voice_to_text": "You need to throw these away immediately. If you are using makeup wipes to take off your makeup, you need to stop, and let me tell you why. Disclaimer I am a licensed esthetician, so I know what I'm talking about. So not only do these not remove your makeup completely, it also disrupts your acid mantle, which is the protective layer of your skin, which keeps all the good things in and the bad things out. When you're wiping the skin over and over and over, that is considered tugging, and when you tug at the skin, it causes premature aging. Also disrupt your pH balance of your skin, and they can also cause micro tears in your skin. And the naked eye can't spot micro tears, but if you look under a microscope, you can see tiny tears in your skin. A majority of makeup wipes do contain alcohol, which is very stripping to the skin's barrier, and you will not be able to maintain a healthy barrier if you're gonna continue to put alcohol on your face. Especially if you're using this on your eyes to remove eye makeup, that is one of the worst places that you can use this on. The skin around the eye area is the most delicate and thinnest. When you're tugging and wiping and irritating, it most definitely will be causing premature wrinkles. Instead of this, use something like this. Micellar water is one of the best ways to remove makeup. It is very gentle and it's not gonna irritate the skin. My favorite right now is this Fenty Skin Jelly Oil Makeup Melting Cleanser. This works so well at removing the makeup and it's very, very gentle. As you can see, I used half the bottle already. One of my most favourite makeup cleansing balms to ever exist is this one by versed. You can get this at target. So bye bye to this, hello to this.",

People online are calling the speech demeaning to working women and also say it is mysogynstic.  A\u00a0petition\u00a0was even started to have him removed from the\u00a0Super Bowl\u00a0champion's roster, which has now reached over 100,000 signatures.  He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend. And, also in the speech he criticised Pride month, a particularly important time for the\u00a0LGBTQ+ rights movement. #lifeandstyle #HarrisonButker #TaylorSwift #NFL #KansasCityChiefs #Chiefs #Butker",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.",

Like, I don't know if you can see in there, but it literally goes to, like, right here. Now, I'm not a scientist or anything, but what the fuck is that? Why is there nothing in there? They are ripping us off because this doesn't go up or anything. It doesn't. It doesn't do that. It's literally that right there holds the tiny amount of product. That is crazy. Now, this isn't the most expensive product, but I feel like that is nuts for it to be that tiny amount in there. And you think that you're buying this whole container because it's the same color.

    "voice_to_text": "Feminine hygiene needs to be discussed more amongst young girls. I work with teenage girls, and unfortunately, a lot of them have odors, have, you know, don't have the best smell, and I think having that conversation is very uncomfortable. Number one and number two, knowing that a lot of information is like, oh, my god, I never knew that. Like, they were never taught that or never talking about this stuff. And what I realize, especially in a black community, amongst black mothers and daughters, a lot of black mothers either don't know how to had a conversation, are too afraid to have the conversation, um, don't know enough information to have the conversation with. They were not taught themselves. So it becomes this thing where, like, when, when young girls are growing up, just thinking about just feminine hygiene, like, not having anything to do with sex. In a black community, for some reason, I believe black mothers believing we talk about that stuff is gonna lead to sex. And that's not the case. There are girls out here who are, have odors, who are not wiping themselves properly, wash themselves properly, just taking care of their bodies, and then they're out here being sexually active at the same time, and that combination is not good at all. So I think it's so important that we have to be comfortable with our children to have these conversations even before they hit puberty, to let them know about their Bodies don't be afraid to talk to your daughters. Like, find out the information if you don't know. But we. We had to do better for our girls",

    "voice_to_text": "Lazy Girl's Guide to Boyfriend Blush  only takes five products in five minutes let's do it together  for this easy lazy girl boyfriend blush look it's gonna be five products that's all you need five products two of them are blushes so really can't even really count that I'm gonna start with some concealer because just gonna even out a little bit of my skin tone it's gonna make me look a little bit more awake but you don't have to do anything crazy okay I'm going to conceal my under eyes because my darkest part is here in the hollow even that out and then I have a little bit of discoloration on my top lip now I did start with a moisturizer because I don't want my blush to stick to any little textured or dry parts of my skin I want it to look nice and seamless so just do this like I said you can do it with your finger for extra blendability and extra laziness so don't worry don't have to be precise this is a lived in gorgeous natural look you're gonna look natural we call this bus makeup because everyone takes the bus or the train to get into work so this is bus or train makeup you can just throw it on while you're on the bus alright so we're gonna take a cream blush whatever cream blush you want I'm taking the Bobby Brown Bobby Brown Pot rouge for lips and cheeks in the colour Rose Supernatural I'm gonna apply in a boyfriend style for me and my Oblong face you can also do this for oval face as well I'm going to apply it towards the back of my ear like going towards my ear and then just filling up this area I'm not gonna go any closer than this because my face is already long so I don't wanna pull my face down I don't want my face to be drooping down here okay so I'm gonna leave it like this I'm also gonna take some here because I'm not wearing bronzer I'm not wearing anything else so I wanna add some flush to the rest of my skin natural come over to the other side still using rose but I just wanna even myself out a little bit right going towards the back these blushes any cream blushes most of them pretty pigmented so you don't need too too much but you know you can build it if you want so you can place a little bit more in there and start to blend up you can absolutely blend these any cream blushes with your fingertips but I always use a brush just because it's just easier for me it gives me more of an even finish I feel like my fingers sometimes make them look a little bit blotchy and you don't wanna look blotchy you just wanna look sun kissed and flushed okay this makeup is actually perfect for school if you're going to class um work if you don't normally wear a lot of makeup to work this is great it's easy 5 minutes in the morning and it's also just great for you know weekends you're just running errands you're just going on a picnic or you're just doing some chillaxing throw this on throw this on it takes one minute I hope this lighting isn't too bad for you guys because I can't really see much to be honest with you can't really see much in this light but that's okay this is mid day light this is what I get okay so I'm just pulling it down and out not going any further alright so I'm keeping this area blank and still nice and bright too because I did put that concealer here I didn't put anything on my nose so my nose is still a natural color my face is still a natural color look at that let me make sure it's just even for you folks stunning stunning alright now we're gonna take powder blush I'm gonna use or a pink it's a very natural flush very easy to use product No. 3 now I chose these specific colours because I wanna wear more of a pinky lip like a lip balm so I don't wanna look red on the cheeks Pinky Mavi on the lips I don't know I did that the other day and it just fell off to me but whatever anyways you don't have to put a powder blush on top you really don't but I'm using this for two things I'm gonna put this on my eyes as well so you can just throw it on like this also I just feel like it just keeps the cream blush on much longer so if you just pop a little bit on do you see still look super natural but it just clings to that flush of the cream blush thank you you can put some on your forehead as well you just look nice and still luminous but you don't look tacky like wet tacky you know what I mean alright then I don't have any clean eyeshadow brushes one second one second these colours are subjective use whatever colours are best for you alright I'm using this blush on my eyes because I always do that anyways when I'm just blending in my eyeshadow always put blush on my eyes whatever blush I'm wearing on my face it's going on my eyes as well also I'm not doing anything to my eyebrows because this is a lazy girl day this is a I'm not looking too uh put together type of makeup okay this is just you throw it on and this is what you get and everyone's like oh my God you look so nice today oh my God you look so natural thank you alright let's take a lip this is the 4th product right alright lip balm tinted Lip Balm Easy could have even used this as your cream blush but I didn't it's okay now mascara lip balm is on excuse the lighting this is what happens when you have deep set eyes and you get some light here makes your eyes look super dark and sunken anyways doesn't matter doesn't matter cause we're nearly done take some mascara pop it on you can do just top lashes or you can do top and bottom some people they just like to do top anyways regardless because you guys say that on the bottom it just smudges too much which I totally get and especially if you're just doing a nice natural look boom top lashes easy easy peasy nothing crazy here no precision no stress no fussing around just throw it on and don't worry about it you're gonna look amazing it's a natural flush it's a natural colour on your skin it looks natural feels natural you're not feeling like you're somebody else you look like yourself but enhanced that was it that's it that's all you need five products so we had two blushes maybe unnecessary one lip balm one concealer and one mascara that was it to get a flawless beautiful boyfriend blush but also just a flawless face in general just to enhance your natural beauty you don't need something that's too much you don't even have to wear foundation if you don't want to that's a myth and I wasn't even wearing bronzer if you wanna wear bronzer if you wanna swap out one of the blushes for a bronzer because you just like wearing bronzer I also love wearing bronzer but that's a great way to give yourself a little bit more of a bronze look instead of just being so flushed maybe you don't like looking so pink amazing alternative anyways oh there we go it's a little bit better okay so I really hope that you enjoyed this look if you try it please let me know tell me what you're using tell me what I should be using just yeah let me know hope you enjoy bye",

I've been perfecting this routine for years now. First, you're gonna curl your lashes at the base. You're gonna curl them longer than you think you need to. move the curling wand up a little bit to the mids of the lashes and do the same thing. Move it up again and just curl the tips a little. Okay, lashes are curled. Now, this is very important. You want a mascara that isn't too wet. I'm using one from Charlotte Tilbury, but also Covergirl Clump Crusher. The green bottle is really good. Waterproof mascaras are also good. Now, you wanna start applying mascara on the tips of the lashes, and you're going from behind. This isn't gonna weigh your lashes down, and it'll help preserve the curl. And then I'll apply it normally, but just the tiniest amount. And that's it. I promise this curl is gonna last all day.

This is Queen Silver Glitter spray by a brand called Eva NYC and it's incredible! On the day of MET, I applied Liquid Highlight on Sydney's Declatage, gave the bottle a good shake, and sprayed an even layer all over her arms and chest. It's buildable, super easy to use, and the sparkle is magical on the face. I made a custom glitter mix and lightly spritz it onto Sydney's face, making sure to be mindful of the eye area. I followed with a quick Passover of Queen Silver glitter spray just to lock everything in place and voila! Can you even believe the sparkle? It looks like floating diamonds on the skin! I hope you found this helpful! Thanks for watching! If you decide to recreate the look, please tag me. I wanna see your looks!",

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

I have been searching for the perfect foundation shade, and everyone said to match it to my neck, but then I saw this video. Your neck may be significantly darker than your face, so I don't think it's productive to shade match. Here I go for the center of the chest, I get the best match, so I decided I'm going to do the same. I started with my current foundation, which is the makeup by Mario, and to me, this was a really good match. Next up was my favorite tinted moisturizer by color pop, and I didn't expect this to be so red. I don't remember it being the shade, so makeup by Mario was still in the lead. Next was the Fenty eavesdrops, and this is another one that I did not expect to look dark against my chest. I feel like it doesn't look that stark when I wear it. But anyway, this is my most recent foundation purchase. It's by Maybelline, and once again, I thought this one looked really good on my face. Obviously, my chest is a little lighter, and then, of course, I have the Basma Beauty Foundations. I feel like I've seen that so many people be able to find their perfect match with this foundation, so I got a couple shades to try. That one wasn't it? This next one was shade 0 0 9, and I swear this was one of the best ones. And I decided to do a face wash with this one. And look at the material. You can hardly see it. And I have a beauty Mark on my other cheek, so I wanted to see if it would cover it, and it definitely did. It's giving eraser. Then I wanted to try the other shade, which was a bit darker. I also feel like this one looked good, too. It's definitely deeper and warmer, but I feel like if I mix them, it would be my perfect shape. Do you match to your chest, your neck, or your face? Let me know.",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

    "voice_to_text": "Okay. Also, I did a little bit of digging, and I found this lady's Facebook page. If you don't know who she is, she's basically a mom that willingly dropped off her kids at CPS so that they can be placed in the foster care. It's just home so that she can do what she needs to do. But don't worry, she said she's gonna pick them up. I'm coming back for my kids, and I am going to get my kids. When her video first popped up on my for you page, um, I had a lot of sympathy for her, because if you're a mom, you know this shit is hard. But after going through Facebook page, something tells me she's not going back for them kids. Just a few hours after going live and posting about her dropping her kids off at CBS, this was her first post. I'm outside today. Yeah, she's outside, and her kids are finding out how traumatizing a foster home can be. This was her second post. So this is exhibit B. Um, I just wanna clock in and get some money. She did mention that she was dropping the kids off because she had no help and she's in college, but she didn't mention the then go shake some ass part. She then made a post to make sure that we all knew that she really don't give a f. In case anyone of you were wondering if she cared, it's Definitely giving manic episode. So obviously she's posting a lot and frequently on her Facebook page, so I'll keep you guys updated. This is another video that I found on her page, and it's basically just her telling the dads of the kids that they're at CPS and if they want them to come and get them because she's about to give them to CPS. So that's. This video was at the firehouse for two hours, but we're here at Children's Services now. If there's any family out there on my case, dad's side. I don't have nobody's contact information. If there's anybody out there who would like to take the kids, we're here at Children Services, Main Street, Whitehall.",

It seems like guys can just put the bare minimum and not even really put an effort anymore. They don't really care to, but they're like, why don't girls just go and make the first move and make the effort? Couple of things. In 2024, last thing any guy wants to get called is a creep. Men ain't approaching no more. And I understand them. I'm married. I don't have to deal with that bullshit. Jesus Christ. Secondly, social media has done you guys in. We keeping it above women own dating in the sexual marketplace, but y'all let social media trick y'all into handing that shit over to men. A very specific type of man. Mr. Tall, dark, handsome, rich, all that. Now all y'all think y'all deserve that man because you see so many of them on social media. I know how much money I make. I'm 30 now. I got it. And I know how much money the average man makes. I know how much money I made when I was 21. It was nothing compared to now. So, like, the average 21 year old is competing with guys who have money like me. He'll never, ever win. As a matter of fact, the guys who have money, the guys who are tall, the guys who are attractive, guys who Women want to be around. It's probably like 5% of men. That's who y'all are chasing. The regular guys will chase you. You just don't like the regular guys because you feel as if you're an extraordinary woman, which you probably are. Okay, okay. But realistically, y'all disqualify so many men who would break their necks to take a sip of your bath water because your standards are up here, which is fine. Have your standards, but don't get on TikTok asking dumbass questions like that. It's not that men don't chase, right? Especially once there's mutual exchange, like, hey, I like you, you like me. Let's do this thing. Regular guys will still trade. Chase you. The guys who have women flowing into their inbox. Why would he chase you? There are 50 of you in his inbox. Why would he chase you?",

    "voice_to_text": "There needs to be a study on why Serena Williams always looks a goddamn mess. I ain't gonna give her too much cause we know Serena Williams has experienced a lot of colorism and anti blackness throughout her career. But me saying that she looks a goddamn mess is not rooted in colorism and misogyny. While it may not be constructive, it is a valid critique. It's really the wigs that do it for me. The wigs are always dry. They never really compliment her skin tone. Her makeup always looks too damn light for her face. Plastic surgery is unrecognizable. She got these damn fillers in her face, got her looking like phaser parks. Her wardrobe is always ill fitted. She never wears anything that compliments her body. I'm tired of it. Almost positive that she has non black people styling her. The people who are styling her do not know how to style dark skin black women. It's a fact. And then it's like, you're rich, Serena, you got way too much fucking money to be out here looking like this. You gotta represent. You gotta represent for the dark skinned girlies. You've been looking a mess for the last 20 years and I'm fucking tired of it. I want her to take that goddamn blonde hair out of her head. You're not. Beyonce is not giving. Want her to go back to her roots and start wearing natural hairstyles, start wearing braids. Not meant you ain't got To wear the beaded braids, but start wearing more braided and more like natural hairstyles. I think that will compliment you a lot more. Choose to get a black stylist, preferably a black gay male stylist. And stop trying to look like a white woman. It just. I'm sorry.",

I can't do the whole put the dots on and then blend in one go. No, I need my time blending out the. Okay, she's gonna be a clown today. Two dots of the orange. Oh. Um, I'm worrying. Yep. Definitely recommend doing this before concealer so that it's, like, nicely blended in. Once you're done, hopefully then the liquid. Hello. Okay. I don't know how she did this all in one go. I need my time to blend out, like, step by step. Um, she needs a little work. I'm gonna apply a bit more concealer and then finish the way. I really did not trust the process and almost gave up, but this is. This is a vibe. It's so 80s, but modern. And then the gold highlighter really tops it off. Like, are you kidding me?

    "voice_to_text": "My brand will offer PR as a micro influencer. I'm sick and tired of brands not offering PR. So my idea is to make a brand that offers PR to almost everyone. There's just a couple requirements, but first my brand is gonna be called Secret Scoops because my name on TikTok is Emma. Secrets and figure scoops. It's cute. My color schemes can be very bright and happy. Kind of like preppy if you wanna call it that. None of the stuff in the secret scoops are gonna be ugly. It's all cute. It's gonna offer things like claw clips, bracelets, stickers, pop. Its like just little things like that. Basically the only requirement for receiving PR is to make a video about it. Essentially. I'm not trying to make my brand blow up cause I would like to kind of keep it in the smaller side which is like not what most people want, but it's kind of what I want. I would hate being overwhelmed with a stress of like all the package that would have to ship out. It's just too stressful. But the money! Just kidding, I don't care much about the money. I'm gonna make my products pretty cheap. Like a five dollar mystery scoop will consist of three items and a five dollar mystery scoop will be like maybe seven or eight dollars. It'll vary. I still have to figure out the logistics of it, but let me know if you're interested.",

    "voice_to_text": "Welcome back to country boy. Tries to do his makeup. If you're new here, so am I. So get ready to lower your expectations. We're moisturized, and I'm also going to use some primer this time. We also have a damp beauty blender now and a properly colored, matched foundation from Sephora. I don't think I can do worse. But, yeah, I had a very lovely experience at Sephora, and the experience kind of just made me question all of human existence. You know, it's fairly big topic, so I probably won't get to all of it today. Because it really made me think about, like, if I go into a store like Best Buy, I'll go in and I generally know exactly what I'm looking for, but it's not uncommon for an employee to come up to me and just assume that I don't know anything and just start explaining stuff that I don't care about or that I already know. But at Sephora, I walked in, probably looked terrified. The employees still ask me if I'm looking for a Dewey or Matt finish or something with my foundation, and I. I don't know what that means, but there's something refreshing about starting off by assuming that other people have some level of competence. And means the difference between, like, I want to get out of here as soon as possible and I feel comfortable asking questions and, like, I can actually learn something here. And it goes the other Way in customer service, too. Like, the customer is always right. No, no, they're definitely not. Blend, blend it, blend it. I feel like as I was reading all these tips, I was getting, like, very confident. Like, oh, yeah, this is gonna be. It's gonna be so easy now that I know all these tips. But now that I'm trying it again, I'm like, I don't remember anything. I actually watched a tutorial on this, so I have high hopes. My hopes are already a little broken. Hold on, I'm gonna go check in the mirror. Look, do I feel like I aced it? No, no. And then she used a smudge brush. I don't know what that means, but I have a brush. And do be smudging. Haha. Look, baby steps. I'm just the little guy. Okay, cool. Another tip that I remember is that I can somehow put this under my eyelashes and then blink. See, the problem is, I blink and then I can no longer see what I'm doing. I got it. This time we want to not cross the bridge of the nose, and now we hopefully pull it all together again. How does the wig do it? I'm gonna go listen to some Shania Twain and get ready to fight the patriarchy.",

I am so savvy and business smart, and I see products on here and I'll buy them, and then I'll think that they're not great, and then I'll see somebody talking about them and I blame myself, oh, I was wrong, like, they are great, because I just saw that video. This is patchy. And then I'll buy it again, and then someone will say, oh, you have to do it like this or you have to do it like that. We're not stupid. I mean, I'm not a makeup artist, but basically we want things to be user friendly and just good. And there is a difference between good and bad. And I can't tell you how much lying I'm seeing on here, by the way. It's okay to get paid, it's okay to do commercials, it's okay to partner. What's not okay is like the full scam of just bullshitting people. And I think people are really getting sick of it. I don't know. I know that I am, because I don't trust anything I see anymore. I don't trust what to buy, cause I've spent so much money, like thousands of dollars, buying things that I had no business buying just because it looked so good on here. And that's really, really irritating. So you gotta be more savvy, because unlike television, you know, you. You probably are on here longer than TV. And on TV, you're not always being Advertised anymore. Because you're not my DVR or something else here. It's just like a full fledged commercial network and you've no idea the difference. And I would say air on the side of your being bullshit. God, I'm so annoyed. I'm thinking very specific examples of, like, shit that I just believed and then bought. And I'm like, so annoyed because I know you're doing it too, and you're spending money you don't have and so much lying. So a correction is coming. I can just tell that type of stuff I do now.

Because I had a dream that I had a cotton candy eye look on, so I woke up and recreated that makeup look. But every day, I feel like I'm fighting both within myself and then also with others to try and convince them that this is my artistic outlet. It's really discouraging, especially when a lot of the feminist accounts that I follow for really against makeup for very obvious reasons, but, like, why can't we view makeup more as, like, actual art instead of necessary for one's appearance? Probably gonna get comments disagreeing, as always, but I know makeup was created by men for men, for women to use. If women can never reclaim that back from men, use it and wear it, and state that they're wearing it for themselves. If they're not allowed to even do that, what's the entire point? I think people view activities as more of things that you're doing that aren't actually directly related to you. So, like, playing tennis or playing chess or reading a book. Doing makeup is seen as inherently vain, not only because it has to do with someone's appearance, but also because it is for women. But the industry, the actual makeup itself, has all been developed by men.",

followers because she was going to get this really intense brain surgery and she wasn't gonna be able to work for a while last July she was experiencing some weird hearing problems and it turned out to be a large tumor and this was supposed to be you know a pretty serious procedure but it ended up going not very well and she had this brain hemorrhage and it's fucking horrible cause they had to remove such a large tumor there was a lot of swelling and blood luckily they were able to save her life but she's in pretty rough shape right now she's currently on a breathing tube and has blood in her brain that has not been able to be absorbed so she's on a ton of medications I'm you know blessed with this amazing audience of people that wanna help people and like this is the opportunity to do that so I'm gonna play the rest of her update video so you can see just how much of an amazing person she is I've known her since 6th grade the link to donate to Liana's medical expenses are in my bio and if you don't have money to donate which is totally understandable commenting on this video sharing it with somebody liking the video all that engagement will ramp up the video and algorithm and it will find more people who can donate and it will also pay me for the video so any money I make from this video will be directly donated to Liana including a contribution of my own she's a really good and kind person as you'll see in the video so I just really hope that she gets the support she needs and she pulls through this thank you so much as always and yeah I love you guys yeah makeup art about two years after high school after working as a full time system manager at a retail establishment I was kind of had enough of it and I was like I save up enough money to go to makeup artistry school and get a certification so I said you know what let me just do that now so I did that and then I was looking for jobs in the field and I was already assistant manager of a major establishment so I was making really good money especially compared to what the minimum wage was then so I'd really didn't feel comfortable going and hitting minimum wage and then just making commission because the other only other businesses that were willing to hire like a fresh makeup artist weren't fully established places so I have to work on like a counter at least that's what I was able to find at the time and that's like kind of like the deal to work at a counter make minimum wage you get commission and I just don't like pushing products on people and things like that especially makeup I think it's beautiful but I just don't think everyone you need to have makeup you need to have it so I was like you know what I'll just keep working as assistant manager and see how things go fast forward 2020 I quit that job after I found another job managing a flower shop so I've been enjoying that for a long time but something just was never right I was like you know what this is still not it so in 2023 I went to aesthetic school and I became a licensed institution in the state of Connecticut I graduated in December 2023 I've been professionally doing skin and brows and waxing tinting stains all that kind of fun modalities like microdermabrasion I do hydrodermabrasion soon things like that for the last about five months so I've been really enjoying it I rent a suite out of Orange Connecticut within Ria Aesthetic Lounge unfortunately I will have to close down for a short amount of time maybe two to three months I have to have a major medical procedure um and recovery times different for everybody but I'm just gonna take a you know short break get that done recover and then I'm come back with some new services um and more hours I'm gonna be opening for more hours once I come back I'm just really looking forward to it so but feel free to take that and check out my page see what I've got going on message me with any questions I have a really good professional skincare line here that I really trust uh it's called Hale and Hush you'll see me post about it on my page um other than that I've been doing pretty good I'm really enjoying this I think this is more of my passion I loved makeup but it just didn't feel right I was like I know people are making them happy by making them feel pretty but it didn't feel like enough and I've always been into skincare myself I never like to wear a lot of makeup I love to do it on myself but I didn't like to wear it all the time like I don't wanna wear skin makeup until my skin looked good because I wanted the makeup to sit nicely on it and that's one of the common misconceptions I don't think I need a primer primer primer for makeup to look good on their skin but we really need is good skin care and good skin prep so that's a really important thing that a lot of people don't know and they're wondering why the makeup doesn't look good let's go to your skincare is the most important part if not you don't need to waste money on expensive primer just get some nice skin care products and you'll be good to go well thank you so much for being interested in what I'm doing now and that's all I have for you if you have any other questions feel free to message me thank you so much nice seeing you all",

Gonna blend it out with the real techniques expert face brush. I think it comes in a pack of three. I highly recommend that. You guys should get it. I beat my face. We're gonna conceal with the Too Faced born this way concealer. Okay, now my nose is big. Not contour my nose. Girl, that ship has sailed. Yes! Say the shit with your chest. Now we're going to use my real techniques deluxe crease brush. I just poke be I don't drag, and. Oh, my gosh, yes. Now I'm gonna go in with my Huda Beauty Cinnamon bun under my eye. I've tried the Laura Mercier Powder. Beauty just happens to have this. Like, I don't know. I'm gonna go in with my Sacha Buttercup cup setting powder. We're gonna line it up just a little bit. Like, my under eyes is not as bright as I would like it to. I'm gonna go back with my foundation brush. I'm gonna get a brush like this can have some. I'm gonna take my cream contour palette, the darkest. For wondering. I got this brush set from the TikTok Shop. My favorite part as a girl is blush. You guys are always asking what blush I use. I use this Juvia's placed Festival palette. Just go in between these three colors, and right at the highest point of my face. The my lips, I actually like to use an angled brush with this Milani Gilded Mini Palette. Purple Eyeshadow. That's, like, really deep lip liner to deepen the side. The next butter gloss on my lips, I'm creme brulee finishing touches. The next setting spray. Smells so good. And, you guys, this is it. This is the finished look. The my everyday makeup look. Let me know how you guys like it.",

On vous explique, wesh \u00e7a, de ma face is the black face paint or The Euphoria foundation tee. You can't tell you know why tar in a bottle. Cette vid\u00e9o a \u00e9t\u00e9 vue plus de 11,6000000 de fois en moins de 24h. On y voit 1 influenceuse beaut\u00e9 tester 1 nouvelle couleur de fond de teint d'une marque de cosm\u00e9tique et celle-ci s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre aussi noire que de la peinture noire, c'est-\u00e0-dire pas du tout adapt\u00e9 aux peaux, m\u00eame les plus fonc\u00e9s. When we say that we want you, guys, to make Shades pour Us, we don't mean to go to the Lab and ask for menstruel Black. J'ai trop r\u00e9alis\u00e9 that some people think dark skin people like really Deep dark skin people are Black. C'est pas la 1\u00e8re fois que cette marque est \u00e9pingl\u00e9 par les utilisateurs pour ne pas \u00eatre assez inclusive. En octobre, elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sorti 1 gamme de fond de teint dont la couleur la plus fonc\u00e9e \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre adapt\u00e9e au pot r\u00e9ellement fonc\u00e9. Alors pour rattraper le coup, la marque a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de sortir 10 nouvelles teintes, dont celle qui fait pol\u00e9mique aujourd'hui. Jusqu'ici, la marque n'a pas r\u00e9agi officiellement, mais la cr\u00e9atrice a post\u00e9 1 vid\u00e9o la semaine avant le lancement. Affirment qu'elle avait du mal \u00e0 trouver des mod\u00e8les qui correspondaient \u00e0 la teinte la plus fonc\u00e9e de la marque. Loin d'\u00eatre anecdotique, cette pol\u00e9mique rappelle le manque d'inclusivit\u00e9 de certaines marques de produits de beaut\u00e9. En deux-mille-dix-sept, la chanteuse Rihanna avec sa marque, a bouscul\u00e9 l'industrie du maquillage en faisant la promotion de 50 nouvelles teintes de fond de teintes diff\u00e9rentes. Depuis, d'autres entreprises se sont align\u00e9s, mais il reste difficile pour les personnes noires de trouver du maquillage adapt\u00e9 dans toutes les marques de cosm\u00e9tiques.

I- to \u201cenhance mood  and attraction\u201d whatever-  whatever  that really means I think they were only  around for a year or so and do you remember  when Urban Decay  single shadows  looked like this and they had a different  design on every color so fun!  Mac Tendertones  were wildly popular these were launched  first in May of 2007 they were a mix of a  lip balm and a gloss  with a sheer wash of color they had SPF 12 and  a strawberry kiwi flavor it came in a bunch of  different colours but these are the  specific color names I remember hearing a lot  in the beauty community  that were super popular soft note  hush hush tender baby  take a hint  and pucker they brought these  back a few times  throughout the years and people  always loved them I remember getting  a yellow one it didn't look  yellow on the lips at a cosmetic company  outlet store and I loved it and I loved the sound  of the packaging cause it was a plastic lid  on a little like glass base so it made the most  amazing sound when  you opened and closed it it looks like the last we  saw of these was 2012 and the Smashbox O-Gloss this intuitive lip gloss  came out in 2008 it adjusted to your  pH balance for  your perfect pink a lot of brands  made products  like this like color  adjusting lip products but I remember seeing  this one and thinking  that is so freaking cool it's magic I want it I believe this was  around for several years I feel like I  saw it for years and I think it was  discontinued  around like the mid 2010\u2019s some of these products  are so hard to find  information on but I totally remember them",

If you are a white person saying it'll probably match someone, that is not a valid opinion nor criticism cause it's not actually talking about anything real in reality. You're just assuming it's going to match someone. You don't know anyone that that foundation is going to match because that foundation is not modeled after a human skin tone. I don't know why people that are my skin tone feel as if their opinions on the Euphoria Foundation are of any importance. Because unless you are agreeing with black creators and calling out the problematic behavior of euphoria, why does your opinion have anything to do with this? Like that wouldn't have been your shade anyway. So why are you commenting on it saying oh it's probably like made as a mixing pigment? Like oh like there's probably someone that's going to match? Are you sure? Are you sure about that? You don't have to have an opinion. You don't have to be sharing that opinion, okay? It's not productive. It's taking away from actual important conversations. I just have so many people calling me crazy going back and forth with me because I posted a video saying that that foundation is such a problematic shade. You are not going to convince me that it's not problematic because it is. But also Your opinion on the foundation being problematic when the foundation wasn't even made for you. Why do you feel as if your voice has any weight in this conversation?",

    "voice_to_text": "Every foundation in the world, from the lightest to the deepest, is made with at least these five pigments or a combination of white, yellow, red, black, and even green. With these five pigments, you can make almost any skin colour and undertone that exists. I have a lot of experience creating foundation. I started over 35 years ago with my first foundation palette at MAC Cosmetics up until today with Mauve Beauty Blurring Ceramide Cream Foundation with over 36 shades and four undertones. I even helped Crayola develop their colors of the world crayons so every child could find their shade in a crayon box. Here is one of the charts we use to help develop the undertones at MOB. You can see how the undertones go from pink to neutral to gold and then olive. Depending on the depth and the undertone, it will determine which combination of the five pigments we use. I would call myself a medium neutral to golden undertone. And I'll show you how we use the five pigments to get to eye shape. So we've got the white in the middle, and I'm gonna add some yellow. I'm gonna need some red as well, but you can see that that's a little bit too pink, so I'm gonna have to dull it down a little bit. And that's what the black is used for. The black kind of dulls the color down a little bit, but because I have a little bit of Olive undertone. I'm just gonna add a touch of green. Just a touch. And that's how you need the five pigments to get to my depth and my undertone. In conclusion, foundation shades are nuanced. Everyone has a unique undertone from the lightest shade to the deepest shade. Which is why using a combination of the five pigments are essential in order to create the unique undertones needed.",

    "voice_to_text": "What Youth Foria has done is absolutely so disrespectful and offensive. So this is Gloria, um, she was one of the main people who called out Youth Foria for their lack of deeper skin tone shades, um, for their date night foundation. But what they just had the nerve to do is send her the darkest shade, and it is literally black. Like, just black pigment. Like, it is just black. First of all, I would be offended that they sent that to me thinking that, like, there's no other shades in between, and they're like, oh, here, this is gonna match you, so we're gonna send it. Like, I. I would personally be offended by that because it's like, are you kidding me? Like, I thought you Learned your lesson. And the second thing I'm so. I would be so offended by is that they don't even respect black people enough to put different color pigments into their formulas. There are so many undertones when it comes to black people, and I don't understand how they think that you can just put black pigment in that skin color. And I personally have never met anyone who is this dark. I'm not saying there's not people there could be, um, but I still just. I'm so. I would be so offended that, like, they don't even respect people enough to put enough colors to make actual skin. Like, they don't even think black people have as complex skin as white People, which is so absurd and that it just. It really irks me so much. Addition. The fact that they did not even test this color on actual people who this shade would match is absurd. Like, if you cannot find anyone who matches this, maybe you can release it, but, like, no, just. You need to find someone, and you need to make sure this will work for your consumers. I'm not mad they made this black shade. You know what? Be innovative. Do it. People can use it for whatever they want. I'm more mad that they jump from their darkest shade, which was way too light for Gloria, to this. That is what I'm kind of pissed about, because they did not fix the undertones. They did not make complex colors. They did not make colors that would match actual black people. They just said, we're gonna make a black foundation, and you know what? That's great, but we need the colors in between. I don't have any youth for your products, but I am most certainly not going to be using them, because this is just so disrespectful.",

I'm super stressed because I need to find a model for our darkest shade of Euphoria Foundation, and it was really hard to find models for our four darkest shade. Hmm. So a month ago, we held a casting call to just look for real people, real skin. I'm applying now. The 600 Foundation. The foundation is just too dark. That matches for most of our shades. Except. Except for our dark references. Is Euphoria's darker shade versus Venti's darker. You guys need to stop pretending that it's someone's shade when it's literally not. It's just the color black. Hmm. The brand could not find a shade match in real life. They could not find a person who matches shade. This is black face paint. This is the darkest shade of the euphoria foundation. It's like you guys can't differentiate these colors, and you're thinking that a black. A dark skinned person is going to fit black face paint, that it's gonna be a shade match. No. After launching my fair share of flop, is always my intention to launch this as a proof of concept, see if people even liked the base formula. If the entire project is such a flop that we have to start over, and everything that we've ordered just goes into landfill, not only in 2024 is this so disgusting and disrespectful, but this needs to be Pulled off the shelves",

You doing my hard work for me, you're doing product development for me. And so because of that, we are gonna give you \u00a31,000 to a credit and pop it on the account. So the neat handwriting is from somebody who sent me a letter with loads of suggestions in there. Again, if you have any suggestions, you can always stitch this video or create some ideas and tag me. And if I ever choose your products, then your idea or your concepts, then I will give you 1,000 pound store credit. Cause at the end of the day, you guys are doing the work for me. I appreciate you, I value you. So",

    "voice_to_text": "I want y'all to see something first before folks start gaslighting her and other black creators in the comments. So this is one of Youthforia\u2019s lightest foundations. If you look here at the bottom of the ingredient list you'll notice three different colors. stay with me now. The CI stands for color index and it basically represents titanium dioxide (at the top) *red, yellow, and black iron oxides pretty much the only colors you need to make a lighter shade of foundation, but then if we look at their darkest shade the ingredient list tells a different story. here there's only one pigment CI 77499 which is just black iron oxide. No other colorants. this foundation literally only has pure black pigment. Here\u2019s a close up if you missed it the first time. and before folks say, \u201coh maybe it\u2019s meant as a mixing pigment\u201d That makes no sense. anyone who has ever taken an art class will tell you  that black is a terrible pigment to mix with because it just makes things gray and muddy and skin tones typically have some combination of eumelanin and pheomelanin. The pheomelanin is where we get the red and yellow undertones. And this problem is so avoidable. She literally could have used NARS or Fenty foundation shades as a benchmark. This brand does not care about us \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe",

    "voice_to_text": "Viral products here on TikTok that I personally think are overhyped. Probably an unpopular opinion. These are not flattering on the cheeks, do not work as blush. You have to keep them towards the back of the cheek, and they're better as a blush topper. But these girls I see putting it all over the cheeks, you must have poreless skin, because it ain't gonna work on me. I personally don't understand the purpose behind any bronzing drop, really. I feel like the products I put over top take away the bronze, and unless you self tan, I don't really want my face more bronze than my body. I find that whatever I have underneath any skin care pills up. Whenever I use this, I have to prep with literally nothing in order for this not to pill up. Like, I can't not prep my skin. This product is just a little finicky. It's nice when you apply it with fingers, but if I have the wrong product underneath or if I use a tool, this pills. The wear time on this is not great, but it's so thin, it travels into all of the fine lines. I see all the ads of this being super shimmery. Am I missing something? I see everybody using these blushes. Packaging, super cute, but the formula, it's fine. I feel like there's so many better powder blush formulas on the market. Your girl likes a thick lip oil, and this is so thin. It doesn't fill in any lines of my lips. Two new powders. If you have dry skin, this one can be pretty drying, but this is also $54 for it not to blur away all of my problems. And I love Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, but this powder is even drier than the hourglass. Also went through phase of seeing everybody using these. They are so creamy to the point where I don't have control applying this, and I feel like I can't get a defined line with this. It always looks a little blurred. Not saying that these are bad, but they definitely don't deserve the hype that I'm seeing. Let me know what you think in the comments.",

Apply it by putting it over your nose like this and then dabbing it with a wet towel, and you do it for, like, I don't know, 30 seconds to a minute, and then you peel to reveal.

    "voice_to_text": "The viral inkey list lip balm comes in three tinted shades now, and we have them early. The inkey list sent them to me early, so obviously, we're gonna try them together. The shades are pink tint, mocha tint, and Berry tint. Was wax on my hands, will put them on my lips, all that fun stuff. The first tint will do is the pink one. This is what the tint looks like when it's coming out of the tube. And that's what the swatch looks like on my hand. It's a nice sheer pink. Let's put it on my lips. This is really pretty. And that's what the pink tint looks like on the lips. Also, if you're wondering, it's the same formula in the tints as the clear one. So it's that same tripe peptide plumping lip balm. And that tripe peptide complex is, like, the main plumping ingredient. This is really pretty. And for, like, spring and summer, it's a nice, just, like, kiss of pink. Next we'll do mocha. Also, I feel like some of you are gonna ask. The colors are labeled on the cap, and that's what mocha looks like. I think that's gonna be really pretty. And this is what the mocha lip tint looks like on me. Also, in terms of scent, these are technically fragrance free. There is, like, a natural scent to the formula, and they smell exactly like the clear one to me. And then the last one is Berry. And that's what Berry looks like. This is a really unique, almost like orange Berry shade. This is really pretty too. And the last one, this is Berry. This might be my favorite. So those are the new Tinted Tripe Peptide plumping lip balms from the inkey List? Like I said, I did get these early. They launch May 2nd on the Inkey List's website. So May 2nd if you wanna try them. May 2nd.",

We sat on the couch, we need to go do the dishes. This is what we do. Right everybody? That's what every single person in the UK does. I don't care who you are. If you ask any British person or British family where they are going on holiday this year, I'm telling you now it will either be Tenerife, Gran Canary or Lanserati. If you've never had a Sunday roast dinner, just don't say that to a Brit, okay? It's offensive. And yes, yes you may have grown up in China, that doesn't register with us. It's an it's offensive. We are extremely sarcastic individuals 90% of sub don't take to heart because it's a joke. Not everybody loves the royal family, especially in Scotland. Most Scottish people hate the royals so would avoid bringing it up if you're going out there. The Scottish hate the English. I'm not including myself with that, but generally the Scottish hate the English. English don't hate the Scottish, but the Scottish hate the English. British chocolate is better than you will get chocolate anywhere else in the whole globe. It does not get better than cabbries. Get yourself cabbry Dairy Milk buttons. That's all I'm gonna say. The UK has a huge vaping problem. Don't be stunned if you see a Group of 8 year olds vaping. Unfortunately, that's the world we're living in. When we greet you and say hello and say, are you alright? No, you're. You don't look ill. You're fine. We're just asking, how are you? If you're going to London and you're walking about London, pick pockets everywhere. Be careful. Like for part 2. Love you.

Do you use foundation, you dumb bitch? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. You're not dumb bitch. You're not dumb bitch. But all I'm trying to say is the reasoning that you guys use for no foundation makeup makes no sense. Why are you putting concealer all over your face? Concealer is a more concentrated version of foundation. Just use a lighter foundation if you don't like the cakey feel. Because I promise you, putting concealer all over your face is gonna make it even more cakey. Cause it does look cakey in real life. I don't know.

Flipping adorable. And let's see what the dough foot looks like. Bioma looks so good. A smell test. Oh, it's fruity. Okay, we're just going in. We're just going in. Oh, my goodness. It feels so juicy. She's got a little tug to her, which I do not mind because it's going to last longer. My lips definitely feel hydrated. It's like giving. This is made by a skincare brand.

One of the nicest people in this industry. So talented, a massive inspiration of mine. But, like, you can't look at these two things and say they're a copy of each other, can you? Like, just because they're both at a rectangular component and have a cream and powder formula inside, just like Tom Ford, just like one size, just like dubious plate, just like Charlotte Tilbury, just like every other brand, huh? I'm trying my best here, people, okay? There are only so many different ways you can put two formulas into the same package, and respectfully, I feel like we're doing a pretty decent job in that department so far. But I do apologize if anybody feels like we're copying anybody else. That does bring me to the point of this video today, though. Okay? If y'all are such little sticklers and packaging designers, you be the CEO painted for a day, cause I have a question for you. I've been working on lip balm for the past couple of months for painted because they've been highly requested, and I got these samples in yesterday. Unfortunately, after about four months of work, um, we've decided to completely start over because the formula of this sucks, and I want you guys to have the best. I'm trying to design the Packaging. And I am struggling a little bit because I really want ours to be unique and on branded painted. Uh, but speaking of brands copying each other, I don't know if you guys have shopped for a lip balm recently, but they all look exactly the same, which is also no shade. This is how the beauty industry works. When one component is really great at applying a product, other brands are actually going to use the same component. And I guarantee none of these brands were the first one to invent this packaging, either. So I could design ours with a similar looking tube, but if I do, I know that I'll get comments saying that I read this as well. So I've been trying to brainstorm something a little bit more creative and unique for our packaging. I really am open to anything, as long as it's on brand with painted and the rest of our packaging designs. And also can't be too crazy as well, because I wanna keep these super affordable for you guys. If y'all the packaging police, then you design the next painted product, and if it's good, I'll pay you, maybe even bring you onto the team. Good luck.",

Okay, so yesterday, I was on TikTok Live, and I was battling one of my favorite creators and Auntie Prue. Well, then Michaela Nagrara. There goes right there. Popped in to anti proves live stream and threw 100,000 points against me. You can see the. You can see it at the top. Sneaky snake. If this was the. If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have my team ready to snipe against Michaela's pity. 100 K. But this shows that Mikayla Nagrara is revengeful. She is spiteful. She can't take the gigs, can't take the jokes, and she sniped against me. Girl, look, I have it right here. It's an honor. Look, I. Can you imagine? I'm literally entering this battle with Angie Pru, and then Michaela's like, wait. Oh, hell nah. And I lost the battle. It took my win streak away. So here's the thing. If Michaela wants to do this petty stuff back and forth, just battle me. Michaela, set up a time. In a day, we'll Go on TikTok live. You have your team, I'll have my team, and then we can battle it out. I mean, I don't know what team she has. Last I checked, you got that many? Her and Cody. But we can battle it out. So. Anyways, I challenge Michaela to a TikTok live battle, and I'm pretty sure the odds will forever be in my favor. Let me know what you think about this drama, guys.

Um, I'm referencing the increased risk of lethal angioedema in African American patients that are prescribed licinoproral. Quite frankly, if the rates of angioedema were the same for Caucasians, this drug would have never hit the market. But because the rates of that lethal side effect are only high in black patients, the FDA overlooked it and passed the medication through to the market. While the cough is annoying, the cough happens due to the Renan angiotensin aldosterone system, which basically, it's a function of the lungs. Um, that occurs in the lungs to lower your blood pressure. And it happens in every ethnic group. It's just a side effect of the medication. Um, but it's not lethal. Angioedema is lethal. And on top of all of this, even though the rates of this lethal side effect are so high in African American patients, it is still so commonly prescribed to that population with no warning from medical providers. That is medical racism.",

And that's, oh, that's just what a dude from the 1950s is gonna say. And I couldn't get my nails painted now because think of my mom, dude. My mom raised two boys, me and my brother. How would she feel if I just wasted 18 years of her life where she could have been taking me and my brother to get her nails painted, doing the whole pedicure thing, doing the whole play dates with the nails painted, the whole before bad thing.

And when I say alternative baddies, I swear to god there's always a hair. Anyways, as I was saying, when I say alternative baddie, I do not mean black hair was a nose ring. Not that there's anything wrong with that look either, because I follow plenty of baddies with black hair and a nose ring. But where are my heavily modified influencers? Where are my influencers that just listen to nasty music? And like, don't get me wrong, I know there are like alternative influencers out there, but I don't see any of the girlies with these zero cage septums unboxing 50 PR packages. And I honestly think that needs to change. As soon as TikTok got big, so did the alternative community. But in my honest opinion, I feel like most of the alternative content creators are just being fetishized. And I feel like there is a very small percentage of alternative content creators that are being given the same opportunities as the regular, for lack of a better term, content creators. Like fuck I wanna go to Bora Bora with tart. And this video by no means is me saying like wagon give me free stuff. This is just me simply saying just to be a little more inclusive, give us weird girlies a chance and To the brands that have. Thank you. And this video is by no means me saying I don't like regular influencers, because I actually follow a lot of them, but this is me talking to the big brands. Um, I think you're missing out on a whole demographic here. But what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna tag all my favorite alternative influencers in the caption, as well as people I think deserve a little more recognition, and I want you guys to do the same in the comments. And one last thing before I go, I just wanted to say that everyone has their own preference on the type of media they wanna consume, whether that is alternative people or, quote unquote, normal people. This is just my preference. Okay, bye.",

And it's serial number six. Six, six. Oh my god. She uses everywhere. Here's the color. Oh my God. Jesus, take the wheel. I haven't used a MAC lipstick since the motherfucking 90s, honey. Right. Here's the color. Oh, oh. She essentially used this one lipstick all over her face. Here goes nothing, guys. So we're gonna do the placement where she did this. Now this color looks a little more bright on her, but. Oh my god, A lipstick all over the face? Is this going to work? I am so scared. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay, it's kind of cute. Let's blend. Forget the iconic eye sockets. Oh my god. Okay, let's blend. She literally just uses her fingers and she uses her fingers and she blends and then she uses a sponge. Is this going to be good? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Why is it kind of pretty? Okay, we're blending this out. I look a little sunburned. But why is it really pretty? What the hell, you guys, what do we think? Do we love it? Do we hate it? Alright, let's do the lipstick actually on the lips. Okay. Okay. For on the go, really quick, minimal makeup. This is absolutely beautiful. I don't think anyone would Even know that I used one lipstick for my entire face. Do we love it or do we hate it?",

Who are you? I think it takes away from a woman's natural beauty. And also, it is so bad for you. Like, you think about how skin absorbs things. When you read the ingredients on a foundation bottle, what is in it? You can't even pronounce it. It's a bunch of crap that you're putting on your face, and that is, in turn, making your skin worse. So you have to keep buying more foundation to cover up what it's creating.",

Recipe below  Pre-Ferment 2 \u00bd cups bread flour   \u00bd tsp instant yeast  1 \u00bd cups warm water (110 \u00b0F)  Dough 2 cups  bread flour  \u00bd tsp instant yeast  1 \u00bd tsp coarse salt  1 tsp light honey  2 tsp apple cider vinegar  Water bath 10 cups of water \u00bd cup Dark Beer 1 tsp *Baked* baking soda  3 tbsp dark brown sugar   Instructions - Pre-ferment.  To a medium bowl, add bread flour and yeast.  Mix until combined then add your water. Let that sit at room temp for 2 hours. Right on top of that add your \u00bd tsp yeast, salt, honey and vinegar. Stir until combined then add in half of your bread flour. (only 1 cup) Add flour until you have a kneadable dough ball. Knead that until you have a smooth, supple dough. Divide your dough into 6 equal balls, shape each one then cover with damp towels for 1 hour. Grab a heavy baking sheet that will fit in your fridge, put a piece of parchment paper on top then add a light layer of coarse cornmeal. To shape your bagels, gently flour the tops of them.  Flour your thumb then make a hole straight through the middle. Twist them around your fingers til you get a 1 inch hole. Re-Dampen your towels, cover then refrigerate your bagels for 1 hour. To bake, heat your oven to 425\u00b0F. In the meantime add 10 cups of water to a pot then add *baked baking soda, your favorite dark beer and brown sugar. *Simply bake \u00bd a cup of baking soda 30 mins at 350F then let it cool. Bring to a boil then add as many bagels as you can fit without them overlapping.  Boil them for 1 minute per side. (longer for chewier bagels, shorter for less chewy) Remove them with a slotted spoon to a baking tray. Immediately brush with egg wash (1 egg white + 1 tsp water) then sprinkle with whatever toppings you like. Transfer into your preheated oven for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, rotate the tray then bake for 16 more minutes (flip halfway through) Take them out and let them cool on a wire rack. You can wait a few mins and eat them fresh or wait a couple hours until they are cooled. Make this recipe and let me know what ya think\u2026 Appreciate the support!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udd25 #bagels #bageltok #easyrecipe ",

You let that just sit for two hours, then you add yeast, salt, honey and vinegar right on top. And going with your flour. And you know all the ingredients in the description, and the directions will be in the description box. And then you wanna just need that until you have a nice supple dough divided into six portions. And then you wanna divide those six portions into nice top balls. Parchment paper. Go ahead and cover with damp paper towels. Let that sit for an hour, then go ahead and make your bagel shapes. You know, finger straight through. I love shaping them. That's my favorite part, redamping those paper towels. Put them right over, let rest for another hour. Then, you know, you wanna grab your favorite dark beer, go right into that water, go in with your dark brown sugar. Once that's boiling, you wanna go in with your bagels. Boil them for only one minute per side. The longer you boil them, the more chewy they will be. You wanna go right on with a bunch of egg wash. Um, you can add any toppings you like at this point.

You know what spring means? Bringing. You're gonna be dealing with an excessive amount of flowery looks for the next three to four months. Also means I'm gonna be forcing your ass to do some flowery looks with me for the next three to four months because they're so easy and fast. Why would you not want a flower on your eye when you could have one in five fucking seconds? I wanna brush with like, a thin handle. Doesn't matter what the hairy part looks like cause we're using the back. Start with the main color of your. And I'm just loading up the butt of my brush. We're gonna start by making five circles in this kind of looking shape. Like to start with the top one, just to give me an idea of what the fuck is going on. Maybe lift your eyebrow for a second if you need to, like, fill in a gap. But keep in mind you're not gonna be walking around like this all day. So relax. You're vibing with your paddle shape. You can take the very same brush and your middle color. Who needs a fucking smokey eye? Who needs wing liner? I've had farts that take me a longer time to accomplish than that. To Add a couple little leaves because I felt kind of naked. And these are also super easy. Gonna, like, start with a tip and then stamp down. It makes a little way, but you get these flower basics down, you can be a pro. With this type of flower, I look in no time. Favorite part of this eye that I think really pulled everything together is this green inner corner. Was a little scared it might give conjunctivitis at first, but no, I think it's very cute. Ring sleigh. Guess I can maybe see how normal people might think that face painting an entire flower on your eyes a bit much for everywhere, but, like, at least get with the inner corner. Like, it's fine. You have one life. Be fucking fun. I still have a million earrings that I haven't done yet, but I also have the urge to purchase more earrings. So, like, if you know any little artists on Etsy or something, drop it in the comments.",

So I met someone from the music world, and I said, hey, I need some extra money. You believe in this vision? And I told them the plan, and they said, absofuckinlutely.

I haven't done a crazy amount of digging or looking into it, but from what I understand, when you wake up in the morning, this is all good stuff and healthy bacteria that's sitting on your face and also protecting your face. And skin barrier. Skin barrier? I kind of feel like skin barrier is an overplayed word. Like, it's not that deep. You have your skin cells, the bacteria that's on your skin, and then see them in other oils that your skin naturally produces. Skin barrier. So when you use a cleanser in the morning, you're stripping your skin of all those oils and bacteria that sitting on your skin that should be staying on your skin in the morning. People that have oily skin, this is why you have oily skin. Your skin is overcompensating and overproducing those oils because you just dried it out. I mean, it could also be because you're eating like shit, but so really quick before in the video, this is what you can do. Instead of clinching your face in the morning, grab yourself a rose water spray. Or lately I've been using LA Roche Posay Thermal Water. Spray it all over your face. You're done. Or you can ice your face for 30 seconds to a minute first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up. And then resupply your face with a moisturizer. I always recommend people to use a beef towel moisturizer. And then, like I said, you're done. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you collect vintage makeup, the Volupte Golden Gesture Compact is one of the most coveted compacts to collect. Hand shape compact launched in the 19 forties, and it's rumored to have around 12 different versions. Now, I know a lot of you out there are starting to collect vintage makeup, which I absolutely love. So if you're looking for this compact, I have about 7 of them. I'm trying to complete the collection. But let's start with this one. Is the engagement ring. All you have is the ring, no bracelet. And what you want to look for is absolutely no dings. You want the mirror intact, although it does sometimes get this sort of corrosion that happens to a lot of vintage compacts. And then inside, you want to have the puff. And most importantly, with any compact, if you can find it in its original sheath and its original box, this also came completely clean with no ring, no bracelet, and no nail polish. And this one has the nail polish, but you can actually see it's a little bit tainted. So this is not mint condition. But I just find it really difficult to find these, so sometimes I'll grab them even if they're not perfect. The card playing hand is extremely rare. But speaking of not perfect, I've never been able to find it in mint condition all of these years. So you can see it up close. It is a little bit scuffed, but I had to have it. This one's very special because it's actually on the cover of the holy grail of compact collectors. This is Roslin gerson's Ladies compact's book. Definitely need this. All collectors. In 1948, they launched the gay 90s Mitt. Now, this refers to the Victorian era, the 18 90s, when women would wear the fingerless gloves. This one's a little easier to find. It's the white mitt. There's no ring. And of course, this gorgeous bracelet. And I have one that's even more rare. Now, this one comes with the glove and the ring and the bracelet, and I do have the box for it. This back then would have sold for $7 and \u00a250. And recently, one on eBay went for over 2000 dollars. Now, this one might be the rarest of all. This is the Zodiac compact. And this one came out closer to the 19 50s. A lot of Zodiac compacts were becoming a thing. And this one is intensely rare. It's in perfect mint condition. I have the box, I have the sheath. And this one also would go for over 2000 dollars. If you find these and you don't want them, let me know. Or get them for yourself if you can get them at a good price. Because as you can see, worth it.",
