So instead of sitting here and bitching and moaning about it, maybe go drop out. Maybe go find something else to do with your life. Like, it's not her responsibility that you're in school and that you have to do school, and she figured out a different way to do something with her life. You can do the same. Like, before y'all come at me in my comments, y'all need to realize these idols don't give a fuck about you. They never have, they probably never will, and you shouldn't give a fuck about them, so.",

And I feel like wavy got the vocals, they got the dancing, they got the rapping, but y'all just don't listen to them like that as much as we all say. Yes, we're all. We start all of NCT. I feel like wavy gets less love than the other sub units. I don't really hear people talk about wavy like that. I'm disappointed cause where we be making bangers, okay? It's not just love talk.

    "voice_to_text": "I am actually convinced that Kpop companies are doing this on purpose. Let me explain. So the main reason why they get trainee so young, it's not because, like, younger people are better at the arts. God knows that's not true, but instead, like, they're easier to manipulate to, to make malleable, to make into whatever product that the company wants these kids to be. And a lot of the kids that were trainees in for first and second gen were legitimately really talented kids who grew up to be really talented adults that could expand themselves beyond just being known as like, a K pop idol and an idol group. They started producing and writing. And with talent comes power. It is much easier to manipulate someone when they know that they're mediocre, when you're constantly reminding them that they can't sing well, they can't dance well, and the company has the burden of hiding from the public that they can't actually sing well, they can't actually dance well, and that they can be replaced with another girl that's a blank slate. That can get the surgeries, that can get the skin whitening, that can put on the Gucci in the Chanel and do the same exact thing that you're doing at that time. You are far more easily replaceable when you do not have a unique or extraordinary or even just basic talent. That is not shade. I think that some of the kids that are currently in Kpop had a lot of potential. And I also think that a lot of the training, even back in the day, but especially now, is more about breaking you so that you're convinced that you have to do whatever the grown folk around you are telling you to do. I don't think that K pop is actually training kids anymore to be able to sing and dance on stage. I think it's purely about breaking the kids. It was about breaking the kids this entire time, but now it's not even like, oh, we have to at least have two or three members that can sing really well, or two or three members that can dance really well and advertise how talented they are at this particular skill. And they all have their roles. They saw how SM kept saying that Taemin couldn't sing. Now Taemin is one of the best selling artist solo artist for SM Entertainment to the point that he was able to leave. He didn't need SM anymore. And I really think that is what these Kpop companies are fearful of. These idols having the power through their talents to just leave and not have to listen to everything that they say. But that is my conspiracy theory.",

Why am I seeing these clips torn apart on Twitter and on TikTok by people who usually do not care about that group? And the people in the comments of Disney's video pissed me off so bad, too, because, like, this whole argument of, like, but they're singers. It's their job. Like, this is the bare minimum. And it's just like, you could be the best fucking singer on this planet earth if you just wanna have fun, if you just wanna be goofy, like, be fucking goofy. It should not matter. It should not matter. And then people wanna talk about, like, idols, mental health. They wanna talk about all the pressure on these, like, young idols, and everybody is debuting so young these days. We will have that discussion, and then, like, you will grow, and the next thing will be, like, a group that is newly debuted just being torn apart because of their own core, because of them having fun and Like, you can already tell the impact it has on these idols, with them legitimately being scared, like, it's gonna happen, that people no longer want to win because they will be afraid of the encore and what's gonna happen.

It probably isn't, because, again, I wasn't around when this was happening, so I haven't seen the discourse on it. Yes, it's completely commendable what the staff was willing to do, um, risking themselves like that, but that shouldn't have been necessary. I don't care how big this award show was. To be honest, I don't know which one it was. If it was, eh, one of the smaller ones. So if it was Mama or what it was. I don't care how big it is. If staff see that the stage is literally about to collapse to the point where they're calling staff over to hold the stage up, you're gonna, like, call someone in and get that performance stopped. Get them off the stage. I don't care who it is. Um, this is not something I'm saying just because it's BTS. I don't care which artist was on stage. If the stage is collapsing, and especially when you know a performance of that scale is gonna be taking place, you call that shit off. I don't care how big the award show is. I don't care how much money you've spent on it. It's not worth risking the lives of the artist, the dancers, and the staff, if not the other artists. In the wings watching this, because you can see that the stands are shaking as well. This should have never happened. Yes. It's like, I completely commend the staff for being willing to put themselves at risk like that, but that shouldn't have been necessary. Like, in what world was that necessary? That it is money and getting. Getting the views for. For the show really more important than these people's lives. Like, legit, this. This shouldn't never have happened. I know this is not. Probably not an original take, but to be honest, I. The only takes I've seen from this has been people praising the staff, and I am also praising the staff who are willing to hold the stage up, but I am very much criticizing that none in that staff called off the performance as soon as they figured out what was happening. That is deeply unprofessional and inhumane, to be honest. You are willing to risk people's lives and physical health for the show to keep going?",

He is my golden boy of stray kids, and probably one of the best purchases I ever made was this photo colored right here that I bought outside of an 80s concert for six bucks. And for not being my bias, I do tend to get him a lot and pre order benefits. It's kind of fascinating, really. And like, sometimes I just keep him because he has pink hair or because he has silver hair or because he's holding Jenny Rick. It's really, truly an interesting experience. And again, he's holding Jenny Red, so, like, how could I say no? And then you got the classic peace sign kind of action going on here in the fit is on point. So again, how am I supposed to say no? Especially when he's coming in something I'm already buying anyway. But this. This is Lino, and we call him a bias wrecker. But probably one of my favorite photo cards of Lino is this one right here. He's holding a little Dinosaur. Isn't that neat? I think it's neat. And you know the best part about this one? It's double sided. So from the back he's giving you a peace sign, which can either mean a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your country of origin. And this. This is Han, and he's just the cutest little bean that ever beaned. He's a quoko, but also just A silly, goofy little guy who also has a penchant for acting sexy when he should be behaving. He also likes hats. And, you know, I really can't blame him for that. And then this one. Well, that one. That one, that one. Yeah, yeah, if, you know, you know. And as you can see here, he likes peace signs and hats. Sometimes the peace signs come with hats. Other times, we forgo the peace sign for either a cheek, heart, or whatever this is. It's by his cheek, and it's really cute. I don't know why he does it, but he's doing it. And then. And then, as if that wasn't enough, we have iron. And really, with this PC alone, you get the entirety of his personality. And the jokes truly do right at themselves. That is a baguette he's holding, just in case you're wondering. And then, finally, finally, we have my little bean, young man. And with this PC alone, you get the entirety of his personality. Yes, he likes to poke stuffed animals in their peepers. Why he does that, I don't know, but it sure is endearing. And in this one, he's got a little flower crown. But don't worry, he can also be safely pictured with real dogs and not poke them in their peepers. I don't think it's a waste of money, Mel. Can I call you Mel? And then, of course, there's a fan art that I could get into, but I don't think we have time for that, Mel. I don't think you have the patience for it either. But I could go into heavy detail about it.",

K-Pop choreography takes from a bunch of different choreography and then puts it into one. So to take one person's vision and then to hate on specific parts of it just feels wrong. Whenever someone creates something, whether it's dance or anything, it has a strong connection to them personally because it's what they want to express with whatever fits the vibe or the music or whatever they're going for. So just because it doesn't matter what you want or what your vision is or what you think is right doesn't mean that it's bad or objectively anything. As someone who sometimes creates content related to K-Pop, (because\u00a0I\u00a0also\u00a0make\u00a0K-Pop\u00a0dance\u00a0videos) I think that we need to have more respect for the creative process in general. There\u2019s a lot that goes into it and it\u2019s not just someone who creates the final product. These are real people that are creating things and putting themselves in a position where they're likely to be judged by people who maybe don't understand what they're going for. So to make videos like this that aren't productively contributing to conversation or adding anything, and instead just judging what people already created, it stops people from creating what they authentically want to create or what they believe they want to express which is where real art comes from. So (again) I don't wanna be ruining the fun or be a Karen or anything, but I'm just saying, we need to have more respect for the people that are creating the artistry that we're consuming and enjoying, that's all.",

    "voice_to_text": "Who then, shortly after outing this high ranking police officer, allegedly took her own life. I've seen a lot of this over the past few days and I really think it needs to be addressed. So this is referencing the Burning Sun documentary that the BBC dropped over the weekend. And particularly this is about the involvement of Harugu, who was a member of the girl group Kara, and how she helped investigators, um, with the case that they were building. And I just wanted to say and put it on the record that there was nothing alleged about her passing. Um, I've seen a lot of that. I've seen that, you know, her death was definitely suspect and things like that. And if you know anything about her, followed her story, you know that's bullshit. Hara suffered with her mental illness openly for years. She attempted to end her life many times before she finally succeeded. There was nothing alleged about her ending her life. There was nothing. There was no mystery behind it. Um, she had a troubled past and a. A. A troubled soul and that was extremely unfortunate, but let's not sensationalize it and make it into something that it wasn't. Hara should be remembered as being a hero for doing what she did to help these victims. She was a victim herself, as it says in the documentary. Um, that's how we should remember her. And not trying to make clickbait and get engagement in You know, bullshit accusations that because of her involvement in this scandal, that somehow that's what ended her life. It's bullshit. And the involvement. Nobody knew she was even involved when she was alive. All that came out after her passing. The reporter came out long after she was gone and said Hara helped. So as someone who was a fan of hers and a fan of Kara's, it's kind of irritating that I'm seeing a lot of this stuff. Um, it just needs to stop. The watch the documentary. The documentary is terrible enough, and the things that happened were terrible enough. We don't need to sensationalize extra parts of it just for, you know, clickbait, bullshit reasons.",

I just looked up the global side and if you bought it on the global one, like the set, you also get a unreleased photo and the Polaroid type photo feature. You get an extra Polaroid. You get a Polaroid? Fuck y'all bitches. Cause I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. But like, the few times that I've like, almost bought something off of weverse and I did global, it wouldn't let me. Because I think it might have had something to do with specifically where I am in the US. Miss Lindsay. Girl, you're on the east, you're on the west coast, you're in California, and where you get all the. You. Where y'all get all the. Nice did. I'm on the east coast in the south, so like, I don't get shit. That's ghetto as hell. And the set was cheaper. That's also ghetto as fuck. I paid $122 including shipping. Also, fuck shipping. That shit is unnecessarily expensive. 20 extra dollars? Fuck, bro, it was already 94, but whatever. What the fuck ever. But I'm Super glad that I got it! Thank you for making that video for me, even though I didn't and I didn't even get to see it until after I bought it, so. Oh my gosh. But I'm super excited! I don't think mine comes till like July or something. It is what it is, I guess.",

    "voice_to_text": "when I first saw that price I said wow that's so high it's not even the highest that I've seen I saw a girl she was joking she was jokingly trying to buy floor tickets for like an NCT dream concert and it said 4K for what\ud83e\udd14 4K for what bro\ud83e\uddd0 like it's that's too crazy is and the thing is the NCT Dream pre sale was good it was really good because they didn't let you just buy the membership whenever you wanted it was you buy the membership and then you wait like 24 hours before and then you can get your code to get into the pre sale I'm like okay so it was mad chill it was mad clean for that pre sale I went in there I got three tickets for around $300 divided that by up in the 100s all them tickets came to around a little bit over 100 beautiful hmm any the one time I'm happy with SM whoever at SM did that get all your flowers \ud83d\udc90 get a raise because you deserve that so much\ud83d\udcc8 because if you don't do it that way pre sell does not matter at this point pre sell does not matter\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I don't do pre sale at all I just wait wait like a week or two and then you'll get a reasonable it's still high don't get me wrong it's still crazy high but a reasonable ticket like txt I saw them last time when they came to Charlotte right what I spent over like two something for a nosebleed \ud83e\ude78ticket I said I was gonna go because they were in Charlotte and they never come to North Carolina so I'm like okay cool this time I said if I see a ticket I am not going if I'm all the way in the back and that seat is as expensive as I did the last time I said it needs to be in the one hundreds for a reasonable price and it was it was cheaper than when I spent on those nosebleeds and I'm still in the one hundreds in a good view at and I waited wha\u23f2\ufe0f a week I waited a week for them prices to go down cause everybody would like oh man I can't get a ticket god easy good um the one that was easy and I just did general admission was P1 Harmony for their Atlanta stop that that was great it was like one something I don't know exactly where I am in the auditorium but it's not a bad seat I could see everything focus on but there are two things I wanna say one the people who bought their tickets for NCT Dream and then because it got opened early at like 4:00 o'clock in the morning and then had to get their stuff refunded\ud83d\ude31 how are y'all doing \ud83e\udd14 cause I feel bad for you because you were there for the opportune time and then your money gets refunded and you're like wait \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude2b but that was my money to buy this ticket and now you stuck in the back is like I had floor and now it's gone oh oh \ud83d\ude2b I feel bad for you that was mad messed up but I also know whoever at ticketmaster is getting remed for that one secondly secondly different K pop group altogether those people that are able to afford the floor seats for multiple stops how do you do that\ud83e\udd14 like how does that happen cause I keep on hearing about enhyphen and the same cyclical people getting floor seats how is that happening how much money are you making to be able to do that\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc40 like you grown? grown and you how cause even if you're grown right we've been seeing these prices for just the general price that these K pop groups have been putting down they be like oh be like 600 500 700 dollars before FEES and you just got like yeah\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb5 just got a couple grand and then you gonna do the flight to the next stop in the hotel doing that getting possibly getting parking and getting rental feeding yourself do y'all have jobs \ud83e\uddd0 cause you should apparently y'all do before how much money you put down I don't how anyway my moral of the story is stop doing these pre sales unless these companies start doing what NCT Dream did there's no point in doing these these pre sales anymore just wait a couple weeks because that dynamic pricing can't kick in if nobody's there to do that crap the people who actually do their presale thing can get a reasonable price and then it just trickles down later on",

But let me just go through everything that is Day 6 related that I have right here because Day 6 are my old so I have quite a bit of them. Okay, so on the small shelf I have my signed shoot me album. That's the first signed Day 6 album I have. Then I have forever, which doesn't really fit. I know. Everything's a mess right now. And I have my two one pill albums. I have the other one somewhere else. Then I have the Sunrise album and I have remember us, you've part 2 and honorary mention my J album. On top of that shelf we have the even of day summer vacation stuff, I think the 4th Gen fan club, and my Moonrise final. Also have Bang laying here in his fancy suit. And my sign gravity album, but I don't really know where to put that right now. Plus my forever poster you get with the forever album and one of my concert posters from Soul. Then we have two letters with notes because I bought one and then I got one for free. Then um. Concert DVD and the book of us. And then 4th gen fan club thingy I just put up there. We have the night lamp or whatever it is she got with the 3rd gen fan club and First version light band with Daydream under it. And then we have the Japanese releases, or at least some of them. We have unlock stop the rain and if. And then we have third version of the Light Band with the 3rd gen fan club. We have the memory book and the 3rd gen fan club photobook something. Yeah, and young case eternal in the corner. I only have one version of this, but the young one itinerary. And then the youth World Tour DVD. Oh, let me not mess anything up. And yeah, he's just still chilling there, don't mind him. So we have the entire book of us series except the gravity version. I have signed that. I don't have duplicates of that. And then the two first versions of the light band with Moonrise standing right there in the back. And we have out of the blue by Dawn. I didn't know a physical version of this like album existed before I went to Korea, which maybe I should have known. Also forgot to mention, right next to the young one I have my other version of Moonrise. Then we have today which is the first mini album, and the Best Day which is one of the Japanese releases, I don't really remember which one. And I have my cup sleeves which quite a bit of these are of Yankee because I was there when it was his birthday in Korea. Also have the 2019 season's greetings Hiding in the back. And of course, we can't forget. Um, yeah. Yeah. I have a song. Jin. Also, photo cards. I don't really collect. I just have the ones that I've pulled mostly, and then I've bought a couple because I thought it would be nice to have. But. Yeah, I kinda wanna buy more photo cards, but I'm also like. Photo cards are not really my thing. Oh, went a bit too far. Yeah. So I have some, but not a lot.",

He just made it one day. So now it will stay on my wall until I die. This is my reputation Snake Karen. She is currently a witch, as you can see by her costume.

I see some of y'all in the comments like thinking that it's funny, giggling about it. But do we need to address again that a fan site does not equal a saucing? Yes, it's pretty common for a fan site to also be a saucing. But there are people that are just fan sites that show up to concerts, bring these cameras, and take really good pictures. And of course there are negatives to that, especially if they profit off of it. Or they purposely do that just to sell the photos. But by just seeing someone at a concert next to you that has one of those cameras, you can't automatically assume that they are saucing. Now if there's added context to the situation where this saw saying was acting purposely rude or sitting in a seat that they weren't supposed to be in, or if they laid hands on this person first, I would understand. But it just seems like out of nowhere this girl's trying to take a picture and this person, OP, does not agree with the fact that she has a big camera like that. But let's all have a level set and agree that it is not okay to lay hands on each other just because you don't agree with it.",

This \u201coh I'm a real fan because I've been around for longer.\u201d \u201coh I'm a real fan because I know their birthdays.\u201d \u201cI'm a real fan because I stream their music 24 hours a day.\u201d I don't know if this is a hot take, but I don't think you're entitled to a concert ticket or merch or whatever just because you've been a fan for longer. At the end of the day, they're making the same amount of money from someone buying a ticket, whether they've been a fan for three months or a fan since six years ago. If anything it's a good thing seeing people promote this tour! People go to concerts all the time and then become fans because of it! And if they have more people coming to the tour,  they're more likely to come back for another one! I don't get why you're mad.",

    "voice_to_text": "Stays are coming through my DMS to tell me to myself, aside from the fact that stays are bullying. Literally one of the loveliest days on this app. The racism issuing this fandom has been here. And it's so stupid too, because the people that you Stan are people of color. But anyways, let's get into it. In 2,021, Hyunjin was under fire for the whole blackface thingy. People were asking him to apologize and everything. And when stray kids finally posted an apology, people went crazy in the fucking comments. People were like, no, all lives matter. It's not just black lives matter. A lot, a lot of states were saying this. And on top of that, a lot of black states were getting hate messages, death threats telling them to leave the fandom or to off themselves. And I'm like, what the actual hell? Like, in that situation, I can understand if you think that they didn't have to apologize, but when it doesn't concern you, you shut the fuck up. Right? And this has been going on since the beginning of Stray Kids, because when Chan wore the cornrows at that show, that award show, like, people were like, no, you can't do that! You can't do that! And the amount of hate black fans got for saying that, for telling him that that was cultural appropriation. Bullying this poor girl because she decides to put morals over K pop. More worried about your face getting the Amount of streams that you want them to have, then about your face. Doing the right thing and collaborating with the right people and not hanging out with fucking Zionists. Like, do you understand how fucking crazy that is? A lot of people here or so performative, or posting, oh, free Palestine, reposting videos for Palestine and stuff like that. But then you're like, no, I won't participate in this boycott because it's affecting Stray Kids. Girl, Stray Kids has so many fucking songs you can stream. This is not gonna kill them.",

    "voice_to_text": "On bubble in the past 24 hours, also with all eight Instagram accounts. They have not. Please go watch the full video that I just did so you can kind of get a better idea of, like, the point I'm trying to make here. But multiple people have already brought up the point that Stray Kids have been completely silent as soon as this collab. I refuse to say the name of the song cause I am not promoting it at all. This collab. Um, they have not said anything once it was released. And even though, yes, that is true, and yes, it is saying something to us, like the fact that, like, we're reading it in a certain way, because, like, they usually do say something. I will say, though, as much as I can see that they are possibly becoming aware of the situation or now are aware of it and they know what's going on, and they're refusing to, like, engage with anything now, even though they're doing that and we're receiving that message that way, I still think that given how in the past, when they were silenced for one reason or another and they weren't allowed to make statements about anything, they have found a way to say something. Chan specifically has found a way to communicate with us and let us know that he's hurt us and he's learning and he is trying to do better. So as much as I am acknowledging That they are being silent about the collab now that it's released and they are not promoting it at all themselves. Personally, I am still keeping an eye out because the benefit of the doubt is getting smaller. And as much as I love straight kids and as much as I love their music and want to support their music, they are part of a company that's part of the problem. And if removing myself from the fandom for a very short time by blocking them or whatever you wanna consider me doing by blocking them, if that's what it takes to send a message out to the company, that's what we need to do. Like, at this point, it's not like at this point, it's not about who's a fan of who, who's most supportive or not. We are talking about companies that are funding the killing of innocent people. I have gotten so many comments in the videos that I've posted saying, what's the point of this? The company is the one that's a Zionist. The company is the one that's taking the money from these people. The come. Okay, then the company is making money through Stray Kids. Cut off the money through Stray Kids.",

Okay, fair enough. In western media, you have the ROM com, but the ROM com kind of died out, right? So there wasn't really anything decent romance levels coming out. Okay, like, maybe around, like, 2,010. Like, the romcom was dead. So what. What do we have for love? Like, sure, you had TV shows, but the. The focus was never on love. It was the TV show with love. No, but that wasn't. Love wasn't the main focus, right? Unlike K drama. So I was super into ROM coms. I watched every single fucking ROM com I could possibly find that sounded interesting, which was most of them. Um. And then I kind of watched them all already. So then my ex was, like, super into anime, so I got super into anime. I really like the ones that were romances, but the problem with romance anime is usually it's only one season and they cancel it. So, okay, yeah, there's manga, not for TV. There's not really anything to watch. So then I was like, let me check out K drama. And, like, that's the thing. There's always gonna be another K drama. And even if there's not really any decent romance K dramas coming out, the moment, like, what one you can do The J dramas and the C dramas and the Thai dramas and all that kind of stuff. But, like, there's also, like, a massive backlog like this. You. You never gonna run out of K drama to watch. Like, you're never gonna run out. There's always gonna be something, even if it's not exactly what you're looking for. Like, there's always gonna be something. Like, you. You have to admit, as K drama watchers, in comparison to, like, what western media there is, we're very well fed because, like, what. What western media have. They have Bridgerton. That's fucking it, really. Like, what else is there? Okay, you have wrong cons, when it comes to TV shows, Bridgerton, maybe, like, Love Sick. Yeah. There's not a lot.",

    "voice_to_text": "This stays. Armies and blinks working together. That is the unholy Trinity. You have truly done some. I need y'all to understand how wild this actually is, that the unholy Trinity that she just mentioned was actually, like, summoned together. And just to show how, like, these paparazzi photographers really brought K pop fans together during Kingdom, in their final performance, as the one that we were gonna vote for, to make sure they win. Right? They did remixes of iconic songs. Icon, one of the performers, one of the. Sorry, one of the groups competing, they performed with Lisa from Blackpink. Okay. They performed with her. She was there. And Stray Kids did their gods do to do Deadpool whole thing. That went viral. Whatever. But while we were voting for those two performances, like, as international fans, everyone, we had to go on YouTube and stream it. The streams, what we're gonna count as vote. Well, given that they were both, like, Black Pink songs that were, like, involved or, like, Lisa was part of icon, Stray Kids use Black Pink for a song. All the fandoms. And when I say all the fandoms, even fandoms that didn't have groups competing in Kingdom got together to vote against Stray Kids because they were not gonna have Stray Kids win with a Black Pink song when one of the other people actually had a Black Pink member in the group. My words are really not coming to me today. They were not gonna have. This is their logic. They were not gonna have someone using a black pink song beat a group that actually had a black pink member in it. That was the whole thing. And when I tell you every single fandom and their mother decided to vote for icon will stream icons performance instead of stray kids and stays. We were in the trenches. We were streaming all on our own. I mean, obviously, like, there was other people that knew that it was ridiculous that the fandoms are doing this. And, like, they were Maltese and like 18. You were helping as well. Like, don't get me wrong, around Kingdom is when, like, stay teenies really derailed. We used to be married. What happened anyways? Little sidetracked. My point is, is that these photographers messed up so bad that they brought together three of the bigger fandoms that usually don't really interact with each other and kind of, like majority of the time kind of beef with each other for no reason. Honestly, I think fan wars are dumb. This is the kind of fan where I'm down for the war against the people that disrespect K pop idols.",

That was abysmal. That was horrific. We know that the American media is trash. We know the American paparazzi is trash. Always have been, probably always will be. They are the scourge of the earth. But to have them treat these boys like this, it's hard to form words because this was such a big opportunity for the boys. This was a huge deal. This was great for their exposure. This was great for their careers. And then to turn around and see that there were comments like in this previous video that I stitched made. Not only that, but I have seen the racist comments that I have seen surface that they experience while on that carpet. Awful. Disgusting, horrific. I hope every single one of them loses their jobs. Because in no dimension was that acceptable behavior. Shame on all of you.",

Ummm..I genuinely don't know. I feel like I would be.. Knowing myself I'd probably be like.. Like.. in shock ! Cause I'm not a lucky person dude ! Things like this will never happen to me. And no, that\u2019s not just what I like, I'm just.. (I\u2019m not sure what I said here, but this is what I heard, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense \ud83d\ude2d) I- Let's just say.. I think I'm very unlucky.. to the point where I say I'm cursed. Let's just say that. Okay..so if that were to happen to me\u2026 It will be like God telling me\u2026(aish - meaning: Ah shit) it would be like.. Dude just..ahem, I don\u2019t wanna say it out loud. But..like I would..I really\u2026 Okay, I went through the comments under that..video, that I'm stitching right now. Anddd, it sounds like no one would really approach them, out of respect. Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay.",

I literally recorded every performance from nature and Dream Note. Um, even since like, their debut song for like, so my love. Their song girls was literally revolutionary. Like, they were truly the essence of what made K pop. K pop for like, 2018 era. I hope they're gonna make like, personal Instagram cause I really do wanna keep up with them.

    "voice_to_text": "This is honestly unbelievable. So last night the. The Conservative Party here in the UK, Rishi Sunak, they just announced that if they win the general election on July 4th next month, they will be bringing back national mandatory service for when you turn eighteen. This is not a joke, this is 100% serious. So basically now if they do win, going forward, if you're 18 years old, both male and female, you'll have a choice of either doing one year full time in the military or if you don't wanna do that, you will have to volunteer one weekend every month for a year, carrying out a community service. So say goodbye to your weekends because this is mandatory for any of you that. That that think you're just gonna refuse to do this. You will face potentially non criminal sanctions if you do. Oh, and here's the kicker. So this isn't some plan that's like scheduled for 10 years in the future. They say that the first teenagers to take part in this will be in September 2025 next year. So I guess the natural question is why? Well, Rishi says here that it will bring back the national spirit that emerged during the pandemic. And that his two daughters, well, they will too be doing their national services. Well, so yeah, I mean you're probably thinking at this point like, okay, well, fine, no one's gonna vote for him now. But I kind of think it could be the exact Opposite. Like, yeah, young people, they would hate it and that they're not gonna vote. But conservatives are not really after young people's votes. Like, their majority is like 40 to 70+. Like, I don't know, just think about how many people in the older generation look down at Gen Z, Gen Alpha and think, like, you're far too soft nowadays, you know, you need to get off of TikTok. And a good year in the military, that'll really sort you out. So, yeah, I mean, it's hard to believe, but I. I think that this is gonna get more support than you think. But anyway, let me know what you guys think about it. Do you think it's good? Do you think it's bad? Just let those comments rip.",

And it was right around the time I figured out how my live nation contract worked. It was right around the time I figured out how my record deal actually worked. How did that make you feel? It was like panic attacks. It was like oh my gosh, if A plus B equals C, I'm never gonna pay this back. I'mma be on the road 11 months a year just trying to pay back live nation. They're getting everybody coming 12 ways 12 times Tuesday. Are you with live nation? No, I paid myself out of the deal and I had to pay 25% extra on what they advanced me. When you figure that out on the road and you're thinking man, why did we buy 300 rolls of toilet paper? Why do we have to spend this much on catering everyday? Wait a second, what? In my contract it says, cause it's not their money, you gotta spend this much on catering and it comes out of my pocket? Yeah, then I have to pay an advance back. And by the way, the advance that you have to give me is only on hard ticket sales. So the concept called peanuts, parking and alcohol. When I sell out 10,000 people at Jones Beach, the person who buys a twenty dollar hot dog I don't see a dime of that. Person who buys forty dollars for parking, I don't see a dime of that. And the person who buys twenty dollar vodka and Red Bull, I don't see a dime of that. And then you advance me a million dollars and tell me I'm rich. To then find out that you're making four million dollars a night. It takes me 36 shows to pay back one million dollar you advance me. It's a loan. It's a fake loan. It's a fake loan that it's like, we're gonna give you a loan so you can make our money off of your creation. And then it hit me, oh my gosh, they own all the venues. It's a monopoly. So then now they just want my body in this room so they can sell food and alcohol. So then they're gonna make tons of money. And then they got me like schlepping around the United States talking about I wanna be famous. So when you figure that out, Joe Small pays $20 for a hot dog and I don't see that. And if I'm only making my advance back on hard ticket sales, that means I have to sell out every single venue in order to not go in the red. Cause I'm only paying my advance back on hard ticket sales. And by the way, reserve the right in the contract to put the tickets on sale. So when it's $100 a ticket and they do Their summer blowout sale. The tickets are only $10. So instead of me paying back $90 a ticket, right before I go on tour, they drop a John Bellion sale and the tickets are only $10.",

He must be hard. Many are saying how her attitude is very selfish and how she doesn't care about her fans who are actually studying, which comes into the next topic. Due to all of the memes made over that post, many decided to bring back her Coachella performance. Her recent Instagram post is being filled of nets, some comments saying how she should be grateful of even being in Luceraphim Boon Che ah what are you gonna do?

But we are not here today because live Nation ticket masters conduct is inconvenient or frustrating. We are here because, as we allege, that conduct is anti competitive and illegal. Our complaint makes clear what happens when a monopolis dedicates its resources to entrenching its monopoly power and insulating itself from competition rather than investing in better products and services. We alleged that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live concert industry in the United States for far too long. It is time to break it up.",

All I saw on that phone was a list of phone numbers. A past online post from 2008, allegedly made by the singer's mom, has resurfaced. The post alleged that Zico was swearing at his girlfriend, calling her a B word and kicked her desk repeatedly. His teacher was witnessed his hot temper. The post also allegedly included a picture of him, his mom and his teacher. Some people have said that they are glad he is finally being exposed and that male idols are not to be trusted.",

And I've been like, oh, should I put a, like, hollow sleeve in there? Do you put a photo card in there? What do you do? Right? And it just occurred to me just now that I could cut that out. I could cut that spot out of the page, and then it wouldn't be there. It just be a hole. Would it look better as a hole? I don't know. Let's find out. I'm getting Scissors. I thought at first, exact knife, but I feel like this would be more precise. Like, you just snip a hole in the middle and then cut around it. Gem is my assistant, so I'm not gonna be an insane person. I'm gonna take out the cards first. Okay, here's the result. Let's put the cards in. Okay. Why do I think it looks kind of good? Obviously, you have to be careful. Okay. That looks kind of goofy as shit. You know, you just gotta be sure not to clip any of the, like, seam. I don't think it's terrible. It's probably one of my better diys. It's not the stupidest thing I've done today, but I kind of, like, there's just nothing there. Like, there's nothing meant to be there. So they just be a little black, almost like a black filler. Right? There. So weird to have like 60 pages with a hole in the center. I probably won't do this on my pages just because as much as I love Meow Cafe, these still aren't the pages for me. You know, I've said before, like, I want, um, a pocket that will fit a no sleeve photo card perfectly. And these just kind of like, are sliding all over the place because of the extra room. So do I wanna go through all the effort to trim like 60 pages of a middle hole? Probably not, but you never know what I'll get up to. But you know what else could be cute is say you got this hole here, right? And you've got a wider black binder. Sure. You could put a different sticker there, like each week so there's like a different filler and it'd be on every page cause there's a hole in every page. It's late. I'm getting up to some weird diys",

Seoul South Korea well BBC just dropped a documentary about it with new details and footage that has never been seen before whether you've seen it or not let's talk about it so if you know anything about Kpop you know that before BTS there was a group called Big Bang and the youngest member of the group was a guy named Seungri who was only 15 when they debuted well Seungri became known for his partying lifestyle and he loved the partying lavish lifestyle so much that he even became to be known as Seungtsby known after The Great Gatsby he opened up a club in the most affluent district of Seoul South Korea known as Gangnam at the Le Meridian Hotel known as the Burning Sun and Seungri and a couple of his other kpop idol friends including Choi Jong-hoon who was the lead guitarist of the Korean rock band known as FT Island Jung Joon-young who was a very popular singer at the time amongst a couple of other kpop idols but these three were the most active and they would send each other videos to a group chat of themselves taking advantage of women for instance in this video before he says hey friend he had just \ud83e\udef4 a woman who clearly did not want that to happen those videos of themselves taking advantage of and forcing themselves onto women were \ud83e\udee3\ud83c\udfa5 videos which means that they were completely \ud83d\udeab legal and they would laugh about it and I mean they would laugh about some of the most despicable things that I've ever read yep and at Seungri\u2019s club the Burning Sun which at the time was the largest and most hyped up club in all of Seoul South Korea and because it was so hot at the time they were able to sell VIP tables for upwards of $75,000 a table some nights and because they paid such a disgusting number for just a table at a club these men would think that they deserve something more for paying $75,000 a table and because the club was owned by Seungri who himself was using the club to \ud83c\udf47 women they set aside an area that was further down below than the rest of the club that was built specifically for the use of the Super VIP customer and if one of the VIPs fancied one of the women that were at the club that night it would be the responsibility of the employees of Burning Sun to get that woman for the VIP no matter what it took and this is an actual text exchange between some of the workers that worked there to help find a woman and often times they would use sub stances to incapacitate these women for instance a young woman who frequented the Burning Sun decided to get a VIP table with all of her girlfriends one night and after only one or two drinks she started to feel really \ud83e\udd74 and in fact the last thing she remembers is telling one of her girlfriends I think I need to stop drinking because I'm feeling way too \ud83e\udd74 only after one or two drinks and the next thing she knows she wakes up without clothes in a hotel room with a guy that she doesn't know afterwards in order to be able to go home safely even after she told the man \u201cplease\u201d \u201cI just wanna go home because I miss my mother\u201d he forced her to take a selfie with her where she's forced to smile and put up a peace sign so that afterwards he could say that it was all consensual a female patron of the Burning Sun was\u00a0even\u00a0secretly\u00a0recorded\u00a0while\u00a0being\u00a0essayed\u00a0inside\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0red\u00a0bathroom and went viral after it was uploaded online Jung Joon-young and Choi Jong-hoon even\u00a0gng\u00a0\ud83c\udf47\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0Jung\u00a0Joon-young's\u00a0fans\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0club\u00a0with\u00a0multiple\u00a0other\u00a0men and secretly \ud83c\udfa5 it and they quite literally thought that they were above the law and\u00a0they\u00a0essentially\u00a0[were] because they had a really high ranking man in the police department in their pocket who ended up being so high ranking that he worked directly for the president of Korea his identity was only revealed because K pop idol Hara knew Choi Jong-hoon from their training days before they debuted used her connection to urge Choi Jong-hoon to give her the identity of that police officer that she then gave over to the reporter who then shortly after outing this high ranking police officer allegedly took her own lyf even before this scandal broke Seungri who was under the YG label starred in this documentary for Netflix called YG's Future Strategy Office where they pretended like all of the misfits from the YG label were being sent to this office and in that documentary every single member of Blackpink talked about how uncomfortable Seungri made them feel and Jennie from Blackpink at one point on stage in front of a live audience even said to Seungri hey I heard you say that I touched your shoulder at the background but I never did that Jung Joon-young was only sentenced to 6 years in prison after being convicted of essay as well as secretly \ud83c\udfa5 women and then had his sentence reduced to 5 years because he wrote a letter about how sorry he was Choi Jong-hoon was only sentenced to 5 years in prison after being convicted of 2 separate instances of gng essay and then had a sentence reduced to 2yrs and 6 months because he reached his settlement with his victims Seungri was only sentenced to 3 years in prison for 9 different charges but was released only after 18 months is currently now a free man and was even seen doing appearances in Malaysia as recently as January of this year and even with the closing of the Burning Sun close to 5 years ago the nightclubs in South Korea are still actively participating in the \ud83d\udea6ing of young women with the system that shows that they clearly don't care about the well being and safety of Korean women it's no wonder that Korean women are fighting the ptrchry  and refusing to mate with Korean men",

That is May 20th at 7 p m. So I'm gonna post this video, and it's probably gonna be in about an hour. That is gonna be released. Now, if you're ordering from us, once you hit 7:00, you are gonna be able to pre order the poster set or you can pre order the D day, like, original DVD thing. Now, if you're doing Weaver Shop Global, it is gonna be all three options. So you have the poster set with the DVD, you have the DV itself, and then you have the poster set. To be clear that it's not a DVD, it is a QR code. So it's a digital thing. And when you order from global, you actually get, um, separate pre order benefits depending on which one you buy. US doesn't have that option. So yes, 7:00 today. Rooting for you, bestie.",

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

In true Australian fashion, he loves a good ham and cheese toastie with a barbecue sauce. The real question for y'all though is if part of your cheese starts molding, do you throw it out or do you just cut off the mold and continue to eat it? Sorry to all the Australians because they made the most pathetic little cheese toastie with the last bits of bread I had. However, it was incredibly delicious and I definitely make it again. Jake says the sign of a true cheese toastie is that it's squish, and that made mine very crispy. Like listen to that crunch for lunch. One of you actually suggested chapagetti with spam for Jake's Day. I've never made this combination before, but it was delicious. Chapagetti is an S tier instant noodle in my book. Always. And I added some spinach for a healthy colon. And lastly, Jake's favorite Korean dish is kimchi, so I made that for dinner. However, I realized I was out of tofu at the very last second, so I tried substituting that protein with eggs, which was weird but good. I'm so sorry Jake for these janky meals. I obviously flopped my grocery run. Either way, this was delicious and I still thoroughly enjoyed these. And let me know which member I should eat Like next",

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

We are giving stray kids the benefit of the doubt because we don't know what their contractually obligated to do or say right now. We don't know how long this has been in the works and how long ago that contract was signed. The benefit is very small, I will admit, but it's there. But I saw a distribution post like the line distribution. 66% of that song is Charlie Puth. 66%. And based on, um, what I've heard from people that have listened to it with alternative methods, the song is made at best because Stray Kids really weren't involved with it. They have credits on it, but it's the bare minimum credit.",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

You have truly done something for those three fandoms to link up and go. We gotta take care of this.

So thank you to Tommy for inviting us, all eight of us. What was it like dressed, getting dressed by Tommy Hilfiger? Um, we had a lot of fitting sessions, but, um, they all went really smoothly, and I personally really, really like everyone's fit. So, yes, I'm seeing lots of, like, sexy men around here. But you're the Queen. Always. And Tommy. Tommy, your Spring 2024 campaign revisited your iconic style of modern prep. What was it about working with stray kids that inspired you? They are as modern as you can get. They are modern prep, and they're global superstars. They are a K pop band from Korea, and they're embarking upon a 40 city tour, and they pack stadiums with 80,000 people. Oh, wow. And they have a wild fan base all over the world. Yeah, just a little bit popular. What are you most looking forward to when you go inside? Tommy, because this is not your first met, what is it that still excites you about coming to the met each year? Well, this is the event of the year, and it's full of energy. Um, we love seeing what people are wearing because this is the one chance people get to really sort of wear whatever they want. True. As long As it's within keeping of the theme. Yes. We wanna make sure that Anna also approves. Absolutely, yes. It was so lovely to see all of you meet. You all have so much fun inside. Have a wonderful evening. Thank you.",

The best thing about 2024 is that we're able to identify who's hungry, you know, for stories, and we're able to hopefully work together to tell stories that are undeniably great and that include everybody and that also reflect certain personal experiences. I would have loved this movie. Oh, my god. I would have obsessed with this movie, girl. I would have actually, like, been so deeply in love with it. And I wanna just say thanks.

But then it's kind of awkward to if you start recording them secretly because then they're gonna end up finding out and they're gonna be like, why the is fucking recording me? But then also I kind of wanna record because I wanna show my friends and I wanna have evidence backing up my claims saying that I saw in hyphen shopping at the same store I was.

Anyways, back to the original reason why I was making this video. New tour said by Joshua Hong himself. Uh huh. I was gonna stitch my previous prediction video on here, but it wasn't recording my audio, so we're gonna stick with a new post. But I do have some new predictions based off this information and also based on the fact that they basically confirmed Carrot Land. Um, in July I think DK accidentally said on live and then they all confirmed basically like a new album, another album the second half of the year. So based off that and this, based off like the formula that 17 and I guess K pop in general has, you know, set out, they're gonna do Caroline in July, and then probably at Caroline, or like a little after, they're gonna announce the second album of the year. Another album, come back in August, they're probably gonna announce world tour. Just saying. That makes me so nervous. Oh my goodness. Ticket sales, all that will happen probably within like, knowing them in like a week. And then I feel like the actual comeback will be in October. Based off You know the formula they got going on? Um, because that'll be like, six months from now, and then tour will happen in, like, November, December. That is my new prediction for the rest of the year.",

And then after googling it, apparently it only seats 650 people, and it's in a high. In a high school, I think. What in the world? I mean, I don't know how popular this group is, and they.

Well, the first day, because after dinner, we went to her car and thinking, okay, I gotta go. And I went for the kiss and kind of fumbled it, and I asked for a do over, and she said yes. And it was much better, as it was exactly what I was planning. I knew I know how to do this. This was the rest of my life. Yeah. You know, counted on this one little moment, and it worked, you know, and we've been together ever since. That. That fateful afternoon, time disappeared. It was just her and I. The night we got married, we went to this little restaurant. I, you know, got down on one knee and did the whole nine yards. But what had happened is the kitchen, just before this, had a revolt and walked. They went on strike when you propose. They walked out of the kitchen. On my knee? Yeah. And all of a sudden, the lights go out, and, you know, it's just a little candlelight on everybody's table, like, I did this. And so I did propose. She did accept. You just feel everything is right in the world. As long as this is together, as long as this is happening, you can do anything. What's your name? Monterey Morrissey Hunter.",

    "voice_to_text": "Why your birth order actually really matters. So the following is part 3 of a four part series determining which is the superior sibling. Okay, I have to start out with this one because statistically, the youngest child is the most likely to turn out gay. Over 20 years ago, these two researchers demonstrated that the probability of a boy growing up to be gay increases for each older brother born by the same mother. The startling phenomena was then confirmed in multiple studies based on independent populations totalling over 10,000 subjects. And meta analysis indicated that between 15% and 29% of gay men owe their sexual orientation to this effect. Okay then. But apart from being gay, according to psychologist Doctor Frank Soloway's research, lostborns generally aren't the strongest or the smartest in the room. So they develop their own ways of winning attention. Their natural charms with an outgoing and social personality. No surprise then that many famous actors and comedians are babies of the family. Youngest children do, however, tend to have the lowest IQs, as a 2,007 study show that the more older siblings one has, the lower ones IQ is. And I, um, youngest of 10. Not ideal. Youngest children generally also receive the least discipline and get away with a lot more, leading them to engage in risk your behavior and go into higher risk, more creative careers. Also, just a warning. But according to psychologist Kevin Lehman in his book couples consisting of Two last borns are also the most likely to get into death. And the series finale comes tomorrow. And we're looking at you, only children.",

If I could count solo songs, which I don't know if I'm allowed to, I'm gonna say euphoria, because euphoria by Jungkook is. Is a top 5 song ever. Just like not even K pop is ever. My favorite Black Pink song. It's close, you know? Forever Youngs there, but Maji Maktodom, dude, as if it's your last. That's number one for me. Best twice song ever. This one gets harder. I think it's been likey for a long time, but when I heard dance the night away in person, like, when I went to their concert, that shit changed me. Yeah, I don't know. I think. I think it's still likey, but dance the night away is right there. My favorite EXO song. Hasn't changed since the day I got into them, and the first song I heard from them was monster. So, yeah, it's been monster ever since. And then again, if I could do solo songs, Rover by Chi is. Yeah, it's different.

Nobody knows how to break music right now. Each person I talk to in the industry is more depressed about this than the person I talked to before them. I'm gonna be real here. I think we're at a point where a lot of these big, mainstream, popular artists aren't connecting with any sort of fan base or audience. A lot of their songs aren't written by themselves. They're written by other people and then just performed by these singers. Whatever. I think people miss that authenticity that came with the singer songwriter persona. Sort of like Taylor Swift, she writes her own songs there about her own personal experiences, so people really connect to that. I feel like with all this ghost riding and this industry plant sort of stuff, a lot of times people just don't feel connected to it, they don't feel inspired by it, and they want something real. Nobody wants to listen to something that just feels like a product that was just created for them to buy. It's just no fun.",
