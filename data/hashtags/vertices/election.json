I would be perfectly fine putting a criminal in that seat not okay with Donald Trump because I'm not okay with a white supremacist I'm not okay with a literal piece of human garbage I'm not okay with bigotry I'm not okay with homophobia I'm not okay with him as a person okay but in America we do have to remember that most of the people in this country that we consider criminals do not look like me there are a lot of black and brown people in this country who have earned that title without actually earning it you know what I mean or have earned it for reasons that I would still vote for you if you were a criminal because you happen to sell a couple dime bags in your day that's w33d um I don't care if you had to do time because you defended yourself from a piece of crap who deserved being beaten because they were coming after you first I'd vote for you did you steal to feed your family? I\u2019d vote for you. now I get it there's a distinction in what he's done and what these are doing but the problem is the language criminal does not equal terrible person I think we need to remember that because there is another conversation going on about the whole fact that he is now a convicted felon but current felons cannot even vote so well yeah no I'm not okay with him being in that seat I just want everybody to remember what criminals in this country tend to look like",

    "voice_to_text": "What I am doing is proposing a bold new model of national service for 18 year olds. So you've had the glossy PR version of Rishi Sunak's plan for national service. Now here's some things that have been revealed since he announced the policy. Parents could be fined for their kids not participating. Uh, leak documents say teens could be jailed for refusing to do national service. Well done, Rishi. You know, jail. Jailing young kids for not participating in something that you say should be voluntary service. Of course they should be jailed. I mean, lock out, throw them in jail and lock away the key forever. Young royals could apparently be forced to take part. I mean, the Telegraph says that's important, so I'll, I'll leave that to them to decide. And Grant Schatz, the defence secretary, insists that national service will toughen up kids. I think the kids of Britain today are already quite tough, considering they had to deal with covid, uh, the having to watch their parents go through, um, the cost of living crisis. They may not even have enough food on the table. And we're thinking about either sending them to the army or making them complete national community service like criminals. I mean, Britain's a wonderful place to live, isn't it",

What are the Germanic peoples came over by King Alfred? I'm not fighting for royals that are not even native, that are not even the royals of this land.

Because they are giving our 18 year olds a choice, which is mandatory and you will face criminal suction. But it's to give them opportunities to give them a sense of national pride. No it's not. It's just keeping our our children in line with your fucking dictatorship. Leave our kids alone! Leave us alone! Stop forcing us into a shitty shitty life without shitty shitty circumstances. Honestly, sometimes. I'm fucking done. Seriously, I'm going to fucking live in the woods. Ridiculous. Ridiculous? Fuming is an understatement.

Forcing your children into these fucking education and school and stuff when their mental health issues for kids is like 50%. I will need to check the actual figures for that, but it's very high.

Then we got July, August, September, October, November. That's one, two, three, four, five, six months to figure out what we finna do. Last year, this time on TikTok, we had a plan that we gonna vote for Joe Biden. Now, everybody, we don't wanna vote for Joe Biden, cause Joe Biden, you know, there's a lot of reasons not to vote for Joe Biden. The next option is Trump, y'all. What we finna do? What, what, what are we getting on the same page about? Because if we not working to, to, to get a third party candidate or third candidate on the ballot, we got two options. We got this one right here or this one right here, y'all, we can't just not vote. We got, we gotta, we gotta pick somebody and go behind. We gotta do something. If there's no alternative, if we can't find another candidate by this time, we need to pick somebody. One bringing all his goons and his shenanigans and Project 2025 and, and, and all these craziness, and then the next one, we don't even know if he gonna make it. He, he may forget he president. We, we all know. We all know. But y'all, I, I, I, I'm just gonna say it. We can't vote for Trump. We can't. We Can't. We can't vote for Trump. We cannot. That man cannot. We're gonna have a. We're gonna have another restless four years. That would have another restless four years. Y'all know, the last four years was. Do y'all wanna have an even worse, more restless four years? All we can do is maybe. Maybe we vote Biden and maybe Kamala take over, even though she not necessarily any better, necessarily the best in the world. But there's no other. There's nobody else. There's nobody else, y'all. We gotta. We gotta pick somebody. We can't just not vote. I'm not gonna be in the business of telling us to not vote. We gotta vote some. We gotta do something cause not voting makes it even worse. We gotta vote for somebody and. And we don't. What y'all think? What should we do? What plans should we put in motion? What should we conjure up? What. What. What do we need to. To. To get that. What. What should we do, y'all? What should we do?",

    "voice_to_text": "If Trump gets elected it's OUR fault Go watch Jeremy's video I love his face and they make good points Um, but hard disagree on THAT Because the fact of the matter is politicians don't care if they lose an election Because if they lose an election then they can just use the opposing party as a boogeyman for the next election And yes, Mr. Delaware is a POS but nothing is going to get better with him out of office and Trump in it It's our fault that he's there to begin with And I'm tired of seeing so many people being like Voting doesn't work Voting does work but we've never tried it If we actually turned out and voted in mass we could get all the things that we want We just don't And yes, they try to make it hard for us to vote in many places but we don't try to plan for that and accommodate accordingly Just like how Jeremy was advocating for a third party candidate like Jasmine Sherman You know what I would love for someone like that to be in office but we need to put the groundwork in beforehand You can't just go, \"vote for this person in November \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\" and expect people to do it It's kind of like how every Tuesday we're supposed to have a general strike If you haven't planned ahead it's never going to happen No, uh nobody wants to vote for Joe Biden I don't want to vote for Joe Biden  Am I voting for him in the primaries? F*** no! But people trying to discuss the plans y'know with Project 2025 are not fearmongering That's real and valid and they don't want us to have elections after this And as much as it sucks those two a**holes are the options that we actually have And the way the system set up Right now we got to choose the lesser of two options (evils*) And there's a lot of people on here that are real comfortable um in the fact that they know that no matter what happens the results of the election aren't necessarily going to affect them But some of us don't have that luxury No,  it's not fair It sucks It's stupid But if we want to avoid this in the future we need to put the groundwork in NOW for next time But first we need to make sure that there is a next time And for everybody that's just like well I'm not gonna go vote at all Stop being stupid Uh... putting the groundwork in for next time means voting in your local elections Getting people um set up in your states and your municipalities um on your school boards so that there's people in place to elect to higher office later And if you want people to vote for your candidates go get people registered to fucking vote We don't get a better future through wishful thinking We have to actually do s*** Go get to work"

I've always voted conservatives. Not this time. We've gone through this in previous videos. Um, I'm just wondering if it is the sort of middle aged people and the reason that younger people not vote for reform. Is it because they find them racist or is it because they haven't experienced a Britain under the control of Labour? That's a question that I think you should look at. I think you should research. It's quite interesting. Um, I still don't know I'm gonna vote for. Lots of people comment on my videos and still are from yesterday, telling me to vote reform. Um, still don't really know. Gonna look at it myself. Probably go through the policies. But what age are you and who you voting for? If you are reform, are you under forty? Hmm."

Transports rubbish. Inflation still high. Everything costs a fortune. Um, immigration's not under control. Um, you know, it. It's. It's difficult times. I'm just wondering who people are gonna vote for. Uh, what you tend to get in elections is conservative voters who are a bit disillusioned won't vote at all. Um, I think, like you saw in the locals, I mean, the numbers were really low. You know, Labour said they had big claims, but all that really happened is the Labour voters came out and voted Labour. The conservative voters just stayed away. Um, just wondering what people are gonna do. Is reform really an option? Don't know. Interesting one.",

I've only really seen John Sweeney, our First Minister, say that the fourth of July, the choices of the fourth of July is an election day. Really shows the content the Russia, Sunach, Westminster and the Tories have for Scotland. The fourth of july is the first week of the Scottish summer holidays. Many families will naturally be wishing to go away for the holidays because the children are out of school so they won't be able to go to their local polling station and vote on election day. That's really shows a contempt for Scotland. Had it been the English summer holidays, I do not think that Rishi Sunak would have chosen that day for an election. But because it's falls within the summer, the Scottish summer holidays and Scotland is treated as an afterthought, it's all a okay apparently. I think that's really shows the need for independence so that we can focus on Scottish interest in all of our decision making.",

    "voice_to_text": "what happens after Donald Trump wins what's next for America so first go watch the whole commercial um this is my second video on this and there is course no way that this was mistakenly put up that the their language has been like this this whole time I remember growing up I graduated High School 91 I'm Gen X product of the end of the Cold War the fallen of the Berlin Wall and I have a few friends who are very politically active have you know read a lot of history and all that and we have talking before of how you know normal people normal citizens can fall into this you know trap that you know 1930s with the moustache man fell into the same thing with Italy um Mussolini um Japan and what not this you know descent into fascism to totalitarianism and things of that nature and we're seeing this now here in the US where for 40 45 years 50 years since basically the destruction of the Fairness Doctrine from Reagan Holpeth he's point back to Reagan of course this Ascension into am um conservative radio which then of course began into things like Fox News then ultimately Newsmax all way up to things like Stormfront and things like that you know all this nature of hyper conservative politics and now we have a commercial of the you know the persumptive uh GOP candidate who is openly talking about deportation and no wars of course that's course bullshit of a new America and all this other stuff and of course seating in things like the word Reich in there and all this this is textbook descent into Naziism um that we saw in the Germany and that this can't be any more you know clear and the fact that it's not just 10% 20% 30% 40% is 45 to 50% of Americans who are going to vote that will vote for this they'll either just pass it off as like oh this is you know I'm not worried about cause it's not me the classic line of of hey this is not me I don't care what happens um to the true believers that somehow you know immigrants are a bad thing and we're all virtually all dissemigrants uh the the the 7 8 from immigrants here and all that and they're buying this hook line and sinker just like Germans did with Nazi itself actually I have a friend um when I worked in the intelligence community that wrote a book on Middle Eastern radicals and again I talked to him not too long ago and we same exact dissension into things is much more accelerated here especially over the past 10 to 15 years social media course helps to you know push that but this has been ongoing this has been from the limbaz in the world and the Mark Levines and all that uh you know what you now hear on places like Newsmax and all this what you now hear from the mouths of uh Trump and his cohort of just absolutely horrible horrible people I can't make this any clearer this is this is not they're not hiding behind anything they're not obfusating through even really major coded language it is just plain out there I truly hope I'm actually very concerned um I do think you know Biden most likely will win but there's definitely a percentage enough that has me concerned that why are there just so many people willing to not only listen to this but then attach with it and with their full chest you know support something like this we're in very very scary times"

There's this reminded me, when we're talking about the block out, we're also getting rid of the dirt sheets, like them, right? I mean, like, we're gonna weed things out. We gotta start at the roots. So, you know, people, US, Entertainment Tonight, TMZ, of course, The Shade Room. But any organization that does that, where they are also platforming, I'm thinking we'd have to take care of them, too. Also, we're talking about engagement. There are 470 people in Washington DC right now that don't get bugged enough. They shouldn't have a moment of peace through this election cycle. Anywho, just wanted to check those out and also probably want to check these people out as well. Have a happy Friday.",

Four years later, no proof of anything, and you guys are still crying about this. This is fucking sad. Even if we got rid of mail and voting only had in person voting, you're still going to lose and find a different excuse. This is pathetic. Your shit party doesn't have any policies. You're not running on anything. You don't have a platform. You're taking rights away and giving the wealthy everything. Okay, people like you don't look at policies. You look at buzzwords and fake promises. All right, dude, you're gonna lose again. Get your excuses ready.",

Any other candidate who can't answer that very simple question, will you accept the results of the 2024 election with a simple yes, they are immediately disqualified from running for office. Rule number one. And we all know why Tim Scott couldn't say yes. He's trying to be Donald Trump's vice president. Donald Trump still has not conceded the race in 2020. He's still not acknowledged that he has lost the race in 2020, even though there is no evidence that he. That there was any sort of voter fraud or anything like that that would have given Donald Trump any sort of chance of becoming president. And he lost over 60 cases in court that verified the fact that Donald Trump lost that race. But, yeah, absolutely disqualified. If you can't accept the results of a competition and you can't lose that competition, then you can't be in that competition, full stop. And good on Kristen Walker for pushing back on this as Tim Scott tried to pivot and go on the attack. Tim Scott tried desperately to pivot to, you know, inflations higher under Biden. And nobody likes NBC, even because they're just Democrats. And Chris Walker said, I ain't having it. Good for her.",

For example, with Joe Biden and the BLM protests, he essentially pretended to support them and use that to get into office and gain the momentum to get into office, and then never actually took action. True revolution does not come from those in power. It does not come from those running an office. True revolution needs to be started by these movements and.
