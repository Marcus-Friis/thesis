I would be perfectly fine putting a criminal in that seat not okay with Donald Trump because I'm not okay with a white supremacist I'm not okay with a literal piece of human garbage I'm not okay with bigotry I'm not okay with homophobia I'm not okay with him as a person okay but in America we do have to remember that most of the people in this country that we consider criminals do not look like me there are a lot of black and brown people in this country who have earned that title without actually earning it you know what I mean or have earned it for reasons that I would still vote for you if you were a criminal because you happen to sell a couple dime bags in your day that's w33d um I don't care if you had to do time because you defended yourself from a piece of crap who deserved being beaten because they were coming after you first I'd vote for you did you steal to feed your family? I\u2019d vote for you. now I get it there's a distinction in what he's done and what these are doing but the problem is the language criminal does not equal terrible person I think we need to remember that because there is another conversation going on about the whole fact that he is now a convicted felon but current felons cannot even vote so well yeah no I'm not okay with him being in that seat I just want everybody to remember what criminals in this country tend to look like",

Now here's some things that have been revealed since he announced the policy. Parents could be fined for their kids not participating. Uh, leak documents say teens could be jailed for refusing to do national service. Well done, Rishi. You know, jail. Jailing young kids for not participating in something that you say should be voluntary service. Of course they should be jailed. I mean, lock out, throw them in jail and lock away the key forever. Young royals could apparently be forced to take part. I mean, the Telegraph says that's important, so I'll, I'll leave that to them to decide. And Grant Schatz, the defence secretary, insists that national service will toughen up kids. I think the kids of Britain today are already quite tough, considering they had to deal with covid, uh, the having to watch their parents go through, um, the cost of living crisis. They may not even have enough food on the table. And we're thinking about either sending them to the army or making them complete national community service like criminals. I mean, Britain's a wonderful place to live, isn't it",

Because they are giving our 18 year olds a choice, which is mandatory and you will face criminal suction. But it's to give them opportunities to give them a sense of national pride. No it's not. It's just keeping our our children in line with your fucking dictatorship. Leave our kids alone! Leave us alone! Stop forcing us into a shitty shitty life without shitty shitty circumstances. Honestly, sometimes. I'm fucking done. Seriously, I'm going to fucking live in the woods. Ridiculous. Ridiculous? Fuming is an understatement. As I said before with my previous post, I do not think conservatives actually want to be put back into power. We can imagine it though if they did. Forcing your children into these fucking education and school and stuff when their mental health issues for kids is like 50%. I will need to check the actual figures for that, but it's very high. And I want you torture them with all that crap. You know, fucking send them off to bloody military and do this and do that and do that. Let them Live their own fucking lives",

Last year, this time on TikTok, we had a plan that we gonna vote for Joe Biden.

If you do want the current government out, if you type in tactical dot to vote on Google, go onto the first link, type in your postcode. It will tell you who to vote for to ensure that happens if you're that way inclined. Not telling you to vote for, but um. Yeah. Jenny Lex. July fall missing uncle corpse dramatically. I miss him, I do. He's running for MP in his area, which I believe is Islington. Regardless, I'm not in his area so can't vote for him. But it's a shame cause I do wish I could have voted for him. Which kind of does tell you which way I would vote. But I'm not Kirstama's. Not I anyway.",

I've only really seen John Sweeney, our First Minister, say that the fourth of July, the choices of the fourth of July is an election day. Really shows the content the Russia, Sunach, Westminster and the Tories have for Scotland. The fourth of july is the first week of the Scottish summer holidays. Many families will naturally be wishing to go away for the holidays because the children are out of school so they won't be able to go to their local polling station and vote on election day. That's really shows a contempt for Scotland. Had it been the English summer holidays, I do not think that Rishi Sunak would have chosen that day for an election. But because it's falls within the summer, the Scottish summer holidays and Scotland is treated as an afterthought, it's all a okay apparently.

But any organization that does that, where they are also platforming, I'm thinking we'd have to take care of them, too. Also, we're talking about engagement. There are 470 people in Washington DC right now that don't get bugged enough. They shouldn't have a moment of peace through this election cycle.

Any other candidate who can't answer that very simple question, will you accept the results of the 2024 election with a simple yes, they are immediately disqualified from running for office. Rule number one. And we all know why Tim Scott couldn't say yes. He's trying to be Donald Trump's vice president. Donald Trump still has not conceded the race in 2020. He's still not acknowledged that he has lost the race in 2020, even though there is no evidence that he. That there was any sort of voter fraud or anything like that that would have given Donald Trump any sort of chance of becoming president. And he lost over 60 cases in court that verified the fact that Donald Trump lost that race. But, yeah, absolutely disqualified. If you can't accept the results of a competition and you can't lose that competition, then you can't be in that competition, full stop. And good on Kristen Walker for pushing back on this as Tim Scott tried to pivot and go on the attack. Tim Scott tried desperately to pivot to, you know, inflations higher under Biden. And nobody likes NBC, even because they're just Democrats. And Chris Walker said, I ain't having it. Good for her.",

So there has been a push within the pro Palestinian community to vote for Joe Stein, because Donald Trump and Biden both support this ongoing genocide. But we as students need to be wary of these.

For example, with Joe Biden and the BLM protests, he essentially pretended to support them and use that to get into office and gain the momentum to get into office, and then never actually took action. True revolution does not come from those in power. It does not come from those running an office. True revolution needs to be started by these movements and. And it's a social changed caused by the people. It is not by electing someone. So be very wary. Jill Stein is not the path to a free Palestine. The way to get to a free Palestine is by showing up and revolting and causing social. Social change. And staying at those encampment.",

November 5th, Election Day is our last chance to save it. You know what? You're right. November 5th is our chance to save America for MAGA lunatics like you, Donald Trump Jr. And your now convicted father, Donald Trump. Isn't it remarkable that when someone is held accountable on 34 felony charges and our justice system works as intended, the Republicans come out against it? They try to downplay the verdict. They try to say that the system is bad add and it was rigged against Trump. They won't just accept the results. The Republicans are trying to delegitimize our justice system in real time because they didn't get the verdict they wanted. It's insane. Look, justice prevailed today. The rule of law prevailed today. The jury came to their verdict, and we as Americans must accept it. It's a great day for America.",

During his whistlestop tour across Cornwall and Devon, the Prime Minister also clambered into the seat of a Jackal 3, the latest in a range of armoured vehicles, had a pint of lemonade in a county pub, and spliced a fibre optic broadband cable.  #Election #election2024 #RishiSunak #tory #conservative #conservatives #devon #ukelection #ukelection2024 #uknews #ukpolitics",
    "voice_to_text": "It's been difficult the last few years, you know that. I know that we had a pandemic, then a war in Ukraine, and everything that. That did impact all of you. But I hope that you saw throughout all of that that I had your back. Whether it was with the furlough scheme or the support that we provided with energy bills, I wanted to be there for all of you and your families. And collectively, thanks to your hard work and your sacrifice, we've got through it. And now you can see that things are pointing. Ability has been restored. So the question now, for all of you",

    "voice_to_text": "There's a lot of left wing people saying, I'm actually quite worried about Keir Starmer because he seems to be incredibly ruthless. And this was a thing that he put in the times. Uh, in an interview recently he said he finds it easy to be ruthless. And I have to say I'm a bit worried about him too. Five years ago Jeremy Corbyn was the leader of the Labour Party. Now he's not even a member. Diane Abbott has been kicked out but LED back in, but she's not allowed to stand. And it seems, I think dozens of MPs and councillors have been just deselected just arbitrarily like that. Kirstam was just kicking people out. He's again just being incredibly ruthless. And it's got echoes of sort of desk murderer archetype where it's a very boring bureaucrat who's nowhere near the actual damage that they're doing, just signing pieces of paper and that's it. A bunch of things happen that hurt a lot of people. And the reason this matters is cause very likely that Kistan will be the next prime minister. And so if this is the style of governance he approaches his own party with, well, what will he be like when he is given a massive and absolute majority? We've already seen him say that. Oh well, you know, the, the by elections were proof that people super endorsed Labour and everyone can't, can't wait to have Labour government. But that's not true. Uh, what it Is is people didn't want to vote for the conservatives. Turnout was incredibly low, even for by elections. And the Labour Party want it on this sort of rump vote of Labour that just comes out every single time. The majority of people don't vote. And so the general tone of these victories is hollow. People don't actually endorse what he's done or what he's doing or who he is. He's not a great politician, he's not a great rhetorician, he's not a great mind. And he is going to take the victory he will have, which he will have, as a sign that he can go full bore on whatever changes is he intends to make. And as I said, if the way that he governs his own party is the way that he's going to govern the country, then we're fucked.",

And now we have a trial that evidence and closing arguments have concluded, and you can read the transcripts. You can read the transcript to every witness who testified. Yeah, that's exactly the future that I want for America, where people who break the law and commit felonies are investigated, indicted, arrested, booked, and put on trial. That's exactly the America that I want. Donald Trump commits felonies before he even gets out of bed most days.

That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18 year olds to be spent either in a competitive full time military commission over 12 months or with one weekend per month volunteering in roles within the community like delivering prescriptions and food to inform people or in search and rescue. Young people will gain valuable skills, make our country more secure and build a stronger national culture.",

    "voice_to_text": "By my reckoning this is the first significant new policy announcement by either of the main parties. And I think after a bumpy few days it's an attempt by Rishi Sunak to change the conversation with quite a bold and a very eye catching announcement. What it involves is essentially 18 year olds being given the choice uh. To either have um. One weekend a month over a year working in organisations like the NHS or the police or with charities um. Or if they like they can try and pass a test to get into a selective year long placement with either the armed forces or in um. Cyber um, defense. Now a Royal Commission which is a kind of inquiry would be set up to look at the details um. Of all of this. And because this is mandatory, any 18 year olds that refuse to do it could face non criminal sanctions. That inquiry will hammer that out and look at things like um. Exemptions um as well. Now I wish you seen like it's written in the mail on Sunday about this um. This evening. And he said this isn't conscription but in his view this is about giving young people opportunities, equipping them with skills. But he also believes it's about instilling a sense of um. Pride of service um. In younger people which he believes will bind society together and make society stronger. I think this is clearly designed as well to appeal to Traditional core Tory voters, especially older voters. It's already causing quite a bit of a splash and getting a lot of attention in many of the Sunday newspapers due out, um, tomorrow as well. Labor have lashed out at it already. They've called it desperate and they say it's only being announced because of the dire state of the armed forces. Sokia Starmer has taken a different, um, approach in terms of policy towards young people today, reconfirming possible plans and saying that if Labour make it into government, that they could extend the voting age down to include 16 year olds and 17 year olds. So, as I was saying in my report, a lot of focus on the visuals, the optics of this campaign. But I think it's the details, the substance and what both parties have to offer which will prove decisive. Compelling day.",

My name is Larry Seaworld. He joins us live from the scene with what we know so far. So, Larry, what can you tell us at this point? Authorities not confirming very much beyond the fact that this is part of an ongoing investigation started by Homeland Security Investigations, the state of New York. Behind me, that is the entrance to Star Island. You can see the Miami Beach police car there at the entrance. If you look to your right, you can see this is where the Homeland Security Investigations are set up with their command post. We've seen not only HSI police, we've also seen a. An FBI agent and a numerous other officers going in and out of the house that is behind it. You can see the beige complex there. That home, we understand, according to property records, owned by Sean Combs, or Diddy, as he is known, of that property, again being searched at this hour. We also know, obviously, Sean Diddy Combs has properties in Los Angeles and New York. We understand from our, our. Our colleagues in Los Angeles that earlier today, uh, helicopter hover above one of Diddy's homes there, that a similar law enforcement, uh, they showed up there as well to search the property. It's not clear exactly what they're searching for or The details of the investigation. We've asked a Homeland Security about that only saying that this is part of an ongoing investigation LED by New York. But obviously, the properties in Los Angeles and the property here in Miami being searched as we speak. We're gonna stay on top of this story and bring you more details as we get it. But back here live, we're looking at again, HSI police setting up their investigation at this house. You can look and see driveway, the gate. Uh, it looks like that gate has been disabled, because it's sort of just leaning up against the pillar on the side as they're backing a van up into. I know. Looking like all the ghosts that did his past is here to attack the man, and they are ready to bring him down for good this time. Jaden Smith took to Instagram to share a series of images of him inside of Diddy's tunnels. Underneath Diddy's mansion in Los Angeles and Miami, there are secret tunnels. Originally, it was built as sort of like, an underground swimming pool, but did he drained it and began to create a network of pathways that connected nearby points of interest. For example. What. What is this?",

Yes. I'm not done talking. You basically wanna legalize a dictatorship and take away the working classes ability to protest and fight for their rights, giving total power to the ones who have more money and not to the ones that made them rich. Yeah. Definitely. Yes. Yes. So just a personal question. This would openly create new slaves. How are you agreeing to all of this? Because I'm rich and none of this actually affects me. And some of it benefits me, even if it's to the detriment of the rest of the population. So you're okay with oppressing the majority of America as long as it means more power for you and your team? Yes, I'm definitely okay with that. My family is good. But have you considered the families that aren't good? Also the fact that the wrong person in power could pass unethical bills and destroy America? Ho, ho, I just told you, I'm rich. I don't care about any of this. Just pass the Bill. Yes. To everything. I got things to do. So money has LED to your abandonment of ethics, morality, and any sense of empathy for the rest of America. So you are a legal terrorist. Yes. Yes.

And when you break things, you get cut and you may bleed. And it is worth it. Every time. Every time. And so, too, especially the young people here. I say to you, when you walk in those rooms, being the only one that looks like you, the only one with your background, you walk in those rooms chin up, shoulders back beat. A meeting room, a boardroom, a courtroom, a hearing room. You walk in those rooms knowing that we are all in that room with you, applauding you on, and expecting certain things from you, including that you will not be silent in those rooms. And that we expect that from you, because we also expect that you will internalize and know we're there with you. And so your voice can be strong. It is as Alicia said. My mother would say to me, don't you ever let anybody tell you who you are. You tell them who you are. Don't ever carry as a personal burden your capacity to do whatever you dream and aspire to do based on other people's limited ability to see who can do what. This is Part of what's involved is that we have to know that sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open. Sometimes they won't. And then you need to kick that fucking door down.

The other 32 are in counties that Donald Trump won, making inroads with a lot of the Trump voters and the independents who lean more conservative. And on top of this, Biden has more campaign staff and more field offices in Wisconsin and in every single swing state than Donald Trump and his campaign does. Biden campaign is quite literally squeezing Trump and his campaign of all their resources. They're making sure to hold down the democratic counties, make sure to win those votes, but they're also going after Trump voters. And these moderate Republicans and these independents live in these more conservative counties. Donald Trump has not made the same outreach. And of course, on top of this, Biden and his campaign have a lot more money than Trump and his campaign, allowing them to do stuff like this. The Trump Campaign is spiraling",

People are wondering why these even made it onto TV in the first place. The Doritos finger cleaner commercial from the Super Bowl of 2,016. Billy, use the cleaner! Touchdown! Yeah! It only works with Doritos. Why only Doritos? You ask too many questions, Billy. The Reese's Pieces Love Child commercial from 2,011. God! Oh, awesome! Congratulation! You just had a brand new orange candy. My sweet candy baby! Oh, god! Love you, peanut butter! What? Hey, cupcake, that's my little peanut butter baby. Huh? This guy. Peanut butter, Bertha. Peanut butter! Taste the peanut butter! The Kmart I shipped my pants commercial from 2,013. Shit my pants right here! Shit my pants! You're kidding! You can shit your pants right here! You hear that? I can shit my pants for free! Wow, I just may shit my pants! Yeah, shit your pants, Billy, you can shit your pants too! I can't wait to shit my pants! Dad, I just shit my pants, and it's very convenient. Very convenient. I just shipped my drawers. I just shipped my nighty. I just shipped my bed. If you can't find what you're looking for in store, we'll find it at kmart com right now and ship it to you for free. Last but not least, the Mountain Dew commercial. Puppy monkey baby from 2,016. Puppy monkey baby! Puppy monkey, Baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby. Why did these ever make it onto TV in the first place?",

And they can continue to have corporations pay nothing for the minimum wage because high school student is easy to take advantage of. Which is crazy because the politicians don't even have to work half a year in total days. They don't and they get paid and get free healthcare. It's just ridiculous.

Originally, congressmen were elected by a direct democracy, senators were elected by their state legislatures, and presidents are elected by the Electoral College. We are devolving into a democracy. Because now congressmen and senators are elected by the same pool. A direct democracy. And with the national popular vote coming, we're gonna be electing our president by a direct democracy, too. Bad idea. Bad idea. We are devolving into a democracy. We do not want to be a democracy. Okay. As Danny Wesney at the Seattle Times reported, delegates of the Washington State Republican Convention then stood up one by one to argue that the US should repeal the 17th Amendment, which allows us to vote for our United States Senators. After that resolution passed, they went bigger. They voted to put this language into their platform. Quote, we encourage Republicans to substitute the words republic and republicanism where previously they have used the word democracy. Every time the word democracy is used favorably, it serves to promote the principles of the Democratic Party, the principles of which we ardently oppose. Vote. We oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature. We oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature. So say Washington state Republicans, officially in writing in their party platform. What's going on here",

So I'm asking you, as a potential VP nominee, will you accept to commit to the election results in this election cycle, no matter who wins? Just simply yes or no? I expect. I expect President Trump to win the next election. I'm not gonna ask you answer your hypothetical question when, in fact. Yeah. Tim Scott was asked six times if he would accept the election results in 2024, and every single time, he danced around it. Would not give a straight answer. The obvious answer to the question is yes. Yes, of course we will accept the election results. Joe Biden would say yes. Every major Democrat would say yes. Except the MAGA Republicans want to continue their attacks on our democracy and say, well, you know what? We'll have to see. So they can plunge us into more chaos. Republicans like Donald Trump and Tim Scott, who's auditioning to be Donald Trump's vice president, are already laying the foundation to challenge the results in 2024. They answered this question in the same way in 2016, in 2020, and now in 2024. It is so abundantly clear that these MAGA Republicans don't care about our democracy. They never have, they never will. We must keep them out of office.",

What does that mean? Well, if you say that Israel is a racist state, that's anti Semitism. If you draw comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, that's also anti Semitism in practice. If this Bill also passes in the Senate, it would be illegal for Americans to voice opinions such as how Israel cannot be by definition both a Jewish state and a Liberal democracy. As this op ed in the Jerusalem Post points out, this would be anti Semitic and illegal to say. Or how it's racist for there to be segregated roads that separate Palestinian and Jewish settlers in Jerusalem. Criticism like these would also be considered anti Semitic and therefore would be legal to say. Even though this is in harats. Or if you wanna criticize the IDF, their shoot first, ask later policy, that is also anti Semitic and therefore you would not be allowed to say it. It's funny, you could bash America all day long, but if you dare voice criticism of Israel, then that would not only make you an anti Semite, but in the future that could also mean that You could be sued, persecuted or sanctioned by the federal government",

But Christie Nome, who is the governor of South Dakota and seen as a potential vice presidential pick for Donald Trump, has, I think, blown up her political career in the most spectacular manner possible. She had a 14 month old wire hair pointer called cricket, but cricket was not deemed useful enough to Christy know him. He was not a good hunting dog and he was potentially a danger to chickens and he was annoying her and so she. What did you. What did you do with the dog? Oh, what did you do with the dog? I know. Why don't you just shoot it? You would. Ha ha, yeah, no, she did. She shot her own dog. She took the dog out and shot the dog. And now we're just hearing from a Trump insider that she may no longer in the running. I mean, it could have gone either way, to be honest. It could have shot her to fame. But she is now no longer in the running to be the VP candidate to Donald Trump, because apparently they don't like people who shoot their own dogs. Really? Can't. You can't go. What is it? People so sensitive. Honestly. Snowflakes. Snowflakes that you can't even kill your own dog because it's annoying without someone getting up. At it, yeah. She's defended her actions as just the kind of thing that you have to do, you know, if you people do that in. On farms and in politics. I mean, obviously that's the same thing, aren't they? On a farm, in politics, sometimes you just have to. Unpleasant things. I just do wonder about the calculation here, because this is a story that has come out as a result of some journalist farretting away and finding something extraordinary detail. She has brought this out in her own autobiography. What did she think the consequence would be of announcing, oh, yeah, I killed my 14 month old puppy with a gun and threw it into a gravel. Well, the. The answer to that is she may face a misdemeanor charge. She's now also admitted that they put down horses. She said, I hated that dog. She shot crickets, the dog and a goat in the same gravel pits. The goat had to be shot twice. I mean, who shoots a goat? I mean, who shoots a dog or a goat? You don't. You don't, right? I think. I think you don't. But why? But why? Why? I mean, why she shot the dog, why she shot the goat and why she bragging about it? What planet are you on, Christy? Yeah.",

Reclassifying cannabis is necessary and it's a long overdue step, but it is not the end of the story. The three of us are proud to say we're introducing the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act. As I said, our legislation will finally remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances. It will expunge the criminal records of so many Americans with low level marijuana offences that haunt them and inhibit them for decades, preventing them from getting good jobs and leading good, strong lives. And it will help our country close the book once and for all on the awful and harmful and failed war on drugs, which all too often has been nothing more than a war on Americans of color.",

There will be Trumpism attacking the federal government that will be in control of. Of Joe Biden and the Democrats. Right. So. So that Trumpism is actually having to fight with the government. If Donald Trump wins, um, Trumpism is emboldened, and you'll have a weaponized government going after all marginalized people's, going after Trump's political enemies, Trump's cultural enemies. And Trumpism will be emboldened in the streets and will be stuck fighting Trumpism. And. And it'll have nothing to do with moving the country forward. It'll have everything to do with somehow removing Trumpism's foot from our collective necks. Which will be next to impossible given the.

And so to me, it's about picking our conflict, not our champion. And I would much rather be doing battle with Biden and the Biden administration, and the ideological problems we have with them, and the direction of this country. Than trying to get the Trumpist fucking foot off our collective necks, and it's not even close.",

An anonymous source from inside Trump's team said, I haven't seen this public a self unaliving since James Town. Which are the people she was trying to impress with this to begin with. Apparently, like, wanted to project Midwesternly strength and do something that she thought Trump would like. the only thing you could think of was a story about unaliving a puppy? I mean, that might say more about how you really feel about Donald Trump than anything else. You notice that her arm kind of looks like mine at this angle? Hi. But even Trump is like, ah, yeah, no, we're gonna. We're gonna pass on that shit. And when people are upset, she doubles down like, I got a few horses last week, too.

He says he would use the military to build migrant detention camps. He would let red states monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress. He would fire any US attorney who wouldn't carry out his order to prosecute. He's weighing pardons for everyone who attacked the capital January 6th. He said he might not come to the aid of an ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasn't paying enough. He would gut the civil service. He would close the White House pandemic preparedness office and staff his administration only with those who believe the election was stolen from him. And when they asked about dictatorship, he said, I think a lot of people like it. And he's on the cover of time magazine. He should be on the cover of doing time magazine. That's the",

    "voice_to_text": "a question for my American followers real quick are any of you familiar with taxation without representation if you failed history you're just not as American as you pretend to be don't worry I got you right taxation without representation is the entire basis of the American Revolution you know that war we started so that we could break free from Britain and be our own country like the entire premise of the United States Constitution so essentially American colonists were so fed up with being over taxed and under represented by British Parliament that they incited an entire revolution and what was the catalyst to the American Revolution that little thing we call the Boston Tea Party they revolted against their government over a 3% tax on tea why am I bringing this up you didn't ask don't worry I'm gonna answer anyways how do you think the founding fathers of America would feel if they knew that the average American was paying roughly 50% of their income to various taxes 50% of our income so $920 billion can go to the military in 2023 alone that is a real number reported on the collected tax revenue from the United States of America 50% of our income in taxes so 920 billion can go to the military now I know what you're thinking 50% where is she getting that number from even socialist and communist don't pay 50% Americans definitely don't yes you do and we're gonna fall down the rabbit hole of real numbers using my income which is verifiable to prove to you that you guys are being taxed at a 50% rate of the money that you make now in the sake of being transparent I am going to use real numbers here last year as a mother of two children meaning I have two dependents I made $103,000 working a regular 8 to 5 job on top of the fact I monetize my content creation and I get paid royalties off of the music I make so I have multiple streams of income and I work while I'm not working to make $103,000 as a head of household mother of two which at present given current inflation puts me as a lower class American citizen even with me being head a household mother of two lower class American citizen I still don't qualify for any subsidized assistance um no healthcare Temporary Assistance for Needy Families food stamps etcetera so everything I'm paying is out of my own pocket everything cool fine now buckle up for the fun part cause we're gonna go ahead and talk about how we got to pay in roughly 50% of our income to some variation of taxes now out of my regular check I pay 29% in payroll deductions the payroll deduction start with my income tax Medicare Social Security then I also have to pay for my own private retirement because they're threatening to take away Social Security and my own private healthcare because I don't qualify for any type of subsidized assistance so 29% of my check is immediately gone to income tax healthcare and retirement now as if 29% wasn't blatantly disrespectful enough I have to allocate an additional hundred dollars bi weekly to pay additional income taxes because I'm 1099 for my content creation and my royalties then on top of that I still ended up owing income taxes somehow even with two dependents only making $103,000 and paying an extra 200 a month but when you owe taxes to the American government if you can't pay them in a lump sum they charge you for setting up a payment plan so now I'm paying $300 additional a month so that's an additional $500 a month of my disposable income after I've already been taxed 29% going to the IRS for income taxes which guess what that boils down to $6,000 so roughly 5% of my income now we're at a staggering 34% just for income taxes retirement and healthcare well 34% still isn't 50 cool cool story let's go ahead and talk property taxes now I live in Cook County and property tax on average is 2.19% of the assessed market value of the home that you live in and well ever since hedge fund started buying up all of the single family homes this has increased the market value of homes driving the average home in America up to $300,000 for the assessed market value what's that break down to on a yearly basis about six to seven thousand dollars let's just go ahead and add another 5% of my income allocated to property taxes bringing us to a staggering 39% but wait there's more so on top of income tax government healthcare government retirement private healthcare private retirement and property taxes I also have to pay sales tax sales tax in Cook County is paid on every single thing you buy which guess what 10.25% bringing me to a whopping 49.25% roughly speaking of everything I make going to some version of taxes so now that we're all on the same page that over taxation is absolutely a thing that all Americans are experiencing can we talk about the lack of representation now because you would think after paying 50% of my hard earned American dollars I would have something to show for it but I don't I don't have free health care I don't even have affordable health care for that matter or options for affordable medicine I don't have access to nutritional food they won't give our public school children free lunches which is honestly absurd if they did they're not healthy you don't have some amazing quality of infrastructure you don't even have access to media that isn't polarized and heavily propagated you don't make a livable wage you don't have affordable housing you don't even have paid maternity leave and they refuse to regulate the cost of college tuition little alone the cost of daycare for working parents so what do we have what do we have I'll tell you what we have we have poison we have propaganda we have school shootings and we got a fucking TikTok ban that's what we get as Americans for our tax dollars we get to watch other countries that do have free health care use our tax dollars to fund their wars over taxation without representation",

    "voice_to_text": "I have some bad news about the US economy not a joke our economy only grew 1.6% even though it was projected to grow 2.4 but worst of all core inflation rose by 3.7% even though they only expected it to go up by 3.4 this means that the US is not gonna cut interest rates anytime in the near future it also means that this quarter's growth was stagnant even though inflation is high and that introduces us to the monster of stagflation where prices are rising but the economy isn't growing to match it and that is usually followed by unemployment it's not just the US economy that's not doing very well right now world economy is heading or inside a recession and the greatest precipitator of this worldwide recession China the Chinese economy is dealing with a 23 trillion dollar local debt bubble most of that backed by real estate and it's collapsing I'm well aware of their projected growth of 4.6% but anybody can massage data and we know that China is a non transparent economy they are also the world's second largest economy topping $18 trillion so if that hurts the world feels it China's demand for goods in the west has been diminishing and their ability to produce goods for the west is doing the same thing right now the Chinese economy is desperate to unload all of what I produced especially when it comes to electric vehicles that is bad for all of their competitors like Japan South Korea the United States the EU they are desperate to sell whatever they can to have as much liquidity to deal with the new wave of bond defaults that are clearly coming for them US has already sanctioned countless individuals and they have been denying China access to semiconductors and other high tech equipment now the US government is preparing to fully sanction China because of their military aid to Russia China's been doing this quietly for quite some time I think right now our government is just engaging in protectionist practices that is going to hurt the US economy but it is going to crush China to a lower level what scares me about protectionism is that if it goes too far it can crush the entire world economy like it did during the Great Depression but I'm aware that there are many more fail safes put into place to prevent something like that from happening again but you should always keep that possibility on your horizon and right now this does look like a game of chicken between these two largest economies but it's clear that China has a lot more to lose than the United States because China is desperate to sell their goods there's only one market that can buy the quantities that they need purchase the consumer markets of the United States and the European Union valued at over 29 trillion dollars consumer markets of all the bricks nations do not hold a candle to that of the combined amount of the US and the European Union China is cut off from the US market then the deflation that they're facing now will be nothing compared to what they would actually face that stands the risk of putting the US into a deep recession which will easily snowball to the rest of the world the US recession would clearly snowball over the rest of the world and any countries that were still buying quickly cheapening Chinese goods would no longer be able to do so the US would recover much quicker from this than China but I have some positive points to make or one this is just the first quarter of the year a lot can happen over the next nine months China will most likely seek a compromise so they can keep selling us their goods second I bet you within three to five months most of the conflicts in the Middle East will boil down to a minimum or meal that will stabilize global trade and also the price of oil 3 the fact that a huge chunk of the GOP is willing to support the Democrats in aid to Ukraine and other measures shows a more unified front than everyone else thought $60 billion of funding for Ukraine means it gives them an extra edge against Russia long string of Ukraine wins against Russia or kicking Russia out of Ukraine overall will be a huge boon to the world economy and world trade official jobless claims are still trending down the same is going on with continued jobless claims our exports have increased to an all time high of $263 billion this month the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index is at 15.5 well up from the negative territory it was from months ago I wouldn't be surprised over the next few months if we saw some kind of housing measure which made it easier for Americans to afford homes because it's an election year we are most likely gonna see a lot of massaged data to make the economy look a little bit better which means there would be probably more consumer spending during this time so even though there is some bad economic news for this week that is not definitive for the rest of the year more reports are gonna come out tomorrow we'll see where it goes from there my name is the Geo Hussar I'm going to be interviewing John Allen Woods the CTO of the Algrand Foundation about what impact blockchain can have for the rest of the world will be tomorrow at four PM Dublin time 11:00am Eastern Standard Time and 8:00am Pacific Standard Time thanks for watching",

    "voice_to_text": "1973 is. Is pretty much the high point to the American Empire. For those who hadn't figured it out, we've been in decline for 50 years. 1973 was our APEX, was our height. The distance from the poorest person, the richest person was really, really low. And it was a time of innovation. I mean, we landed on the moon. That wasn't a bad thing to do. Think of how primitive the computers were. They were so awful that they had to hire mathematicians to double check the results from the computers because they knew the computers weren't reliable. They could get you answer quickly, but they couldn't get it to you accurately. Nixon doesn't quite do all the damage, but he does some. And by many socioeconomic indicators, United States starts to go backwards in 1973. In other words, in many ways, the economy of 1973 is something that most Americans dream of and reminisce of. It's our imaginary moment when we think of the economy that the preserver nature wants to get back to. So when a politician stands up and says, I'm gonna do something like Make America Great again, they're thinking of the 1973 economy. When they hear that, they're thinking of 1953. Sorry. They're thinking of 9 1853. When they think of the social order. So really they hear, make America 19th century again. Reagan is the guy who does the destruction to the education system.

Thanks for your support for the party over so many years. That's fantastic, and I'm sorry to hear about it. But all I'd say is, next election, there's gonna be one of two people Prime Minister at the end of it, me or Keira Starmer. On the two issues that you mentioned, you should just come to a view on who you think's more likely to deliver for you. And on the issue of net zero, I don't know if you remember last year, I stood up and made a very significant speech. Changed our approach. Net zero was very clear that we can't rush to it in an ideological way. That saddles cost of five, 10, 15 grand on ordinary families like yours. Didn't think that was right. Change the policy on it. Of course we're gonna get there. I've got young kids. I care about the environment. We should do that in a sensible way, when we're doing a better job on it than pretty much anyone else. And when it comes to tackling illegal migration, you know, I'm battling the Labor Party and everyone else to get our Rwanda Bill through Parliament. So, look, I'm. Look, those are the issues that you care about. I care about them, too. I've already showed that I'm delivering on them. And I said if You vote for reform, all you're gonna do is put KS Dahmer in power, and then we're gonna get no action.",

You're 31 years old and you have sex, allegedly over a 3 month period with a 16 year old. We're done. I'm unsubscribing. Alright. And I am sick of conservatives online trying to defend that as though she had a role in it. She was a minor. Just because you can't be prosecuted for it doesn't. It's right. The conservative men I know are lovely, they're ethical, they're honorable. It's not to say they've never fallen down in their lives, but in no world would they be taking advantage of a 16 year old minor. I have a daughter who's 4 years away from that. You come anywhere near her as a 31 year old man and we are gonna have a serious problem. And it's not gonna be over whether you could demonetize on YouTube. Yes, I really hope my friends and the conservative side of the aisle would remember. Just because we're all over. Me too. And it was an overreaction and it went too far and it got politicized. Doesn't mean that we have to need jerk defend every scumbag who gets accused of bad behavior.",

I ask you tonight, where is the stability? a crying prince is falling out the royal family. he's washing his dirty laundry in public and we're all feasting on gossip.",
