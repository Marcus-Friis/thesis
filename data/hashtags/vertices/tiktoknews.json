And I'm sure by him being, you know, an educator, that he took some sort of harassment training, you know, some sort of, you know, child harassment, you know, sexual harassment train, which all educators take, I'm sure of, because if you're educated, mandatory. And, um, that what he gets done, y'all seen is, um, is crossing the line. You know, bringing a dozen donuts to class after everyone, as you know, passed a pop quiz or quiz that everybody worked hard to pass, that's one thing, but, you know, having your students, you know, physically touch you. Yeah, he definitely didn't think this through, to be quite honest. So, you know, saying, those who agree, comment. Those who disagree, comment as well. And y'all have an amazing day. God bless.",

    "voice_to_text": "particularly on TikTok about what's going on in the Middle East is woeful Hillary girl you should have sat this one out it's truly so ironic because this is the propaganda that video that I stitched is propaganda at least for my generation Gen Z they taught us about media literacy and I know what a primary secondary and tertiary source is so when I am seeing primary sources of what's happening on the ground I'm recognizing that that is the most undiluted untouched source of information that we are going to receive the families sending me messages begging to save them and being sent evidence of the cruelty happening to their family unfortunately that is a primary source and this is exactly why they wanna ban TikTok because we have direct *access to primary sources and we're using that information to rapidly organize ourselves if me watching family members pick pieces of their loved ones out of the rubble makes me pro H-m-s then hmm I truly don't have a problem being aligned with the revolutionary group who's trying to prevent a G side of their people our government works through control that's why cop cities are popping off everywhere all of our elected officials all of the news media outlets are \ud83d\udca9 themselves over what's happening on this platform and Twitter and Instagram we're all seeing the primary sources and it is shaping how we are feeling and acting about the situation they thought they could have complete control of the narrative because that's absolutely what happened in the past not to mention what she said is actually really dangerous wanting to hold people accountable for the information that they put online which on the surface level yeah okay it sounds reasonable you don't want people flat out lying about important events but like anything the US government does it's never going to be used in the way that we think it will be used if there's any way to target and punish people posting information it will be used against BIPOC activists who are spreading information on this platform that is usually going to be the closest to primary source it would be used against people who are doing actual good work on this platform like um I forgot the name of the creator who's matching people with families to sponsor um or the the guy who started the um the block out there's no way in hell it would be used against all of the people spreading actual misinformation on the subject because that closely fits the narrative that they want the American people to have they fundamentally don't want us to have free speech or access to information because then people like Hillary can't control the narrative and bend the people to her will and this is what I mean when I say Democrats are honestly no better than Republicans they're all funded and bought by the same people and ultimately even though they argue over literally everything imaginable we've seen that on the worst policy they can actually come together because ultimately they do want the same things so honestly be wary of all politicians and this is why we need to be fighting back about this TikTok ban we've seen the cruelty that isn't real has enacted full out in front of cameras in front of press teams I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if phones didn't exist if social media didn't exist I mean we've seen real world examples of how bad it would have gotten and I can't stress how important it is and how thankful I am that despite going through this horrific tragedy people are still posting about what's happening in real time my heart and my prayers go out to everyone there right now you guys are never not on my mind and it just amazes me the strength and resilience that you have every day to continue posting about what's happening and it's thanks to you guys that we can mobilize effectively and accurately and not fall to American propaganda so #AllEyesOnRafah and #FromTheRiverToTheSea y'all",

A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

    "voice_to_text": "That Nigeria is actually the 12th most dangerous country in the world. And the military base that Harry travel to, uh, is somewhere that the Foreign Office is actually advising against visiting. Anything could happen. But uh, remembering as well that not just that the security and everything that they're providing is being paid for. So that's another controversy because I think at least three 3 quarters of the the country are in poverty. this highlights the hypocrisy over their security fears here in Helena. One of the reasons they chose to go there as well was because of course, Megan's been looking into her heritage and she's discovered that she's 43% Nigerian. And she's described feeling like it's a homecoming, feeling very much at home in the West African country. And yet, um, we're told, um, I'm read, I read in the paper this morning that. That she actually came to the UK to pick Harry up on route there, but didn't step foot out of the Windsor suite. Uh, he throw air support. So little is her affection or small is her affection for us here in the UK, where she had a huge wedding, welcomed into the royal family, but feels more at home in a country she's never visited before.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, y'all. I hope that this video finds you well. This is doctor is. Yes, yes, yes, you guys, this is it. Listen, I know I've had my fair share of criticisms of Lizzo, including the fact that she just went to the Met Gala. However, this is what we have wanted. To my knowledge, she is the only celebrity that I can think of that is actually made a video promoting the gofundme of people trying to get out of Rafa. And I'm here to say this is good. You guys take the W. I saw already some people criticizing her for this. It's like, look, look, I get it, I get it, I get it. She shouldn't have gone to the Met Gala. She shouldn't have performed for Joe Biden. She should have said something a long time ago, but she's saying something now. Don't misunderstand me. No one saying you gotta be huge fan, you gotta go buy her shit or whatever. But what I am saying is we should be encouraging this. We should be encouraging this. We should hope that she is the first of more. I wanna see more people doing this, more celebrities and people with power and influence doing this, because we need to remember, guys, this is not about us. This isn't about us and our feelings toward any individual person. This is about the gofundme. She shared two gofundmes. One for evacuation for a family in Rafa and another for Relief for the Sudanese people. So this is a good thing. And since we're already on the topic, let me just mention that my friend Muhammad, who I've been talking about his campaign for a while, is still trying to evacuate from Rafa. He has sent me multiple videos over the last few days where he is trying to escape and there is rapid bombardment all around him and he barely has cell service. This is his Instagram. Please go to it and go to the link in his bio and donate. This is his gofundme. He has 3 beautiful children. He is trying to evacuate. Remember, this is not about us. This is about them. The whole point of pressuring celebrities and influencers to talk about this was so that they could use their influence and their privilege to help other people.",

Anybody who is teaching, uh, in a university, or anyone who is, uh, putting content on social media should be held responsible for what they include and what they exclude. And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East, is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted. Pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there.",

And the pink one tastes like strawberry. I love it because it adds an extra crunchy layer, and it adds so much extra flavor. I hadn't eaten eggs for over 40 days, so this was like a dream come true to me. Safe to say that all the eggs were finished, and I can't wait till I can eat more next year. See ya.",

Say I wanted to go to McDonald's and you had your kid with you. Would I be expected to pay for the two of you or just you? Let's see what they have to say. Just me. That's. That's my baby. That's my responsibility. I wouldn't. I mean, if he wants to do that, it's fine, but I don't expect. Not the expectation. Now, let's be honest, after seeing so many of these, who really saw that coming? You're not gonna feel any type of way if I'm like, okay, let's get me a meal. You a meal, but you can pay for your kids. Um, yeah, no, I don't mind that, because that's why she has her father. You know, to be able to contribute and then, you know, like I said, if you want to do that, then that's fine. Thank you. I appreciate it. But if not, then that's fine as well. Would I need to provide anything for your child at all or. No, just kinda be there. Just be there for us. Both of us. It's almost refreshing, isn't it? Hearing someone That actually appreciates someone just being there and being with them and their child, as opposed to having an expectation that someone that they're just dating pays for everything.

What? Why won't you answer these very simple questions? Senator, it's not appropriate for you. Are you serious? And spend to come in the world leaders. Are you scared that you'll lose your job if you say anything about negative about the Chinese Communist Party? I disagree that you will find content that is critical of China. And the next time you go on, are you scared that you'll be arrested and disappear the next time you go to mainland China? Senator, I. You will find content as critical of China in any other country freely on TikTok. Okay, okay, let's let. Let's turn to what TikTok. A tool of the Chinese Communist Party is doing to America's youth. Does the, uh. Does the name Mason Edens ring a bell? Uh, senator, you may have to give me more specifics, if you don't mind. Yeah, he was a 16 year old Arkansas. And after a breakup in 2022, he went on your platform and search for things like inspirational quotes and positive affirmations. Instead, he was served up numerous videos glamorizing suicide until he killed himself by gun. What about the name Chase Nasca",
