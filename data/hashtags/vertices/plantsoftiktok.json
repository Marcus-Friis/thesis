I wanted to show you how all my little propagations are doing the ones that I stuck in with a cut up golden pothos that you see right here. So, I did this technique with more than I'd originally posted about in the video. As you can see right here, I did it with this Rosemary. I also did it with at least a few different clippings of Flaming Katy\u2026 more of which you can see right here. and little gold golden pothos in the back. I've Learned at least a few different lessons I'm gonna share with you from this experiment. The first lesson is that there's some plants that this technique works very well with. This Rosemary for instance\u2014 she's doing great got lots of little root growth I'll probably let her go for another month or two. It also really worked well with the flaming Katy\u2019s. With it's originally intended plant it did not work well. It\u2019s quite dead and rotted \ud83e\udd72 Moment of silence for the fallen \ud83e\udd27 but so um [Lesson #2] as it turns out from Google no matter what I did this one wouldn't have survived because she needed to have some of her  original root mass to come with her. So, yeah originally she started folding in her  leaves and I'm like \u201cNo baby your stem is still great keep holding on.\u201d So I Frankenstein the hell out of her with  some tape to hold her open. Just thinking: \u201cYou got this take in that light you're gonna you're gonna survive I swear!\u201d  She didn\u2019t \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72 No\u2014 she eventually just continued to rot and I felt like a terrible person.  Clearly I still have much to learn about  being a plant mom. [Lesson #3]: Though, I would consider this  Rosemary propagation a success, due to where the wax is located it did prevent roots from forming in that specific area. Do with that information what you will \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc8b",

I didn\u2019t trim her and quickly she took over one of my raised beds last year. Because she mesmerized me with her sweet scent and beautiful flowers, took me a while to decide to uproot her.

In 2020, she double down on enabling my planting/ gardening hobby! Lol I started with a container vegetable garden on our deck, she bought me a Garden Tower 2, the soil, the seedlings and even the red wiggler worms! Whatever I needed, She provided. She\u2019s been a true gift since day one when I found out I\u2019m expecting. She changed my life! Just like the garden, she is a breath of fresh air. She is beautiful and kind and most of all loved! I love hanging out with her.

The Victoria water platters are native to the tropics of South America and related to water lilies. Their leaves grow up to about 4 to 6 feet in diameter. For reference, I'm 6 feet tall here in this picture. One of the coolest things about them is that their flowers actually exhibit thermogenesis. This means that they create their own heat, and they can actually reach temperatures of up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. We're just getting started. Each flower only blooms for two nights. The first night, the flower is white and female, like you see here. The heat attracts nocturnal beetles, which crawl in through this opening here. The flower provides carbohydrate reserves, which keeps the beetle orgy going all night long. In the morning, the flower closes up, trapping the beetles inside. On the second night, the flower opens as a pink male and begins releasing pollen as a trap. Beetles escape. They move past the anthers, carrying pollen with them to a fresh female flower for round two. They're also covered in insane spine.",

Six points, six planes at work. I was trying to, like. I literally had to count them. Technically, some of them are cuttings from one of my others, but I kind of try to rehab some of my plants here because there's just such great lighting. I've also got my little, um, purple zebra.

So it's so funny because I had this thought the other day that plants could see only because. Let me show you. So I've had this little pothos plant for a couple of years now, and she always stayed, like, in this little planter. Like, she never stood up like this, you know? And just recently, like, her leaves have gotten bigger, she's more shiny. She's standing. She's standing up. And I noticed that she started doing this when I put the mirror in front of her so she could see herself. Conceited little bitch.",

You would just put some water to the soil, and then all of a sudden, it started growing. And then you add the seeds. There was a bunch of seeds in there, but I only grew two because, like I said, I have had experience with crazy pumpkins before. I found the perfect spot for them, and now I'm super excited to see if they start to grow. Just wanted to share with you guys, and if it goes well, I'll make another video. Okay, bye.",

I am a mother to about 200 plants, and there are a couple plants that are literally in the corner dying. Let's talk about it. There are some plants in my collection that just do not like me. We just don't 5 like, it's fine. I don't take it personally. It's totally fine. I don't care. Through some of my sadness and despair, I have chosen to be super vulnerable about this. I'm gonna show you some of my plants that are on their way to heaven. Is my fiddly sick? I have had her for two or three years now, and every year she looks worse. I generally don't do good with ficuses, so, like, this is no surprise to me. She's just one of those problem plants that I'm gonna put outside when it warms up. Up next are my ravens easys. I don't know why. They grow super leggy. I don't encounter this issue with any other ZZ in my house. It's just Raven ZZ's. They're beautiful plants, don't get me wrong, but they just do not like me. Up next is this pot. Those that I was supposed to be rehabilitating. Here she is in all her glory. This what I'll probably end up chopping and propping if she has any good growth points. And last, but certainly not least is my fuzzy Petio philodendron. She's crusty, dusty. I probably need to stake her up. Just one of those plants. And I'm like, oh, I'll get around to you. And I never do. If you ever have plants in your collection and they're not doing too well, don't beat yourself up about it. Just plans to give them a little extra TLC. All right.",

Go ahead and trim all the way down. It will take longer to regrow a stem, but it will grow back. That will encourage bigger and larger blooms. If. If you don't want to do that, then trim it. See these little buds here? These are opened. Ooh, look, it's closed in between the last open one to the closed one. You have any black roots or mushy roots, snip those off. All the rest of these look great. The one from this size pot to this one orchid mix he roots in, and you have that soil for every single time you do it so it can settle. Shimmy, shimmy.

And I have all 3 of my collection now so I can show you. In terms of care and growth, habit would say that all 3 of these are incredibly similar. And as you can tell by the foliage, they look a lot alike. So if you're trying to go just based off of the leaves, you're probably gonna have a hard time. The secret and telling the difference with these babies is going to be looking at the stems. A philodendron White Princess is going to have green stems with pink variegation along the margin. It is rare, but it can happen that a white Princess pushes out pink variegation instead of white, but it usually is going to fade to white eventually. The White Wizard looks really similar, but the stem is going to be completely green, no signs of pink. And lastly, the philodendron White Knight is going to have a darker red kind of burgundy stem, and that's going to be really apparent, especially on that new growth. Let me know what's your favorite!",

Perfect companion for basil, cucumbers and brassicas such as kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, turnips, radishes. Their aroma deters cabbage pests. That\u2019s what I had growing in these beds last year. This year, I will need to clear the space to make room for gourds (squashes and melons). She attracts a lot of pollinators. I\u2019ve seen lady bugs and bees visit her a lot. The one bunch of seedling actually multiplied to 2 bundles as seen here. I spread her a little so it doesn\u2019t suffocate the Thyme near her. I am calling her Camilla as she is becoming a force in my garden. Looks like she\u2019s is a German Chamomile as supposed to a Roman Chamomile. The German chamomile is about 24\u201d, prolific bloomer, an annual, dies after flowering but set seeds that comes back the following year while a Roman Chamomile is a perennial and shorter in size. I actually saved some seeds last year but learning now that I may not need them. Will save for the flowers for loose tea instead. Chamomile is known as a good herbal tea for calming the stomach and anxiety and promoting sleep. However it may not be good for people with asthma especially with allergies to ragweed or the asteraceae family (ie. aster, daisies, chrysanthemums, etc.) \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude33  I\u2019m afraid if I don\u2019t relocate or cut her back soon she will sow her seeds everywhere and will grow all over my beautiful rock bed. I will keep you posted but in the meantime, join me in enjoying her beauty. #garden #chamomile #chamomiletea #germanchamomile #herbal #herb #plants #companionplanting #zone6b ",
