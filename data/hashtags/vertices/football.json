We just started like, what? It's only been 10 minutes. He's like, yeah, we still got number 35+ at the time. What? Plus at the time. Bro, I'm not gonna lie to you.

If you don't stretch, you're now gonna lose your range of motion and lose every sort of mobility within your body. But you're being told not to stretch. Form rolling is a way of massaging your body. So, I mean, unless you wanna pay \u00a380 for someone to massage you when formal can do the same job, by all means, don't form roll. Band work as well. Another way of increasing your range of motion and your mobility within your body. And last but not least, gym work. You see, all the top athletes who had such a long career, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, they all went to the gym. But, hey, by all means, don't do those. Wow.",

    "voice_to_text": "Trust me bros, you don't need to learn. I'll give you my reason. Here's a couple of reasons why I wouldn't want Joao Felix. Reason No. 1. We should sell Mason Greenwood for multiple reasons, which I'm not gonna go into, and use that money on position that we need to cover, like center backs. Also, Zhuang Felix has a history of, you know, not getting well with managers. And if Eric Turnhardt is to stay, we don't need another guy that's gonna give him problems, in my personal opinion. Also, this brother's wages are crazy. 2:50. And he hasn't been great in the last two to 3 years. Let's be real. Since Zhuang left beifika, he hasn't been the player that they bought him for. I don't think he suits acclaim Madrid system very well. I do see him suiting more of a Barca style. Where is that one touch football? So I feel it's a little bit like Jaden Sancho. And I don't think we need that at the club. If you're a stats guy, his stats has been okay over the years. It's been. It's been alright, as you can see if you're a stats person. Over the last three years in Portuguese. I think this guy needs to sort out his career, cause it's just all over the place.

    "voice_to_text": "Fair play to Vincent company. Went from managing Burnley and getting relegated to. Yeah, fair play to him indeed. I mean I don't understand how on what world that make sense for a manager to get his team sacked. Because he was so stubborn to change the way he plays to suit his team to keep him in the league. Yeah, though like Vincent company went wrong because he didn't. He didn't decide to switch up his tactics, he carried on persistently try to get his team to play how they did in championship. When you one of the best teams in the league as means Man City know you'll get away with it. But when you're promoted into the Premier League, you've kinda gotta adapt. You've kinda gotta realise that mighty my players and my team isn't strong enough to play that way in the Premier League and get results. So me as a western fan, I was annoyed that Moyes didn't adapt to certain games. He just played the same way over and over again. It's clear that Vincent Company does the same thing. And yeah, I can't see, I can't see anything but Leverkusen or another German team pipping Bayern Munich to the title again. But yeah, that's my opinion. I don't. Yeah, it is a bit of a weird one because although I think what he did with Burnley in the championship was great, how he coached them, it's all well and good to doing that With one of the best teams in the league. But when you're. When you're up against it and you've got use your head and try and change tactics to try and get the best result for the team at that time. Yeah, company kinda proved that he. He couldn't do that. He couldn't change how his team played. So I don't think it's gonna be much of a success forum in any way of form. And won't be surprised if Dortmund Salzburg is Salzburg. No, Leipzig. It's one or the other. Dortmund, Frankfurt, even. UM. Leverkusen. One of them. One of them. Pippin. Um. Bayern Munich. To start all again. But yeah. Let me know your thoughts in the comments please. Like, share all that shit. But yeah, commonly wise.",

    "voice_to_text": "Addressing trends at left winger. Because I am not advocating that he plays on the left winger. I just can't believe. One thing I find disappointing on social media is a large amount of people are just so desperate to see the demise of a content creator. And I, I don't know who this guy is, I don't know if anybody else, uh, does. I've only recently come across his videos. His, his football coach who just produces harmless videos from kind of a tactical perspective of football. And he's built up a following quite quickly. And I think fair play to him, right? You can clearly see he has a passion for football coaching. And he's come under fire a little bit stick recently for suggesting how England could line up, that you wrote 2024. And whether you agree or not, fair play to him for putting himself out there to just get people talking, to perhaps suggest how a team could set up differently, how players could express themselves differently. That's what football's all about. And I'm all for that kind of content creation over someone. Some rage baiting video which is just clamoring for controversy to. To real people in like, it clearly works hard. And I think until you play football at decent level, or you've played throughout your life, or still playing, or you've coached or managed, I think it's easy to criticise. But when you're living that on a daily basis, of course you've Got that passion to come out with all different. Different ideas and different perspectives, and I'm all for it. It gets people engaged, insensible conversations. So, yeah. Anyway, like I said, have you come across this guy? What? What your thoughts? Um, but for me, from my perspective, let's not suppress content creators creativity, and let's get involved in a conversation.",

Us women who are into sports, who love watching football, who love watching racing, F1, all of that. Us women, we have gotten so many comments thrown at us the last couple of years and even before that of oh, it's a male dominated sports, it's only for men, you only watch for the hot drivers or the hot players and everything. We have been getting those kinds of comments from men for years. Just because we like a sport, just because we like watching football, we like watching racing. And sure, there are probably some girls or women out there who only watch because of the hard men that are doing the sport, but the majority of the industry of women in motorsport, women in football, we watch it because we love watching the sport. And in both sports, we have just gone to a point where it has been more accepted and more generalize for women to also be able to love the sports for the sport, more women getting opportunities in like women's football or F1 academy in the engineering part of F1. So for an influencer who got invited to watch the football, to watch the racing, make a video saying the contrary that oh, she's only there to watch the hot player, she's only there to watch the hot drivers because She's an influencer making these videos. She's gonna have people generalize her videos to the wider community of women in motorsport and women in football, women in sports in general. And that is gonna set us back massively, as we've just gone to a point where it's been more normalized. Watching those videos really made me angry. I just had to say something about it.",

I'm too large to run most of the time, so I shout from the bench. Um, we were told they train twice a week. Um, had six preseason games. We turned up to our first game against them, where we only lost 2 1. Um, half our team was hungover. We'd never trained before, we'd never met our left winger before. We had. We've never even spoken to our left winger before. And we weren't wanna look against this tactical, incredible. Sunday League can plan any pitch. And we got tired and lost. Um, they weren't good. They. They didn't do anything tactically. Um, I. I do like some of the stuff he says. The. The many that I've stitched has got some good content, but this is. This is my Parish FC top. And, uh, if you're claiming your corner routine is. Is fantastic because you scored a goal against Parish, join the club. We've conceded about 40 set pieces this season. It nothing to do with a corner tactic, I promise you that.",

    "voice_to_text": "Say the Premier League has turned into a bit of a Farmers league. I would say that this. I can disagree more. I don't think the Premier League is turning into a Farmers League at all. I think it's actually the most competitive it's been for a while. So this season Man City won the league by two points on the last game of the season. Pretty sure that's not what you call a Farmers League. They didn't run away over even slightly the year before that in 2022 23 they went by five points. That's mainly cause Arsenal bottled it towards the end of the season, but still they pushed Man City pretty much all the way up until about what, three or four games to go? The year before that Liverpool literally missed out on the title by one point. I think Aston Villa went two nil up and Man City had to come back 3 2 to win the title. In 2021, yeah it did change. It was I think. I think it's a 12 point difference. Man United came second, so yeah, Man City won it comfortably in that one scene. The year before that in 1920, Liverpool actually won the title, so yeah, definitely not Man City steamrolling the league there. And the year before that in 2018 2019, Man City again won by one point on the last game of the season. So in the last six seasons Man City have only run away With the title once, and we've had another winner in that time as well in Liverpool. So yeah, definitely not a Farmers League. It's actually really competitive. It was a three horse race this year until Liverpool decided to drop out with about seven or eight games to go. So yeah, not a farmers league. I can only see it getting better. And even so, when Pep maybe leaves the end of next year, it'll be even tighter cause I don't think Man City will dominate at all.",

But my main question is why is this the stats that you pulled out? Why is it this statistics? Because they're trying to tell me that this is the only significant statistics for Messi and Ronaldo. Because I looked and I was seeing all club stats for European clubs excluding friendly. So I'm not seeing any international statistics here. So are you trying to tell me that the international statistics are somewhat insignificant as well? Because personally that is where I would disagree. I don't believe their international statistics is is insignificant because I feel like it is also the Pinnacle of football. Yeah but there is this start here that says all time start without USA and without Saudi. That is the insignificant ones. Yeah because based on your videos these are the 2 insignificant ones, the USA and the Saudi Pro League. But it also contains the international statistics. We are Ronaldo has more goals. So personally I feel like their international statistics is also very significant and is also the Pinnacle of football. So it is important to include their international performances as well, not just their Club performances in Europe includes their international performances because it is very significant. if you say the international statistics and achievement is irrelevant, that's your opinion. But personally I disagree. Now for the people who may still get this video twisted, even though I know you, no matter what I say, they will still get it twisted. I came here for the goals and the goals alone. Have a good day.",

What are they risking winning matches for? They could have cemented themselves as the Invincibles of the Turkish league. Hey come on, the being invincible is the greatest achievement right? Having 12 draws is the greatest achievement. I can't understand why sides like Fennebach and Galatasha I don't wanna be great like the invincible. Like surely that's the only achievement you would try and replicate, right? Why play for the win and try get maximum points when you could have the invincible? Truth. They just drawn 12 of their game. They could have had Gold Air, Galatasra. I could have won gold air is far better than winning the the title in Turkey, Feder Bach and Galatasra. So just relax and let other team win as many games as possible. Because the real winners is whatever team goes invincible, right? Not the team which ends up with the most points at the end of the day. Getting 90 points, but going invincible is a far better achievement you know. Then get a hundred and two point, cause it doesn't matter if 102 points guarantees you the league title, you were beaten so you're just not as good. What were Fennebatch you think? Trying to win the league when they could have just been the greatest side in Turkish league history anyway? Yeah, the Invincibles were overrated. Thank you. Thank you.",

Um, I've seen that clip, what. What I'm stitching now, uh, a few times now, and it. I'm still baffled that, um, the club have allowed him to go on, you know, something with. That should have been Celtic, uh, and camel Gob and the other one that Steven Olsen is a complete. Anyway. But for city to allow Kyle to go on, on stuff like that. Listen, I love Kyle Walker. I've. I've actually backed him. Um, I've had arguments with city fans this season because, you know, they've been slaughtering Kyle Walker. He's had a poor season like that. Yeah, and I. I backed him hundred percent and I always will. Any. Any city player, anybody pulls a city shirt on, I will back. I just don't like the. The ways he's going on stuff like this now. He's coming out with comments. Uh, after the FA Cup final, um, he was going on about, you know, his friendship with United players and stuff like that. About, um, you know, getting in the England squad, you know, cause through his friends that. That. That's all well and good, Kyle, but we've just lost an FA Cup final and you're going on about United players and stuff like that. It doesn't. You're not doing yourself any favours, mate. Um, but Your personal stuff the club have backed you with, even. You even got a new contract through it. So I think at least. At least a bare minimum, you don't do stuff like this because I know it's getting a lot of city fans tits at the moment. Um, I still can't understand why. Why you doing stuff like that, but, um. Maybe it's because, you know, you're going in the summer. You going to Saudi? Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? But yeah, it's getting a little bit tiresome now with the stuff what. What is coming out with. And obviously we're gonna get various comments in the comments, but listen, is. What is it? I'd like to know all the fans opinions as well. You think that it should be just concentrating on the. On the job in hand, uh, which is his club who pays his wages? Or do you think he's got the right to go on shows like, uh. And. And they're not like big shows. It's not if it's Sky Sports or anything. It's just no beds like that. Stephen Elson and third in hand and whoever else they called. So, yeah, I. I just. It just doesn't sit well with me. I don't know what you. You think",

Why is nobody talking about this? You tried to get me banned off TikTok last time and I did a stitch. Uh, a stitch with you? Um, just shows you. You give it but you can't take it. Um, so. But in my opinion, you're a buffoon. You're an absolute buffoon in. In. In fairness. Um. So run along to TikTok again. Report me again. Um, yeah, you know, can't give a shiny shit. Enjoy the rest of your bank holiday, you know, cause why is nobody talking about this?",

Cause there's a lot of Arsenal fans right, that need their egos to be pushed right down here. Because you guys are acting like Arteta is like some amazing genius manager that's like gonna be so much higher than Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola. Can I just remind you, 5 years he's been in charge and he's won one FA Cup. One FA Cup, two Community Shields, but no one even cares about that or even bothers to acknowledge the Community Shields. But one FA Cup in five years of management, 20 years, Arsenal have gone without winning a Premier League trophy and you still not won a European trophy. And you're saying that we want the next Michel Arteta? Yeah, I really don't think we want that at all.",

Please watch the full clip, then send a context of the conversation that we're about to have. So this man, who's been married to this woman for a while now, you believe that you've had three children with this woman, and it turned out to be all three children are not yours. He did a DNA test, and all three children turned out to be not his. And their supposedly biological father is the pastor of the church that his wife goes to, and he exposes her in front of her, um, YouTube IG Live while she was doing a ministry sermon with her peoples, and basically exposed her for being basically a daddy. Daddy, daddy, daddy. Um, this is my thing. I know that a lot of women find it very offensive to ask for a DNA test at birth. I think a lot of men are very worried, some, because at the end of the day, the mother is without doubt on who the mother is. The father is always the possible deniability. We don't know who, because it could be anybody at that. At that moment. I just feel like, as if they need to be a middle ground. Of a place where men can acts for a DNA test at an early stage of that childhood development, prior to you already spending five, six, seven, eight, 11 years Of not knowing, and then find out that these children are not yours. And to me, women who fight back towards that initiative, y'all be the ones that make people side you. About wanting to commit into long term relationships. Is because y'all be so prideful and find it disrespectful, or, oh, I'm gonna give him the voice paper. Soon as he gets asked for a DNA test. Why are you in your feelings about that? Why? Because if that was your brother, your uncle, your nephew, you'd want him to get DNA test to be sure. But your man, quote unquote, the one that's supposed to be a biological father, your children can't ask you for a DNA test. And you, you ready to fight? You ready to. To blow your whole family up?

He spent half, more than half the season out injured and was it four goals and 10 assists in 18 games? And he's saying he's finished? Kevin De Bruyne finished. Oh my god. And the worst part is, you're a Man United fan with Casamero in the middle. Please, God, you've. You've got to be deluded to think Kevin De Bruyne is anywhere near finished. Like, seriously, you. You gonna tell me that Kobe Maynard. Maynard is better than him? Or, you know, Bruno Fernandez got more, more goals in his system this season. But of course he has, because he was out for five, five or six months injured, is come back from injury and still done better than nearly three quarters of the midfielders in the Premier League. Wasn't he joined third for assist this season in the Premier League? But yet you think he's finished after missing that minute, that much time? Mate, you have no clue.",

It's full on pathetic. Am I surprised? Not really. Was it expected? Absolutely. Manchester United yesterday won the FA Cup off the back of their worst ever season since the Premier League begun. But for some reason you'll always get that small pocket of United fans who have to jump on social media and just somehow make it about Arsenal. No mention of Liverpool, who fine, won the Carabao Cup, but you could argue that the FA Cup is more prestigious. No mention of Spurs? No mention of Chelsea, Villa, Newcastle? All teams that achieved a better league position than them. Because unfortunately you still have United fans that live in 2,004 with a rivalry between the two clubs was absolutely huge. It's time to get over it fellas. It's time to drop it. Just grow up a bit. This rivalry is not the same as it was two decades ago. And just for a little bit of context, we achieved identical seasons back in 2020. Arsenal finished eighth, won the FA Cup, United finished second and won nothing. And there was no mention of Arsenal having the better season. Put it this way, there isn't a single Arsenal fan in the world that would swap seasons. In fact, I don't think there's many fans out There at all. That would swap seasons. One FA Cup does not gloss over the fact that this is the worst United side I've ever seen in my life.",

So guys, if you watch that video, Coach Raffa is basically responding to my stitch, um, and kinda comments that I made about this line up behind me, which I thought was rubbish. And I just wanna say, Coach Raffa, you as a person, I've got nothing against you, you know, you're doing good things, being a good, uh, creator in the game. But I'm allowed to have an opinion about the opinion that you shared in that video, and I still think it was absolute rubbish. Bro, I'm. I'm. I'm so sorry to say, but. But that's just my opinion about that video. Um, particularly, you know, I thought rice at central centre back was a pretty bad shout. Maybe not the worst in the world, but not great. But the trend at left wing I still think is awful. When you're looking at my comment where I said that it would have been better if Trent was at least inverted. I'm talking about him playing as an inverted full back. So if we're talking about this 3 2 4 1 in possession shape, him being one of the players in the base, Trent left wing is still terrible. The fact that he's coming inside at times in the shape that you wanna adopt doesn't mean much to me. He's still way too advanced and The fact that at times, Trent is gonna have to hold whip and play as a left winger. Bro, I'm sorry, nothing you say, it just cut out, but for a second, but, yeah, nothing you say will make that logical in my mind. And I don't think it will make it logical in a lot of people's minds, bro. Like, trend. Like, where did the left wing come from? Like, right wing would have been odd anyway, but left wing. I'm sorry, man, it's. It's still. It's still just rubbish. Uh, to. To me, I just don't feel that that's some of your best work, mate. Um, sorry if it upsets you, but I've just got to be honest with you, man. Uh, that's my opinion.",

Now, I'm sure most of you have seen this clip, but I can't believe they've got someone actually showing ex professionals. The most out of context clip I've ever seen. So. Cause people are a bit stupid up there, they don't understand he was completely taking the piss out of Madrid fans. The fact they're taking a small clip that just makes it so out of context just sums up media really. But if you haven't seen that clip, he's mocking Madrid fans because they were giving it the whole game and they've scored and he's taking the piss out the gestures that they were throwing. Now it's just football. I understand it when people do stuff seriously like that. It's like you can say what you want, but the end of the day it's really not that deep and it makes it quite funny. And the fact that they've shown ex professionals this and they're all like, oh, this is embarrassing and stuff and questioning fans. Oh, I know for a fact he follows city over Europe home and away every week. It's, you know, you can't knock it. And they're trying to make him seem less of a fan, cause then out of context clip is pathetic. But yeah, anyway, it's just embarrassing. It just Sums up media and how they're saying this is hooliganism. It's just laughable. Um, but yeah, it is what it is. It is what it is. But yeah it's just hilarious the fact that they are actually trying to say that is hooliganism and making him seem less less of a fan. Uh, it just sums up media and ex footballers. They ain't really got a clue. Um, but yeah I'll tag him below. Don't you know, give him stick for anything? Cause it's really not that deep. It's. It's quite funny to be honest. Um, I'm not tagging him below to embarrass him, but he follows. See him in a way. As I said, he post some pretty sick stuff. That's good to see. Uh, from an actual proper city fans point of view for all of you that say they got no fans. Um, and no I'm not fucking ass licking him. Um, but I respect fans that go home and away and city gets stick more than anyone so yeah. The fact that he's had this made about him just makes me laugh. But feel free to give him a follow.

Don't know why when I woke up this morning, I just have a feeling it was Man United's day. And I think a few people might have. But you wouldn't have talked to them on the TV cause they were all writing them off, even at half time. You were saying, Carolyn, Carolyn, Alan, Sheera. But I was saying it. There's no way you seen that one. Come on, we're all shocked, we're all surprised. And you know what? Man United deserve to win that game. They really did. Um. City of poor. Really poor all game. I mean, Toku looks dangerous when he came on, but that's some of their star players. Look. Phone didn't look on it. Harland looks okay and little patches, but yeah, they just didn't look. Look all together there. Defensively do it all over the place. In the first half we hadn't run ragged by Man United's pace, but yeah, I told you so, didn't I? So next time you wanna know results, come follow. All towards your toffee and I'll show you. Now up the toffees.",

Trent left wing back? What? Oh no, he trans left wing. He's left wing there. It's not even left wing. What's going on? What is going on? I'm so sorry, man. That is. That's really bad, man.

Not even my Stan fans say that. They may say say say the Mick, but he gets into a lot of Premier League teams and he makes most of a lot of them better, but not all of them. I don't think anyone see anyone say that. And also some people say you should start from England. No, there's a minor. There's some West Ham fans that say again is a bit of a joke but I think people saying he should be in the squad which 100% he should be in the squad but no one says we started like he is ridiculous. Bowen is not overrated. He is unreal and he's getting better every year and the numbers back it up if you just watch him as well.",

If you watch the last AFCOM, he was the main key player for the Nigerian team. The problem with you people is that when people shining, that is when you wanna come out to claim that you wanna praise a person, you understand? Look, man has been play for Atlanta as long as he's been in that club. So I don't understand why you saying that. Where has this guy been? I mean, how come you just know about him? He's been there, he's been playing. That's one thing about you people. You just think that when these players are Africans, they are not useful until they start scoring goals or until they start making names for themselves. That's what you people know. Luke Man has been in the game. And the last AFCOM, Ruth, Luke man has been there. He played wonderfully for Nigeria. One of the greatest player of all time. And now he's just made history. The greatest of all. The only player that has ever scored a hat trick in the Europe League final. And I say you can't take that away from him. So the history is there. So if you don't know about look man, that's your business as far as I'm concerned. Look, man has Been there. He's been playing for Atlanta. He's been playing for Nigeria, and he's doing very well. So whether you know about him now or you've never heard about him, that's your business. That's it.",

Before our takeover. We. We won the FA Cup in 19 o four. When. When was your first. First trophy? It's not all about trophies though. It's. It is what it is, right? And for you to call out city fans saying we're emotionless and stuff like that, you're a disgrace. To be fair, I thought it was only you and Lee Gunnar who were actually fair and alright, but you've gone down in my estimation, mate. Maybe you've signed up for the Arsenal fan TV because your little. Your little video there is so it resembles an Arsenal fan TV kind of ranty, rubbish kind of thing. You had needs to wobble on this one, Lewis. Uh, you. You need to reassess. Calling city out for not being a big club and emotionless. And it's. It's not evident at all. Uh, mate, way off. Way Off with this one. Very disappointed in you. You've. You've. You've gone to the dark side of Arsenal fun TV, ain't you",

You'll say that I actually did say Atlanta would win this. And I seen him against Liverpool. Madness. Absolutely madness. What they done last night was crazy. But could you expect it? Could. You couldn't write it? I don't wanna look when we're at hat trick. You really could not write it. Trey Grey calls as well. Absolutely stolen Liverpool's. And what's next for Atlanta? I really don't know. But most importantly, what's next for Liverpool's? And where does this have been? Some of the players gonna leave them now. We never know.

    "voice_to_text": "Her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. Holy shit. I mean, I knew this guy was a Christian freak, but, oh, my god, the absolute gall and arrogance you have to have to go up on a stage at a college and say this, albeit it's been addicting, is just. That's so insane. Yeah, I, uh. I haven't fully seen the speech until, like, an hour ago. Yeah, it's. It's worse than I ever could imagine. Oh, my god. As someone who lives in Missouri, uh, if you couldn't tell. Yeah, I'm not surprised at all. Not surprised at all that he said this when you gave him a microphone. Now, I could just sit here, like a lot of people are doing, and just clown on this guy, which there's nothing wrong with that. It's. It's really, really easy and really fun to make fun of. But I've noticed that when regarding this situation with Harrison Bucker. I mean, I've seen something. I mean, obviously there's general consensus of, hey, fuck this guy. But something I've noticed, and it's turned into a question, is why is Benedictine asking this guy to speak? Like, Harrison Booker didn't go to Benedictine. He's not from this area. He went to school in Georgia. The only thing. The only connection to this area is that I see is that he plays for the Chiefs, who are in the same area as Benedictine. And His faith, which I. I have no problem with him having his faith. Like, that's. I don't have an issue with that. Now, I do not for one second want to ever construct that Benedictine or really any other people who practices faith agrees with what he's saying or think what he's saying is okay. What I do have an issue with is that when he uses his faith to say things like this that are not okay, and then the school allows him to have an opportunity to say things like this in front of so many people. Quick sidebar, but why is a professional athlete, especially a kicker? Not saying that a kicker isn't difficult, very hard. But why is a kicker speaking at a college graduation, a school he didn't go to, in an area he's not from? It just doesn't really make any sense. It's also been something that really gets me angry is when people use their faith. And again, I don't think anyone who practices Harrison Bucker's faith agrees with this, but it gets me annoyed when people say things like this, and then when people get mad at them, they use excuse of, oh, well, it's what I believe, it's my faith. Like, that's bullshit, right? Like, someone can't say, oh, I think a certain demographic of people will die, and then when asked about why that's bad, they say, oh, well, it's because my faith of Scientology believes that. No, that's not Okay. But, yeah. Guys are douche. He deserves all the shit he's getting. He should know better than to say that. Will he be caught? I don't know. We'll just see.",

But if you wanna go just on the league itself, how many games has Arsenal drew in that year? Was it like 12? Something like that. How many games have Lavacruzin drew? It's not even a debate mate, the Invincibles is overrated anyway. Fantastic achievement but forest was invincible, Preston was invincible, Arsenal went the first and Hannah not the last. It's like as always, Arsenal fans can't have that someone else done something better than their team. Levy cruising hands down better Invincibles. End of.",

Um, yeah, he's an Everton fan. He obviously values brown flight quite highly. Um, and the report in the. The report is talking about, says that United are prepared to offer 55 million for brown flight, uh, as he's one of our main targets this season. So in the video, basically, um, if I remember rightly, he goes on to say that maybe 80 million is probably more, uh. More what the value should be. Um, and for me, that feels high for someone like Brown Fay. Um, he's. He's good, he's promising, he's young, he's. There's obviously a talent there. Um, but how much is a fair, um. A fair value for a player like that? Um, I mean, if you. If you slap on 80 million, hundred million for someone like him, then you're gonna go, let's just say, uh, Saliba, Arsenal. If Branford's 80 million, Saliba's what, hundred and fifty million, then you. You kinda setting them the. The markets getting skewed then, because players are getting massively over, uh, overvalued. I mean, I've seen a lot of talk of why would Bramford leave Everton? Uh, why would he, uh, downgrade to go to Man United? It's crazy. Um, the facts of the matter is, if United can call in with the money that Everton can be happy with. Branford will 110% sign on the dotted line for United in the same way that Rooney did in German. If. If we want a Nona, if we. If we give Everton the money that they want for a Nona, a Nona will come to United. Because we are Man United. It is. That is just when United come calling, there'll be very few players, especially at that level. I mean, neither Nirvana or Branford are at the sort of top tier players at the moment, so I think at that level, I think they will come to United in a heartbeat. But yeah, I found it interesting the. The values of players, um, as I thought it was a little high, what he said, about 80, hundred million sort of thing. For brown fight. But yeah, get in the comments, guys. Let, let me know what you think. Um, how much you think brown fights worth? How much you think, uh, it may take to. To get the deal done for United? As I say, he's. He's apparently one of our main targets this summer with Michael Elise from Palace. So yeah, get in the comments, let me know what you think about this one.",

There is nothing more that pisses me off than I mean, one horrendous takes, but two when people's arguments are double sided. And a lot of his arguments were extremely double sided and horrendous. So. I mean, if you didn't see the list, I'll break it down for you. He had Patrick Mahomes 1. Josh Allen 2 3. Aaron Rodgers 4. Stafford 5. Justin Herbert 6. Stroud 7. Jordan Love 8. Dak Prescott 9. Joe Burrow and 10. Lamar Jackson and his reason for Lamar being that low is that he had the most overrated any pieces and he's ever seen. And also can't stay healthy, mind you. He had Justin Herbert at 5 and he said that he wasn't able to show his true talent because he's dealt with injuries his career and his weapons have also been injured. But the thing on the more was he can't stay healthy. See where I'm getting at then? He also said the MVP this year should have went to Josh Allen. Mind you. He threw 19 interceptions this year. He threw more interceptions than there were games played. Turnover machine. And then Joe Burrow for being No. 9. He said that he had one of the most overrated playoff runs and Joe Burrow does nothing special outside of his accuracy. And then put Dak Prescott above burrow. And Dak hasn't won a Playoff game since 2022 against the Buccaneers. Since COVID, the Cowboys have literally won one playoff game. Other than that, they've been first round exits. And he also said Joe Burrow has a lot of talent and can't do anything with it. Dak Prescott had prime Zeke, Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup when he was still producing, CD Lamb, Dalton Schultz, Zach Martin when he was younger, and Tyron Smith when he was younger. Talk about a loaded roster to only win what, like 2 3 playoff game and then. I mean, Herbert at 5? I don't hate it, but he is hasn't won a playoff game since he's been in the league. Stafford's also been unhealthy and he put him at 4. I. I just. I. I don't understand it.",

Because you brought up Pochi's little points tallies, then you slipped in Arteta's FA Cup, then you started to stumble, because according to you, that can't be considered his achievement. Okay, okay, cool. By Leverkusen made nine signings at the start of the season, seven permanent, two loans. They've just gone on to win the Bundesliga. They could win the treble. Going unbeating throughout an entire season. Are we just gonna say that isn't Alonzo's achievement? Because you have a. 17 players in the squad are not his. Ten. Hag made six signings in his first year at United. Two loans, one backup goalkeeper free permanent. We just gonna say that the League Cup isn't his achievement because the other 20 players in the squad weren't his one. Absolute load of nonsense. If you manage a club from the start of a competition and win it, it's your achievement. It doesn't matter whether the players were yours or not. It's got absolutely nothing to do with it. And we beat Chelsea and city at the time with a mid table squad, which is actually quite impressive. And just for the record, I'll tell one more in six months than your last five managers combined. Like you guys would love a Community Shield. You can call it a Tim Pot friendly competition. At the start of The season. I can't even remember the last time you won that. It's probably before me and you were born. Have a nice day, fella.",

It's just a friendly, an exhibition match, you know, for kind of entertainment slash commercial reasons. Is it ideal? Maybe not, uh, but the players have played their last game. They shoot straight off, no interruption. Play the friendly, get back. Those who are on international duty in the champion European Championships will then start to prep. Those who haven't got international responsibilities will just go off on their holidays. And this. Would it have occurred if Tottenham had been in Europe this season? Not this time. And I don't think it would have probably been safe for pre season instead of post season. But it is what it is. People gloss over and club's desire to compete commercially and have to generate as much revenue as possible. And in this instance, Tottenham won a. Capitalised on a market share in Australia with Postacoglow in charge. Um, and well, light in Australia. So that's just how it is. Um, most teams in some degree that the top. They have this desire for an appeal overseas through some of their. Their players. Um, but that's. That's football. It's really not that deep. As for the fixture congestion suggestion. Oh, it's elite wordplay there. It's the end of the season, alright? Season's done. Um, the problem with fixture congestions is when you're competing in all France, in Europe domestically, uh, and you're getting Rearranged fixtures, um, weeknights, you're playing two or three games in a week. Things like that with. With squads at nowadays just struggle to cope with these demands. That's. That's the problem. Not a low intensity end of the season game where players with international responsibilities aren't gonna pay 90 minutes or. Or to any intensity whatsoever. That the flying is not ideal, but it is what it is. They're paid handsomely. It's part of the job to go and do these commercial things for your club. Um, and. And from a football fan perspective, it. It just gives fans across the globe something to, um, to watch, to support their team.",

    "voice_to_text": "Did you made any plans for the summer or there could be something else pending yet? Um. Morning. All right, I'll keep you short and sweet. I wanna give you a list of players that are kind of shoe ins for the euros that I don't think should be going, cause I'm not really like that. Let me give you one player that's only got, what, a couple of caps for England that should definitely be going to the euros. That man, Abreccia Ezza. He's absolutely car. I've been saying it on here for quite a while now. I saw him when he was playing at QPR in the championship and I quite liked him, but it's very difficult because championships. The championship. He's doing it in the Premier League. I won't give you a long list of his assists and his stats and his passing statistics and his goals because they're there for all to see. We've got somebody that feels comfortable in the ball against top opposition. He can assist players, he can score, he can shoot well with both feet, he's. He can dribble past players. His first touch is just immaculate. I would try and compare him to players of previous generations, but there isn't really anybody because he isn't like a Lampard or a Gerard or a skulls. He isn't like a Brian Robson or a Paul Gascoyne. He's just a very silky player that beats players, can go with either foot, can score goals. And can assist. That's what we need in the euros. Who's the player that you think should be in the squad that might or might not be in the squad? Let me know in the comments.",

Everybody tag queso, jinx, and sketch in the comments. Let's make this happen. Preferably in an empty field or stadium. Maybe the Cardinal Stadium in my hometown.

Now I was at a club here for preseason. One of the teams had to jog around the entirety of the pitch and the others were doing keep ball and then it switched and he was jogging around the outside of the pitch. Now doing 5 k would help you with this because it's long distance running mixed in with your football. So I would suggest you do both the intervals and the 5 K's. Don't just toss off the 5 K's this summer, cause when your team has you running crazy miles, you're gonna wish that you did it. KB's video is 100% correct in terms of match fitness, but make sure you're doing your 5 K's this preseason.",

I've come across your content too many times now and I wanted to let it slide, but you really are doing my adding as a city fan. You're just one of those city fans that don't represent as well on social media. You look for views, you don't mean anything. You say all about this pen merch and what are you, two years of age? Throw flowers where flowers are meant to be thrown. Cole Palmer, let's be honest, has been one of the best youngsters this season in a Chelsea side that are not performing well. Foden, of course, could have won both, but you've got to look at it both ways. Foden is the player of the year. Deserved, but young player of the year. I won't mind it going to Parma, which it has done, because Parma has been great and shown that. So would you just tone it down a bit and stop looking for views and be honest and real about what you say? Cause you really aren't man. And I'm speaking hopefully for a blue saying that you aren't honest what you say and you are chatting out of your head.",

Um, this West Ham fan absolutely speaks sense now that there ain't that much anymore secrets from West Ham. And I thought it's a big, strong London Derby. The rivalry between Arsenal and Spurs is obviously a lot higher level in terms of rivalry, but then I think West Ham are pretty much the same with Spurs. Might be wrong. So I appreciate this post, but it's, uh, this. This creator. Now, my background is I'm still Charleston and my mum's side, so is West Ham. So I will get behind West Ham whenever it's not Arsenal or the casual level. But they can do us a huge favour. Do the Liga favour and stop the city from dominating again for another year.

    "voice_to_text": "It's really pretty simple. Most of the guys in the portal aren't good enough to play for us. Yeah, yeah. Ha ha. Up until last year, this was common knowledge that 99% of players in the portal weren't very good. Well, for some reason. Well, we all know the reason people think that. Oh, you can build a team off the portal. No, the portal is full of players who aren't good enough to play on their own team. Yes, you're gonna have the Joe Burrows, the Jane Daniels, the elite players. Like, there's only a handful of them. Every year they go from one team to another for whatever reason, which that's gonna happen. But this idea that you're gonna build an elite team from the portal is just fucking stupid. Because again, there's maybe a handful of players every year who are really good who wanna switch teams for whatever reason they want to, which is fun, but 99% of players, the reason why they switch teams because they're not good enough to start. So they're hoping that they go to a team that isn't as good they can get playing time, which happens every now and then. But again, most of these players aren't very good. If you're thinking about building a legit team from the portal. Not gonna happen. And if you don't believe me, look it up. Look at the teams who are top recruiting every year and look at the teams who are top In the transporter every year there's a big difference for a reason",

Go out, have a beer with your mates, have a game of pool and chat about things what really matter rather than. That's a viewer. You said fight is cancelled.

    "voice_to_text": "FIFA tweeted this on X app about Cristiano Ronaldo. See, this tweet was obviously, obviously not about Cristiano Ronaldo at all. But here we have a Ronaldo fan trying to force something that is not there. Shocking. First of all, look at the caption. Retiring as a legend. Has Ronaldo retired? So why would they caption it retiring as a legend if it was about Cristiano Ronaldo? And you saw how he conveniently blocked out Sony Chatri from the video so that he can deceive people that wants to be deceived. But I for one, I'm genuinely curious about the thought process towards making that video. Like you saw FIFA seed retiring as a legend, you thought it was Cristiano Ronaldo. You saw first, second and third and you think that this is the third best player after Ronaldo and Messi. This is the 3rd best player. The third good. Ha ha ha ha. Like you blocked out the person that he tweet was even about. Anyways, you can see in the caption here FIFA said soon in Chatri, the world's third highest active international goal scorer, will play his final game for India in the next month's FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He's about to retire. Legend by the way. Legend in India because he has the third most goals in active international football behind Lionel Messi. And that is actually an impressive fit. But of course, telling lies is always sweeter if you truly believe that Cristiano Ronaldo is The goat? Why do you have to lie to make him look like the goat? But sincerely speaking from the bottom of my heart. If there is any one person out there that watched this video and believed what this guy said in this video. You need deliverance, Wallahi. You need deliverance.",

I think maybe you need to take a break from social media, maybe get some sleep, because what you've just said is weird. Now, under Pochettino, you had your golden generation. For five or six seasons, an excellent Tottenham side. Certainly the best Tottenham team I've watched. There was a lot of excitement surrounding that squad. Expectations went through the roof, and rightfully so, because we all thought, myself included, that this Tottenham side was capable of finally breaking that curse and winning a major trophy. They were good enough to win the Premier League, a Champions League and FA Cup. But when that era come to an end, and it was all said and done, that absolutely nothing to show for it. Where is this Arsenal side are just starting. So you can't really call us hypocritical at this moment in time. And you can be proud of that Tottenham team, for the journey they took you on, for the moments they gave you. And it's something that you'll remember for the rest of your life, because that was probably the best years you've had, following that club, supporting that club. And it's great for yourself to remember that for yourself, because nobody really talks about that sort of thing. Like you wouldn't hear a Newcastle fan saying how proud they were of The side that nearly won the Prem in the mid nineties. Because nobody remembers second place, nobody remembers runners up. Great teams are ultimately judged on the trophies they win. And I would be generally shocked if this Arsenal side doesn't win the Premier League in the next two or three seasons. Like we're proud now. I'm a proud Arsenal fan right this moment for the improvement was shown, the fact that we've significantly closed the gap on Manchester City and we're competing. I'm proud now, but ask me again in three years if we haven't won anything in the next three years, I wouldn't be saying the same thing. Maybe we just have a different mindset. Maybe we just look at things a little bit differently. And I think deep down you know that this Arsenal side is very, very close to winning a Premier League. And you probably expect them to do something very impressive in the next couple of seasons. And I think that's why you're saying it. But to call us hypocritical at this moment in time, for me, it's. It's just a little bit premature.",

In 1 speech he was like F u and f u and f u like who let this man speak who approved his speech I know these things have to get approved what is going on and to Harrison butt kicker whatever your name is shut the frick up like ha ha ha ha I will never take a man's opinion seriously about my body so or like no offense anything really",

And for as long as I have loved football and watched football and enjoyed the game, I've been a Broncos fan. And, um, the Chiefs are in our division, and so we play them every year. This year they just released a schedule. Um, we play them twice. And I, I realize that I cannot speak for all Broncos fans up, but I'm just gonna say that I am okay with as many roughing the kicker penalties as y'all want to rack up this season when we play the Chiefs. Just nail his ass to the turf. I am fine with it. I'm good. Just. Just keep doing it. The entire line can just stomp his face into the fucking turf. I, I cannot with that, man. How are you gonna tell an entire graduating class, the women in that graduating class? Oh, yeah, honey, it's cute and all that you worked all this, you know, hardened, to get that degree. That's really cute. But let's be honest, you're only value and what you really want is to be a wife and make babies and be a homemaker.

You know, it's not brave to be homophobic in a culture that only values heteronormativity. Is not brave to be sexist in a culture that relies on sexism to sell product. It's not brave to be racist in a culture that relies and thrives on racism. So this man is not saying anything new. We've heard it all before. It's in a prettier packet, behind a lectern, dressed in a robe, speaking before a well dressed audience. But it's hate all the same, even if from his perspective, he wants to call it love. As I say, the Chiefs do decide to dismiss you, which they probably only do because of public pressure. You're still gonna have the millions you've already made. You'll probably still get paid the rest of your contract. You have plenty of conservative piggy banks waiting to scoop you up to prove their agenda. The agenda that you have apparently bought into. The only question is, I don't know if you know that it's intentional or if you really believe it. But back to my main point. There is no amount of sophistication, no amount of love, no amount of elegance, no amount of bravery that you can add to your hatred to make it no longer be hate. Grace and peace.",

But the problem is unless there's a massive overhaul in referee in the Premier League and the VAR officials, we're still gonna get these same mistakes. And I can't see how they're just gonna, I don't know, suck a load of people and go right, we need a load of new people in. Then you gotta wait for them to bed in. Or is it gonna work? It's a lot to change. This is why I feel we should just get rid of it. Because maybe come, maybe come back, maybe they re rethink it and whatever.

Love them to pieces, but they are. They know this, they don't agree with it, but at least they're aware of my feelings. The thing is with that city game, irrespective of what it meant for Arsenal, all the world's on had something to. To fight for. Some prior to the miracle of getting into a top four, playing Champions League football. Whatever people think about it, I wanted us to. To win because there's a misconception that us winning was giving Arsenal a title. Arsenal in a position to win the title with a game remaining. Right. Regardless of what we did, stay there and the right to be there at first as I don't think wanna hear that. That's not me being a do gooder, that's just a reality. Um, so for me, I'd rather concentrate on Spurs. And I've been open all along and saying that obviously I want what's best for Tottenham first and foremost, but if we did happen to lose that one off, that individual game, I wouldn't lose any sleep. And I think most sensible football fans that you speak to would be the same. I don't agree with all the celebrating city goals and the type of fan, or the fans voicing their, um, opinions on that, on. On throwing the game away in front of possible I'd. I'd. I'd. I think that's made a joke of us, but ultimately think people take social media too seriously sometimes and get a bit carried away. Most people you speak to on a terraces, um, or in the pubs, on the street, whatever, and normal people, and they just have the. Want the best for their club and there. There's. There's rivalry. Don't get me wrong, of course there is. I think social media just exacerbates it. Right. What a word. What a word that is. Um. And, yeah, get a bit too carried away. That's. That's.

So he's surrounded by all these women with careers who could have careers, and yet he's here saying that they should be just wives and mothers. Time and time again.

And it won't surprise me if he left Tottenham now, obviously, in the summer, you're moaning at Daniel about Daniel Levy for winding up bringing the big players in because you missed out in Champions League. You have a chance to get in the Champions League, playing in the biggest club, biggest competition in Europe, and all you're more worried about is. But your rivals. Stopping your rivals by losing on purpose. It's ridiculous. It'd be funny, though. Man City draw her ass to win the last game because they'll win the title. So small club in town.",

Oh, this guy is so lucky he didn't make that speech at the Christian Brothers North Philly school I went to, because let me tell you how that would have played out. Um, I would have heard him drop the your purpose is to be a homemaker part. And then all of a sudden, I'm staying enough at this point, I'm ready to book towards the stage. But I guarantee you there's a bunch of women before me who are already up. They're probably already on the stage at this point, and then they're going after this guy, and there's gonna be so many women that security just couldn't hold them back. And then I'm up on the stage, and then the Christian Brothers, aka the priest, are like, yeah, we don't like this guy for what he said. These women worked hard to get to where they are at, and there's some of the smartest in our classroom. So now we got the priest on the stage, and the priest have our backs. And then security, because we're in North Philadelphia, security will definitely have our backs. So now we got security up there, and once we get the security, the priest, now the dudes are coming in, because let me tell you something. They're gonna have our backs. They are going to have our backs because of men at my University definitely always had our backs. So they're coming in. So now we got the whole university on this guy, and then you got the dads. Now the dads are down there. The dads ran down, and they're like, no way. This guy did not just say that to my daughter on her graduation day. Not a shot. So now we got the dads in there, and then the moms are also like, yeah, that's my baby girl. And how dare you? How dare you tell her that on her graduation? So now we have the moms, the dads, the priest, the guys, the security guards, and then this guy has about thousands of people just hounding him. He's not walking out of there, bro. God, he's done. NFL is like, Mindblown. NFL is just, like, about to sue the school. And then we're posting the video, like, how dare this guy? And then it feels like, yeah, you right, you right. This guy's bad news. We're done with him. Done with him. His only purpose was to kick balls. But, you know, there's so much other talent out there. So we're gonna hire somebody else because he's misogynistic. He's bad luck on our organization. That's how that would have played out. That guy would have never walked out of that school. He would have never walked off our campus. He would have been done for. Done for, period. And this speech is incredibly disgraceful and misogynistic.",

Fair enough. They gave it a good enough go, but they just weren't good enough at the end of the day. And then city did what city does, and then they just turned up again and they just turn them over. But San is deliberate. What, just to stop you winning the league? No. No, you did that when you went to the Etihad for a draw, when if you're meant to be as good as them, why don't you come out and play and try and beat them?

    "voice_to_text": "And? And look, I can name you a few right off the top of my head. Jalen sucks. And this really is a dumb conversation because I know, you know, sports talk, you know, needs something to talk about. But the idea of that one pro from one sport could just walk in and be a pro at another sport, it's just really fucking stupid. Oh, the athletic ability, the height, the size, none of that shit fucking matters, because at the end of the day, you have to have the skill set. It doesn't matter your size, strength, any of that shit. You have to have the skill set. You take any NBA player you want to. I can grab a bunch of college football players, and they'll be more athletic than them. The idea that you're more athletic because you're a pro in one sport, that's just stupid. Just because you're a pro in one sport doesn't mean you're so much better athletic than everybody else. You're pro in that sport because you have the skill set necessary to be a professional. It's not their athletic ability that makes you a pro, it's your skill set. So let's say NBA player did try to play in the NFL. What position would they play? Quarterback? No way in hell. Offensive? Defensive line? They're not big enough. And again, they don't have the skill set. Defensive end. You know, they had the size, but again, they don't have the skill Set. If you don't have the skill set to get off blocks and the strength to get off blocks, you never gonna play tied in or receiver. That's the one everyone keeps talking about. They just say oh yeah, those are the most likely positions they could play, but again, they would need to. Skill set. If you don't know how to get off blocks, if you don't know how to get open. If you don't have the speed or acceleration to get separation, you're not gonna play Corner. DB, same thing. You don't have the skill set and it doesn't transfer over. Your skill. Your speed or acceleration on the basketball court isn't the same as in NFL. So again, don't have the skill set. And I've heard a few people say linebacker, and the biggest part of that with again is the skill set. Play recognition. Because you don't have the skill set of knowing what plays look like and haven't practiced it and kind of know what you're looking at. Even if you can tackle, even if you have the speed, if you don't have the muscle memory to look at, to look at the plays and know what plays developing and be able to act fast enough on that play, you're never gonna play. Because no matter how big or strong or fast you are, if you don't have the skill set to dissect the play and make the play fast enough, you're not gonna play So again, no. No NBA player could just walk in and be in the NFL.",

Best, they're absolute distasteful, horrific coverage of the Hillsborough disaster where they just lied on every fucking thing you can imagine. And 2, just having some bimbo sits out on the third page of a paper. That's all they're fucking known for. It was recently is January. The school mags are making up false stories for a bend over ill fan. This is during Baltimore versus Cheltenham's game in January. Ah, ill fan was in Purslow. A 71 year old fan who sadly had a cardiac arrest the game and didn't make it. Fuck the scum. They don't deserve to be used as any form of credible source.

And the boring hundred and fifteen charges couldn't be yours. You know what I mean? So let's be honest, right? We'll come together, right? It's north London. You can leave. Honestly, if you beat him tonight, I say get all the Tottenham fans and all the Arsenal fans. Bring him all to the parade. You've helped us out. Come along, join in. You'll see what it's like to win a proper trophy. I know you're in our shadow when you're at Tim Park Club because you want city to win continuously, but, hey, listen, we'll forget about that for now. Come on, north. And then together. You can even sing the song with us. Hey, come on! Oop, the fucking Spurs! Yep.",

And all I hear all other Spurs supporters here is their Arsenal friends or family going, thanks for the league title last season, remember? We're league title winners. Your Champions League means nothing. And then you're there going, well, we've got Champions League. I don't care. What does it mean? It means fuck off. You're honestly kidding yourself if you don't care what Arsenal were doing in comparison to Spurs. Either that or you don't know any Arsenal supporters. I'm starting to think that's.

Because if we get into the Champions League and we beat Man City because of that, we're not gonna win it, are we? Let's be honest, not with this current squad. We don't look good enough to win the Champions League next year. We might make a few good signings, but realistically, it's not gonna get us very far. So, look, if we're gonna be object failures, then we're gonna bring you down with us. Cause if we beat city tonight, and then we beat Sheffield United and somehow Villa lose to Palace and we get Champions League football, it's gonna feel empty. Because we know we're in the Champions League, but at the expense of Arsenal winning the title. Every single Spurs supporter is not gonna want that.

    "voice_to_text": "50% nearly of Tottenham fans would rather beat city and hand the trophy to Arsenal. Tottenham are not handing the trophy to Arsenal if they get a draw or win tonight. How they handing it to him? There's 38 games in a season. So Man City helped Arsenal then, that's what you're saying? Because Man City got one point against Arsenal in two games. So Man City handed it to him today. Liverpool lost to him at the Emirates. Did Liverpool help him as well then? So all these other teams have helped us to win now that to win all them games fair and square. It's not Tottenham's problem. Tell them they're not handing it. It's a 38 game season. What do you think Ange and the players are gonna do? They're professionals. They cannot turn up and give the game away. It's unprofessional and it's match fixing which we don't want in the game. Alright, I'm not gonna moan at Ange or the players if they get a draw or win. I prefer Arsenal not to win it. But they're not handing them mate. They've won it fair and square. It's a 38 game season, not one match in north London on a Tuesday night. Now if city beat em fair and square, which I would suggest they will, cause everyone's got this Assumption that Spurs are just gonna rock up and get a draw or a win. I would assume that city is still gonna win after All this nonsense, but if they didn't after I haven't been handed it by Spurs. They've earned it over 38 games, so let's not get it twisted, alright? And for all the ones that want Spurs to win, that's up to them. They're Spurs fans and they want their team to win. They're entitled to do that when Spurs play and they're at the ground if they want Spurs to beat Man City because they paid their ticket and that's their team, they don't care about the repercussions. They just wanna watch their team win. And that's how is. You can't tell fans what to do. Do the polls now and cheer city goals. They can't do that. So they haven't handed them nothing. But like I say, the good chance is city gonna win 3 4 nil anyway and it'd be the end of it. But they haven't handed them nothing. If Spurs get a draw or a thing, that's just a load of nonsense.",

And yet you say it's a sackable offense for him to come out and say, why would we lose on purpose? We need to be winning every. Everything. In fact, the words he used are pretty much spot on. Because to a manager, bragging rights mean nothing. Bragging my rights being nothing to us, they mean something, but to the manager, it means nothing if he's doing his job properly. So I just think spur supporters are upset with Angie at the minute. Just grow up. Honestly. He's doing a job. His job is to win and be successful.

    "voice_to_text": "I just thought of something that could happen in this tower race that would give us Arsenal fans a severe and deeply traumatic psychotic experience. I'm a Dortmund fan, and Bayern versus Leipzig last season was my version of Spurs versus city. Leipzig B Byron at the Allianz. And ensured that the title race was in Dortmund's hands going into the final day. All we had to do was beat minds at home who are fighting for nothing, and Dortmund would be champion. Not a result itself on the final day, of course, did a great deal of emotional damage to me and every Dortmund fan. But it was the days leading up to the final day where I think we felt the highest stress levels by far. And it was just because we all knew exactly what the team was capable of. We knew it was very plausible that we could just play well, win the game compatibly and win the title. Or it was plausible that we could just throw away the game completely, as we had done many times throughout that season, and lose the teams that we really should have beaten. If the outcome of the title race wasn't in our hands at the start of the final day, I think the stress levels would have been a lot less dangerous. Because at that point, it's just hope. Like, oh, maybe Byron, sleep up, you know, there we know they're not gonna, but who knows? Maybe They will. But because it was in our hands, I think every Dortmund fan can agree that the day is leading up to that final game, it felt like we're all in an insane asylum. And right now it's possible that Arsenal fans could be in that exact same position. So I will say to all Arsenal fans out there, if you are feeling stressed and you feel like you're going a bit mad, just wait and see if Spurs beat city, because then you will start to feel like you're actually going insane. And believe me, oh I get it, it's not fun. Like knowing that it's in your control, but also knowing that there's the juggernaut of the league lurking behind you, just waiting on your side to sleep up. And you know that if your team does the unmentionable, then you all will need therapy. I get it, it's not fun. I have lived it. So with that being said, Arsenal fans, you all should still hope that Spurs beat city tomorrow. But if it happens, get ready to experience the deep, dark inner workings of your psyche. You will celebrate a Tottenham victory if it happens, but it will be short lived, as you will soon after enter into the same insane asylum that we Dortmund fans were in the same time last season. Good luck. It's not fun.",

If you would told me on that deer that in a year's time Sunlum would have just finished 16th in the championship, I would have just laughed in your face and told you to go away because that would have just been. That would just seem so unrealistic to most people. At that time. We were literally heading to Kenilworth Road to the 2 1 lead and was about 16th. We finished 16th the next season. The championship is absolutely. It's just so disappointing and it's so sad cause we were all sun and fans were so excited and just so ready for what was to come. With all the Premier League was on the horizon and I still think it is. But realistically we've just had a nothing season. And it's just so sad to say. A lot of players who started that game, players like Pierre Eckworth, Patrick Roberts were unbelievable last season, especially towards the end. And this season haven't looked like footballers. I just don't know what's happened. Obviously we've lost. Lost players like Amadiyallo, who was obviously massively crucial last season, but what. It's just gone so wrong and it's so sad to say, but there's a lot of players in that team who are still at the club right now and who are Still unbelievably talented footballers. If we build correctly, bringing them right manager and if we re we actually invest our seals this season. Well, I have no doubt that we should be there again next season because it was. We're not far off. We've just had a terrible miss up of a season with no true manager. It's just been a shambles. But I'm excited to see what's coming next season. And yeah, it's just sad looking back on last season because it was just so,",

But like, they'd meet him up leaving Arsenal. Like what? I guess there's a small part of me that isn't actually completely surprised. She's obviously had a really hard time coming back from her injury and we've seen what's like Sistina Laxenius and Alicia Russo can do together at front, but still. So it's just a lot to process. Um, as a lot of people saying that it might have been a mutual decision, and maybe it is. Maybe she does actually just want to take on a new challenge. But that leads me to my next point. On the next mind blowing news, there are now reports saying that she is going to go to Manchester City. Man City and Vivian Mitama. Can you just like, imagine the partnership of Vivian Mitama and Bunny Shaw up front? It's not even fair. I'm saying it right now, if city don't win the WSL title this year, if they make this happen, they're winning it next year. Calling it right now, Man City WSL title 2025.",

To come into this underperforming Chelsea team and score 14 Premier League goals in your debut season when predominantly, I don't think is a strikeout, is more of a winger, is really impressive. Has it been perfect? Far from it. But it gets far too much criticism because we've been underperforming. Boy, he. He shouldn't be the main man leading that line. We should already have a strike in place where he can learn from. He's been put in a deep end because the board have been neglected that position and we've had to use him. And there's times when we could have maybe benched him, but we can't cause we don't have no one else. So I wanna give him full credit to Nicholas Jackson. You know, he's got so much to learn in his game. He's only 22. He can improve, vastly improve on his finishing, which needs work on. But there's a player there and all I wanna say is credit to you, Nicholas Jackson. Keep it up, keep performing up the Chels",

And most of the Arsenal fanbase are gonna be supporting Tottenham on Tuesday. They want the title. It's as simple as that. They're not worried about fucking anything else other than winning the title because they want the Premier League title. So what if habits is said I'm supporting fucking. I'm gonna be a Spurs fan. Most of them are. You're not gonna sit there and go, it's hope Spurs get splattered, are you? You want Spurs to fucking get a draw or a win, surely? Or don't you want Arsenal win the title? And if Spurs don't win, you're not gonna support West Ham either? Of course you are. It's ridiculous. If it was the other way around, I'd want Arsenal to draw with city, wouldn't I? Of course I would. I'll be. Come on, Arsenal, you gotta do this, man. Of course I would. You shouldn't be expecting favours cause you blew it against Villa twice and. And Fulham. That's the way it goes. But in this predicament that you're in, of course you need a favour. And why wouldn't you ask for it? And why wouldn't you cheer on that team for one game?

Obviously had your Ryan Adams, your Dan Brown scoring all the goals, but manch dog, he was silky with it. He could put a ball in the top bins, he could make someone, he could lose the ball. Everything he did was perfect. And now he's out here. Look at him in his. In his grown man stages. Retired.

Firstly, Rory, every team at home do a lap of honour to say thank you to the fans. That's what they do. Not because they won something. They take their kids on the pictures you saw with Madison Romero, etcetera, etcetera. Kicking the ball in the goal and going round to the fans, signing a few autographs and that's it. You're saying, but they've got a game Tuesday night against city. Why are they not doing it then? It's quite obvious, isn't it? Because that was rearranged and it's midweek and a lot of the families won't be bringing their children along and their families when it's a late night midweek game. It was penciled in for this. The Man City game was rearranged so a lot of the fans and the players and staff won't be able to bring their kids at that time and night cause they probably got school or nursery in the morning. Do you sort of understand now? And they won't be doing a lap of honour at 10 o'clock at night cause a lot of the fans are gonna be home and up for the next day. Comprene date. So it's nothing to do with, oh, you got a game Tuesday, why you not doing the lap of honor? And it is penciled in for this game because it's in the afternoon and all the Kids and everyone else can go for the families. Alright? It's quite simple.",

    "voice_to_text": "And I hope this is enough to, you know I'm saying yeah, football's better bro. And yes, I'm back again. And you did say I did make two videos about you, which is true, but because you made two separate points about Formula 1, I chose to react to both of them in two separate video. And all the hate in the comment about not claiming me as an F1 fan. I've been an F1 fan for 16 years. If you don't claim me, I don't care. But let's get into the video. The first point you made was about the response into the Roman Gros on firecrash. And you did say about football players collapsing on the pitch. And in Formula 1 there have been many deaths. Two of the most famous ones is Ayrton Senna and Jos Bianca. And in Formula 1 you do get carried away on a stretcher. For example Joe Grande's crash in Silverstone. My second point was about Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen title fight. Now that is much better than the World Cup final or Guerrero's last minute goal just because of how much controversy there was in that vape. And if you still don't believe me then watch the race on YouTube because you can watch the highlights and you could probably find the full race online. Another point you made was about the international part of the sport. With F1 you travel continent to continent, country to country. And yes, there Is parts of the football, which are international. But if you are competing, you're only gonna be in that one continent, all that one country. For example, the World Cup was only held in Qatar. The UEFA Champions League is only part of Europe. And you did mention about the other leagues, but those are only part of the continent. The only time in football is across the entire world is the World Cup. That's only in one country, as I've just stated. Another point is about rivalries, and F1 has got better rivalries than football. Now hear me out. In F1 you are going toe to toe with your rival for the whole season, across the entire year. And the best rivalries within F1 is hunt versus Loudest, Center versus Post, Lewis Hamilton versus Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton versus Max Verstappen. And in football you do have the rivalries, the main one being Messi versus Ronaldo. But because they are not going against each other for the whole season or the whole year, it's not very good. It's still a good rivalry, but in my opinion it's not as good as Formula 1. And another point you made was about the circle. Now spa has got many sides to it. Circles only have one. Now I know it's a figure of speech, but it still annoys me. And I just wanna say we've got no beef between us. I messaged him, he messaged Me back. He likes football. I like 4 1 1. I like a bit of debate. So I don't really mind doing these videos, but if you're still watching, I wanna know your opinion. Comment. Which do you think is overall the better sport, F1 or football? And remember to follow for more and podium vibe in bio.",

Excuse me, they went inside Corey Davis who was a top 10 pick as a receiver. And not to mention they have a way better coaching staff with Robin Solo versus what Adam Gates was with Sam Darnell. Breece Hall is literally three times the running back Levion Bill was. And Frank Gore at them points of their careers. I mean his No. 1 option was Robbie Anderson and I think Rashad Perry made his last season there. And to top it off he had a significantly worse defense. Yeah bro, it's not close. It's Sam Donald.

Pick up basketball and play professional basketball. Y'all are tripping, right? I'm not even a big NBA guy. Right? NFL football, college football. Football is my thing. Right. You know, I'm a college basketball fan, but NBA basketball, not my thing. That's neither here nor there. Basketballs, basketball rights about touch. It's a difficult sport. Y'all are tripping, man. It be so much more likely that you take somebody playing in the NBA. Right? There's a lot of positions to choose from in the NFL. You move them over, right? You find something, you take some of the bigger dudes in the NBA, you get something going. Right. Moving some dude over from NFL football to the NBA, right? You put a basketball in their hands would be utterly embarrassing. It probably wouldn't work. It'd be ugly. Right? I mean, what percentage of those dudes haven't touched the basketball since elementary school? And even that, right, you could take the multi talented dudes in the NFL that were playing basketball and football. Right? I mean, we're at the pro level of our career. Now so those dudes probably haven't touched a basketball and how long? Even if they're still playing pickup games in between the seasons, right? Bro, you put a basketball in their hand, send them to the NBA. Oh my god, it'd be ugly. Right? At least I know there's a few dudes in the NBA that potentially we can move over and put them tied in. Or do this, do that. So the answer is obvious. Stop the nonsense. Right, it is. Obviously it would be easier to find somebody in the NBA to move to the NFL. Right? Saying anything else is tripping.

    "voice_to_text": "And please don't kill me, please. First one's F1. Like they just racing. First of all, never, ever, ever talk bad about one of the greatest sports on the planet, Formula 1. Because when do you see someone walk out of a crash like this? This is Roman Groton, and he walked out of fire. Yes, he walked out of fire. And yes, I know they got protective equipment, bloody, bloody dark, but he walked out of fire. In football, Neymar gets tapped, rolls down the whole pitch and has to get carried away on a stretcher. Another point, we do not race around in circle. For example, this is one of my favourite tracks, Spa, Frankenshaw. And how is this a circle? Because this has got many corners and it's got many sides, and circles only have one. Another point. Formula 1 travels around the entire world. From Australia, Spain, America, Canada, Singapore. The only time when football goes around the world is when they're in a World Cup, but they're only in that one country. Formula 1 travels from one side of the world to another in three or four days. So Formula 1 is far more superior than football and, in my opinion, the best sports on the planet, because you do not get as many title fights like this. This is probably one of the best title fights in the modern era. 2021. And yes, in football, you might have the last minute goal, you might Have the bit that wins the game in penalties. But they do not get as close as 2021, when Max Verstappen had to overtake Lewis Hamilton to win on the very last lap. So if any of your friends or family or your dog, cat or goldfish talks bad about Formula 1, show them this video. Believe in the comments. Do you think Formula 1 is the best sport in the world?

    "voice_to_text": "It's easier to be a footballer than an F1 driver. I know that video, right? And yes, it is easier to become a footballer than a Formula 1 driver. And here's why. Now I'm not discrediting any other sports, going professional is easy. And this goes for Rugby, cricket, swimming, anything. But there are 130,000 professional footballers across the entire world. And there are only 20 Formula 1 drivers. And another reason why it's so difficult to become a formula one driver than a footballer is money. Because in a football season, you're only really gonna spend 300 pound max. That goes for football boots, shin pads and goalkeeper gloves if you are a goalkeeper. Well guys, if you wanna be a professional racing driver, you have to go to cars and that could easily cost a hundred thousand pound upward. Then you have other series like Formula 4, Formula 3, Formula 2. And those could easily cost a million plus. And yes, you will have sponsors, but I'm going out of own pocket. And you also said that you can become a professional Formula 1 driver in five years. And in my eyes that is complete bullshit. Because first of all, you're gonna start carting at a very young age. For example, Lewis Hamilton started at the age of eight. Second, of all, super licence points. You will not get the required amount of super licence points to even compete in probably Formula 3, let alone Formula 1. Third, Of all physical fitness. Because Lewis Hamilton said at the very first practice he competed in with Mclavin in 2,007, he said he wasn't able to even lift his head up after. So if you wanna do five years, good luck, because you probably won't even have a neck at the end of it. And yes, G forces are a real thing. For example, in Vadyon, you can experience up to 6 G force on the side of your neck. And at the bus stop chicane, you can experience up to 5G behind it. And that consecutively per lap for 44 laps is absolutely mental. So do me a favour, do some more research. But I want your opinion. What do you think is harder to go professional in it, Formula 1 or football? And also, what's more fun to watch, Formula 1 or football? So leave that in the comments. Follow for more.

Um, he's not getting sacked by the way, he's getting let go because the last 18 months has been absolutely dreadful if you actually ask any West Ham fan. Um, the fact that we're 18th in possession, I think in the Premier League right now. Um, we never have the ball, we don't want the ball. Um, we've just been done of Chelsea five nil. But if you go further than that, this season alone, we've been done by three goals more six times. Um, we were massively over performed in the start of first half the season. I think if anyone watched the the Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher covered that, they'd know that. Um, we've considered the same amount of goals of as the ever ungrowned season when we got relegated. Uh, the only difference is this time is is we've. We've actually scored some goals in the first half season since January. It's relegation form. We've had two wins against Brentford and Everton. Um, as I said, I don't particularly needed Chelsea fans to try and educate me why we should keep him. Um, I think you should try and, you know, stick behind Poch and and go for his mid table finish. He's on about. He doesn't think we'll do anything better. Another lopitaggy. Lopitaggy isn't the man I want personally. And so I agree with That personally, I. I want that Amerin from Sporting Lisbon or Francesca. Um. But yeah, no, uh. Uh, yeah, I saw it and. And thought I might as well put my top tens in from a.

Let me tell you now, anyone that answered Jamie Vardy to that question, you are the problem with football today. People trying to say, oh, Jamie Vardy because he's won trophies. X, y, Z, bro, just shut up your mouth. Is it? If you really think that you'd rather have Jamie Vardy's career over Harry Kane just because Jamie Vardy's won trophies, you are the problem with football. This whole fixation on trophies, trophy, trophies. I don't know what you guys gonna say, oh, but trophies, that's what is all about. X, y, Z. Hold on. If you really, really, really understand football, one thing that you will understand is no one wins trophies by themselves. There's not one footballer ever, in the history of anything that has won a trophy by themselves. If I am a striker and I score 100 goals a game, as long as my defence concedes 101, I will not win trophies. Doesn't matter how many goals or assists I get, I can't win a trophy by myself. Football is very different to your tennis or your table tennis, whatever those single, those single player sports where if you're good at golf, and you're the best at golf, you win it. If you're good at tennis, you're the best at tennis, you win it. You can be an amazing, amazing. Look, Messi, Ronaldo, you can be so, so, So amazing. But because of your teammates, you may not win. It's simple as that. I'm trying to get this through people's brains is actually the most difficult thing in the world. Trophies is not the be or an end or of who's better. If you're comparing someone and you instantly go to trophies, I understand that you don't understand football straight off the bat. Like, I can't. I can't have the conversation with you. Harry Kane has had a way, way, way better career than Jamie Vardy. It's simple as playing at the top flight of football, playing for England, being in multiple competitions, it's easy. Scoring the most goals, his name will go down in records. It's simple as that. Like, the fact that that can't go through people's heads is crazy to me. No one wins a trophy by themselves.

    "voice_to_text": "Way too many games this year where it came down to the last minute and they end up pulling out some lucky. I think it's a good question. How would this barrel of accusing team perform in the Premier League? Could they compete for the title? Do check out box to box this video if you haven't. I really do love their channel. But there are a few things that I have to say on this question. First and foremost is a part that I clipped about how many times this season buyer have pulled out a result like a win or a draw by scoring a lucky goal or two in stoppage time. So let me just say, in my lifetime I can recall another team who has scored this many game deciding goals in stoppage time over the course of a season and in all competitions. So we all know that look and fine margins are a very real part of football. And I know sometimes that things are said maybe a certain way to be a little bit controversial, which is fine. But if we say it's lucky for biolevoc using we have to keep that same energy, alright? And when another side does it in Madrid, we can't turn around and say well, it's just cause they're inevitable and it's in their blood. That shows who they are. The same has to apply for Liverpool and. And we should also remember that this Bayern Munich team Versus whom Real Madrid had to pull it out there behind in stoppage time, once again at home, is the same Baron Munich team who got clapped up and put into a split by a buyer, Leverkusen at home in what was a crucial, high stakes top of the table clash. So yeah, I do think it's an interesting question. When you look at their team, they really are playing devastating football. It is fast paced, super efficient and just high quality all around the pitch. And it's not just the 11 starters that are performing well. I mean, their main striker was out for months and they were still able to find ways to win games, including in Europe. Now, do they have the deepest squad in the world? No. Do I think that they could beat a team like Man City? Yeah, I think they could. Do I think the odds would be in their favor? Probably not. It really is tough to say. What is easy to say is that I am hyped, and we should all be hyped for a team coming off of what could be the greatest club season of all time, competing next season against the likes of Real Madrid and the likes of Arsenal and Man City, etc. It is a very exciting prospect. And as a quick last note, if you are somebody who has been keeping up with bio live accusing season but not really watching their games, I implore You start watching their matches, you will not regret it. The only thing you might regret is that you didn't start tuning in from earlier in the season. They are playing some of the most spectacular football we are seeing in Europe at the moment.",

I've seen numerous decisions that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. And afterwards they keep apologising they're not accountable. It is match fixing. It's corruption and there's bungs and people laughed at me. Year, year and a half ago when I come out with match fixing is loads of it going on. It's blatant. We're all seeing it with our eyes. And you see it tonight like everyone else see it tonight. There was no reason for him to raise that flag. There was no reason for the ref to blow as quick. He couldn't wait to blow the whistle. The ref soon as the flag, it was straight on it. It tells you something unfortunately. I know a lot of people think it's a wonderful game, but since Vals coming it's got even more corrupt. It was supposed to Ryan out all the decisions. The referee was supposed to be honest. It is disgraceful. I've seen so many decisions in the Premier League where you blatantly look at it and they go the other way. You like what they doing, you can clearly see this is wrong 100%. And yet they still go the other way. There can't be anything else. Other than corruption and greasing the palms with money. It's match fixing, isn't it? Is. That's what you're saying, and that's what I've been saying. I'm not saying every match is fixed, but quite a lot are, and a lot of them are getting away with it and it's ruining the sport.

    "voice_to_text": "Offensive line was bottom five in the NFL last year and they took a wide receiver at six and this might be one of the worst takes I've seen. Why would we have taken a tackle or any lineman at six? I think obviously O line is insanely valuable, but I do think there are situations where people way over value O line. It's not to say that. Oh, it's not valuable to get a guy who's great on your line, but why would we pick at six? Alignment. After failing with Evan Neal? After just only successfully being good with Andrew Thomas, who developed on his own with the position we're at right now? With the value we have with pick No. 6, why would we pick alignment? We have no weapons. You go for weapons first. Malik neighbors right now makes us better than what we would be with like any tackle or guard we pick right now. Not to mention the biggest issue with the Giants has been developing Oline talent. Bobby Johnson was not a great Oline coach whatsoever. We brought him Priscilla from the Raiders and he brought a tackle of his own from the Raiders as well. We signed Runion from the Packers. We have a line that can still at least manage to get something going. You saw how much better they looked with Tyrod Taylor and Tommy DeVito. Which tells you about the fact that the majority of their problems on the O line are O line, but there also is problems with pocket presence that make the O line look worse. I just can't understand people who are like, they should have taken a tackle at six. It was either quarterback or receiver. Taking tackle now would have been a dumb idea. Again, it's not to say that a guard or tackle wouldn't come in and be good, but you have to think of the value you have right now, what your roster looks like right now. If I had, like, a top four pick, I had no good assets or value on my team whatsoever. No quarterback, no nothing. And there's a bunch of options available. I'm not gonna go, give me that right guard, dude. No, I'm like, give me Drake may. Give me Malik Neighbors. Give me Marvin Harrison Jr, a guy that will make a massive impact offensively this exact second. Like I said, I think it's valuable to take alignment, but you have to understand what the giant situation is right now and where their biggest problem is. It's not just, oh, everyone on the team is bad, they can't develop an online. We gotta stop letting fantasy football people have takes. Like, I can't believe this.",

    "voice_to_text": "And the biggest plebs of the week go to the degree of footy. So Varney has had a much better career than Harry Kane. Varney's won stuff. Vardy has won the Premier League. He has won the top division with Leicester City. With my club. He's won the FA Cup with also Leicester City. He's won the Golden Boot. Harry Kane has. Fair enough, but Harry Kane's not scored 11 and 11 has he? No he hasn't because Vardy did it. And what's Harry Kane won? Nothing. He's even gone to Bayern Munich and has still not won anything. So moral of the story is Varley has had a better career than Harry Kane. Yes, Harry Kane is the better player right now. But I tell you now, Varney has a better career. So you guys are the biggest plebs of the day. And you probably will because it's not podcast. You're a bunch of plebs. Peace out. Varney is a better career. I love you.",

Cause I don't know how he can watch Matt Somos at any point in his career and think that he's not about playing center back. That's exactly what he like. I just don't understand how you cannot want for your defenders to be able to initiate plays and like carry the ball and distribute the ball effectively. Which, by the way, is exactly how Matt Tomos and nikoschlatovic operate. For Dortmund, especially in that game versus PSG, I think they had the most successful passes of anybody on the Dortmund team, which is not a surprise considering they were defending for most of the game. It has always seem to me like mostly British fans seem to have this kind of obsession with hired men and like it represents the good old days of football. You know when you centre Backswood, rough upper man and slight tackle man but basically have no skill on the ball otherwise? And I just don't see how you can put homos into that category. I think he does precisely both. He is just as physical and rough as you need him to be, but he can handle the bath. And I just don't see how that can be considered nonsense.",

No one at the time thought it were a good idea, no one agreed with it and is massively under achieved, no matter what anyone says. The whole owner has actually come out and explained his decision. Um, it's on Twitter if you wanna go listen to it. Basically talks about ambition, but I think he's made the right choice here. Rosinio will get another championship job, but that squad, that whole of was fucking criminal. Plenty of names thrown about. Steve Cooper, Danny Roll. Will still a couple of Turkish guys in there as well. Emery Bellozzo and Errol Bulloch who was at Cardiff or still could be at Cardiff. The favourite is Tim Walter who was at Hamburg last year.

    "voice_to_text": "I think United should bring Ollie back. I genuinely do. That's where I'm at right now. This video is so bad their visionism is actually crazy. So ha ha, let's get into it. It's time. At the club until it went south was better than any other managers we've had by a distance. I mean it definitely wasn't when Meridio came in. He won two major trophies in his first year. Then next year he came second with 81 points. Only one, no trophies and never reached a points tally near to that. He played good football, he had the fans on side. He had people loving the club and enjoying going to games again, being proud to support. Supposedly he had fans back and joined Cody games again. That is ridiculous. We were under lockdown for those two seasons. And the part of the first season we weren't under lockdown, United were 5th in the table under him. United didn't play that good football under and like some United fans might like to make out, they created the fourth most chances in the league. Uh, under him. In the two full seasons he was in charge, much behind Liverpool, Chelsea and city. And he wasn't trusted. He wasn't interested with the budget that Erich Andersen had, or interested with signing the plays that he wanted to sign. Because the vast majority of the plays that he signed personally were great for us. And he had this fantastic talent. I Did? Ha ha. I mean, he spent 460 million in 3 seasons, signed Mcguire for 85 million, who wasn't deemed good enough. And you signed replacements for you. Signed Juan Pasaca for 55 million, who had offered pretty much nothing going forward and has pretty much disappeared since Ollie left the club. He spent about 20 million on Dan James Diallo and Alex Tellers, all of which who have done nothing at the club. He spent 85 million on Jaden Sancho, who at United has been there for three seasons and done absolutely nothing and didn't even turn up for training. Oh, and he chose to sign Ronaldo, by the way. He was offered him and he said yes, which he admitted to on the overlap interview. So if Ronaldo was supposedly his downfall, which I don't think it was, uh, that was his fault. And I think other than if you getting maybe Thomas Tuchel, who's a guaranteed serial winner, still at the peak of his powers, Ollie is the best man to bring in. He's genuinely the next best option for me. Correct. Tom Stukel is a fantastic manager, but he's not the only one available. Hansy Flick is literally available. A sex super winning manager with Bayern. Here's the highest win percentage at Bayern by far, by the way. You also have Zidane available, who I don't think would be the best option out of those three. But he won three Champions League. He's done it, he's proven it. And I think That's far better than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who's proven nothing in his career. I have no problem with Dale, but that video was awful.",

    "view_count": 16998,
    "voice_to_text": "Is anyone else finding this league just boring? Premiers just is draining the life out. I'll be honest with you, I'm bored of people saying that the Premier League is boring when it's not. Top flight European football. World football for that matter. Big five leagues. The Premier League is the only one of those fives that's not already decided. Spanish league already been won by Real Madrid. Bundesliga already been won by Bayer Leverkusen. The only thing keeping that league afloat is the fact that they're unbeaten. And that we love seeing our English captain not get trophies. Italian league already won by Inter Milan French league already won by PSG. Even the Championship? Leicester pretty much won it by Christmas. Nobody doubted they were never gonna get promoted. If switch by Christmas time you would have put your house on it. It was only because Leeds made a late surge and if switch failed. But still, the top two expected by Christmas also went up. Not that exciting right? You talk about the goals like every goal 10 years ago was a screamer. It's just not the case. When you look back at highlights from 10 years ago, guess what you don't see the tap ins, see the screamers. You see the goals that people go back to and want to watch nowadays. Screamers still do happen, but you see every other goal, whether it's through match of the day. Social media is so easy to find every Single goal that went in. Screamers do happen. It's not like they've gone extinct. Another thing that people like to say is that it's boring because the three teams that come up go straight back down. How many times that happened in the 22 years of the Premier League? Once, in 1998. This would be the second time it's ever happened. It's common occurrence. It just happens all the time. I think to call it boring is lazy and an easy way out. Because you don't enjoy it. You might not enjoy it, doesn't mean it's boring. Okay? Premier League and football as a whole has changed dramatically all the time. How often do you see a team lineup in a 4 4 2 with a tall striker and a short striker and just cross it in? Constantly? How often do you see, like a decade ago, Leicester, a team lump the ball forward, have a target man knock it down? Or Stoke for that matter. They survive loads of these because they have that tactic. Football is constantly changing, and just because you don't enjoy this style of play doesn't make it boring. And although nobody's got this far in the video, let's talk about the top six quickly. Yes, the top six are probably gonna be the same going forward, probably because they have the biggest fans, the biggest revenue, the largest stadiums, the best facilities. Somehow that seems like a recipe for success, right? Um, plus it's Rarely ever that the big six actually finish in the first six spaces. There's often a Brighton and Aston Villa, this season a West Ham. It's not always the same. It is far from boring. So just stop being so negative about everything.",

Yes, I have always hated Tom Brady. Okay, that a lot to unpack here, but we're just gonna go with the basic one, like, how do you never have strawberries? Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration about not having strawberries. I know some people, like, are like, that doesn't matter. No ice cream. You eat frozen avocados as ice cream. Not to mention, I've seen numerous articles over the years about this, like, illegitimate child that, like, he was with this girl before Giselle, and he, like, paid the girl off to say it's, like, not his kid or whatever. That's all. Allegedly. I don't know if that's true, but that's what I've seen and heard, and that was commented about in the roast as well. Like, leaving your wife and kids just to say, like, hey, football. Which I am a huge NFL fan. I've grown up a cheese fan. And, I mean, that may make me seem prejudiced to this man, but, however, he's just a douche. I don't know if I can say that on TikTok. Also, the, like, deflating football thing. Not cool, man. I don't know. Never liked Tom Brady. Don't think he's attractive. My boyfriend has always been a Patriots fan, so little beef there, but, yeah, basically, Just hate Tom Brady",

He's saying regardless of the players you have, go and play the way you want to. And that's exactly what he's done with Tottenham all season. They've played good attacking football, attractive football. Tottenham have been one of the most entertaining football teams this season personally. So you can't now go back and say this age well cause you're talking about something completely different. His comments recently about needing more players and needing a rebuild as you say is because he does. We all can look at Tottenham and see there is loads of Deadwood in that squad. He's been there one season and brought in what, a few players? Of course he needs to rebuild that squad in order to start getting more consistent results. But of course, like everybody does on TikTok, they take a screenshot like that and they have to twist it to their agenda. Absolutely wild. Maybe if you actually read the quote you'll understand it a bit better, and that way you can't make mistakes like this in the future.",

We got we, we will. You could say we potentially worse last season with Declan Rice. So where's the excuse there? The guy is just full of excuses whenever he comes under pressure. It's everybody else's fault, not David Meyers fault. He even went on to say, and I. And I. I saw a quote. Excuse me? I saw a quote. That he started to blame players. That is the players mentality. The players need to do better. Granted, the players need to do better, but they're following your system. They're following what you want them to do. Defense first, attack. Maybe they're following your style of playing, mate. So you wanna blame the players? They're partly blame. They're partly to be blamed. But you are too. Stand up and take a fucking account for what you have done instead of sitting there blaming everyone else and then using Declan Rice as an escape goat. Or we could thought cause we lost Declan Rice. Shut up mate. You've replaced him with 3 brilliant players. 2 in the fucking midfield. Our reservoir price can replace What rice did so fucking fix up.

come across like I'm picking on stew ha ha   he   doesn't   come   across   like   I'm   picking   on   stew   ha   ha but I expected him to give us a reason   I   expected   him   to   give   us   a   reason as to why these things are happening   to   why   these   things   are   happening why are these things not as strong as the teams of Hood   are   these   things   not   as   strong   as   the   teams   of   Hood because obviously all of us are watching this now ha ha   obviously   all   of   us   are   watching   this   now   ha   ha I've seen our Bonnie and Chevy that getting beaten blue   seen   our   Bonnie   and   Chevy   that   getting   beaten   blue black everybody and losing town like we are seeing it   everybody   and   losing   town   like   we   are   seeing   it but you are not giving us a reason   you   are   not   giving   us   a   reason so let me give you guys a reason in English word   let   me   give   you   guys   a   reason   in   English   word there's a rule called parachute payments and uh   a   rule   called   parachute   payments   and   uh the Premier League gives money to the teams that are just relegated   Premier   League   gives   money   to   the   teams   that   are   just   relegated for a period of three seasons   a   period   of   three   seasons so that's to help them soften the Bill   that's   to   help   them   soften   the   Bill because obviously the money you're earning in the Premier League   obviously   the   money   you're   earning   in   the   Premier   League is not the kind of money that are going to be   not   the   kind   of   money   that   are   going   to   be earning in the championship   in   the   championship and because you got relegated   because   you   got   relegated it doesn't mean the salaries   doesn't   mean   the   salaries and the expenses that you've been paying on Premier League revenue   the   expenses   that   you've   been   paying   on   Premier   League   revenue it doesn't mean those expenses will go down   doesn't   mean   those   expenses   will   go   down or those expenses will disappear   those   expenses   will   disappear you still have the salary of a primarily club   still   have   the   salary   of   a   primarily   club so the primarily gives that money to soften the blue   the   primarily   gives   that   money   to   soften   the   blue but another thing that that money does   another   thing   that   that   money   does is the money does give them a competitive edge over the teams   the   money   does   give   them   a   competitive   edge   over   the   teams in the championship   the   championship you can't expect a team with hundred million in the bank to not   can't   expect   a   team   with   hundred   million   in   the   bank   to   not Be better than a team with 10 million in the back where   better   than   a   team   with   10 million   in   the   back   where except if you are Manchester United   if   you   are   Manchester   United but that's by the way   that's   by   the   way and it seems that the Premier League teams are just so much better   it   seems   that   the   Premier   League   teams   are   just   so   much   better tactically or physically than the championship players   or   physically   than   the   championship   players that's why a team will get relegated this season   why   a   team   will   get   relegated   this   season and come back up next season   come   back   up   next   season because they already have those players   they   already   have   those   players that are better than the championship players already   are   better   than   the   championship   players   already that's why Leicester won that's why Leeds is among the mix   why   Leicester   won   that's   why   Leeds   is   among   the   mix that's why Southampton is among the mix   why   Southampton   is   among   the   mix you not see a team go down to the championship   not   see   a   team   go   down   to   the   championship but I'm gonna become a medieval team   I'm   gonna   become   a   medieval   team except there's a some there's also   there's   a   some   there's   also there's something going on financially   something   going   on   financially or something really wrong in the opera uh   something   really   wrong   in   the   opera   uh echelons of the club   of   the   club so all this to say is not like the relegation teams are not trying   all   this   to   say   is   not   like   the   relegation   teams   are   not   trying they are trying we all saw the first few weeks of one

This is what football means to the fans and the players. You know, here a little while ago, he found himself not making it. The great at Wickham, went to Wimbledon, super club. He looked after him superbly well. Born in Iraq, found himself in the Iraqi and national team. I know they think very highly of him. And we do it! Ipswich Town. You could see emotions, what it meant to him. This is life changing. He is the first Iraqian player to have played in the Premier League, so that's a massive, massive achievement. Massive, big up. And I just love the emotions there, you know, the fans and you could see what it meant to him. Tears coming from his eyes and the fans. Absolutely superb scene. So massive. Big up, big up to the town. Brilliant promotion. Big up to Ali Ahmad himself. Been an amazing journey. Big up to Iraq! Woohoo!",

Alright, so this, my brother here is asking which of these 12 versions of Lionel Messi was the best Lionel Messi, your favourite Lionel Messi, and the most complete Lionel Messi. So let's get into it. Alright, so I'm going to start with my favourite Lionel Messi, and is this No. 7 right here. This young Lionel Messi. Man, this guy, the amount of bravery that this guy had at that, his age, was crazy, man. Like, this guy was planning to demolish anything in front of him that was not his teammate. Anybody he sees, he doesn't care. He's about to go through that person. Like, this guy was scary. And when he's running, there's a way his hairs keeps going wavy like this, man, that's a mad register. Watching him was both tormenting, scary and beautiful at the same time. My favourite Lionel Messi, without a shadow of a doubt. And then the best Lionel Messi for me is number four right here, the 2015 Lionel Messi. Like, this was when Lionel Messi started taking the role of a playmaker. Like this guy, at that time, he had like, everything, like, everything. This guy could score, he could create, he could dribble, all at 100%. Like, it was crazy, man. This guy was scared. This is my. This is the best Lionel Messi, uh, for me, in this list. And then, for me, the most complete Lionel Messi in This list here is this number eight. I think this is the 2018, 2019 Lionel Messi there. About. This Messi was hundred percent complete. Like, he was winning both the Golden Boot and the Playmaker Award the same year. Like, you can. You can make an argument for this one, because this guy's. This guy, too, was actually quite complete as well. But for me, man, this guy, the amount of carry, the amount of boarding he carried on his. That Barcelona squad that he was carrying, this particular guy, or more like he was. He was Barcelona at that time. He was basically Barcelona. For me, this is the most complete version of Lionel Messi. Drop yours in the comment section and let's see.",

Out of the Champions League like you said when you made this video a few weeks ago. But after putting Spurs and Chelsea in a pack after both fan bases said they would end our season, you'd be looking forward to a early kickoff against Bournemouth this afternoon? Safe in the knowledge that whether we win the league or not this season, we will never starve in the way that I spent multiple decades watching Spurs fans starve and will continue to. I mean you'd find it funny watching Spurs fans how it feels like to be an Arsenal fan based on not winning the league last season or this season when they've never seen Tottenham with the league and probably never will. You'd find it absolutely hilarious that Tottenham fans hell Mary to these home truths would be to point out that they're gonna lose to Man City on purpose. As if they're not just gonna lose to Man City cause they're shit. I mean, sure, I'm not gonna pretend I wouldn't feel disappointed at the thought that we might end the season trophies, but there would still be optimism, clear positives to take from the season. And the optimism that one day we will lift the silverware that this club should be lifting. My question to you and the rest Of you Spurs fans would be this. Could you say the same thing",

As a Bronco fan, this reminds me exactly of when Patrick Mahomes was drafted and everybody thought it was a terrible move at the time. But then like I had to watch my opponents get clown for drafting a dude and then him to turn into arguably one of the best players at the position we've ever seen. Michael Penix Jr. Has the exact same arm strength, if not better. Faster and harder to tackle. If he can read a defense he's gonna be a problem. He can make all the arm angle throws that PAT can. Like if he gets put in a good situation it could be a woo! And I again hate the Falcons. Ever since the 28 to 3 blonde lead I've hated them cause I hate the Pats and just submitted my hate for them. I'm not a Falcon fan, but I do think we're looking at a trade that like. Right? Or a pick that right now everybody's like but in a few years I'm gonna be like damn, wish we would have picked him.",

You bring in Arthur Smith to be your offensive coordinator, who wants to be run centric? Then you've got to rebuild that offensive line, and that's exactly what they've done. First not know you've got Russell Wilson and Justin Fields who are gonna battle it out to be the quarterback. You got George Pickens. You've got some weapons. But that offensive line is what absolutely had to be fixed in. The Steelers did that. Now they still have to get a wide receiver too. Look, that. That has to happen. They still got to get a cornerback. Yes, that has to happen. And they got to get solid quarterback play. But what the Steelers have done in the off season to rebuild the roster, this is exactly what they needed to do and is exactly what they have done. I think the Steelers this off season have gotten an A+ so far. And the one thing about it, I don't think it's over. I think they're still out there trying to get a wide receiver too in a trade. Is it gonna be Brandon and you? Probably not. Debo Samuels? Probably not. DJ DK Metcalf? Probably not. There's still some free agents out there that they can go and sign. Let's see what happens.

I agree with Orloski. There is no doubt that Chicago has a lot of weapons. I mean, you start out Keenan Allen, DJ Moore, you draft romadusa, you got DeAndre Swift as running back, you got Cole committed tight end. Yes, they have a ton of weapons. But I've said it before, and a lot of people have said this same thing. The orphans of Line, Man, is where the difference comes in between Minnesota and Chicago. And look, while Chicago's offensive line got a little bit better, it's still bad. It's not a good line. Minnesota top 8 to 10 line in the league. Then you throw in the fact that you have Justin Jefferson, you have Jordan Addison, you've got Adam Jones the running back, you got Hawkinson at tight end. Yeah, DJ McCarthy is absolutely in a better situation. Now, does that mean that JJ McCarthy is a better player than Caleb Williams? No. Do I think he's even gonna have a better season than Caleb Williams? No. But if we're just talking about actual situation, yeah, his situation is better. Cause let me ask you this question. If you put Caleb Williams in Minnesota, who do you think would have the better season? There you go. That's why I think Caleb Williams is The better player because if he was in that situation in Minnesota, he would be lights out. I still think he can be lights out in Chicago. That offensive line is gonna have to come to play. Because if it does, then he'll have a good season. If it doesn't. Oh.",

Ben White is hard done by. All it. All it sounds like is an entitled child. Ben White is a shit house. Yeah, and it's fucking brilliant. The Premier League needs characters, okay? It needs characters. And part parcel of this behaviour, these antics, it draws media attention, right? That's normal. Just like Mopey and Madison and plenty of other players who act this way. It's nothing exclusive or special to Ben White or to Arsenal, I promise you. Listen, I mean no disrespect, stitching a video and having a pop it someone, it's not what it's about. It's more of an observation that. I actually never used to mind his content, but when it pops up now, all I find is it's wine, wine. It's just a moan about this, um, with the victim. He's the victim.

Bro if you don't perform in weekend week out you are like falling off apparently. Except for Messi and Ronaldo again, one of the 2 best footballers of all time. No footballer was ever really performing week in week out, week in week out. It's not. It's not like possible. Like name any football in the comment section. I can tell you rnan has 14 Champions League goals. How many games has he played in the Champions League? Sudan again for example. People will tell you he wasn't as consistent as you think he was. I'm not gonna say it like I'm not gonna talk about Jude Bell and I'm for example if I didn't score against Dominez and even hit the post. And people already said this can't be the worst best footballer cause those ghosts and inspections. Bro chill out bro. Even though real life Messi didn't even score every single quarterfinal or semi final they played in. It's crazy bro. It's like the standards that people pretend to have for 4+ these days. Mad like I'm telling you bro. Twitter. Go on Twitter and see what people say about 4+ week in week out is actually mad bro. Van Dyke, Saliba, all these guys, did they make a mistake? How can this be this best centre back in the world? This clips of Finnish game abused by Bangalore. I'm just using that as an example or real friend and I getting touched by several defenders. But I'm telling you, like, football is so crazy. John Terry used to get touched on a regular. But people won't say nothing, bro. But in this football generation, if you have a bad mistake, bro. Oh, you can't be. We can't. You can't be compared to the greats. You can't be compared to him or that, bro. It's mad. Like, what we doing, guys",

Certain players cannot hack it at Man United just because of the scrutiny they get the media. But what is wrong with a modern day football fan that they judge a player on one game? So he shit cause he played crap that game? Or Sancho is now amazing because he had a good game last night? Guys, Sancho wasted 3 years at United. He's done nothing. Poor attitude, not turned up for training, not apologise for his wrongdoings to his boss. Come on, wake up! Anyway, all in all, that's my opinion. But what's yours? Let me know.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I made a video where I said Manchester United winning the FA Cup means that they'll have had a better season than Arsenal finishing in second, because second place isn't a trophy and all that really matters is winning trophies. Luke, a content creator, Spurs fan, stitch that video with some counter arguments to that point of view. And his main points were that there's more nuance in it. And Manchester United having a terrible league campaign, which we did. I'm not demanding that. And Arsenal having a great campaign and pushing for the title all the way was a much better position. That team should be judged on their progression in a league season over the trophies that they win. My point is that if you are a big club, if you're a traditional big six or even a top 10 club now, spending big money, you're doing that because you're trying to win trophies. Oh, of course everyone wants to win the Premier League, but not everyone's gonna do that. There are some major cup competitions that were all part of that you can also go and win. And the biggest in England is the FA Cup. But we can forgive him cause he is a Spurs fan. And I know they don't win many trophies, but they should also be going for these cup competitions, not trying to get a slightly better league position, not trying to aim for the Champions League. Because those moments like On Saturday are what we're in it for. As fans, watching Manchester United lift the FA Cup on Saturday was immense. Was the best feeling ever. And actually, I was stuck at a wedding at that game with a Spurs fan, and he said he wishes that they had a moment like that. So I think people can get stuck in the same point of view as Luke. Looking to just progress in the league a bit further. Let's try and go a bit further in the cup competition, but actually winning things is what we're all trying to progress towards. As Manchester United fan, I've always thought trophies are the only thing that matters. And maybe it's because I'm a Manchester United fan that I think that. But like the debate. And I'm glad you stitched it, mate.",

    "voice_to_text": "Addressing trends at left winger. Because I am not advocating that he plays on the left wing. I just can't believe how much of this stuff is going on social media and I'm here to address it today. He's playing as a left wing back who comes inside with Foden and Bellingham in front. They can interchange. Just watch this. If I'm right footed and I'm playing left wing back, I get the ball in this area. My first touch is here with my right foot. With Trent's right foot, he's able to hit that dive to sack up. He's able to find Bowden with a little reverse ball into the pocket. And then you can drive into his path like that. Then you can dictate the game from there. So people saying left wing, he's not playing left wing, because if he comes inside Foden, we've seen him play left wing for Man City. He can drift outside as a left wing back. I start high, Trent comes in. Yes! With his right foot. It could be there. He's looking that way. Set, set! Max Foden! Max Foden, left wing. Now where's Trent playing? He's not playing left wing, is he? He's able to dictate the play with his stronger right foot. So if Trent has the ball on the left side of the pitch, looking at Curtis Jones with Trent, ability to cut in on his right foot, play the pass, go into the pass. Yes. And as Trent gets the ball with his left foot, able to play this right foot, Curtis Jones continue around there. We've seen Curtis Jones also drift out to the left when he's playing for Liverpool. Then that allows Trent and Maynard and Bellingham and Foden to dictate the game in the middle with Curtis Jones on the left. That freedom, that fluidity. So when I said Curtis Jones on the pyramid and I was being laughed at, his ability is more than capable of pretending to play that and then he'll just do a little spin. He's well capable of doing it. And looking at England's overall ability in the middle, I don't see any other player being able to dictate the game. I'm concerned. And may you would",

It's just bad. They know something, it's just gonna be an absolute low light. For me, it's Michael Bisping. I don't know what it is, but every time I watch, like, a UFC or MMA compilation highlight reel, it's always him on the bad side of things. It's always him getting absolutely killed in the ring, ragdolling. And the thing is, he's not even bad. I mean, you could see he's a champion. He's 30 and 9, too. Like, it's just like his nine losses are so bad, it makes him seem really bad. And then for the longest time, the other one was Baker Mayfield, but that was before he joined the Bucks. Yeah, before that. Every time I watch Baker Mayfield play, uh, it was. It was bad. It was not good. I wanna hear what your guys opinion is, though, and I wanna hear what you say, because there, I swear, there's always that one athlete that you watch, and he's just garbage every single time you turn on the TV to watch him.",

    "voice_to_text": "Can you imagine your team gets 99 points in a season, loses just once, yet still does not win the league? That is the level of the Turkish league this season. Hundred and two points Galatas today. Pure record in Turkish football. It's been incredible. And this is the Galatasta side that wrapped up the league. Some very very familiar names in European football in the Premier League as well. But genuinely the squad itself is actually very good. And this is a Galatasta side without Zaha, without Zia. And when you lose one of your best players in Sasha Bay to buy Munich for a great fee. Don't get me wrong, it was a great transfer for him. Is very difficult. And yet still Galatas and Okanbuluk have kept the level up. And our recruitment has been fantastic. In terms of consistent good value signings that have contributed to the squad, it's been good. And some of the names are not even here. For example Zaha was a free transfer. Zanyola is another one who's currently out on loan to Villa. Does he stay, does he go? I'm not too fuss cause both ways is fantastic. We'll get a good fee or we'll keep him. He's great. And the point is Galatasay that recruitment keeps up and at this level can be a good side in Europe.",

They went from Tucole to Graham Potter to Lampard to Pochettino, now to Mareska. This is terrible. I'm so happy. But I was so happy they got rid of Pochettino. I was celebrating. I thought Chelsea might be back next season. I thought next season, Chelsea will definitely finish top four. But with Enzo Maresca, there's no way, no way, Jose, they're getting top 4 next season. He's a championship manager. I'm sorry. Ever know anything about him? Let me know in the comments, guys. Is he even a good coach? Only knew about him this season when he managed Leicester City and got them promoted. Before then, I had no idea who he was. Todd Bowley, you will never, ever find the next Mikal Arteta. Because there's only one Arteta in the world, and he's ours.",

Thank you very much, everybody. Give it up, Pep Guardiola. And this Real Madrid fans come to a perfectly. When Madrid knocked city out of the Champions League. They know what big clubs really like. They don't deserve this amazing thing. But the supporter, they cannot be like that. They cannot be like that. You give this team to United and you see how excited they will be to see this kind of guys playing every single weekend. They do you realize why they. They.

    "voice_to_text": "Now, this might sound a bit dramatic, but I think Kevin De Bruyne is finished at the top, top level of football. I think he's passed his peak now. And this season we are seeing a real change into the guard, where I think Phil Foden's now become Man City's most important attacking player. Yesterday against United, it was god awful and got substitute. It is meant to be city's best player, their main man, their catalyst. It is getting substituted in the biggest game of their season. Other than that, you know, the league games. Near the end of it, in the Champions League final against Inter Milan, it was dog shit and got hooked then because he was injured. He always picks up injuries in big games. Quite weird that, isn't it? I just don't think he has it anymore. He's getting a lot more injuries than he used to. I just think he's over. I don't. I don't think he needs to leave city or go to Saudi like he could be doing this summer, but I don't think he's gonna be at that top, top level ever again. And I think throughout his career is bottle big games. He's been poor in big games. No one ever calls him out on it because he's one of these players that's just protected by his aura and his reputation. It's just one of these players that can stink the gaff up and you'll never hear about it, but It's a Bruno Fernandez, a sacker, a Rashford. The narrative online is very different and within the world of punditry too. And I just think this season when I've seen him play he hasn't really been that great. Yes, he's obviously had some good games still, but whenever push comes to shove in big, big games recently he's been fucking bobbing. And this lad is the one that I've always called upon. And the Manchester Derby's in the title winning games over week as well. He's always the one to drive them forward, he's always a catalyst for him and he's becoming their main man. But I think people just need to realise a bit with Kevin De Bruyne that he's not the big gameplay that people think he is 99% of the time. And this season has been poor and it's not been cold out because no one gives a shit about Manchester City really. No one really cares that much and he's massively overprotected. As is pretty much every one of their players. Very different narrative. Foden was shit yesterday, Harlem was shit, De Bruyne was shit. You see none of that online. Imagine that's Rashford, Bruno or Manu or Anthony or something like that. It'd be fucking well different one. And I just think he's finished at this top level. I don't think he's gonna be set his main man ever again. So maybe take that big contract off from Saudi where he can still get it. To boobies",

    "voice_to_text": "The largest yacht at this year's Monaco Grand Prix is a 200 million dollar super yacht name faith. It probably cost over a million dollars to bring the boat there for the weekend, but you guys are gonna be shocked who actually owns it. So this is faith. It's a 316 foot boat that rents out for $1.5 million each week. The bedrooms have panoramic views. The interior is amazing with a gym, a pool, and a sauna. But my favorite part is probably the front of the boat, which has a heli pad in a garage for your helicopter when you aren't using it. And then when you store that helicopter away, it actually turns into a basketball court too. But the business behind a yacht like this is even more fascinating. Faith is that boat right there with the dot on it. That's a prime spot in Port Hercules and Monaco, and it probably cost the owner of $100,000 to park there this week. And when you use the general rule of thumb that an owner should expect to spend around 10% of the boat's value annually on operating cost, that includes fuel, crew, salaries, maintenance, insurance, stockage fees, and everything else. He probably spent over $1 million to bring the boat to Monaco this week. So whoever.",

Women have highlighted sexist comments, chanting, and even assault, as reasons why their experience of watching men\u2019s football at stadiums or pubs might be so intimidating.  @Emma Middleton asked sports stars at the 2024 @sportindustry awards to reflect on fan culture at men\u2019s football games, and what needs to change\u2026  \ud83c\udfa5 @Yasmin Rapley  #football #footballtok #sport #sporttok #lifeandstyle #facup#facupp#facupfinal #championsleague @Shaunagh Brown @Troy Deeney  ",

It's sad really to see that the likelihood of me taking my two doors to a Premier League match, you see in the stands, that's not gonna happen. I never really see that within the women's game. There's an old 80s vibe that's trying to creep back in now of hooliganism and foolishness is another word. Say foolishness. People want to try and recreate this, so we're tough. It's disappointing that it's actually a young person who I would have thought to be a bit more. More informed at how society is moving. Like I wouldn't want my apple cart to be poisoned by one apple as such. Unfortunately as humans we're tribal and as soon as you're with the same type of people that are like you, you. You change. And that always brings out the worst people. In men's football, sometimes people hide behind. Oh, I feel really passionate there for a behave like that nonsense. I think the men's gave me to learn to deal with people quickly. We give too many people chances to fail. We all know the rules, we all know what your credit card say and if you choose to do that, cause that's your prerogative. And then you get.

I actually want Manchester United to win the FA Cup today and I tweeted it and it's getting some backlash by people saying oh United fans were twerking for city so I want city to win and the main one is oh but if city wins it means nothing. How long? Genuinely genuine question how long do we all sit here walking around like this going my if city wins it means nothing? I want city to win cause it means nothing if they win it. What happens once they've broken all of the records in English football? They've been found not guilty of their charges because the state that backs them have put enough pressure on our government that they get away with it and none of their titles get stripped and they are the most successful team in England. Do we all just sit here and continue saying well it means nothing if city win? Cause I do think it means something. And it doesn't just mean that city have won, it means that none of us have won. At what point do we look back and go as United Liverpool Arsenal fans? We look back and go over the last decade, none of us have really won much at all. City of one 0 does it mean something then? I'm so bored of This. And the best example is this right? This guy quoted me, Arsenal fan quoted me after watching United fans twerk so hard for city to win the league. Fuck off, I'm gonna be rooting for city like my life depends on it. A month after he was complaining about the hundred and fifteen charges winning another Premier League title. And this is the problem. We're just going round in circles hating against each other when we should all be having one common enemy, which is the team that's winning things with 115 charges against them. I don't get it. And actually to be honest, most United fans I've met in real life wanted Arsenal to win. This is a massively social media thing with people who aren't from England, let alone Manchester, that don't really care about the rivalry between city and United. Most? Most United fans I met wanted Arsenal to win anyway. I just think it's an absolute shambles.",

Mailsport revealed Paquetta had been charged on Thursday afternoon, with the FAA later confirming the full details of an extraordinary case which sees the West Ham midfield player accused of being deliberately booked in an attempt to influence betting markets. The FAA are alleging that Pacqueta was deliberately booked in top flight matches against Leicester, Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth so that either he and or his friends could profit from bets placed on him being carded. The Brazilian international strenuously denies any wrongdoing and has the full support of his club.",

You telling me Kenneth Pickett, former Pittsburgh stealer, is outperforming Dylan Hurst, the quarterback who was going toe to toe with Pat Mahomes in a Super Bowl a couple years ago? That quarterback? I'm not a hater. So this is true. Shout out to Kenny Piggy. Keep doing your thing, you feely. But. But where was this last year? Where was this last year? Because if you turned into Tom Brady when you left Pittsburgh, I'm have a problem with that. I'm gonna be honest. I'm a problem. And I seen a few accounts reporting on this. I don't know if it's true or if it's false, but still. His fans, how do you feel about this? Like the kitty pool. Okay, Doke. Or the Stillers? Philly fans, how do y'all feel about this?

But he's come out saying that while he doesn't agree with Harrison statements, Harrison is a pretty good guy and he's supporting him. And this is a sort of behavior that makes women choose the bear. Because even the good guys give the bad guys a pass. They don't stand up, they don't speak out, they don't say, this is not acceptable, because we don't need men just to be nice to the women that they know. We need them to speak up and call out men who want to put women back into the 1950s.",

And Isaac, Stratford Town defender, was given a 10 year ban for basically doing what Poqueta is accused of. Isaac was given a 10 year ban after it was alleged that he was deliberately booked as part of a betting scheme with friends. He did it once and was banned for 10 years for it. Lucas Paqueta has been accused of doing it four times. That's how serious this is. All of those four games, it was specifically the one against Aston Villa that raised alarm bells. He got a booking in that game for going through the back of John Mcginn. It was actually the second time in the game that he went straight through the back of a Villa player. And it was. It was. It looks like he was just clearly trying to get booked. There was no reason for it. And coincidentally, on this tiny little island called paquetta, where he's from, a load of bets had been put on that day. Many punters who bet the maximum stake permitted on the yellow card, which most operators cap at around 200, with some at around 1,000. Um, it's just, it was, you know, they all got flagged. Every alarm bell basically got flagged as. This is odd, the lots of people from the same place are all putting the maximum amount on a new account on Paquette to getting booked. And then he does. And so, look, if he's found guilty, and doing it once is a 10 year ban, what does that mean for him",

Good evening ladies and gentlemen and member of the press. I would just like to make my clear intentions known that I will be standing for Prime Minister and hopefully to bring the football party to power. Now my key pledges in a manifesto. We are gonna make football accessible for everyone. Bring it back to the rest your TV. A scandal surprises, I charge. We're also going to have a far up review into these dodgy owners of football clubs. Get them out. We don't want them ruining football clubs anymore. We also gonna be working with the clubs to reduce prices of tickets. People work hard all week, very difficult to afford. We are also going to build more football pictures so the great British public can enjoy playing this wonderful sport. We are also going to have a overhaul and review of the terrible standard of refereeing and suspend bar until right jokers at FIFA and the FA can get their house in order. And I'm also gonna make a new ministerial post. The minister of Affairs, John Terry will be your new minister of Affairs. Yes, I will. Takes one to know one. I will stop these MPs having affairs. I can sniff an affair out at 100 million miles anyway. I'll be having affairs of all the married Women in power to start with. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I hope I can count on your vote.",

Do the people say he should be in the England squad or he's gotta be playing for England? People always get the two mixed up, but it's one of the same in it.

And don't even dare tell me in the comment section that you know who this guy is and that I got low ball IQ. Don't lie, bro. Don't lie. You've watched this guy play max two games in the Europa League. Don't. Don't lie to me, bro. His first goal is unbelievable. He receives the ball and makes the fuck out of that Arsenal reject Shaka, Bro. Makes the fuck out of him, cuts in and shoots the ball. And of course the ball goes bottom right corner. Oh my god, bro, this guy is smooth on the ball and he can shoot. But yo, he can shoot bangers with his left foot too, bro. This third goal was class. This guy right here, I guess his name is SA Sakamaka. I'm not 100% sure. He holds the ball, the defenders drag and shift his way, and in the last moment possible, he passes the ball out to Lookman. Lookman receives the ball, runs at the right back and does a step over, cuts to the left, and with his left foot, his weak foot, he smashes the ball top right corner. Just making sure with his right. He can shoot with his left. He's good at dribbling. Who is this guy? How come I'm now only hearing about this guy? So these are Look, man, stats for this season. Five goals in the Europa League. Obviously you just scored a hat trick, one assist, 11 matches. And then in the Serie A. Look at that. Nine goals, six assists and 29 matches. Pretty good, man. Good stats. But yo, honestly, this guy could be a superstar, bro. I mean, just. Just off of what I watched today, this guy could end up becoming a superstar. And bro, look how cold this picture is. Bro, this is savage. The unbeing run is completely finished. It's done and over. But still, GOTTA give it to Xabi Alonso. I mean, he won the Bundesliga and he won it undefeated. That's crazy.

    "voice_to_text": "Patrice Evera speaking absolute facts here, talking on Manchester City's fourth Premier League title in a row, breaking records. The reaction is evident. No emotion, no feelings, no nothing. Absolute facts. There was more coverage on Arsenal finishing second than Man City winning their fourth title in a row. Things would have been different if a bigger club have won it. I agree. A bigger club would have done four in a row. It would have made bigger news, more people would have been talking about it, more people would have been giving it. The football world doesn't write rigged success, as you can see it. And I totally agree. Man City broke record. They won a treble last year, they're probably doing a double this year. Four Premier League titles in a row and there's hardly any emotion. Is that because their fanbase just isn't as big as other big clubs? That's what I think, but I also agree with Patrice. Nobody really cares when Man City win it, nobody gives a fuck.",

    "voice_to_text": "I really don't think this Colts offense is going to get the respect they deserve until they go out and hang 30 on Houston week 1. This offense is about to go nuclear and it is so beyond obvious. I don't understand how it's a hot take to say they can win the AFC South. They are closer to being the third best team in the entire AFC than the third best team in the AFC South. We watch this offense walk into Houston last year Week 2 minus JT and drop 28 first half points and still go on to win 31 to twenty. We have yet to see what was the eighth best offense in all of football last year operate with their two best players healthy at the same time. The difference in offensive talent between Gardner, Minshew and Zach Moss to Anthony Richardson and Jonathan Taylor is gargantuan. It cannot be understated how big of a gap there is. The idea that the offense was better under Gardner is so far fetched it's not even worth entertaining. And whoever truly believes that is in for a root awakening in Vegas this year. And there is the ground threat of AR and JT. The predicament created that is trying to simultaneously stop a receiving core of Michael Pitman, Josh Downs, and AD Mitchell is almost inconceivable when all of them are LED by a game caller of Shane Stikens caliber. Like it is just crazy to me. How? By every account, every poll, every odds book, this team is seen as the second or third best team in the division, while the Texans are put on this pedestal despite having been a bad ball from Gardner Mitchell away from losing to this same Colts team that didn't have AR, didn't have AD Mitchell, and didn't have latte. The Texans added Stefan Diggs and Joe Mixon, with all due respect to both, in the year 2024. Their defensive additions were much more important than both of them. This division is going to be a lot closer than almost everyone outside of Indianapolis has it. And if anyone's going to run away with the division, it won't be the team in Houston.",

The funniest part about this off season to me is usually whenever, like, the Bears have drafted a quarterback before people find ways to say that he's gonna be a bust, they go and pull bad highlights of him from college. They point out why he wouldn't make it in the NFL. But the thing with Caleb Williams is the only thing that people say is that A, he either paints his nails or B, he's gonna be toxic in the locker room. Nothing actually football related whatsoever. The only people, like, really shitting on him saying that he's gonna actually be bad are NFC North fans. That's it. The rest of the league actually understands. Like, shit. The Bears actually set themselves up for once and didn't just leave a quarterback out there to die. And I seriously love it. I can't wait for the season to start. Bear down!",

And at first glance you might think that this squad is good enough to win the competition, but then you look at the forwards and you see that he's dropped Marcus Rashford. Same Marcus Rashford, who is arguably England's best player at the last major competition. And it's not just four from over a year ago. England's recent record. They've only won two of their last five games. And guess what? The only other goal scorer apart from Harry Kane in those two games was Marcus Rashford. But that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is that Gareth picked Jack Grealish ahead of Marcus, a man that is known for pulling whales out of the ocean and being one of the lads. Being picked ahead of a man who literally fed his entire country when kids were going starving, and this is how the country want to repay him? Southgate wants to say he's picked players on form, when I've already proven Rashford's England form is better for him. Rashford even has more than double the goals and assists of Grealish this season. Rashford's a better man than I, he still wishes Gareth and the boys the best for the tournament.

    "voice_to_text": "In honor of 115 Chargers FC winning their fourth straight Premier League title, I think it's time to get into a way too early top four prediction for next season, because fuck it, why not? Coming in fourth, I got Liverpool. I think they're gonna drop off a little bit after losing Irgen Klopp, but I don't think it's gonna be too crazy. There was like a 14 point gap between third and fourth this season, and I think they're still gonna be well within that range to get a Champions League spot. I got Arsenal coming in third, and I actually think they could improve next season, but the club that I got coming in second, I just think is gonna improve more than anybody else because they've been on a tear to close out the season. Shockingly, I got Chelsea coming in second. They finished off the season stronger than anybody thought they were gonna. They were the fourth best team in the Premier League in the second half, and I just think they are going to continue to improve. This season was a learning experience, and next year we're gonna see what they got. Unfortunately, I think 115 Chargers FC Manchester City are gonna win again next season. I could see this being Pepportiola's last season at Manchester City, and I just think they're gonna go out with a bang.

    "voice_to_text": "Live Leverkusen. Don't wanna upset Arsenal fans even more, but that Invincibles has got to be better than theirs. I'd say so because they've win, they're winning trophies as well, they're winning cup tournaments and also broken a dominance of Bayern Munich. Yeah, whereas Arsenal were an amazing team, but they were probably favourites that year. Oh, getting a comment you lot. Is that invincible season for Bayern Munich more impressive than the arsenals? It's gotta be cause they're winning trophies as well as the league and they've toppled by Munich. They wouldn't been favourites. Um, but then again it's a weaker league. But then again it wasn't that strong when Arsenal won it. But that's the difference as well. They've stuck it out in Europe, Cup competitions at home. I mean it's 50 odd games now. Yeah, Arsenal. Yeah, they stayed unbeaten in the league, which obviously they've done as well, but they've gone the whole thing. And they've got the cup final against Kaiser Slowton and the Europa. Yeah, in fairness, they only played 34 games, don't they? In the German league. But they've won 28, drew six, played 34, Arsenal, drew 12, 1 28, drew six, LED accusing. For me. That's incredible what they've done. They deserve a lot more hype. I know a lot of people talking about it. They deserve it. Hey, and we talk about the league. Bayern Munich and Dortmund both in the Champions League semi finals. By the way. Dortmund in the Final? Oh, that's right. Finished third. Stuck that, came second. There's a lot when you deep it about that Leverkusen run. That is massively impressive.",

And none of them will have won a trophy apart from some European qualification. Which isn't a trophy. But I'm interesting to know if anyone agrees with that. I know Manchester United have had a terrible league campaign and that can't be overlooked, but this game is about winning trophies. But if we come out with the FA Cup, only Liverpool and city have had better seasons than us. Liverpool because they have won the League Cup but qualified for Champions League as well. And city obviously won the league and they're in the Champions League. Does everyone agree with that or do people look at Champions League qualification as a trophy nowadays? I don't, I'm old school, but some people might do. What do you think? And obviously Manchester United still have to go and win the FA Cup, which is a big effort at this point. But if they can go and do it and win the FA Cup, in my opinion they have had a better season than Arsenal. Up there in second but won nothing apart from Champions League qualification",

Yeah, right. What do we think? Boring. Whoopsie. Do you know it's a whoopsie do. Like, does the four in a row thing mean anything to the table? Oh, because obviously three in a row break and a huge record. Yeah, it should mean a lot, even. Yeah. It doesn't mean anything to you? You know what the craziest thing about the Man City thing is?

And I saw 115 charges. People don't care. Like, even. Even I was talking about people telling me, you're a Man United fan, why would you want C E? I didn't want C E. To win, but Why you so, like, why you not caring about C E. Winning it? Because it means nothing right now. His. Anyone's groups were all in group chats. Is anyone's phone getting off? No, absolutely not. It's absolutely. It's. It's. It's silent. It's like there's another game next week. Yeah, because why. Because it. No one is hard to recognize this club. It doesn't matter. Does it feel like that the title hasn't come to a conclusion in a sense of, like, oh, and now they've won the title and then we started. It feels like it's just a continuation of, like, four years of them winning games. I, I'm gonna say this is an Arsenal fan, but for me, it feels less like city won the league and more like Arsenal didn't win the league. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? That. That's the story. Uh, uh, like that, like, city don't even feel like the main characters in a league that they've just won. They feel like an NPC. They feel like a non playable character. They just, like, background, you know what I mean? Like, the story could have been Klopp going with a title in his last season. It could have been Klopp.",

Football doesn't pay attention to Merritt. It's only about putting the ball in the net. We did not expect them to be so. So deep in their setup. Yada, yada, yada. Same thing when Scotland beat Spain. Accused Scotland of playing rubbish football. Very bitter with them. And it's because in Rodri's head, there's only one way to play football. And everyone should play Man City at their own game and should just be completely wide open when they play against Man City or against anyone. And I don't know if that's something that he's Learned from Pep Guardiola or whatever, but there's more than one way to win a football match. And it wasn't a bad mentality to go to the Etihad and try and draw. And by the way, I don't even think we tried to draw. We tried to beat them by setting up defensively and catching them on the counter. A better ball from Leandro Trossard, To find Martinelli there in the 85th minute we probably win the game. If Gabrielle Jesus had made a better times run, I think we'd have probably won the game. So the idea that we just went and completely shut up shop and wanted to draw is wrong. But even if it's right, the draw wasn't what cost us the league. Losing to Aston Villa after it was. If we haven't lost to Aston Villa, that draw would have helped us to win the league. We'd be looking back on it going Man City really should have tried to beat Arsenal at the Etihad. But they didn't cause they played for a nil nil draw. So I just think he's wrong on this.",

    "voice_to_text": "When are you going to admit that our Tetra is not the one to take us to the next level? Not today. I find it remarkable that there are some Arsenal fans that genuinely think our Tetra is not the guy to take us to success. Points tally's under our Tetra, obviously. The season he joined halfway through 56, then it was 61, then it was 69, then it was 84, then it was 89. Progression year on year. I just wanna talk about this for a minute because I think it's interesting that uh, progression is seen as a good thing despite nothing really coming out of it. Because let's first, supporters, we have been bashed over the head with this in the last 10 years minimum, that you've had all this like progression on the Pochettino. You had all that progression but you had nothing to show for it. Cause do we remember the, the, the uh, the piss that got taken out of us for um, being pushed, pushing Chelsea all the way or pushing Leicester all the way to then finish 3rd in a two horse race? Because yeah, this rhetoric is not new. Um, we faced it as well. If you have nothing to show for it, then all it's gonna be is this. Let's circle back to the Pochettino era, um, as Spurs manager, just to show you a comparison. Because quite honestly, I think um, whilst it's admirable to look at this as A positive from Arsenal fans. Um, if there's nothing to show for it and also have a bad season next year, the Arteta era will be seen as a, a worthless and a failure really, because when we compare it to the Pochettino era, slightly different, obviously, but he came in and got his fifth with 64 points. The next four seasons, we didn't finish out of the top four, so we didn't have less than, uh, 70 points for four seasons. And for Spurs, that was huge progression. We got to two League Cup finals and a Champions League final, but we had nothing to show for it. Now, you could say the FA Cup that Arteta won in his first half season was an achievement, but that wasn't really necessarily all about Arteta, was it? Cause. Cause he got the. He got the squad that he inherited. So it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily an Arteta achievement. Whilst it was good, you can't really say that in the Arteta era, uh, it was deemed to success. If he is, is failure next season. And he only, well, won an FA Cup in that half season he started. So my question really is, what is gonna be a success for next season? Personally, I think, um, the way that Arsenal going, there's a good chance that they could win the league. As much as it pains me, I look at the progression and I think as long as they do Well, in the transfer market. And they don't fall off next season like Spurs did. Is every chance that they could win the league. Because they challenge Man City all the way. They didn't bottle the league this season.",

I mean, I'm not sure if Arsenal didn't win the league, but still, the West Ham fans were not particularly supportive of Arsenal trying to win the league. Still, fans are, for the third season in a row, uh, proud. We're really proud. We're so proud, lads. You, you, you bottled top four. You bottled the league, and then you lost the league. Like, you seem to be very proud for a team that keeps failing to achieve what it wants. Man City, you're absolutely fantastic. They just stop a team that I actually care about from winning things. It's fantastic. A lot of people say that Arsenal bottled the league. I don't think they bottled the league. Right. They were very, very good this year. Credit where it's due, this game is where I think they lost the league. Paper and a draw at the Seattle is a fantastic result, but in reality, all that happened is that they parked to the bus and played for the draw, and had they won that game, would have won the league. It's not you. From Arteta to think Arsenal could just cruise straight to the title. You've Got to beat the best to be the best. You can't park the bus against the best and expect to win the title.",

Because if you were watching that, hoping for a miracle, it was never gonna happen and you couldn't do anymore. But this must be said. It's a juggernaut. It's not a surprise. And also, the Premier League have created this monster with their own inadequacy. How did they allow this to happen in the first place? Because whatever you think about Man City, they've just exploited a gap in the market, that's what they've done. Some say Chelsea are doing it with their mega long contracts. But the Premier League has failed. The Premier League should not be in this position it is in today, where we've got one team turning it into the French league because they're winning every year.

So you have to cheer on overpaid ponces. Nothing to cry about. Oh no, I'm forgetting it's the euros this year, innit? So uh, probably mid June. You can outside the cheer about, get on the smash. Have pride in your country. Follow the boys, support em. But don't worry about supporting the stuff that really matters. Aye, your family unit, your relationship, your life, your career, your distractions. Distract yourself with the big circus people. I mean, how pathetic. Men. Grown men sitting around with other grown men, bonding over toxic bullshit. Weak ass football. What weak ass mentality. What an absolute embarrassment. And you call yourself men? Ha ha, there we go. Anyway, Merry Christmas. Enjoy the euros. Sorry. Oh, and the joy. Also sorry. Enjoy your last game of the fucking season tomorrow, you absolute degenerates! How embarrassing.",

    "voice_to_text": "Manchester United could win the Premier League on Sunday despite being in eighth place with one game left. Let me explain. To pass Newcastle. It's simple. If you look at the points, all that needs to happen is Newcastle loses, we win, we get 60 points, we pass them. See you later, Newcastle. To pass Chelsea, we would need a higher goal differential, which is 16 point gold differential. So all that needs to happen is Chelsea loses 5 nil, we be bright in 12 nil. Boom. We pass them. See you later, Chelsea. Now here, we're not only gonna pass Spurs, but we're also gonna pass city, because the Premier League is currently investigating son for purposely missing this shot after being bribed by Pep Guardiola. This conversation between them after the game was overheard by a ball boy. And the ball boy says in an interview that Pep said the following Sunday, 1 cash, app or sell. This will eliminate both Man City and Spurs from the title race, making this the new updated table. Now to pass Villa. We all know Article 29 says you can refuse to play Champions League. And we also know that Emory loves the Europa League. He has the most wins in that competition. Plays Europa League instead, he would remove himself from the top four, bringing Manchester United to third place. Now in terms of Liverpool club just came out in an interview reminiscing on the 2022 Champions League final and He says that Courtois had 12 hands and in that final. Now, this could be a racial slur, since we all know the Belgian spider, the Iran, is that the matatas, has 12 legs, which could be a reference to the 12 hand comment. If they confirm claps racist comments, they could deduct up to 20 points for that. And that would bring them to 59 points, bringing Manchester United to second place. Place. Now, how will we pass Arsenal? It's very simple. An article just came out saying an asteroid will hit north London this upcoming Sunday. And if you look at the main area of impact, down below is the exact coordinates of Emirates Stadium. But since the Emirates will be disintegrated, this disqualifies Arsenal, making Manchester United your 2020. Three 24 Premier League title champions. Let's go get it done, boys. This is easy.",

I never, ever understand how these competitions and these awards work. Like, bro, Colt Palmer, okay, you had a great season, but everybody knows you're a bit of a pen merchant. Look, okay, I'm not actually being serious when I say that, okay? Cole Palmer, at the end of the day, is a Manchester City product, okay? I love the guy. He goes by the name of Cole Palmer. I have a lot of respect for Cole Palmer, okay? He won this award, but how is the question when Phil Foden and Erling Haaland are also in the same league? Erling Haaland, top goal scorer, is gonna win back to back Golden Boot and is literally, you know, gonna break another Premier League goal scoring record. But for some reason he missed out on the ward. Phil Foden has had an absolutely amazing season, and I think that Phil Foden is personally gonna win the Premier League player of the year. But why does that mean that he doesn't win the Young Player of the year as well? Surely scoops up both trophies then. You guys need to help me make sense of all of this nonsense, man. For real.",

    "voice_to_text": "Save this video. Remember I said this. From 2026 onwards, USA are gonna dominate international football. Let's have it right. Out of 341 million US citizens, most of them know absolutely jackshit about football, or shall I say soccer. To them, it's slow, repetitive and plain boring. But that is simply because of the American culture. Past generations have traditionally been raised to watch high scoring, fast paced sport with constant action and clear statistical outcomes. But now all of that is changing and it's changing quickly. Since USA's admirable efforts at the 2,014 World Cup in Brazil, there's been a monumental increase in investment for football facility. One of the biggest being the construction of the US Soccer National Training Center in Atlanta, Georgia, which is valued at $200 million. In addition to that, there's been considerable investment in smaller scale facilities all across the country. Companies like WSP Sport have been pivotal in designing and building hundreds of football centers catering to both indoor and outdoor. As of 2,019, football was the most popular team sport amongst children aged six to 12 with nearly three million participants, near enough the exact same as England. The main reason for the rise in participants is of course, the international influence. In recent years, the US has welcomed the handful of superstars to the sport, including the GOAT himself. Think about it. The greatest basketballers of all time, American. The greatest golfer of all time, American. The greatest boxers of all time, American. The greatest swimmer of all time. American wonder kids are starting to spawn out of nowhere. Fourteen year old Kevin Sullivan has already agreed to join Man City in 2,027. Not to mention the biggest and most prestigious tournament on the planet is coming to the States in two years, which will further inspire this generation to take up football rather than the traditional American sports. Americans are dominators, freak athletes and with money, influence and freedom to grow, football supremacy is only a matter of time.",

We got a prop one this time. Pick fitting goal. He's been epic all season. Really, really fantastic. And he's just so good for England. Left back Luke Shaw. I hope he's fit for the euros cause he's our best option. We really don't have many options at left back. First centre back Harry Maguire. I don't care what you say, he's fantastic for England. And he said an underrated season. He's really, really good in tournament football. And then John Stones next to him. World class centre back. Get him in. I hope you fit lad. Right back it's Reece James. I don't care he hasn't played much this season and I don't care that you got sending off recently. He is, when fit, England's best right back. And he is fit. And he has a month to get even fitter, so he's in there. End of discussion. Uh, defensive mid, you're gonna have Declan Rice. Sensational, unbelievable player. Just absolutely incredible. And he's matching perfectly well. Second centre mid Connor Gallagher. We've seen him. What? Fantastically. Kaisado in kind of double pivot. He'll do that with Declan Rice. He's meant for international football and he'll do all the dirty work and running for the rest of the team. Attacking midfielder we have Jude Bellingham. Sensational season. For Real Madrid. And Gallagher will help him just explode up front and hopefully get us a lot of goals in this, um, campaign. Left wing, we got Phil Foden. Phil Foden is gonna be floating around the left wing. Him and Bellingham can switch. Bellingham does play occasionally on the left in throughout his career. Striker, of course, is Harry Kane. He's just gonna be Harry Kane and be fantastic for us. He's gonna have a son and Kane type relationship with our right winger, which is Bakaya Saka. I really hope he steps up this euros. And he's gonna be fantastic if he's just at that elite level that teams win the euros. Hit follow if you watch till the end.",

This is a day before the actual fight occurs, and we've had confirmation from USIC's manager that he has an issue with the actual ring, but they're going to be fighting it. Check this out. When all about this ring camera situation. Just wanna know from your point of view, what is the latest? I don't know. Right now we're checking the original canvas. Uh, yesterday the canvase I saw, it's, uh, no go. The guy who does the canvases, he said it's too late to change him now. That's his problem, not mine. I do. I wanted to put my fighter in a. In a. In a risk on a. On a bad cannabis and then he's gonna get injured or something. Whom do I have to blame? I'm gonna have to blame myself. Hey, have it guys. That's you 6 manager talking about the fact that he does not seem to be happy about the actual ring at all. And he's gonna legit call it off if that is the case. Man, this is absolutely ridiculous. Now, we've been waiting so long for this damn fight to happen, and if they go ahead and cancel it now, what the hell is going on with the boxing world? This is legit a simple thing to just go and resolve and everything should be bang on for tomorrow. But this might be as well. Mind games from you. Sick trying To play with Tyson Fury's head, whatever. Just to make him feel uneasy about the fight. Or he might well just be a fucking pussy and he's obviously not wanting to fight at all. In which case, literally, you might as well just give the belts now over to Fury. What do you guys think? Let me know.",

    "voice_to_text": "If we have a playoff system, there isn't a reason for English teams to play in the UEFA Champions League, as it will be the same thing but on a smaller scale. I mean, yeah, you're approaching the point. And that's literally the point I'm making. If the English Premier League were to adopt a playoff system similar to what American sports leagues have, it could rival the UEFA Champions League for viewership and revenue, but it would go exclusively to English teams. So it would essentially make you by far the most successful soccer league in the entire world. And it would beat all of your competition, making the Premier League similar to what the NBA is currently to basketball. But you guys don't wanna do that. You're scared of actually beating the rest of your competition. But fortunately, Americans don't have that problem. Which is why in the future, the MLS likely will become the one and only top league in the world. Because we're not afraid of setting ourselves up. Be bigger than the UEFA Champions League or the Club World Cup. We could make it to where the MLS essentially functions as the Super Bowl for world soccer. And once that happens, your Premier League, Champions League, everything else just become background noise and most people won't even pay attention to it.",

That's the team Taylor Swift's boyfriend plays on. And the kicker, that's the guy who does a light jog onto the field and kicks the ball. So he gave a commencement at a Catholic college over the weekend, and it is sparking outrage because in it, he goes after women, LGBTQ community, the president, IVF, take your pick. Excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make the sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. Even the NFL. The NFL had to say his remarks were personal. They do not represent us. What has people the most fired up is when he talks about the diabolical lies that women have been told. And what he's likely referring to is the idea that women can have it all and not honor our chosen vocation to be homemakers, to serve our husbands, the gift to be wives and mothers. Because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of You are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world, by the way. I will say, personally, is a gift. I absolutely love it, but I certainly don't think it is my chosen vocation. It wasn't Harrison's mom, who is a known physicist from Emory University. We have not yet heard from Travis Kelsey. I'm guessing we might because he takes a stab at Taylor. We have not yet heard from Patrick Mahomes, who we might, because his wife has certainly become a power woman. My personal thought, I don't know. All those fantastic female stalker stars we've been talking about lately, many of them are free this fall. Maybe they wanna try out to be the new kicker for the Chiefs. Maybe they'll be an opening.",

You don't get a 15 second rest. And that's the first part of the first set. Now, when your 15 second rest is done, you run all the way from the halfway line, down to the goal line, back to the 18 yard line and back to the goal line again. Try get on the 15 seconds.

When the only Me Too movement was one woman saying she's ready to have her fourth child and another woman agreeing, ladies, we have them all wrong. He's not a misogynistic man that thinks that women are just baby factories whose only purpose in life is to serve men and their children and wait on them hand and foot. No, he wanted to go back to a better time. But better time for who? When women didn't have the right to vote? When women didn't have bank accounts? When women couldn't buy houses on their own? When women were dependent on men and the only way they would have a decent life is if they married into one? That they couldn't create or establish one on their own. This man really curled his lips to say, when women had more babies than thoughts. Your physicist mother must be so proud. And your wife to think that all she is to you is a quiet baby factory.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is giving me pure joy. I've never been a fan of Wolves all my life until now. I might start supporting if you've not seen. Wolves wanna scrap VR which I'm glad about but majority of Premier League teams are against it and wanna keep it. Obviously like majority of these sides. I got a backbone between them and obviously the Premier League itself are gonna wanna keep their and went like being undermined. So that's probably why a lot of these teams have said no the shit bed because they don't wanna go against Premier League and the almighty gods that be above them. So it's. It's to be expected because of how pathetic majority of these teams are but it's just sad. Wolves argument and the reason is well put together, it's well fought and I agree with all impact on goal celebrations hundred percent. I've been to about 5 games that I've had VR involved. 2 2 with Bowser probably. And you didn't celebrate anything? The joy is just completely taken away from me cause you're waiting for R2D2 to tell you it's been disallowed. The stupid amount of time it takes to make decisions. Completely agree. Over reach of VR's original purpose to correct clear and obvious mistakes. I couldn't agree with that more like VR. It was supposed to be brought in to change very obvious things. Like when Gordon should have got a penalty last night against Man United which they still got Wrong by the way. But that the game over everything that they don't need to and it takes a complete piss. Which then leads to diminishing the accountability on field rest. On field rest might as well not be there. It's pointless. They still get countless things wrong. There's so many apologies to clubs. There were one last night where they gain a blatant decision wrong way. About a minute worth of time and 15 different replays. I feel like wolves especially are just accepting the fact that referees in this country is shit with or without VAR. So what's point? Just get rid of it and go back to what it want because this is just so boring. Bring semi automatic of sides in and scrap VAR. I think that is the the perfect thing. But obviously it won't happen because primarily do what they want and consult no one so.",

    "voice_to_text": "The same as Tiago was done for Liverpool. You're probably wondering what this is about. Well, this morning I made a video on Rafa Varane and Anthony Martial leaving Manchester United and being completely baffled while I'm watching United content creators make dedication videos for them where they're speaking and saying it's sad to see them go and it's emotional. I, I, I can't understand that. Why? Because neither of them have contributed anywhere near on a level that qualifies. That kind of post for runs on \u00a3340,000 a week in three years is played just over 60 games. Marshall's been at United eight and nine years. What has he done in that time to basically, uh, attract the admiration of Manchester United fans? Nothing. So therefore, in that moment, I'm like, why are people sad about these two leaving? I'd be happy, get them off the wage Bill, create more room for hungry people to come in and take the place. But here Sam the man and another person have got on that video and reference Tiago. What has that got to do with anything? I haven't made a video about Thiago saying it's sad he's leaving, and I haven't seen another Liverpool football content creator do that either. And if you have, by the way, please tag me in it, cause I have something to say. Thiago is a great footballer, but he hasn't contributed anywhere near enough at Liverpool over his time there to justify me saying It's sad that he's leaving. He's on \u00a3250,000 a week. There's been moments where he's been mustered, but way too much as he been injured and way too much as he not been present when Liverpool have been in really good moments, in my opinion. So when Tiago leaves in the summer, I might turn around and go, good luck. But you'll be getting no. Oh, it's sad that he's going. Hmm. If only they see phone. It's as simple as that. We support football clubs where we should recognise people's contribution, effort, desire and presence throughout their time at a club. That's when they deserve that emotional send off. So I don't know where you're going with the Tiago thing, but you're way off. And look, if you want my evidence, I can tag people in and you can look on their page and you can see their little dedications to Marshall and Varane. Can you do the same? If you can, please do it now. Now, look, I appreciate everyone who interacts with me and I like bringing you into the fold, but sometimes, sometimes, just maybe, when I make videos, I might be right on a few of them. Just put that in your mind and ponder it. Have a great day.",

And I just have to say this here is the slippery slope of wanting all famous people and entertainers to be local about their political opinions. I think sometimes we forget that the lot of these bitches are kind of dumb. And I just kind of don't wanna hear it. Like, for example, let's dial it back a bit here. You, sir, are a football player. Why am I hearing you speak? And not just speak, but giving an advice speech to a graduating college class? Your job is to get hit in the head or. I'm sorry, you're a kicker. Your job is to show up and kick a ball, like, three times. You get paid millions of dollars to do that. These are the same men who will be telling other people they need to get real jobs, by the way. And listen, Republicans, and I'm gonna hold your hand while I say this. Not everybody needs to have goddamn kids. And look, I'm saying this as a person who loves kids. I wanna have kids in my own someday. Shit, I work at a daycare. Not everybody is cut out for this type of lifestyle. And if you listen closely to that speech that harius butt crack gives, and he's talking about How great kids are and everybody should have them. You can faintly hear a loud ass baby at the back of the auditorium just hooping and hollering, crying, presumably about how fucking stupid this speech is. Not everybody is equipped to deal with this. And even if you wanted to give a good faith speech about how great it is to be a parent, there is a time and place for everything. And that time and place is not at a fucking college graduation. These people did not go to school for four years to learn how to get pounded raw. Sir, you really should have just stood there on your Mark and kick the goddamn ball like you get paid the millions of dollars to do. Cause look at what you done now. Now all these motherfuckers want you out of here. You're gonna show up to your first game in August and they're gonna have Lucy from Charlie Brown waiting on the field for you. Good luck, Mr. Butt crack. By the way, if you have some change to spare, head to my bio and help out my homegirl Salam here. She's trying to get her family out of Gaza.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is such a great question. Here's a list of three women who are currently kickers on their college football team. Who can replace Harrison Bucker in the NFL after his crazy, misogynist to awful speech? I'm Coach Jackie, and I talk everything woman sports, and we don't talk about the women who play football enough. They're so cool. Option No. 1. Maya Turner. She's a kicker at the university of Manitoba. She's the first woman to score in a regular season U Sports football game. But she score. She kicked a game winning field goal in overtime. And there was just a short documentary about her where her coach said that she's kicking. As far as the guys that have D1 opportunities, we love Maya. Next we have Leilani Armenta, who's the kicker for Jackson State. She's the first woman to kick for an HBCU D1 school. This is her in high school right now. She says she's practicing up to the 46 yard line. And before I get people being like, that's fun to know for the NFL, she's a freshman in college. That's very impressive. Just better cook. Next we've got Mccall Bennett, who kicks for Valdosta State in South Georgia. She is the first woman to ever score points for their football team in the history of their football team. That's just three. Not to mention all the ones who have come before them, all the ones that will keep coming. All the women who play In the Football League. But after the way that he talked about women in this commencement speech, I think the Chiefs could do to look into some permanent changes.",

Jonathan Bean, who is the NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, provided a written statement to People Magazine. Harrison Butt Licker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger. Making a statement is the least that they could do. I'm curious to see if there's gonna be any other actions taken, because I feel like a lot of shit goes down in the NFL and they just kind of brush it under the rug. Hopefully his contract is not renewed, and if there's enough heat on him, hopefully he'll just bow out. I see a lot of people saying, oh, this is gonna blow over. By the time the season starts, nobody's gonna be talking about this. You do understand now that you don't just have regular NFL fans, now you have Swifties, and they are ruthless. The fact that he referred to Taylor as his teammates girlfriend and quoted her, huh. I'd say god be with him, but I don't care what happens to him.",

Amount of pain we have, like, for example, me, as Tottenham fans, are to put up with. And now you're wanting your own team to lose to benefit another team. Like, it doesn't make any fucking sense. So just let me, let me get this right. So you wanted Spurs to win regardless, no matter what, you wanted Spurs to win last night because god forbid. There's a bit of nuance to this. Now, I can understand your position if you're looking at Jamie O'hara and the ridiculousness of ridiculousness of that man. He's got. He's got two brain cells in there, I'm sure of it. Cause he wore a Man City shirt and he was celebrating when Harlan scored. You wanna call those fans brainless, whatever, fine. But if you're talking about the majority of first fans who would rather sacrifice the game last night in order for our local rivals not to be successful, because all this is telling me, man, is that you just don't have enough people close by you, family and friends who are also supporters. Because believe you me, coming from someone who's got friends and family who are staunch Arsenal supporters, if we had gifted Arsenal the league, that would have been 100 times worse. You are not thinking straight, About this, because, like in war, sometimes strategically, you have to sacrifice a boat in order to win the war. And if you don't take the rivalry seriously, then you don't take how important that rivalry is to Spurs and Arsenal fans. You know, it says to me, it says that you live perpetually online and you don't interact with football fans outside of TikTok. Because if you were anything like me, for example, if we had get given Gifted Arsenal the title, my life would have been fucking hell forever. So I get you a bit pissed off because to you, you're looking at it and going, why would you want Spurs to lose? But there is more to it than just wanting Spurs to lose. I did not celebrate the goals. Many people in the stadium did not celebrate the goals. There were a few stragglers, but the majority of people didn't. This was a gut wrenching experience because we were kinda like, we don't wanna give Arsenal the title for a win that probably means nothing. You need to rain it in a little bit, Matt, because it sounds like you just got a black and white perspective on this when it's so much more than that.",

That's not even referred to the monitor. VAR looks at that repeatedly, doesn't even refer the VAR to the monitor, no penalty is given. But equally in the Brighton Chelsea game, this initially was given as a penalty. It's a brilliant tackle, absolutely brilliant tackle. Wins the ball, referee gives the penalty, VAR intervenes, sends the referee to the monitor, the decision is overturned. The correct decision is reached, perfectly demonstrating that when VAR, the system is used correctly, the correct decisions are made. The issue we have is we can't rely on the people using the system to get it correct. And so when it comes to voting whether or not to scrap VAR, the answer is scrap the people operating it.",

If there's anyone in the world I would back to finish this, it's him. Or it was him. No. 6 Ange Postacoglou has officially discovered just how impossible the Tottenham job really is. The mentality, the culture, the history. You simply cannot succeed. Put yourself in his shoes for a second. A manager who's already under pressure and his so called supporters were desperate to see him and his men embarrassed last night. I feel for it, genuinely. No. 7 Tottenham's mentality is a disgrace. you can see the club's captain laughing with the opposition manager after missing a one on one that ruined his club's chances of playing Champions League football. No.8 Man City are the Bollocks. They just are. They all play for each other. They're machines. They don't ever get tired, they hardly ever make mistakes. They always find a way to win.

I wonder how she would have felt to hear this speech at either her undergraduate degree or her master's degree ceremony. I wonder if her husband is the type of man who would tell her that she should stay at home and she shouldn't have career aspirations. This woman is literally helping cure people of cancer. I feel like this woman deserves better than her son saying that women should be primarily homemakers and aspire to have children and get married when she clearly focused on her career and focused on her accomplishments throughout her life.

Well, you saw that, and it's hard to believe it's true, but it is. That's Kansas City chief kicker Harrison biker dressing college graduates, women in the crowd telling them, you've been fed a lie. That degree you have means nothing. There's only two things that matter in this world. Being an adoring, attentive wife and a mother. Those are the only things that will make you happy. Taking care of your husband and raising those children. And this is the definition of toxic masculinity. This is a terrible, destructive message to women, and once again, unbelievable. That this college invited him to speak to women about to graduate, telling them this college is fed you a lie.

I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. The gentlemen here today, part of what plagues our society is this lie that has been told to you that men are not necessary in the home or in our communities. As Men, we set the tone of the culture, and when that is absent, disorder, dysfunction and chaos set in. This absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the US, and a correlation could be made in their drastically lower violence rates as well. Be unapologetic in your masculinity, fighting against the cultural emasculation of men. Do hard things. Never settle for what is easy. You might have a talent that you don't necessarily enjoy, but if it glorifies god, maybe you should lean into that over something that you might think suits you better. I speak from experience as an introvert who now finds myself as an amateur public speaker and an entrepreneur. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity, and inclusion. I'm certain the reporters at the AP could not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places in people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him right here in a little town in Kansas.",

I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail.

But I've now got going to a full day of work, so catch up at 5 for the match day vlog. You know I mentioned about the blister. Well, these were the only plasters that I could find in Tesco Barbie.

It's gonna be today. You just know it is. And look, I'm only really taking the piss today. I obviously hate seeing Tottenham lose more than anyone, but there's a time and a place. And the time in that we've had is just been shite. I just can't stand Arsenal winning the league. The fans are unbearable. They've overtaken the scalches of being the most unbearable fans in the league. We've made it last for the last time this season. There she is, in all her glory. There's the boys. Alright, lads. Got the teams out. And for ages I've been saying, play Dragacin, move Mickey out on the left. We haven't done it. We've been playing Emma somewhere out there. What does he decide to do today?

And now you can look at this other clip here. This is Pep Guardiola on the floor. This man is such a dramatic queen. What are you doing on the floor? Ha ha! Pep was so nervous. The team were nervous. In fact, as a matter of fact, before they got the second goal, Pep almost disappeared. The guy was everywhere. Oh my God. It's an interesting game. It's an interesting game, but I want to ask a question. Son, how did you miss this glorious chance? How did you miss this glorious chance? I am beginning to think spouse sold that game. I'm really beginning to think because I don't understand how a player of this caliber, son, will miss this kind of chance. Anyways, I was. I was thinking the. The kudos to this keeper, man, this keeper was. Was impressive. He had 2 good saves in that game. And anyways, Manchester City is already top of the table and as assistance right now. Assistance right now? They are favorited to win the league. Assistance right now because West Ham doesn't look like that team that can stop Manchester City at This point in time. Manchester City look unstoppable right now. West Ham is in their shambles right now, and they cannot stop this Manchester City team. They cannot. I, I just think man Arsenal should just give it up and hope for nursing. They might win the league. Nursing, but then they should also get ready that other teams will be coming up and that is it.

Jordan Love is about to get the contract of a lifetime, and they're gonna have no other money to help anywhere else at all. But then you go and look at the Bears in the Vikings, like I said earlier, who got two rookie quarterbacks on contract for the next four, maybe five years. Both of us can put whoever the hell we want on that team around those quarterbacks. And the real shit is, Jordan Love probably does deserve a big contract. But with Jared Goff in the Detroit Lions, he did play good this year, but you could 100% plug in almost any quarterback into that Lions offense, and they will give you a close enough level of production, if not the same as Jared Goff.

    "voice_to_text": "I talk about this often with sports parents in youth athletic development. Puberty is the ultimate X factor. It can take athletes that excelled and bring them back to the pack. It can also take athletes that did not have much success at the youth level and take them to the elite status. Because the modern sports parent is completely obsessed with skill building. You'll see these little 6, 7, 8 year old prodigy with perfect throwing mechanics or perfect fielding mechanics or kicking mechanics or fill in the blank. But what happens is when you hit puberty, that's when everything changed. Puberty could be good to you or could really put you behind the path. One of the best youth players I ever played with on the football field. We are 11 years old. He used to completely dominate. I mean 3 4 touchdowns a game because he developed before all of us. But the guy ended up not even starting as a senior in high school. So athletes and parents, be patient. Until puberty hits, you don't know what you have.",

It has just been confirmed that Bruno Fernandes wants to leave Manchester United this summer after four and a half years. He even recently, last month, did an interview where he said he's not sure if he will stay at Manchester United after the euros. Bruno Fernandes is considering a summer move after four and a half seasons and Manchester United. And if anything, he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies. This man has single handedly carried Manchester United. Goal contributions, you name it. Most chances created in Europe, breaking Frank Lampard's record twice even shows. Without Bruno, there's no Manchester United. We conceded five goals in two games and lost both of them without scoring any. Without this man, Bruno Fernandes, Crystal Palace and Arsenal is a pure example. No Bruno Fernandes, no Manchester United. And we're gonna need a big replacement. For me, as a Manchester United fan, Bruno Fernandes, if he does leave, I'm gonna be upset. Obviously he's my current favourite player, but he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies.

And then Netflix is coming in for Christmas Day games. Somebody put this all together. $506 for the year, and then you have to add $350 for Sunday ticket. $855 per season.

Also have not won a league in my lifetime. I just missed the invincible season. I do not want that to reiterate itself again. Not a chance. And then worst of all, we've got kulosevsky, who says we want to win for ourselves.

Arsenal fan anyway so that would be fucking disgraceful. He needs to take a leave. Also he needs to be more like Richardson and Emerson cause these guys are just having fun. Flying kite.

To have represented a club like this for so much history and tradition has been an absolute honour. So above all else, I'd like to say thank you for making this chapter of my life so memorable. And Midamar's got forward in the middle. Oh, she didn't need it! And Vivian Midamar makes WSL history! In football, you never quite know how long you'll be somewhere. You've got to enjoy each moment as it comes. But early on at Arsenal, I knew that this was the place for me to grow and challenge myself as a player and as a person, too. It didn't take long for me to win my first piece of silver with the club. And the following season, it felt like everything just clicked into place at once. What a goal! Arsenal are going to win the title and they are doing it in style. Playing at Amateur Stadium is something I dreamed of as a young girl, but it's the connection we've created with our supporters that's made it so special. Breaking records along the way. I've never cared much about personal accolades, but being able to help the team and scoring goals in an Arsenal shirt has always been something I'm very proud of. It's another for Midamar, and that is 10 of The best for Arsenal. For Midamar in a good position. Here she is. This time she's played a brilliant pass. Black Stenius for 1 1. She's done it! And take a bow, Vivian Minamar. It's a brilliant assist. What a pass! That is absolutely perfect. She's not even had to break stride. The last two seasons have been tough for me with injury and missing two cup finals. But this is a team sport and we've all got our own roles to play. I've been lucky enough to have the amazing support of my teammates and friends. And out of all my goals are Arsenal. My first one back against Liverpool stands out for that very reason. Freedom arm. I have a pop. Brilliant! We'll be able to meet them all with a moment of quality. It's always been an honor to represent the Arsenal, and it's been a pleasure to play with many talented players, ex teammates and fellow Dutchies. Without all these amazing teammates and of course, you, the fans, my story here wouldn't have been as special as it was. So thank you for everything, Arsenal.",

Tottenham done the deed. They beat Manchester. CEO of West Ham done it themselves. Man City drop points but we lose the league because we couldn't be Everton at home. Wallahi I can see it.

Now that I've somewhat gotten the hang of keepy uppies, I've taken a recommendation in my comments and I'm trying to learn the around the world. From looking at some tutorials I realised that step 1 is the footstool, which I haven't mastered. So this is what I'm trying to do here. This part was actually much harder than I was anticipating and I was trying to just get the hang of what it felt like by placing the football on my foot in the right position as well and then moving up to rolling it onto my foot. It also quickly became clear that having size 4 feet was not an advantage here. There just wasn't that much room on my foot to hold the ball against my shin, so it really was a balancing game at this point. I was then practicing the main part of the around the world and it wasn't actually as bad as I thought to get my foot the whole way around the ball. The real difficulty was catching it again on the other side and not just kicking it off into the middle distance. I'll admit as well, I'm not doing the whole skill here as I've just placed it onto my foot. I figured I'd do the two skills separately and then put them together at the end. This is One of my better attempts, where I got my foot the whole way around, nearly caught it. Not quite. Some of them didn't go quite as well. Of course, I was getting really tired as well by this point. I was really standing on one leg for quite a while. Clearly, I was proud of the one I just attempted. Turns out this requires a lot of mini one leg squats, which was tiring. But to be honest, this went more successfully than I thought it would. As my first day of attempting this skill, I'm absolutely not ready to start integrating it into the juggling itself, but I was at least attempting to link the two together. So here we go. Rolling it onto my foot and then going for the around the world. That might have actually been my best attempt, although I tried again here, and I think this one goes okay as well. Yeah, I was, um. I mean, as long as you ignore the fact I use my hands to catch the ball, it's fine. Next step, of course, will be to try and continue juggling it after I've got my foot the whole way around. Um, but we're not quite there yet. So let me know how you think I did on my first attempt at this. And if there's any other skills that you think I should try and learn or any hints for this one, please let me know in the comments.",

Oh, Kai Havertz reborn under Arteta and Jackson, someone that can't finish, just got 14 Premier League goals this season. Stop putting some respect on his name. He's coming and he's doing a job. He's 22 years of age. Um, he's fed up with seeing a criticism and, yeah, he's frustrating and he's gonna miss chances, but he knows where the back of the net is. 14 Premier League goals, the fucking decent return. So I think we should start putting some respect on his name to be. To be perfectly honest. But, I mean, yeah, I'm just. I'm just delighted, mate, you know, that we've managed to win an away game and. Ha ha ha ha! That we've managed to win an away game. It's been a while and we showed some fights and spirits and passion. And we're now level on points of Newcastle in seventh. And we could be going on a fucking European tour next season. You know, the frustrating thing is, right, you know, could have been so much easier for us, you know, four more points today and I don't think we're a million miles behind Spurs, you know, it's those missed opportunities to drop points at Sheffield, the drop points at Burnley. You're thinking, today, Newcastle have drawn. It's a chance to close up two points and then go level on points. And you're looking at us 2 1 down, you're thinking, how many times we not gonna take advantage of our opportunities? But actually, do you know what, mate? We. We did today and now we're level on points. We got two games left. And momentum and confidence is massive in football. And you can just feel that this team has got a never say diatitude about it, as a fight about this team. And that's. That's something that is. Is really good to see.",

He's clearly the best player in Chelsea's team, but we are still talking about a team that has kinda struggled. If you took Palmer's penalties away from his stats, he'd have 10 goals. That's pretty good. If you added the penalties onto Nicholas Jackson, who people say has failed this season, he'd be on 24 goals. That's the way that it can distort things. Even though there are penalties and that all that, I do still think without Cole Palmer, Chelsea I like. There's nothing there. Brentford bro. Yeah, Brentford. Let's talk Cole Palmer. 21 Premier League goals, first season at Chelsea. Still a very young player so good future prospect. He's dragged a team that's been pretty poor this season. Now maybe they might finish fifth or sixth. Havertz going into a team as good as Arsenal, anyone can score goals up front for them. It's not hard. I mean, hey, Zeus can't do it, so then everyone can! So that you admitting that Kai Havertz is good? I want to pay him a really high compliment here because you know how much I rate Bobby Firmino. I think Kai Havertz is like a target man. Bobby Firmino. He wins every duel up there. It gives Arsenal so much more than just the goals. It's great when you make a signing who doesn't turn up Till January. That's good, isn't it? Do you know what it is? I reckon it comes down to if Arsenal win the league, then it's Chi. What's the recent match Palmer didn't play. Wasn't that Arsenal away? Yeah. Look how poor they were that day. Where's posh? You know, it was good that day. It was good that day. Kai Havers",

I don't even think that's a really good D1 school, but like this just shows you how much like there's a difference between these levels. So we get put up against this kid in the summer league, we go into the game and we're just thinking, all we got to do is just stop this kid and we'll win the game. Let me tell you, we only lost by five or six, but he had almost forty. And this was just off easy buckets. This wasn't like a take over the game like 35 like, this was just steady buckets. Like he was just giving us buckets. The funniest part about this is this kid gets on a fast break, he's like, mind you, he's 6 8, he's athletic. And we're like alright, he's about to do like some East Bay or something. No, he didn't do that. But he jumped damn near from the free throw line and he punched it.

    "voice_to_text": "First one, F1. Like they just racing. First of all, never ever, ever talk bad about one of the greatest sports on the planet, Formula 1. I know you are not rattled that much that you made two videos on me. Let's see what he has to say. Because when do you see someone walk out of a crash like this? This is Roman Groton and he walked out of fire. Yes. Okay, like what does the man walking out of fire have to do with the sport? I said I like football more and you're here talking about this guy walking out of fire. That's kinda cool I guess. How does that make a better football? In football, Neymar gets tapped, rolls down the whole pitch and has to get carried away on a stretcher. What about the people that break bones? What about people whose hearts have stopped on the football pitch? Cause that's actually happened before. What about them? Hmm. Another point. We do not race around in circle. For example, this is one of my favourite traps. Spa fungus shot. And how is this a circle? Obviously it's not a circle. I was joking. Damn. But you know what I mean. Like a circle is a one sided shape. That shape whatever is also one sided. Therefore circle. Another point. Formula 1 travels around the entire world. From Australia, Spain, America, Canada, Singapore. The only time when football goes around the world is when they're in A World Cup. But they're not only in that one country. You're right. If only like teams from all across like Europe could be in one competition and play to the not the World Cup. And you may be saying, well, that's just Europe. This tournament since South America, Africa and Asia. So I think football may maybe international. I think. I think this is probably one of the best title fights in the modern era. 2021. First of all, don't say title fights. We're not doing UFC. Second of all, you think Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton was a bigger rivalry than these two? I'm telling you now, I'm not even joking. Not even a speck close to these two. This rivalry. Not even close. And yes, in football, you might have the last minute goal, you might have the bit that wins the game in penalties, but they do not get as close as 2021. When Max Verstappen had to overtake Lewis Hamilton to win on the very last lap. You think we're stopping taking over Hamilton is more impressive than the Aguero last minute goal to win the league? One of the most legendary games of football history. You think that's more impressive than the legendary boss who come back against PSG? You think that was crazy? Than Argentina versus France World Cup finals. One of the greatest games I've ever seen in my life. And I'm not even gonna talk about the numbers and the viewership between The two sports? Cause that's not even a question. You made two videos on me. And I hope this is enough to. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Football is better, bro",

Packers fans, there's no way that this is a real shirt, right? No way. Yes, the tweet is real. Yes. Players have favorite teams before they get drafted. It's a crazy concept. Like I wear a shirt saying Green Bay Sucks. I made them myself. But you would have to pay me a million dollars to wear a shirt with, let's say, Aaron Rodgers on there. Are you kidding me? Legitimately, if you open Packers Twitter, this is the only person that they talk about. They don't talk about their own team whatsoever. The guy hasn't even played a snap a football yet and they're putting him on t shirts? They're putting him on t shirts? Dude, he hasn't played one down in the National Football League. This is insane to me. Look, the Packers might have been a little bit better than the Bears over the past 20 years, but we could tell you guys are scared shitless right now. Bear down!",

He's hitting all of the right notes, he's saying the right things. He's making a lot of public appearances. Um, and he's also talking a big game. His quote from a couple days ago, he said, what's the reason to duck? It's here. There's no reason to duck. I'm here. Rome's here. Keenan Allen, the top five defense we had last year, special teams, all the new rules, whatever. We're here. Vibes are good in Chicago.

They bring David Moise in, he saves them from relegation. The next season, I think he finishes them sick. Qualifies them for European football then. Okay. Yeah, alright. He has a little bit of an underwhelming season domestically, but you get some to semi finals. Semi finals. And actually they didn't. I think they finished one spot below in 7th. Semi finals. Away days. Memories. Those fans will never, ever have had. A lot of them in their lifetime. What's he do the next season? What's he do? He follows it up with a European trophy. That trophy is getting a little bit more prestige as the years go on. We understand with the money that's coming to football, the level is, you know, it spreads further down the table. So you do get guys in those European trophies that are decent, decent level. What happens this season? They lose their best player, who, by the way, most people would agree is possibly signing of the season. They're still sat ninth in the league. And let's be honest, that's where they're gonna finish. They're not gonna go lower, they're not gonna get higher. And what have they done this season? Quarter finals against Bayer Leverkus and a team that have gone invincible. And you're sacking him at the end of that? And it makes me ask a question. How could the West Ham fans think it's gonna get. Do you think Lopertaggy is gonna finish higher than David Moyes next season? Do I think if Lopertaggy did four seasons at West Ham, yeah, he would have better numbers in terms of league finishes and where they got to in cup competitions? No, I don't. I don't. I agree completely. I don't think they're gonna be as high as they are this year with Lobotachi. Next season, they're gonna drop off.",

And the first time in about 19 years, I don't know the exact fact, Bayern Munich haven't won the league. Jamie Vardy, on the other hand, come from, uh, Fleetwood Town, was bought from Leicester for \u00a31 million. Uh, they got promoted, let's say, in one year. After the second year, they won the Premier League, got demoted, and in the first season, they won the championship. So what career would you prefer to have, Mike? Well, Harry Kane, I would say. I know, obviously he's not won a trophy, but he's obviously played for England, he's. He's had many more experiences, and he's like one of the best players in the world, he would argue. So I would like. I would prefer that status of being one of the best players in the world. Yeah. Harry Kane. Oh, we're gonna go down. So interesting. Yeah, because Harry Kane is like a much bigger player. It's just an interesting question, cause obviously Harry Kane, I would say, as you say, he's the bigger player, the bigger household name, um, probably has the bigger crowds. Well, he's had like, as.

Where every time I see it, I just think he's, like, putting on an act or something. Ever since I got media coverage like a year and a half ago and it blew up and everybody thought it was like, oh, haha, it's so funny. He likes horses. He just hasn't, like, stopped doing it. I just think it's getting weird at this. This is Jokic's reaction to when it was announced that he won his second consecutive MVP. He goes a little, oh, yay! Excited. Like, dude, what? Like, you are the world's best basketball player for the second year in a row. Everybody around him is just happy cheering him on, and he just thinks it's hysterical that he doesn't care. Like, I swear he thinks this is the funniest thing in the world. And I love Jokic, I root for him, I root for the Nuggets, I, I love the Nuggets. I've loved Jokic, but at this point, it's just getting weird, man. This is what he said about winning the MVP. I don't really think about the MVP award. Like, zero interest. Like, what? Like, bro, just. Just show a bit of happiness. Like, just show a bit. Like, oh, yeah, I'm honored. I, I love being able to help my teammates, like, at least, like, something like that. It all started with this, man. When is The parade? No, I need to go home. I need to see my horses. Like. And this. This post blew up. This is from June 13th, 2023. And ever since, this. Man, it is just. It's just non stop. Just peak nonchalantness from this guy. I can't tell if he's just doing this because people think it's hilarious, and he knows it would get a lot of media coverage. I don't even think he cares about media coverage. I mean, I feel like he made that very obvious. But, like, playing in the NBA and you being so good at playing basketball is the reason you can buy all your horses. It's the reason you can support your family, it's the reason you can fly back to Serbia. So I feel like it's not asking for a lot to show a little bit of gratitude to the game, but I don't know. I love Jokic. I love the way he plays. I love the Nuggets. I just think this is a bit weird. Please let me know if I'm the only one who thinks like this, because I. I really hope I'm not.",

In gold, there's plenty of options, but I'm gonna take Pickford here. He second in the race for the Golden Glove behind David Raya, which is pretty good considering where Everton are in the table. Full backs I'm gonna use my Spurs pick here and put Pedro Porro right back. And we're staying in London for the next one. Fulham's Anthony Robinson is my left back. Completing the back four, Virgil van Dijk has to get one of these spots. He's been pretty much back to his best this season and will be so key to Liverpool's transition to Arnie slot in the summer partnering him. This one was tricky, but I'm giving it to Sinesi from Bournemouth. The midfield of this team is so, so strong and I'm starting with Rodri. I could have used my Man City pick to select Foden or Harlan, but this guy is by far the most important player for me. Next to him is probably the signing of the season, it's Deckham Rice. If Arsenal can win the title in the next few weeks, a lot of that will be down to the difference he's made. Completing the midfield there might be a little bit of recency bias here, but I'm giving it to as a right wing slot. Was only ever gonna go To one player, and that's Cole Palmer. 30 goal involvements in the Premier League this season. We all knew he was good, but no one expected this level of output down the middle. I've kept my Aston Villa pick for now to select Ollie Watkins and to finish the squad. He surely gotta go to the euros this summer. It's Anthony Gordon.",

Cause I know less than 0.00, 0.1% of people are actual football players. But I feel like, yeah, give me 5 years as a F1 driver practicing, put me on the track, I think I could do it. But if you give me 5 years of football training now, I'm not making it bro, I promise you. But don't get me wrong, I've done my F1 research. Now F1 drivers are. Are more fit than uh, footballers. Cause apparently you do some spaceships of 4G. What's it called again? G force. Where like your head does this. But I know you got to be a proper, proper athlete to be a F1 driver. But can a F1 driver score from a corner? No. Can a F1 driver score a basketball kick in the Champions League final in front of millions? No. An F1 driver is not scoring a ninth minute. Look at Troy Deane right here bro. F1 driver is not kicking the ball. I'm sorry, I know I'm speaking out of arrogance, but other than overtaking someone, what is like a crazy. Oh my God!

Facts are all out there and their owners are getting scared what's coming. This is Red Army. I'll be talking on my podcast about the season desist letter, and I'll have the letter for you on the podcast on Tuesday. So for anybody's interested in that, Tuesday's podcast, uh, normally would be tomorrow, but it's bank holiday. So I'll have the letter. I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, I'm not scared. And at the end of the day, if it's the end of. That's football, it's the end of. That's football. But I will read the letter out and I will tell you what, it's all. So what is the cease and desist letter? Well, basically ceases, stop, desist, don't do it again. So it's a. It's a warning shot from Manchester City saying, stop doing this and don't do it again. And this is now where I'm gonna speculate in terms of what that means. Now, I would assume they've basically found moments where Mark Goldbridge has gone beyond talking about hundred and fifteen charges and assumed guilt. Everyone is completely entitled to say, there are a hundred and fifteen charges against Man City. What you can't do is assume that they are guilty of those hundred and fifteen charges. You can't say that they pay rest you Can't say they're corrupt. And I would assume they found instances where Mark Goldbridge does that. Now, someone a few days ago said that he'd been sent a cease and desist, and he quoted it with 115. Right, you can say 115. Um, what will he have to do? I would imagine he'll have to take down videos where he says that and not do it again. I would be highly surprised if the vast football channel would just have to disappear completely. But in terms of Man City's lawyers doing that, I mean, you know, silencing people, does that assume. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about going out in silence. In silence in the critics, but, um. Look, Mark Goldbridge is the biggest creator, and the fact that they've hit him with a cease and desist is pretty scary.",

I think it will happen at Stoke. I think it was a cock and in law. He's having a bit of a beast. So he got dragged off at half time and he put in Golo and sent a mid. And if not second half, everyone was like, oh my God, uh, who's this? So. So when he came to the club, he wasn't bought as a midfielder? No, he was bought as a midfielder, but after that of a game he put him on. Oh, I see. Right. Yeah, he just happened. He just pushed him out, thinking he's probably too small to be, you know, playing in the centre mid in the Premier League. He went into centre mid and it was like he found his home. It was this. I've never seen anyone win the ball back so consistently and so well ever in world football. He. He is an absolute phenomenon. Hmm. Is he quiet? He's quiet, yeah. Unassuming, very shy. What cars he drive? Yeah, he's got a mini honey. Ha ha. But you know what I Love about it. That probably looks massive to him. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You know what I love about him? Obviously, you would have seen him, obviously, with more trophies with Chelsea and obviously France. And he's too. He doesn't even wanna hold the trophy. Doesn't. It's like he gets shy, like he's scared to, you know, mess it up. Isn't the World Cup someone to push him at the front? Take on. You've won it, go and hold the World Cup. Why is he like that? It's just who he is. And, you know, I love him, you know? Sure. Obviously Lester fans love him. Chelsea fans love him. So many is. Is one of the greatest ever, right in that position.

Do you understand what I'm saying? Cause if you didn't understand the video, that was the parade after Inter 1 the league, OK? The scum on the earth was screaming in a k a. Interfans was screaming. Who doesn't jump? His Juventus fan. And he decided to jump. He started to jump as if he's Ronaldo. Okay, you keep jumping. Keep jumping. Because all I say is congratulations. Because the day you signed for Inter, you burnt everything you built at Juventus. You sold your soul. You won 11 trophies at Juventus. You were here for what, six, seven years? However long you were here for, you said you were Juventus through and through. You always paid for the badge. And you went round there and you won two trophies. And you weren't even integral in those. You're like a kidney. Without one you can still live. You won integral, you won LA Tara Taram. But Ella, all these players, they won it without you. And you're giving it large. That's fine, you do you. You're a knob, that's fine. But you, Ventus, I ask you on behalf of every Ventus, Fan in the whole world. Remove a shirt. Remove it and burn it on Insta Live. I wanna see it. I wanna live stream it. Burn it on Insta. Burn it on TikTok Live. Burn it on Twitch. I'll send roses, I'll double tap the fuck up the screen to run it up. Do anything. Just live stream it. Burn it. Because he doesn't belong round here. Do you understand this or do you not understand this? You vented. He's not welcome round to win. Understand? He's not welcome round cause what he did was disrespectful. Disrespectful? And I'm not taking that level of disrespect well, I'm pissed. I'm pissed and so is every Ventus fan. Every Ventus fan. It's not about him rattling us. He's a knob head, that's what he is. This isn't shit. How's he like Vardy or. Or what's his name from Mopay? Whatever that guy called. It's not like that where you like, you know, respect to the cause. No, he's a knob. This is. This is unbelievable. This is. This is some next level beer. I'm not having this. I'm not having this. Seriously, Ventus. I might start a petition. I don't. I think there's even a petition going around. You have to remove a shirt. Please. Anyone that works, you Ventus, just remove it. Put anyone's shirt there. Put Philippe Melos, put articles, put costaches, put bentness, put Anelka's, put, put, put, put, put look at hellys, put anyone's Millix. I don't care Just remove your shirt now, please.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's too funny how Bears fans think Caleb Williams is good because of his highlights when his low lights prove exactly why he will be a bust. And see his terrible decision making. Like on this play where he just threw the ball up into double coverage even though there was no pass rush and he had a wide open man in the flat on first and goal. Everyone talks about his arm and his crazy deep ball, but he only throws it long when his receiver is wide open, while when bro sees tight coverage he often short arms it. Which is why you see his receivers come back to the ball on a bunch of his touchdowns. And this also results in a ton of interceptions which will only get worse in the NFL. There are way too many times where bro has completely clean pocket and Caleb just starts seeing goes and throws the ball for no reason. While he is horrible at reading the middle of the field on short to intermediate throws like this, he has terrible footwork inside the pocket which results in a bunch of Aaron throws while outside the pocket he almost never sets his feet when he is thrown down field, so he has a ton of inaccurate passes like this that get intercepted. He makes early career Josh Allen like decisions when he gets just throwing balls up there on the run. They get picked off every time. And he Has straight up horrible pocket awareness so he got hit all the time on throws, while he also had terrible ball security every time he got touched by a college defender. So he could easily have 20 fumbles this year behind the Bears offensive line.",

You're telling me if Dion his entire life focused on basketball, you don't think he would have been able to figure it out? Oh, probably, yes. Whole life? Yeah.

    "voice_to_text": "I think United should bring Ollie back. I genuinely do. That's where I'm at right now. We have never, and I'm gonna talk about Ollie's time at United. We've never had a manager be that close to making us be great or show anything through sustain period of time like we had under him. And I just wanna feel something again. I just wanna see attacking football. I wanna see our team score goals, be solid at the back, be in the Champions League places, be challenging Pep City side. Not challenging them, but being at least in the next best. The best of the red. It's time at the club until it went south, was better than any other managers we've had by a distance. I mean just look at this. This is a created and allowed fret from Man United in last like 4 5 seasons or so. The yellows are created fret, the purple ones are allowed fret. Look at that at 10 arc. Look at Ollie's for the two seasons that he's at the at at the club. Second most wins, fewest losses, second most goals scored, second fewest goals conceded, second most points. In the 18 month spell at United when it was going well and the only team we were second to was pepcity side. Every team in the Premier League before and since the past six or seven years has been second to pretty much every part of every single season he played. Good football. He had the fans on side. He had people loving the club and enjoying going to games again, being proud to support Manchester United. And he wasn't trusted. He wasn't interested with the budget that Erich Andersen had, or interested with signing the players that he wanted to sign, because the vast majority of the players that he signed personally were great for us. And he had this fantastic talent idea. He had Kira Mckenna, he had Michael Carrick at the club as coaches who were now some of the best coaches in the championship. And Mckenna's getting sought after for their Brighton job about two years later. And I know this is fucking bad, I know this is how bad it's got the club, where I'm asking for a little comeback, because when managers come back to the club, that usually almost never work. But I honestly reckon if we kept only in that job, giving the money you wanted, sign the players that you wanted, kept the coaches on board, we'd be challenging for the title, up there with city and Arsenal now, and might even have won it this season. And I think over then, if you're getting maybe a Thomas Tuchel, who's a guaranteed serial winner, still at the peak of his powers, Ollie is the best man to bring in. He's genuinely the next best option for me.",

And look at my attack.   it's   always   like   that   And   look   at   my   attack The only place I see that I'm complete is maybe my attack.   only   place   I   see   that   I'm   complete   is   maybe   my   attack Lots of Antonio Ganaccio and all that.   of   Antonio   Ganaccio   and   all   that But in midfield and defence now where my United day Arsenal.   in   midfield   and   defence   now   where   my   United   day   Arsenal Next then Newcastle.

They beat my new home and away this season for Ross Clark. No, but let's talk about the elephant in the room. Blood Casimiro blood boss man Casimiro. A absolutely atrocious performance. Blood Casimiro was awful. Casimiro. There I say it is. Finished. MLS, Saudi league, whatever league. Bro. This guy is finished at the top level. Bro. The only way he stays at United you must just use him as like a. As a striker. Literally bring him on as a striker cause to to his defense he was the only threat going forward from set pieces he got his head on everything. Had two goals this allowed but um defensively the has no legs. I mean the way he kept losing possession, the way the um, Olesi or Ezi would just skip him past him like he weren't there was absolute, absolutely ridiculous man. And as in Alicia. These boys man. Probably the two most exciting duo on the wing. Blood in the Premier League. These like two mates in a park. Just having a laugh mate. Literally. These man will just. Just cook in United blood, you understand? Even Jean Philippe my tattoo up front. These guys had a underrated season as a striker. The numbers are very good I think. What's that 13 or 14 league goals? Bro ez and Olese they remind me Of like, um, two guys in NBA terms, the Celtics, they've got, um, Jaylen Brown and they got Jason Tatum. Like, sometimes Tatum is seen as like, the best player in the team, but brown is just behind him. And at times brown looks like the best in the team. And that's what I think of when I watch Elise and, um. And as a man, like I said, at times one looks like the best, at times the other looks like the best. But one thing is, both of them cook together, man. And. And love to see a man united on the other hand, man. I mean, there's no point even going through the team. Obviously Bruno Fernandes, um, missed out today, wasn't in the squad looking for injury. And then they had. They got. They got injuries all over the defense, bro. Obviously, even Maguire is not there. He's injured as well. You're playing with literally two old, finished center backs. You got no chance of winning games. But you understand? But yeah, man. In the middle as well, you got Eriksen, he's got no legs. Kobe Maynard now is just. The hype has kinda died down. Hasn't. Hasn't performed in the last few games for United. Got natural, did nothing. Hoyland again, ghosted, um, Anthony did nothing. Literally all round poor. Um. 10 hog. This. This guy's got a lot of issues to deal with, man. You understand this guy? I mean, it's not looking good. For him, his resume at United looks quite awful. Blood last year, that trophy, the Carabao Cup, you know, gave him a little leeway. But this season, I know there's injuries and everything, but it's a manager that looks like he's lost to change room as well, man",

Even though I like Bruno, I'll definitely start Bruno, but I'd give it a watch today how midfield plays and how mount plays. He'll probably stick to that midfield position like all the other kinda attacking midfielders in the league. But Bruno already does that because obviously, I don't know, he's trying to help the team. Obviously he does help us 100%. But watch on midfield today. I generally think mount will bring more of a balance to midfield and it'll be more structured, but we'll see.",

Check. And Brady. And there's just tension all around the room. And you throw craft in there. I thought some of it was broken last night. A little bit lightened up last night. And I get it.

For about half. 8, 9 PM Wednesday night, those Oxford fans would wanna go home. It'll be so depressing in our way. And cause they're. They're not gonna be near us. If you are there Wednesday, get beyond the boys, stand up, sing your arts out and we'll get the job done. Wembley again! Ole! Ole!",

This one now said I beg it's Ronaldo 20 in a game according to according to L. Dominico. You know that these ones are the ones the algebra love brainwashed. You know the way they use brush and split to clean foam panel? That is the same way algebra love use brush and split and clean this one's brain panel. I don't know which match Ronaldo completed the 20 trivals. I don't know who counted it. Was it you or was it Bajibala? And in which match against who? Was it against Mamelodi Sandam? Or was it against Ramo FC? But tell us now! Or was it against or was it against Falcons? Hello! So let us know my fellow Ronaldo fans, when it comes to scoring goals, all type of goals, goal starts and goals records, types of goals, head at goal, shots, uh, flying goals, jumping goals, swimming goals. Yes, bring Ronaldo into it hundred percent. He will dominate when it comes to playmaking, dribbles, passes, touches, ball control. Please leave Cristiano Ronaldo out of that conversation. Please. If not, you will only be setting him up for A mockery. Think about it. Alright, Goodnight.",

Both in the draft. A double dipping early rounds. Troy Fou Tanu, who's a tackle, slash guard. Zach Frazier, the center. You've heard me praise this draft pick, but this has been a work in progress for a few years now. The approach they take into the offensive line, recognizing that that's what's really key to their rushing success. They both success for me.",

Summer's world class. Jordan was saying that he feel like he's overrated and I think one of the things he pointed out was that he's died. I, I don't think he's as good as people make him out to be. I do think he's a diver. Name me one top player that hasn't died for a free kick or penalty. So that narrative is, for me, it, it don't make no sense. Listen, I know there's no debate on his goal scoring, but they said in big games they don't see him. So for me, is probably one of the definition of big game players. As in his stats and goals change games. So for me, and um, it may be, I may be biased because I'm a local supporter and it's maybe a bit dramatic that I've got salary in the background, but I think he redefined the wide forward. I mean, what do you want from a wide player? He scores goals, he dribbles, he's strong, you know what I'm saying? He assists. I don't understand that. I think at this time at Liverpool he would have been able to get into any team in the world. For me, ain't that the definition of world class",

Um, you can make the case JJ McCarthy as a top 10 quarterback could be in the best situation a rookie quarterbacks walked into when it comes to. He has the best receiver in football, arguably. He's got a really good No. 2 receiver. He's got a top. Probably six or eight tight end. They've got a top 10 offensive line. Aaron Jones is one of the best dual threat backs in the league. But then the next level, and really a separator for me is Kevin O'connell as the play caller in the scheme that he runs, this scheme that comes from college. And Mike Shanahan, Gary Kubak always elevates quarterbacks. They always play better, maybe than their physical talent should allow them to. And then you have a. One of the better play callers in the NFL. So I just think that the situation that JJ walks into, you know, I've said I. He would be and Caleb are neck and neck for front runners for Offensive Rookie of the year right now. As far as who would place your. You would place your bets on, I think Caleb walks into a fantastic situation. But as far as the quarterback and just strictly the offense, the one that JJ walks into is one of the best for a top 10 guy that I could remember.",

Cogley was doing a pre match press conference for the next game that Tottenham have against Chelsea tonight and he is still being asked about Ben White's antics in that game. You've got articles in the times asking are Ben White set piece antics legal? How the team stop him? This by the way, in the very same game was Vicario at the end of the game trying to do exactly the same to David Rayer and David Rayer just pushed him out of the way. So this isn't just a Ben White thing, it's an incredibly normal thing that happens in pretty much every game. And I don't know about you, but I don't remember this goal being spoken about when Ramsdale was literally pinned to his line and the ball went in. At this point, by the way, Ramsdale's literally being held and obstructed from getting the ball. Ben White is nowhere near the car. About time the ball goes in. And I don't remember when we got knocked out the Carabao Cup this year when Ramsdale shirt was being pulled like that as the ball came in. I don't remember anyone asking if that was illegal. I remember when we lost to Brentford on their first game in the Premier League and Leno was being pinned down like this when the ball came In I. I don't remember if anyone was asking if it was legal then. It's just a bit odd, the hyperfixation. And it's now Thursday. Get over it.",

After leaving Dortmund in 2021, Sancho should have went back to Menzie. Hear me out for a second. I know you're gonna say, oh, he probably left on bad terms or whatever, but let's just forget all of that for a second. Strictly as a footballer and the team that suits him the most. Bro is Manchester City. When you talk about little combinations between the players, him linking up with Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, KDB. That is Sancho's game, bro. Them quick combinations between his teammates, that's what Santo loves. We've already seen his link up with Harlan Ozaw. We already see what these two on the same team. Bro is cash money the role that Jack Greedish has been given at Manchester City? Hug that touchline, beat your man, but also combine with your teammates. Get balls into the box to Holland. That is perfect for central bro. He's much better 1 v 1 player than Grealish as well. Moving to Grealish now and he should have joined Manchester United. Now hear me out guys. Grealish at Aston Villa. This is a guy that had freedom, bro. Could roam anywhere on the pitch and a manager wouldn't say anything to him. Fast forward to see now. And he just has to hug the wing. And for Me, bro, that's. That's not his game. But if he was at no rules United, Manchester United. Listen, these. But have no structure. He would cook in that cell. Don't forget, this guy is a bull carrier, bro. This guy is a bull carrier. Ha! And imagine him on the old traffic pitch, just baiting players to come into him. And then the players get drawn in, slipping in. Bruno hits it from outside the box or even feeds in. Rashford. Listen, I'm telling you guys, the vision.",

A man that can literally score with just looking at the goal post, and the goal will go to into the net. Ronaldo does magic to score goals. There's nothing you want to tell me? How did he score that goal? Ronaldo scoring a very nice volley from that range at the age of 39 in a very difficult league, like, like the pro league, man, this is so impressive. Ha ha! This is so impressive. You know, those of you that are not Ronaldo fans, I don't know how you enjoy football. I don't know. But then, Cristiano Ronaldo has taken Anassa to the finals. The only problem I have in that final is that they're playing with Al Haleela. But trust me, trust Me when Cristiano Ronaldo is involved. You never, you, you never ruled ruled out his team in any way. Never ruled out his team until it's over. Ha ha! Ha ha! But wait to. Wait to Cristiano Ronaldo. Why, why did you, why did you give our go outs? Why did you give our penalty to. To. To sell your money. We like Messi's tears. Messi fans tears. We like their tears. It would have scored that goal. So they would start crying. I, I, I like their tears. I have pockets full. Empty pockets where their tears will be filled inside. But anyway, we can manage it.

One million quidditch cost Leicester and goal contribution every other game. Won the championship with them 10 years ago which is mental. And he's still there now scoring goals to send them up once again. It's ridiculous. It's absolutely mental for a 37 year old who rely on his pace massively. It's mental that you still be able to do this even in the second tier of English football. And it's got to be looked upon of that as an icon of the English game at least surely. And everything that is achieved, winning the Premier League will. Leicester PFA Player of the Year, Premier League Golden Boot and going down unless they're coming straight back up again. And the level of loyalty showed them when he could have moved to Arsenal, could have gone away, could have got a loads of other clubs. Just fucking sick to say cause you don't really see many players like that in today's game. And I mean just how he is as well. If you've not seen it, go and watch your second goal against Preston yesterday. To get his brace two yards out and literally twats it over the line like he's hitting it from 40 yards out. Is it shit house? Is it? Likable bloke. He's also got The streak for the most goals scored inconsecutively in Premier League games when he got 11 and broke Rude Van Nistelroy's record that stood for like 10, 15 years at that point as well. Just a proper throwback, a shithouse, quick loyalty that you show into his club as well. And I'm glad that he's coming back up to the Premier League with less than next season for potentially his last one ever, and he's spending it in a Premier League because he really deserves it.",

I would love to, like, watch a game and commentate it from my perspective of what the quarterbacks is looking for so everybody sees. I would be so interested to see how Tom Brady commentates. That'd be something interesting. But Tony Romo, all those things that he says on TV, Watch for the run, watch for, oh, they're definitely running right now. That's the typical one high, two high check. Like, too high. The box is not as loaded as a one high look. So of course, the easy check is, hey, kill, I'm checking into a run. We got numbers. But some of the things that he does a great job with commentating and giving a understanding, a watered down understanding of the game. And I would love to do it on my terms.

Showed a lot of promise towards the end of last season and he's been really poor this season for me. Most improved player Joe Gomez. He's had a really good season. I think. Um. His versatility, especially his caiman. Clutch filling in for injured players throughout the season. Unsung hero Harvey Elliot.

And I disagree with that. I, I disagree with that. Um, Cristiano left Real Madrid and they went on to win A U C L. And made 2 semi finals, right? Without him, he went to Juve. He couldn't even play in a semifiner. He went to Manuel, played in Europa, now he's in Saudi league, you know, bottled every trophy on offer. But one man, here's this man, Tony Cruz, he is the difference. He is the one that brought the 3 P T U C L. To Madrid, and he continues to deliver both domestically as well as, um, in Europe. So for all of those who think Cristiano Ronaldo carried Real Madrid, this is the guy that carried Real Madrid, and he continues to do so, right? All of those passes that he was giving for Pendu to score those goals, similar to what he did for Vini last night, right? Penalto was just at the end of those. Of finishing those goals. That's it. But all the work was done by this man. Modric, Benzema and Bale. Cristiano was just there, you know, to, to, to finish the, you know, at the finishing touches and score the goals. But all the hard work, Tony Cruz. I don't like Madrid, right? Obviously, but you've got to give credit. Where it's due Tony Cruz is a legend of the game.",

But yet,   La Liga   But   yet so just imagine if Cristiano Ronaldo also plays 520 games   just   imagine   if   Cristiano   Ronaldo   also   plays   520   games like Ronaldo Messi in La Liga,   Ronaldo   Messi   in   La Liga Ronaldo would have scored by now at least 800 goals and that's a fact.   would   have   scored   by   now   at   least   800   goals   and   that's   a   fact That's a fact.

I'm sure that's the stack cause I remember there's a season Ferguson lost twice. Jesus Christ. At an average of 1.6 per season. Yeah, that's nuts. Do you. Do you actually see what I'm saying, brother? Wow. So Alex Ferguson had an average loss rate of 1.6 games per season and he only lost 34 home games in his whole tenure. And he was there for nearly 20 old years. One point. Are we just glazing over this? No, we're not. 1.6 games per season. Do you see what I'm saying? About how we used to be? Yeah, you man used to be gods. He used to instill fear in our opponents and in our players. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah. Wow. We don't have that anymore. Wow, bro. Ah, brother, down my hair. Rashford's fucking as well. At least he didn't sign off the pitch. Cause he's doing nothing on the pitch. He's not. A season. The only save it. The only two bangers he scored.

    "voice_to_text": "How can a player with this much talent be on the verge of falling out of football all together? That is the curious case of Tongai and Dumbale. A player who was once heralded as the future of Francis midfield is now stinking up in Turkey in what should be his prime years. Dumbledore's talent is undeniable. He turned heads at Leon with his dazzling close control and dribbling ability. Then partner that with impressive upper body strength and remarkable vision and you've got the blueprints to a truly special midfielder. Spurs recognised this potential and in 2019 they parted with a club record \u20ac62 million to bring and dumbbelle to London, seeing him as the long term successor to fan favourite Musa Dembele. And still gets it back on dumbbelle. How's that for a way of making your Mark on your debut? But now, five years and three loan moves later, it looks like they won't be getting any return on their investment. That is simply incredible. Tonky on Dembele with a moment of inspiration. So where did it all go wrong? Well, there's always been questions surrounding Tang Guy's commitment to football. He was released from Ganggump at age 17 due to weight and fitness related issues. And although it looked for a few years as if he had put these problems behind him, it's always been a concern he struggles with injuries throughout his career often point back to his lack of dedication and desire to get fit. And play. And now fans have rightfully been expressing concerns for Ndombale after footage of the French midfielder shows him once again looking out of shape playing for Galatasaray. You have to wonder if problems outside of football have ultimately caused Ndombale's downfall. It's a sad thing to see. Galatasaray have rejected the opportunity to sign Tangai on a permanent and with just one year remaining on his Spurs contract, it's hard to see where he goes from here. Still just 27 years old and dumbbell a should be a world superstar right now. Instead it seems he is destined to join that long line of players whose careers promised so much more.",

A laughable coach the last three seasons. His weapons were always injured and he's even battle with his own injuries. I think people forget this guy had 40 3 hundred yards and 30+ touchdowns as a rookie and in his second season he had 5000+ passing yards and over 40 touchdowns. And number four. I have Matthew Stafford. What we're hoping that CJ Stroud and Jordan Love can turn into is what Matthew Stafford is right now. Arguably the best overall arm tower in the entire league. And he's controlling. We did now to the top two wide receiver seasons ever and the best rookie wide receiver season. Not to mention being by far the toughest quarterback in the NFL and No. 3. I have Aaron Rodgers. It feels weird to put him here after Achilles tear, but I simply have to. I don't think it will affect his game that much, but I think people forget how good he really was before that terror since we haven't really seen him play in like two seasons. But I expect him to be an MVP frontrunner with this stacked Jets team this season. And 2 in one should be pretty obvious. I have Josh Allen at two. Best arm in the league, highest ceiling out of any player on the NFL. But his floor is significantly lower than Mahomes, so he just can't be higher than him. And he is one hell of a playoff performer. He has rarely been the problem in the postseason. But No. 1 is Patrick Mahomes and I don't think it's that close. I think he has maybe a slightly lower ceiling than Josh Allen, but his floor is so much higher and he is just consistently elite week in and week out that he has to be here.",

    "voice_to_text": "I have some questions about the Sean Payton draft process. First off, admitting he baited Minnesota, forcing them to trade up for JJ McCarthy. What sense does that make? Dude, why would that matter to you whether or not Minnesota gives up a couple of day 3 picks? That seems like a total waste of time, and I question whether or not it's true in the first place. I mean, did you actually try to trade up? You didn't pull it off, and now you're worried that stories are gonna come out that, hey, maybe he didn't pull off a trade up, and bow next isn't really who he wanted. So this is you getting out ahead of it? I don't know. Could be. Regardless, there's a story that came out about how the Falcons, the Vikings in the Broncos landed on which quarterback they wanted to take at the top of the first. Here's a Broncos section. What's in your backpack? Sean Payton asked. Next, reach inside and grab the roll of tape that he explained he needed for his ankles if you were going to train. He also pulled out a spare pair of football cleats and a cross ball that he'd use for rolling out his back. What wasn't in the bag was just a significant. Everything was football related. All of it. Look, I'm not saying if you're a Broncos fan, you can't defend the bow next pick. You take a quarterback that high, you're going Through no matter what. Trust me, I get it. But knowing that part of the process was Sean Payton Soy facing after Bonex pulled a football out of his bag. Which is great cause he's a football player. Can't inspire confidence. This wasn't his entire process, obviously, but I listened to a lot of what else he said after they picked them and it didn't move me. And really, it's just thinking that this means anything at all to me is crazy. I give him credit for the Franklin pick in the fourth. I thought that was very good. But I'm wondering if maybe there's some Mike McCarthy allegations that Peyton needs to beat if this doesn't work out. Cause right now I'm just not there with the process.",

    "voice_to_text": "Adam Walton was the January signing that got away for Spurs and I can't believe it's taking people this long to realise that. He probably should be on the plane to the euros in the summer. Colby Reynolds had an outstanding season at Manchester United, has really burst onto the scene. Looks so impressive, looks so comfortable for the most part in that midfield and in an England shirt as well. But Adam Walton is an excellent. He's more of that profile that England need. England don't really have that successor to that come rice ready yet in that No. 6 position. Someone who come in and step in and look composed on the ball just like rice does if rice was to get injured. Rice isn't a Sardinian's best player, but he's England's most irreplaceable in my opinion. But Adam Walton could step up to that mantle and probably should be on the plane in the summer. There's were a number of big clubs that were linked with Walton's signature in January, but he chose to move to Crystal Palace and it's been brilliant for him. Glasgow ball is perfect for someone like Adam Walton. He looks so comfortable in that midfield and he's shining at just 20 years of age. I genuinely think we're looking at a generational talent here in midfield. England are blessed with so much talent in that area. But Walton for me should squeeze into that squad over the likes of Gallagher, potentially over The likes of Henderson. We've got a 26 man squad, let's use it and give this man the opportunity deserves. Hate to make it about Walton versus Manu cause they're actually quite different profiles. Manu's more of that ball playing No. 8 and Adam Walton is very comfortable on the ball but he's more depth of playing that No. 6 position. He's averaging over double the amount of successful tackles per 90 in the Premier League, blocks per 90 as well. Clearances per 90. He's been excellent so far for Crystal Palace. Played less minutes naturally than minor in the Premier League but you can see his expected assist to hires create more chances. And for me this lad has got to be on the plane. I'm gutted Spurs didn't pick up the option to sign him in January because he was the one that got away. Especially when you consider how many struggles we're having in that position at the moment. Let me know in the comments if you had to take one of Walter Hermione to the euros, which one would you take? And as always if you enjoy the video, drop it like for me and follow for more daily football content. Nice one!",

    "voice_to_text": "So Matt spawn our put out a tweet and a subsequent video where he asked the question, is it unfair to say that this is a make or break year for Bryce Young? He thinks it is, and I agree. And my reasoning for that it it starts with the class of 2021. So sometime in like, the 1970s, for the first time ever, quarterbacks were taken 1, 2, 3 in the draft. It proceeded to not happen again until 1999, and then not again until 2021. But then only two short years later, we see quarterbacks go 1, 2, 4. And the team that picked third, it's the same team that picked second. And then this year, they go 1, 2, 3 again. Why is that, you ask? Well, to me, it's because when you look at the teams that picked quarterbacks in 2021, they all worked out. At this point in the NFL, it seems like within two years, you know whether or not you have a guy at quarterback. In Trevor Lawrence's case, he took the Jags to the playoffs in Year 2. Zach Wilson, two years in, major bust pause. But the roster is good, so they go and get a veteran. Trey Lance barely got playing time, but the Niners decided they didn't wanna wait anymore. Look later in the first round, the Patriots draft Mac Jones and they trade him away. The Bears draft Justin Fields. He's traded. Different year, but are any 22 Quarterbacks still on the team that picked them. Starting quarterbacks in the NFL are younger than they've been in 60 years. Teams are basically comfortable saying, we think we can surround you with enough weapons to know whether or not you are good by your third season. Boring injury or bad process. If you're good, like these three guys right here, they'll keep you. But if you're bad, you're gone. Think of the Jets, the Falcons. They'll just get a veteran. The worst thing a team can do is not know by year three or four. Get the Titans. Look at what they're surrounding Will Lewis with right now. They want an answer. The Giants are a good example of not knowing what you're working with and then paying a bit too much money as a result. If you draft a quarterback top three and they're not very good by Year 3, you're probably stuck with them for the rest of that contract. But they might be cooked. They could take longer. It's just. It's a bit unusual. So. For Bryce Young, I'm not saying he has to lead the league in passing. Wouldn't mind like a Josh Allen Year 2 scenario where it's a bit messy, but there's upside. I think the situation is definitely good enough. I'm rooting for him, to be clear. I like Dave Canalis. I like that supporting cast. I do think he will have a pretty good season, but if it looked like last Year. I wouldn't really blame the Panthers and Panthers fans for, you know, deciding they're out on him.",

    "voice_to_text": "Furthermore, from that game, my head's gonna cover a couple of the ratings, but ratings don't really matter cause gecko got an 8.2 and he was all right. But 8.2 is crazy. I'mma be real. I don't get the subs in that game. Jones wasn't playing great, but he's just come back from injury. I'm okay with him coming off. Simicus, I don't want to say nothing disrespectful about the players, but you understand what I'm saying? That. That performance. Wow, man. It's like he was playing right wing for Atlanta. But like he was. There was no defending, especially in transition, was not there? This right to. To the bottom left. You see? You see this name here? Harvey Elliot. Why did he come off? What? Unless it's a fitness thing. If it's fitness related and they're trying to keep him fresh, even he doesn't start, so it's not as necessary, I would assume. Maybe the sports scientist of said sign, I don't know. But based on actual performance, who. Who won that pitch? Of the 11 that started and the what five? Who came off the bench? Whoever came, however many came off the bench, but can anyone say they played better than Elliot? The 4. The 45 minutes that he gave us the first half? Elliot was arguably the best player on the pitch. Endo didn't have a good game today. Jones didn't play that great. Nunez was not very good overall. I love Nunez, but that Was not a great Nunez game. Sim cast was poor. Virgil didn't do anything wrong really, can I say? Was kind of a bit wayward for the second goal, but it's not too deep. The space between him and Gomez was kind of crazy for that, but I didn't know it's Gomez play. Overly bad. Mccallister didn't have one of his best games, but it was kind of like a 5.5 out of ten. Gakpo played one of his better games in the past couple of months. No one played better than Elliot off the bench. Robertson had a good appearance off the bench. No one else really made a difference. I can't fathom why Elliot came off. I understand seller comes on, but based off of the last couple of games from suburbs like to come on off the bench. He was not good against United. Respectfully, I don't want to rag on these players too tough because they're all human and we all make mistakes, but like suburbs lie against United does not warrant him coming off the bench to make a difference today. Because the only difference he made in that game was negative with the decision making and we saw it again today. The third goal. The only player on that pitch you can actually be that third goal for Atlanta to is suburbs lie. Terrible, terrible pass back to. Can I say. Completely gives the ball away and then doesn't really sprint back in transition. And then is late to react to the rebound, which then causes to go like there. There was like 2 or 3 different times he could have avoided that goal and that was kinda him. I can't imagine what Elliot came off the sub would have been. Jones off, Salah on, push Elliot into midfield, put him on the right, leap, put my callister on the left and we vibe like that. I don't know why he came off.",

He's already won it, we don't really need to debate that he's won it. But Farker, I can agree with this. Rosinia's in there. Manager of the season. A team that should be comfortably within that top six in my opinion. They're gonna miss the playoffs. You could have even given it to Maresca, you know. Leicester probably gonna go in the league after that bit of a shake. But the one that's missed out, and it is fucking criminal, is Marty Sithwenters. The job he's done at QPR is nothing short of fucking phenomenal. It wouldn't have won it because it's gonna be Mckenna, and deservedly so, but Marty Sifwensis should be on that list over Liam Rosinia. Nothing you can say changes my mind. I don't think you can massively argue with any of these smodics. Has to win it. A couple of options who could have been included. I think Jack Clark's had a good year, 15 goals. I think he's got um. Just some land have been shit out. That's probably what's taking him out of it, but. So Blackburn and then Leaf, Davis, Ipswich. Really, really good year. He's not nearly. Something like 20 assists or something like mad. It might not be that high, but it's really high. Uh, smart Excel for me. Has to win player of the year. Somerville will go play in the Premier League next year even if Leeds don't. And Jews Brighols been massive for Leicester so can't really argue with that. Now this. To be fair you can probably rule out the two on the right hand side. What Archie Grey has done this season is nothing short of phenomenal. The lad is 17. At the start of the year he was barely 17 I think. But what he has done this season, looking as accomplished and as assured and everything that he has looked, he is going right to the very top. He will be in the England squad within the next 2 years and if Leeds don't go up they could see some serious money come from in the summer. He's gonna be a fucking top player. If there's anyone that you think should be up for these awards let me know in the comments.",

It was reported yesterday that a sequel series to Blue Mountain State is in the works. Alan Richson, Darren Brooks, and Crystal Monoroll all expected to reprise their roles. Young kids out there have no idea how much Blue Mountain State was like a phenomenon, a staple in the 2010. So much so the people were upset it only got three seasons. It was raunchy, it was over the top, and a hell of a lot of fun. Alan Richardson's kind of a big deal nowadays for his role in the hit show Reacher and his most recent role in Fast X. But the real ones know him as playing one of the greatest characters in TV history in Thad Castle. And the fact that this man is said to reprise his role makes me so fucking happy. Let me see the condom you plan on putting on my quarterback's weenie. I'm sorry. Oh, my god. Yes! Holy shit. Just put a baby in me, please. Oh, I don't know. I'm in love with you. Oh, good. We have a really great life together. Sip it, psycho. Find another famous person's life to ruin. Get out! Get out of my house! So, yeah, this probably gonna suck, as most reboots do. Yeah, but is there a slimmer of me that's hopeful and a little bit excited? Fuck, yeah!",

I'm gutted. I am absolutely gutted. You know what we're building at the moment. I thought he would be here for another couple of years, the way the team is going. After everything that happened last season, people are saying he doesn't have it anymore. He's shown the season that he has, but for him, this is the end of the roads. And I. I'm worried about where.

It looks something like this. This is all wrong. I shouldn't be here. I should be at work slaving away for my retirement and paying my bills. How dare you rob me from getting old! The illnesses I accommodated over the years, my utility bills and everything else. You've stolen my dreams of growing old in the nursing home. And now I don't have to run young and healthy until I'm 15 years old. But I only planned for 75. And I've planned everything out. I even have at least of diseases ready. You've already invited everyone. This is your creative society. I hear about it from every TikTok account. I'm lucky. I am conscious individual. But others are not. They want everything the Creative Society offers. And people like me, they understand what we're going to lose. Crisis, power. See? Wars and violence and boring life. Mark my words, Creative Society advocates. All our eyes will be on you and your actions. And if you go through with your plans, they will never forgive you.

They'd say the wrong school. Have some attention to detail to you, and make sure you're doing things the right way. If you're trying to get recruited, make sure that you're putting yourself out there, reaching out to coaches. I mean, I really did find recruits from kids Dming.

If he's don't know someone and Lou. And are both significantly better away from home than they are at home. And we have managed to win at home, which basically means we should go through now. A lot of people said if someone wins at home, they've done it. We have one at home. Wait, I thought there's nothing stopping us now. We're actually a game away from the player final. 2 from the Premier League. But my god, what an atmosphere. Party, atmosphere from minute one. Absolute limbs. And if you don't know, I broke my arm only a couple weeks ago and it took a batter in a day. It was actually in an arm wrestle, exactly the way Tom Garrett did it. And I've had an operation, but I was in agony after that first goal. I cannot lie up. Accidentally punched down and my arm, honestly. But it was worth it, every second of it. I'm Just so excited. But my god, some of the players on that pitch. If he's watching a Pierre in the midfield it is the reincarnation of Ya ya Tori. I'm a DLO. One of the best players I've ever seen in the Sunland Show. Patti Roberts genuinely could be 100 men and score. He is. I'm just so excited, as you can tell. I don't really know what else to say. I can't really analyze this game very much cause the only thing I can think of is with one. And we're going to Kennelworth Road with the 2 one lead. There is nothing stopping us now.
