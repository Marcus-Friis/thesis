    "voice_to_text": "It\u2019s also too hot for planes. Yes, that is a thing we have to deal with. And today we learned of another new thing we have to worry about: Life-threatening air turbulence. Today, one person passed away and several were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight hit a really bad air pocket on a trip from London to Singapore. Such incidents are rare, but clear air turbulence, which is when out of nowhere in the clear blue sky your plane suddenly starts acting like a mechanical bull, is on the rise. One recent study found that it had increased 50% over the North Atlantic in the past 40 years. Could climate change be to blame? Possibly. It could be making the jet stream more unstable. But the important thing to know is that this is a risk and that there is a simple solution for dealing with it. Just keep your seatbelt fastened even when the fastened seatbelt light isn't lit.",

    "voice_to_text": "Article that said that Egypt is deploying their military to the border because tensions are rising. So, yes, this is a sad state of affairs, but it's probably a little bit more complicated than we're giving them credit for. I'm gonna explain why by talking about Jordan first. Now, you might have seen this wimpy picture where king of Jordan was looking a little bit sheepish sitting behind Biden as he was giving a speech. But there is a reason for that. Because Jordan has dependency in Israel. This strip of water here is basically the most important piece of water for Jordan, because The Jordanian River, via the Jordanian Dam, is actually controlled by Israel. And not only is it a river that, how about bears the name of Jordan, more importantly, it's the river that is then desalinated by Israel and then sold back to Jordan as fresh water for drinking. That's right. Israel is capturing the water from the Jordanian river and then sell it back to Jordan. This is broadly a colonial problem, because at the end of the day, the resources actually belong to Jordan. Technically speaking, at least half of them do. But instead of splitting 50 50, they took all of it from desalinator and then sell it back to Jordan as part of a water for energy agreement. Because the Jordanian desert is an ideal place to place solar panels, and that creates electricity which is then exported back to Israel. Now, Egypt's problem is actually very similar, because they also depend on Israel to keep the peace around what is basically the Suez Canal. Now, the problem, of course, is a part of this colonialist war. I sent this invasion seems to be that Israel wants to create a second canal that it has full control over that basically more or less goes straight through the, uh, god of Peninsula. As both countries are aware of what's happening with climate change, especially since they've been suffering from some of it, they are very aware they can't lose something as crucial to human life as water, because as those areas heat up and less and less freshwater is about, dehydration is a very real problem that can happen in much shorter order than before with many more people. So you can sort of understand the predicament he is in. And unfortunately, what's happening now is basically a political point is to say, well, yes, we are ready to stand up our troops basically when the job is done, just to try and save face. But you tell by his there's no saving it.",

They have been coming back every year now for four years, doing the same thing, attacking the boats and sinking a couple ships, but generally putting on hundreds of, not thousands of dollars worth of damages to these. To these boats. They were like, climate change will take it into our own hands or fence. They also go on to say that they believe that the older generations are now taking the younger generations out to this area every year and teaching them to attack the boats, which I fully believe, because that's honestly something that orcas and many whales do as they teach their young how to hunt. This is my favorite animal. Amazing.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I am stitching this specific clip from The Ocean Cleanup because I think it really hinges into a lot of my world view but also I just love the work that they do and I think it's really helpful account to follow um if you're someone who is like following all the different climate crises happening at the same time I like hear that saying all the time \u201clook for the helpers\u201d and I think this account is a really good example of helpers like the people who are out there and actively doing things to undo some of the horrible things that humans have done to this planet but on a more broad sense like I also was having a conversation with a friend this past week about like nihilism and about the sort of arc of freedom in this country and the reactionary way that kind of both sides of our political divide react to all of those things um and how it sort of hinges into my own world view and I think we all know that quote that like the arc of humanity bends towards freedom (okay barely got that right*) but at the same time I also think it's sort of important to understand especially in a political sense um while we're on the precipice of this next election and there are plenty of people who are very rightfully not interested in either side of the divide to kind of have a broader conversation I think about the way in which that affects both our day to day lives and how things happen at a more macro level I just feel as though it really is a great breeding ground for apathy to fall into that sort of space of our slowly backsliding into fascism and we're no longer going to have democracy in this country and I know that I sit in a really privileged position as a white cis-male so I just want to like caveat that and obviously I can't speak to having not experienced a lot of the atrocities that like black and brown folks feel in this country um at most I can speak to the sort of LGBT struggle having live through part of that but at the worst of it being like fighting for marriage Equality which is nothing like fighting for our lives during the AIDS crisis which predates me and then I think a lot of the horrible things that like our trans Brethren are going through today and being systematically and legally eliminated in as many ways as possible but again sort of saying in a macro level the way I was talking about it with my friend was that the way this country tends to work is that at the pendulum swing we generally have two terms of a democratic president and then two terms of a Republican president and usually all of the progressive stuff that happens during that democratic presidency has a sort of backswing that happens in the following eight years that said I don't think that the pendulum just goes back and forth I do believe that while that pendulum sort of goes back and forth it also moves forward so every time we do have that pendulum swing I feel as though we make maybe small bits of ground up in that time and taking it to an even more broad like worldview sense I don't think that I'm someone who's like a super optimist I'm definitely a realist but at the same time there's a part of me that still has this deep belief in the sort of indominable side of the human spirit so I remember during covid there would be all these news reports that would come out and say oh this is gonna be going on for another 7 years this is gonna go on for 20 years this is gonna affect 30 generations of humans and while that is certainly potentially true and I am not talking about long covid and the reverting effects it's had on us never mind the mental effects it's had on us and children's development and all of that but it kind of brings me back to this original clip from The Ocean Cleanup because there is just something in me that believes in the resiliency of the human mind and human creativity that we have generally found ways to overcome most challenges that have come our way so I'm just not someone who's going to sit here and believe that there's not going to be some amazing advancement in science at some point in my lifetime where we learn how to refreeze the polar ice caps or we learn how to build machines that help us to clean up the ocean from all that's been polluted into it and you can absolutely call that like a polyana worldview but I think that there's a way to acknowledge thr backsliding into fascism or the loss of democracy and everything without it becoming this histrionic sort of reaction that I think again breeds nihilism and then also apathy for most people and I think apathy is the opposite of what we need when we need ingenuity and creativity to fight some of these battles",

    "voice_to_text": "What does \"native adjacent\" mean? Andy's idea of \"native adjacent\" plants is an interesting one because it gets at this idea that what makes a native plant might not be so black and white. Over the last four months, I've been writing this paper about the usefulness of native plants as they face the problems posed by climate change. And in the paper I talk a lot about what the definition of a native plant is. The main factor we often talk about when defining what makes a plant native is geographical proximity. So is it native to your city, your county, your state, your country, your continent? How do you define what region is close enough to make that plant native? And while geographic proximity is useful, it has its limitations. Take for example, if I say that all plants within 10 km are native, well, I go 10 km to the top of the nearest mountain, are those plants really native to where I am here? Geographically maybe, but climatically, not really. While nativity maps are useful to an extent, they're not gonna show you the biomes or the habitats that these plants are native to. And if we add climate change into the mix, those biomes and habitats are currently changing and are going to continue changing into the future. So what does that mean for our definition of a native plant? A point that I make my paper is that, in this era of climate change, the definition of a native plant shouldn't just take into account geographic proximity or climactic conditions, but also the benefits that these plants have for native fauna. Because if we're planting native plants solely based on their historical region of nativity, what good is it if they can't survive the climactic conditions of the future? They can't benefit the local fauna if they can't survive. This is an idea that I found in this research paper from the university of Lausanne that talks about tree planting as it relates to climate change. The paper is in French, but I will break it down for you because it's super interesting. The researchers used climate modeling to predict the climate in Lausanne in 2070 and then rated a list of 110 trees. These 110 trees from around the world were rated according to how well they would be adapted to this predicted future climate. Trees best adapted to the predicted climate received a score of one, and then the trees that were less and less adapted to that predicted climate received scores of 2, 3, or 4 being the worst. But the researchers didn't just stop at looking at the adaptability of these trees to the future climate; they also took into consideration the potential for supporting local biodiversity. Biodiversity potential was calculated mainly from two factors: geographic deviation and phylogenetic deviation. I'll explain what that means. We've already kind of discussed the geographic deviation \u2014 basically, the plants that are found in this area in this close region here in Switzerland are considered to have a low geographic deviation because they're from the area. Trees found on the European continent, but not necessarily in this local area, are considered to have a medium geographic deviation. And then trees found on another continent are considered to have a high geographic deviation. The idea is that the area that a tree is native to, the closer that is to here in Switzerland, the more likely that that tree would be able to support the local wildlife. So a tree from Italy is probably more likely to support wildlife here in Switzerland than a tree from Japan. The second factor that the researchers taken to account for this biodiversity potential is the phylogenetic deviation. Phylogenetic is talking about genes, DNA, how closely things are related. So we're talking about family. The closer two plants are related, the less phylogenetic deviation there is. So if we take maple trees as an example, maybe we already have a species of maple tree here in Switzerland, and we're considering planting a species of maple tree that comes from Japan. Geographically speaking, that's a long ways off. But genetically speaking, that maple tree is a cousin. So the wildlife here might still be able to take advantage of that Japanese maple tree because they're genetically related. They're family, they're cousins. The closer these two plants are related, the less phylogenetic deviation there is, the more biodiversity potential there is. And these are all important things to consider because, as the researchers point out, some of the trees that are the best adapted for this future 2070 climate, they don't have very much biodiversity potential. However, some of the trees down here in the second place category, even though they may not be the best adapted to the future climate, they do have a pretty good biodiversity potential. This is why, in these conversations around planting native plants, I think it's really important to consider some of these native adjacents, as Andy calls them, because what might be native adjacent today could be the perfect native plant tomorrow.",

    "voice_to_text": "Something really, really strange is happening in our oceans, and the wildlife is clearly reflecting that. Groups of whales have been coming together before beaching and unaliving themselves, and scientists have no clue why. This specific group was located near Australia, and the general Assumption was that they may have just wandered too close to shore by accident. But the exact same thing happened near Taylor's Bay. And according to the locals who were trying to help, the whales and dolphins sounded like they were screaming for help. Check it out real quick. First stranded before two PM yesterday at the rocky beach in Taylors Bay. They were screaming. It is probably the thing that's stopping me from sleeping, because you can hear the screaming and your ears. Um, they were making more than a noise. They were really yelling out for help. And even after the locals and rescue teams help the wells back into the water, they rebeach themselves further down the coast, almost as if they refused to go deeper into the ocean. Over in the beach in Oregon, a female anglerfish washed up, which is really strange. We consider that they live two to three thousand feet deep. And with the huge anomaly that we were initially told was a glitch coming back, people's speculation is starting to grow and theories are starting to circulate. I touched on the first theory that states that very large creatures, or a very large creature, possibly Leviathan, has entered Our oceans ecosystems, eating the wildlife and scaring them as well. But there's a second theory stating that some sort of frequency device is being used or tested, heating up the oceans and scaring the wildlife. Leave a like. Let me know what you think.",

A lot of people think of the internet as just being in the cloud. Really, it is taking up this huge space of these gigantic computers, which are data centers. In Northern Virginia, we have over 300 data centers. There's around 100 million square feet. And they use a lot of energy. Artificial intelligence requires servers to run much hotter. Water cooling will be necessary. And where will that water come from? One chat GPT request, for example, that's the equivalent of pouring out a bottle of water and powering a light bulb for 15 minutes. You multiply that times billions of requests, you can start to see the cumulative impacts. AI is driving the need for additional power to meet this demand at an unsustainable rate. Scale of the energy use is 20, 30, 40 times more or square foot than anything else that we familiar with. Diesel generators are the backup power for AI applications or any data center application. More fossil fuel emitting infrastructure that historically and currently impacts low income communities and people of color. We're contemplating a tripling of the entire energy infrastructure that we have today. And the effect on the average taxpayer, the doubling of their utility bills. Everything that's needed to support this industry is paid for by the rate payers as a whole, which is you, me, it's everybody. The Subsidize are the richest corporations in the world.

Now, the governor says the Bill, and I quote here, is restoring sanity in our approach to energy. End quote.

He says it\u2019s all to protect American jobs from China\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d on trading practices. But will it actually change much? #ElectricCars #ElectricVehicles #US #America #JoeBiden #China #Channel4News #C4News",
    "voice_to_text": "President Biden is adding a huge tax hike on imported Chinese vehicles from 25% to 100%. In fact, he's increasing border taxes on a whole range of Chinese green tech, like solar panels, semiconductors and lithium batteries. And it's all to protect American businesses from China's so called unfair trading practices. American workers are, I cannot work and I could beat anyone as long as the competition is fair. But for too long it hasn't been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across the whole range of industry. And when you make tactics like these, it's not competition, it's cheating. China has become a powerhouse for electric vehicle or EV manufacturing in recent years, especially from this company, BYD, which stands for build your dreams. It overtook Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest electric car seller last year, selling 3 million vehicles in one year. Why? Because they're cheap. In some cases, BYD cars are three times less expensive than American models, and Beijing wants to keep them growing. The Chinese government has invested billions in BYD. In Shenzhen, where the company is based, taxi companies can only use BYD cars. Elon Musk says if there weren't any trade barriers, Chinese electric cars could pretty much demolish most other companies in the world. In spite of all of these warnings, the US doesn't actually import that many electric cars from China. That's in part because Donald Trump introduced a 25% tariff when he was President effectively driving Chinese electric vehicles off American roads. So some people say Biden's announcement is just posturing, a symbolic move to gain voters in an election year. After all, lots of US car manufacturers are based in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Chinese government has called it typical political manipulation from Biden and has promised to retaliate.",

We are ascending to a pristine world,   are   ascending   We   are   ascending   to   a   pristine   world which is also known as New Earth,   is   also   known   as   New   Earth true earth, or better yet,   earth   or   better   yet the organic universe.   organic   universe That world that we are stepping into is facilitated by a solar flash.   world   that   we   are   stepping   into   is   facilitated   by   a   solar   flash When we have solar flares like we are right now,   we   have   solar   flares   like   we   are   right   now what we're having are many practice rounds for our Ascension   we're   having   are   many   practice   rounds   for   our   Ascension and it's beginning to show us exactly that clearing that takes place   it's   beginning   to   show   us   exactly   that   clearing   that   takes   place large scale at Ascension.   scale   at   Ascension We're starting to see it. Hmm.   starting   to   see   it   Hmm Relatively small scale now,   small   scale   now but it's building and it's very tangible.   it's   building   and   it's   very   tangible And that is clarity is starting to come.   that   is   clarity   is   starting   to   come It's kind of like, this is the analogy I wanna give you.   kind   of   like   this   is   the   analogy   I   wanna   give   you It's kinda like we've got a whole lot of little sky elves   kinda   like   we've   got   a   whole   lot   of   little   sky   elves and they're cleaning up all of the particles of debris in the sky.   they're   cleaning   up   all   of   the   particles   of   debris   in   the   sky They're cleaning up all of the pollutants   cleaning   up   all   of   the   pollutants because it's beginning to dissolve.   it's   beginning   to   dissolve So not literally, guys,   not   literally   guys that's just metaphorically what it feels like.   just   metaphorically   what   it   feels   like We are experiencing a clarification and a purification.   are   experiencing   a   clarification   and   a   purification The light That's coming in is doing that.   light   That's   coming   in   is   doing   that It's clearing out the debris of the false matrix.   clearing   out   the   debris   of   the   false   matrix And as it clears out the debris of the false matrix out there,   as   it   clears   out   the   debris   of   the   false   matrix   out   there it begins to do exactly the same thing at the body level.   begins   to   do   exactly   the   same   thing   at   the   body   level So it's okay for you to feel a little bit like you're detoxing.   it's   okay   for   you   to   feel   a   little   bit   like   you're   detoxing You can feel that instant clarity.   can   feel   that   instant   clarity But a lot of you are going to feel more like the movement of debris   a   lot   of   you   are   going   to   feel   more   like   the   movement   of   debris and the opening of the heart.   the   opening   of   the   heart And when the heart opens, it can feel very raw and it can feel very   when   the   heart   opens   it   can   feel   very   raw   and   it   can   feel   very almost like you're purging the grief   like   you're   purging   the   grief and everything that was once stuck there.   everything   that   was   once   stuck   there So let me know in the comments below.   let   me   know   in   the   comments   below Are you feeling the clarity that's coming in   you   feeling   the   clarity   that's   coming   in or are you feeling the purge?   are   you   feeling   the   purge Remember, if you are,   if   you   are it's not wrong and right. It's just if you're feeling the purge,   not   wrong   and   right   It's   just   if   you're   feeling   the   purge you making space for the clarity.   making   space   for   the   clarity And if you're feeling the clarity right now,   if   you're   feeling   the   clarity   right   now it means that the purge has already happened for you in some way,   means   that   the   purge   has   already   happened   for   you   in   some   way shape or form.

Porto Allegra, the capital, home to 3 million people, is in a desperate state. 160,000 are homeless. There is little or no drinking water, and five dams upstream of the city are close to bursting. Food is sparse and despair has set in. Looting for medicines, for food, for survival, is widespread. The ordeal looks set to continue. Three powerful storms will last the state in the coming week. According to meteorologist, new maps of the region will have to be drawn. These floods have changed Brazil forever.",

On top of this, He\u2019s been helping to secure oil deals with Petrofac for the Bahrain royal family worth billions.

Unsurprisingly it is propped up by billionaires such as the Koch brothers and those who \u2018tend to be richer than the average person and much more intelligent than the average person\u2019 He has been Legitimising climate denial since 2019 and making a fortune exploiting democracy. We refuse to sit back and allow the biggest culprits of the climate crisis to dictate the future of our planet and their dying industry.

Liam, how can we believe a word that you say when you are in the pocket of the people obfuscating the reality of the situation that we're in? The ICC, who are here today, have been unequivocal in the condemnation of new island gas rigs. Right? And yet you seem to be representing the interests of the people causing climate breakdown. Who do you work for, Liam? Do you work for us? Do you work for the people who've come here because they genuinely want to see a green transition? Or do you work for oily billionaires and their apologists? Cause your bank statement suggests the latter. Am I the mad one here? Am I the only person in the room who thinks that this man should not be cheering a sustainability conference?",

After some time of the machine being turned on and the temperatures rise, we also get natural gas made from plastic waste.

Inside each of those discs  are six of these leaves, oriented around in a circle, kinda like the slices of a pizza. The tree's circular leaves are filled with materials  that bind to carbon dioxide and pull it from the air. So zero emissions are not enough We will need negative emissions. Which means the removal of carbon  from the environment and their storage in some kind of reservoir. If we have enough negative emissions, we can counterbalance the emissions  that we are still producing and reduce the concentration of  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

It's transformed my life in so many ways that I just had to share with you. Let's start with my skin. I used to struggle with hormonal acne, eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. It felt like a never ending battle. But since adopting the carnival lifestyle, my skin has gone through a remarkable transformation. I now have this glowing, plump, and healthy complexion that I never thought was possible. It is like a complete 180 degree turn, and I could not be happier. Next up, let's talk about my body. I used to suffer from constant bloating and digestive issues. It was uncomfortable and frustrating, to say the least. But after making the switch to a carnivore diet, I've never felt better and leaner and stronger than ever before. And those pesky bloating problems, they're a thing of the past. Now let's get into something even more significant. This carnival lifestyle has actually cured my autoimmune disease. It's like a dream come true. I no longer have to live with the constant worry and discomfort of red, swollen, itchy, inflamed skin. I take zero medications now, and this is truly a testament to the power of this lifestyle. But wait, there's more. I've also experienced a remarkable boost in energy and mental sharpness. I used to have those midday crashes, so much brain fog. But now I Am on top of my game throughout the day. My focus and clarity and confidence have never been better, and I'm accomplishing more than I have ever before. There you have it folks, my incredible journey with one simple diet. Comment below with what changes you have noticed on the carnivore diet and drop a heart down below in the comments if you want free access to my steak and butter Gang support group and free forum.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's too hot for humans lately, but it's also too hot for planes. Yes, that is a thing we have to deal with now, and here's why. Plane might seem to stay in the air because of magic, but it's really just science. Air moves around a plane's wings and gives it lift. When the air is hot, its molecules move much faster. This makes the air less dense, and that means planes have a lot less lift, and it makes it harder for them to take off and stay in the air. So when it gets too hot, pilots and airlines have to make some hard choices. Maybe they toss passengers and luggage off the plane. Maybe they delay the flight until it gets cooler. Maybe they make you sit on the runway in a plane without air conditioning where you roast for hours. None of that is good. What it all adds up to is more delays. As if air travel needed more of those. Believe it or not, hot weather causes more flight delays than cold weather. And as the southern US experience for the past several weeks, global warming means the air just keeps getting hotter and hotter. Climate change was already making air travel worse by fueling more turbulence and extreme weather and changing the speed and direction of wind. Extreme heat is just another way. Will ruin your vacation. Will this be the thing that finally wakes more of us up to take action? And stop burning so much fossil fuel, I. Maybe we could even skip some plane trips. They're pretty awful these days anyway.",
