So I have a couple of questions at the end, but don't worry, it's not gonna be like, oh, was it really that bad? No, I believe you. Because, um, I've been hearing every single year that these big name conventions are fucking ridiculously bad. Personally, I think it's because we live in an age now where parasocial relationships are so prevalent, and I think COVID had something to do with it. I, I am, I'm not particularly sure because I've only been to two cons, and I'm doing, um, another one, um, next month. Um, but I do believe that the reason that connect again is just gone out the window completely is because parasocial relationships is. Is one of them, and people just don't seem to give a fuck anymore. That's what I've seen. I mean, again, I've only been to two cons and they've been kind of small. Um, but I, I think it's just people just don't give a fuck anymore and they just want to get their own selfishness out there. And I feel like some people kind of thrive on a power dynamic as well. Um, it's just my, um, thoughts, but that's just the way I see it. I haven't experienced anything of what you've experienced, but I've, and what others have experienced. But I do feel for those that have went through shit like that. So this is where the questions come in. This one's for you. How, uh, what was your most positive experience at a con? Because it just seems like there's a lot of negative press when it comes around cons over the last few years, and I kinda want people to be a bit more positive about their experiences. So what was your, um, most positive experience, uh, at a con? And the second question is, and this is to everyone that sees this video. Um, what things about connect, again, can you tell me, as someone who's only been a two cons, what about it again, can you tell me, what. Can you advise me on? Um, just shit like that, you know what I mean? Um, and what experiences have. Of other people had like that? Yeah. Just to put it out there, what experiences have you had at these cons? Um, you can tag us in the video, you can, uh, put a comment down, whatever. Um, I just wanna know people's experiences because it seems like cons are getting more negative press and more negative experiences are coming out of them. Um, it. It's just my own research, really, but yeah. I'm sorry that you've had a really bad time.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's got a fantastic community. One of the greatest examples that you may have seen recently on short form content was Heaven Studio, which was a custom Rhythm Heaven level maker. Okay, never mind. Nintendo shut it down four days ago. Okay, I guess I should talk about this if you're a fan like me of Rhythm Heaven levels. Heaven Studio is the open source, community LED program that is pushing the charge in the Rhythm Heaven community by creating a custom level maker that is built from the ground up. And I think to hear that Nintendo would put a takedown notice on this project is not very surprising. However, in Heaven Studios, they do believe this to be a false takedown. As in, basically a takedown troll is what we're assuming this is. But I'm not gonna tell you, the viewer, one way or another, what it is because I don't know. What I can do is at least read the information that Heaven Studio has shared on their Twitter our itch dot Io page. I suffered a copyright takedown. However, we have reason to believe that this is a copyright abuser and are working to slowly remedy the situation. And then since this tweet later this week, they posted that they have officially submitted an appeal. they go into a couple reasons why they're skeptical of the takedown. The only two cents I'll add to this is that Rhythm Heaven is not for sale on Any Nintendo platform right now. Not even as like a Switch Online or anything like that. Now listen, I completely understand the fan game rhetoric with especially Nintendo properties because Nintendo strikes down a lot of content. Honestly, the only way I feel Nintendo would care about Heaven Studio is if they're planning a rerelease or a new Rhythm Heaven game entirely. Which is a very sticky situation because as a Rhythm Heaven fan, I think any Rhythm Heaven fan would love to see a new game. You also would hate to see Nintendo just completely slip the rug under the community to do so? I feel like when it comes to Nintendo or the community, I would choose to side with the community. It is what it is. While the download is missing from H dot I O, you can still download Heaven Studio from the Get Hub page. I recommend downloading the nightly Bill to get the latest updates. And I'm still really looking forward to the honeydew release of Heaven Studio, which is gonna combine all the latest updates. Yeah, honestly I really didn't care about this. Nothing. But I felt it was necessary to kind of set the record a little bit straight. But what are your thoughts on the situation? Let me know in the comments.",

So did y'all read that? So a narrative is something that is narrated. The way that this person is describing narrative seems to be they want just the story to have a particular arc, objective, etc. No matter what way you look at it, the game's god narrative, the story is very clearly a descendant of Queen America. A tarnished. A nameless tarnished of no renowned, uh, spermed by the Grace of gold, returns to the lands between to claim the Elden ring, because that's your birthright as a tarnished. You were banished from the Elden, the lands between. Whenever Queen America fucking did all that shit. Um, and then you die and are returned. It's Fucking Valhalla, basically. And you then enter into a world that has been plunged into war. A five way war, I think, for maybe more ways, for centuries. Right. And there's all these. And all the demigods have had their own tails, which have LED them to this stalemate that they're a part of. You then become the thread that unravels this fabric of war by one by one, uh, claiming power, claiming shards of the Elden ring, and, uh, ending the war on your terms, becoming the Elden Lord. Right. Um, you do this via making friends, but also, um, exploring Finding relics of power. Um, and eventually your blacksmith friend forges you a weapon that can kill a god, which is what you've been going toward this entire time. Because to become l Lord, you have to burn the urge tree and kill the god inside. Um, and I mean, that's just surface level. Like, that's not even any extra lore about the lands between, how the lands between came. Came about. You could get all of that just from doing main boss fights and not reading items. So I don't even understand your point that, like, there's not a narrative. The narrative is you, as the main character, come in and finish this war that you did not start. Um, because you have the ability to do so by fucking ghost lady who gives you torrent, giving you the power to convert runes into strength. Like, all of these are very clear plot points along the way that form this narrative for you to become elven Lord. So, like, what's your. What's your point? Like, what is your point, really?",

    "voice_to_text": "you know black people no this is actually gonna be the second video I've recorded about this because the first video I've recorded was full of vocal fillers full of me kind of rambling on a little too much so I wanted to make a bit more concise of a video talking about this because a lot of people have claimed that this game is very historically inaccurate but they're complaining in the wrong places and I'm gonna show you how now the bulk of the conversation about whether this game is historically accurate or not which is a very thinly veiled way of saying why is there a black guy here uh is centered around this character right here this is Yasuke. Yasuke uh if you don't know or have very limited knowledge on him I want you to put aside any sort of preconceived notions you have right now and hear me out Yasuke was a mercenary from East Africa some would say either Mozambique or Sudan who was in the employ of jesuit missionaries when he first arrived in Japan after being in Japan he was made a samurai he was in Oda Nobunaga's court all this sort of thing a lot of the debate surrounding him is surrounding the fact that people think he wasn't the samurai for some reason which I couldn't understand why the man literally he wore armor marched into battle used you know a sword and a spear and all this shit he was afforded all of the luxuries and benefits of being a member of the samurai class despite the fact that he was a foreigner if that doesn't make him or samurai I don't know what will okay the bulk of the conversation has been focused on him when in fact it should be focused on the other protagonist and I find it very strange that all of the people complaining about historical accuracy and what not seem to leave Naoe out of the conversation when in fact she's technically more historically inaccurate than Yasuke is primarily because the fact that Yasuke is a real fucking person okay but Naoe is a little different now you saw from the last image I used and from this image right here that you know now is wearing this blue outfit with the hood and that's all well and good Shinobi wore blue in order to blend in with the night sky when they were on rooftops you know and they were very you know good at camouflage and disguise in that sort of thing but assassins clad and black running around murdering people calling themselves Shinobi is just not an accurate depiction of what actual Shinobi were like alright and Naoe is not a very accurate Shinobi one because she's a woman now I don't mean to sound sexist okay but Kunoichi female ninjas were very rare you'd think that they were common based on how common they seem to be we seen a lot of fictional depictions of them characters like uh the girls from dead are Alive or Yuffie Kisaragi  in Final Fantasy 7 but Kunoichi were not as common as you think now real Kunoichi like most Shinobi were experts at gathering intelligence right but Kunoichi right were also experts at infiltration by method of disguise because Kunoichi were women they would often disguise themselves as let's say sex workers or as travelling shrine maidens and priestesses that sort of thing in order to get wherever they need to be and not stand out because that is a central tenet of what ninjas did was not standing out so that they could collect as much enemy intelligence as they could and though kudoishi were real we do know that they existed they were not very common because of that they've been very heavily mythologized as all ninjas have but Kunoichi more so a lot of the people have been running around crying about historical accuracy and what not only do it when it pertains to Yasuke because Yasuke is black these people see a Japanese woman running around doing things that ninjas don't do and they don't see a problem with it because Naoe is Japanese Yasuke however is a black man who is a real person by the way and is a real samurai and they have to go ape shit it's a very unfortunate that I don't feel as though I should have to say this but don't listen to people raging on the internet don't listen to people who have accounts that were created like less than a week ago saying well I'm Japanese and I don't like Yasuke don't believe most of the hype you see about this a lot of people are making a very big deal about this game and it's probably gonna be super mediocre I don't know it's a Fucking Ubisoft game in 2,024 I don't have high expectations you know for it but despite that there really shouldn't be this big of a controversy but because it is a western game made by Westerners starring a black person it's gotta be a fucking discussion",

I have two thoughts on this, and the first is that saying that you can't feel empathy for a character unless there's some Superman god mode central focal point of the story and every single thing that's happening is incredibly telling on yourself. Holy shit. Secondly, to say that there's no way a from software game could could make somebody cry. I just want you to. I just want you to. Google. 15 seconds on Google. Type in dark souls lore video. You think body isn't gonna show up? Good thing one of the most popular from software creators doesn't have, I don't know, an entire series about how emotionally attached and how heartbreaking the Dark Souls series is. Just. I hate that on the internet these days, you could just have any, any person walk onto a podcast and talk about something like they're an authority on it when they can't even bring themselves to do 15 seconds of research. I'm not saying this dude has to like Elden Ring or the from soft games. He doesn't. But you know, don't come on here and be like, oh, but here's why they suck.

Secondly, you choose whether you wanna be a pirate marine, or you just wanna explore the world and do whatever the fuck you want. But the big twist is when you're out there, you can obviously choose to eat a devil fruit if you find one, or just continue as you are. But if you do eat that devil fruit, you're stuck. Whatever power you get completely changes your character, customises your build. It'd be really interesting, um, you know, and nobody would know what the devil fruits were. They wouldn't be labelled or anything. You just have to take a chance. Obviously, the goal of the end game. Find the one piece.",

    "voice_to_text": "I wanna address this specific point he made in this video because I think it's a really good point that a lot of people are glossing over and they shouldn't be because being a samurai is literally the exact opposite of being an assassin I've been watching nuance evaporate from the Assassin's Creed series for well over a decade now and I don't think they're gonna explore this theme in any serious way in Assassin's Creed Shadows but you know what game will that's right baby ghost of Tsushima the dichotomy of being a samurai while being an assassin is a main theme of this video game it's talked about it's explored it plays a significant part in the story and by the end it winds up having significant consequences for Jin Sakai and everyone around him not only that but the game alters the weather system based on whether you decide to play more like a samurai or like an assassin so if you play like a samurai the game tends to be more sunny and bright but if you play like an assassin it's always cloudy and raining and thundering the fact that it goes so far to explore this theme is one of the things that makes this video game so great because both playstyles are equally enjoyable and you can decide to do each one but there is kind of a consequence for being more of an assassin than a samurai that's the whole point and it pains me to say that I don't think Ubisoft is gonna delve into this issue in any serious way they're just gonna gloss it over like they gloss a lot of stuff over in these games and they're gonna hope that the simple delivery of an Assassin's Creed game in this particular time period in this particular place will be enough to carry it over the finish line so I would say instead of waiting until November 15th to buy the mediocre Assassin's Creed game that we all know shadows is going to be that you go out and you buy ghost of Tsushima now because it's out on PS five and on PS four and on PC and I can guarantee you it's gonna be a better game and it's gonna be made with more love than Ubisoft has made any game since Assassin's Creed 2",

Persona 4 and 5 both got sequels. Persona 4 sequel comes in Persona 4 Arena and Persona 5 sequel comes in Persona 5 Strikers and Persona 5 Tactica. Persona 3, on the other hand, never got a sequel and all we got was a little snippet of what could be because of Persona 4 Arena. Again, here comes the spoilers if you not play Persona 3. Well, I would suggest clicking off the end of Persona 3. The main character dies, but doesn't die. He sacrifices his soul to be able to seal away Nick's to prevent the end of the world. And without his soul, without his spirit, his body dies. The answer is basically the other characters in the party coming to terms with the fact that they cannot save him, that he is destined to become the seal for Nicks, because if they bring him out of that, then Nicks will come back in persona for Arena. Specifically Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Elizabeth is one of the main characters in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and she's on a journey to be able to save the main character from his fate. Because due to the events of Persona 3, specifically Persona 3 F E S. And Persona 3 Reload, Elizabeth was able to become in touch with humanity and become to show Affection towards the main character and because of that she wants to save him. She had joined the events of Persona 4 Arena Ultimates in hopes of being able to do just that, but was not able to, so she continues to search for her answer to be able to save him. Thus were left with an open plot hole that is not finished. Give me a Persona 3 sequel.",

    "voice_to_text": "I've waited to see what the, how the MUD, how far the discourse was gonna get for Assassin's Creed Shadow before giving my opinion. I'm in the middle. I really am in the middle because I've heard both sides of the argument, and I'm gonna give off my initial impressions. I heard the leaks way before they ever dropped the trailer. But even when I heard the leaks, I was like, is it gonna be us again or is it gonna be another character? Are they gonna make a new character? Like, that was my initial, like, mindset. But freaking it was the idea that, um. I didn't know it was gonna be Yasuki. The fact that it is Yasuki, I actually don't mind it. And I think the way, based off he looks in that trailer, he looks dope. And it's a good idea to actually separate the two systems, similar to how syndicate at it. We get the warrior fantasy, which you're gonna get with Yasuke as samurai. We get that, gonna get the ninja fantasy with. I'm gonna butcher her name again. Nawi. Nawi, Nawi. You're gonna get the Shinobi fantasy with her. However, there's the problem a little bit, because if it was anybody else writing the story, if it was rocksteady writing the story, Sucker Punch Rocky while I'm writing the story, even Rockstar writing the story, I would have loved it. Cause I. I have a feeling they won't ruin the characters. I think They'll make them great. If Assassin's Creed Shadow would have come out in any other air age, people would be loving this game. They would have been so hyped to be playing as a Black Samurai. Cause, and yes, I know people are saying oh well, he maybe wasn't really a samurai. He was given the name of retainer. And samurai didn't just mean fighting. Samurai means servant. I hope you most of you know, and I love samurai culture, but not everybody who got was given the sword and all that stuff. Got to be a samurai in combat and all that stuff. And also so long as Yasuki doesn't let anybody live that he kills while he's playing. Also, it's fiction, doesn't really matter. But you know, as long as he doesn't have any kill, you know, there's no saying that he technically couldn't have killed these people, but regardless of the point, that's not the problem. The problem is it's Ubisoft. That's the problem people are having with it. They're saying it's Ubisoft, we don't trust this. We can't trust it because of pandering, because of ESG, because of this new D I. Whatever it is, people don't trust it, people don't like it. But we'll have to wait and see. Will they butcher Yasuke's character? I hope not. Well, now we actually live up to the female samurai fantasy. Cause yes, there is a huge difference between a male samurai of that time and a female Samurai we'll just have to wait and see cause we only got one trailer. We have no real only of few screenshots and no gameplay. So I think the discourse should wait until we learn more.",

    "voice_to_text": "what are we doing here like we gonna really talk about this is what feudal Japan was like it's a story about a black guy and a girl I find it absolutely hilarious that a lot of people try to hide their bigotry behind the facade of logic or uh some sort of critical thinking because this new Assassin's Creed game has Yasuke the first and only Black Samurai and then uh a story original character I forgot what her name was but there's a black man and a Japanese woman who are at the forefront of the story and people are complaining they're like they're just doing this for Bounty Point little do they know all they gotta do is do a Google search and they'll know that Yasuke is a very very prominent historical character in feudal Japan he was quite literally a retainer for Oda Nobunaga who's like one of the most powerful lords in Japan he was like the the people call him like the uniter of Japan or whatever the fact that a lot of one non Asian non Japanese people are very critical about the story and telling Japanese people like this is the represent representation you deserve as if there's not a Japanese woman at the forefront 1 Japanese women in future Japan the fact that we have a Japanese woman at the forefront just means we're telling a story that's gonna be like conflicting with uh societal standards just within the society itself and on top of that we know this is just within the system because we have two minorities within the system that's operated by mainly Japanese men so we're gonna have that representation on both sides so people making this argument doesn't make any sense cause one thing that's known bigotry doesn't make sense so people tryna use logic to justify their bigotry you're gonna sound dumb because we literally have poindexters literally common news like well he technically wasn't a samurai he was a retainers like bro look up what the fuck a retainer is and what they do and the people who are like yeah oh having go having a girl at the forefront is not really accurate it's like bro look up the Ona musha look up look up Lily anything there's like there's so many things talking about female warriors in Japanese history you're just a big adult we are literally talking about a video game when you're just some random dude in fucking I don't know Idaho sitting in the office and you're just logging in and going back in time and just interacting with these people who are fighting like Templar Knights who have like sorcery and shit but you're mad cause the main character in the new game is a black man and a Japanese woman based in feudal Japan and one of the guys is a fucking famous retainer of one of the most popular fucking rulers in Japanese history come on dog you're just a bigot don't try to hide behind the logic stuff cause you sound dumb just say what's on your mind and be upfront about it cause you sound really really dumb y'all gotta do better bro for real",

    "voice_to_text": "I watched the YouTube video and when these statements were made, I got annoyed.  Because first of all, all of this is fake. It's a story.  It might be based in history, but it's made up. Now, the other thing that bothered me,  is he's saying like, \"There's no real situation where a woman  can beat up three guys in an alley.\" Except maybe, if that woman is trained  to deal with multiple combatants like, I don't know, an Assassin. Especially if those multiple combatants are historically, if the other games are to go off of, not going to be that well trained. Strength does not matter if you can't apply it in a meaningful way. And if you're not trained, you're not gonna be able to apply strength in a meaningful way. Thirdly, these are games where we fight literal gods and look for magic items from the garden of Eden. I don't understand why suddenly people are asking for realism. Also, If you put a man in a 3 on 1 fight, even he's gonna have trouble. Gender has nothing to do with it. like It has more to do with the fact that  three guys are ganging up on one person. Anyone's gonna have trouble with that. Except maybe, I don't know, if they're trained to deal with it. Now, You might say, \"That's what I meant. Anybody would have trouble.\" No, that's not what you meant. Because if that's what you meant, You wouldn't have spent the next few minutes of your video talking about how biology means that men are stronger than women. \"It's biologically a fact.\" You meant that only women would have this trouble, because that's the direction you took with it. I don't know where the sexism came from, maybe it's just rage bait. Maybe you're just trying to farm. Because I know you like to farm. But come on, man. You know that this is kind of disingenuous.",

I might as well make this video real quick. Why the fuck are people listening to Osmal with the shit? Generally I have heard nothing but bad takes from this dude. Not only he has been saying some sexist shit for a long time now, but the dude generally lives in shit. Have you seen his place? He Learned how like Roach crawl on him during a live. I always thought he's the homeless version of Penguin Zero. Like genuinely I don't understand how this guy gotten popular in the first place. Is it just me? I just don't fucking get it. This man, no joke said the idea of a black samurai is the same as a female assassin. It's stupid. Does this guy know about Konoichi's existing in the 16th century? That this game is based upon their real life female assassins in Japan? Like does the guy think that Konuigi is just a term came from Naruto? That just mean concern how he thinks other series like Naruto. But anyways, his reason why it's stupid in his eyes because he can never picture a woman taking on three minute once. Even though in the trailer has shown you that the woman in question that he's talking about couldn't take on three minute once. With brute force. Hence why she is an assassin. She takes them out still fully. And even then it's fucking fiction. Who the fuck cares? So focusing on the war on the real issues when it comes to Assassin's Creed Shadow game. You know, ridiculous pricing when it comes to deluxe editions and hiding certain missions behind a paywall. The real issues that the main character is black and the other characters are female assassin even though there are characters based off of real life. Fucking people. Anyone who's complaining about the main leads right now, you guys are losers. Okay, you. I'm sorry, but you guys are fucking losers.",

I didn't know racism and sexism got to be the funniest thing ever. Those are the only two things where it could be the most fictional game ever. It could be dragons, demons, warlords, anything you can imagine. But if there's a black person doing too much. Ah, you're trying to be woke, bro. They would never do that. It's not realistic. Same thing with women. It is hilarious how far you would go. Those are the only lines you can draw. You can have anything you want. Make it black. And don't make it a woman. I dare you. That's how these people act. There's just no realism, man. There's no realism anymore, bro. A woman could never take down three armed men. What are you talking about? That could never work. Like, what? What? And then my favorite line ever that they always say is, bro, I'm just trying to have an escape from reality. Having black people and women makes you escape from reality? You don't wanna see them no more? That's too much for you? I'm sick of seeing these people in real life, man. I need an escape. Why are they here? That's how y'all sound. You know how crazy that is?",

Like, and all honestly, the only reason why this bullshit is a controversy is just cause fucking Yasuke is black. Like everyone, everyone knows, everyone's doing the whole while hmm. I feels a white guy or people are complaining and it's just. It's stupid. It's stupid in all honesty. Like, they sit here and say all Assassin's Creed is about historical accuracies. That shit hasn't fucking been about historical accuracies. Like you play as like fucking Viking and you interact with Odin and shit. You're telling me this is about historical accuracy? Like, in all honesty, the only reason why it's a problem is cause fucking Yasuke is black. Dude worked under the great unifier of Japan, so it's not like he wasn't a real person. And on top of that, you know what I mean? It doesn't. It doesn't matter. It's a fucking Assassin's Creed game. People have been shitting on Assassin's Creed games for fucking god knows since when. Since the fucking series itself has gone down. Downhill? This has nothing to do with what I think the game is gonna. You know, how it's gonna do in sales. Cause people are gonna fucking complain. Especially the shitty keyboard warriors on fucking Twitter. But like damn, it's just cause the dude's black. Like if it was a white guy, everyone, no one would fucking bat an eye in All honesty, like. But you have the people sitting here trying to downplay his role in history. You have people trying to just be racist and then they use the whole, oh, well, um, black people, they call it, they. They call it, um, a cultural appropriation as soon as that someone wraps or has braided hair. But when, when they're inserted into any type of other culture, it's, it's, it's not. It's okay. Like, you have the dudes fucking saying shit like that when they know damn well most black culture is fucking consumed practically everywhere and that really only people with fucking Twitter fingers give that much of a shit about someone having crappy ass braids. I guess just stupid people need to fucking do better and not cry over this bullshit cause it's just a black person in fucking video game. Get the fuck over it. We exist. We've always existed. Fucking Africans have been in Japan. It's been documented. There's all fucking. People are everywhere. People spread everywhere like it doesn't fucking matter.",

Do you have any idea how much money I've saved by gaming? Now, I'm gonna show you my hours played on the new FIFA. Yeah, 352 hours. Now, some of you might call me unique, but hear me out. Let's say every time you go out with the boys, yeah, you spend around 15, 20 pound minimum in this economy. You go restaurant, you might go Sheesh, Lounge to do whatever you man doing it. Now, let's say you multiply the amount you'd spend versus the amount of hours I've spent on this game. That total to \u00a37,040. Now, you can call gaming childish all you want, yeah, but I've managed to save seven grand alone from playing FIFA. Just FIFA this year. I'm not even accounting for any other games that I played. So when you think about, in an economy where people are already struggling for money, having a console, staying home and just playing games is literally saving you money. So I will never understand the approach. Oh, if you're over 25, you need to stop gaming. The bro. Dumbest thing I've ever heard.",

The fact that people are, like, trying to get on Ubisoft for being historically inaccurate, even though this is probably the most accurate they've ever been so far is very strange to me. On top of the fact that, um, people just wanna be haters. Like, that's. That's pretty much it. People just wanna be haters. I'mma tell you this, though. First off, the fact that you're able to play as two different main characters and that's, like, part of the story is already cool. The fact they have a black samurai, the first and only black samurai there has ever been, as one of the main characters is also awesome. So will I, probably playing this game. Yes. On top of that, although I know Ubisoft is famous for fucking things up, and the last, like, two or three Assassin's Creed have all been questionable. Let's just. Let's just leave it at that. They've been questionable. I'm probably still gonna play this one. Give it a try. We'll see how it goes. But man oh man, the fact this controversy over something that has, like, potential is very crazy to me, man.",

One is a Power Rangers MMO set in the world of Power Rangers. And everyone makes their own Power Ranger, regardless of whichever Power Rangers season or series it is or what era it is. You should make your own, uh, that's completely separate from anything we've seen before. Your own color, your own weapon, your own sword that can customize over time. Maybe some big bad is taking over the world, and all the Power Rangers that we know from all the TV shows have been defeated or captured. And it's up to the players, the new Rangers, to, you know, unite, do missions together, and stop this alien threat. No.2, a Marvel versus DC fighting game. Need I say more? And 3, an actual good sequel to the Jack and Daxter games. Why'd they stop? Why'd they stop? We need. We need more Jack and Daxter",

I have other hobbies, too, that some people would say I gotta grow up. Like, I build Gundam. And where is it? I build Lego and I collect Lego. When it comes to telling a person that because of their age, they should or shouldn't be doing something, it's a little rude. And because of that, that makes me just wanna game even more, you know? Um, I just. A few years ago, really, I got back into gaming. PC gaming, specifically. I was always a console gamer. And as you get older, you start a career and you make more money, and you're smarter with money than you were when you were a kid. Sometimes when you're a kid, you have no money. And you're able to afford the things that you couldn't afford when you were a kid, but you still have those same interests. So that means that as an adult, a married adult who owns my home and works and has a child, I'm gonna have some free time. So what am I supposed to do with that free time? Am I supposed to find something to do that I don't enjoy? Is that what you're saying? Like, just sit on my couch with my thumb up my ass? Is. Is. Is that what you're saying? You can't do yard work? Every day. Can't work on your car every day. The can't work 24 7. I mean, I guess you could, but that'll kill you. But we all have different interests and we have hobbies. And most of us, at some point throughout the day or throughout the week, will have downtime. And with that downtime, we're gonna do something that we enjoy. We're not just gonna sit around and do absolutely nothing. For me, that's building Gundam. Building and collecting Lego and gaming. I'm not gonna knock your hobbies because of your age or in general, unless it's something illegal. My hobbies aren't illegal to me. My hobbies are fun. So don't go around telling me that just because I'm over the age of 25 that I shouldn't be gaming. I mean, that's just one of the most ridiculous internet argument. That's the same internet argument as girls shouldn't be gamers. And in 2024, I can't believe it that still a thing, but it is. There are people out there that don't like girls that game, that don't think girls should be gamers. So get off your high horse and quit telling other people how to live their lives.

Yasuke may not have been part of the Japanese culture, but he was part of their history, and there isn't enough known about him to say that whatever journey he went on in Japan didn't happen. He's like, the perfect type of character to tell, again, a fish out of water story and at the exact same time, give us something that resembles what we would imagine somebody who became a samurai that was in Japanese to begin with would go through. And there's just so many interesting things that could happen to Yasuke, so many different avenues, stories to be told, and he honestly is far more interesting, in my opinion, than just a. Just a regular guy that is from Japan. And if you want that narrative, they've gave you a shinobi. They gave you a shinobi. I feel like if it was just a random African man that wasn't Yasuke, that would be where I would be okay drawing the line a little bit. Like, what? Who is this random guy? Why can't we just get it, you know, somebody that was there. But this guy's documented history. Like, Oda Nobunaga was so intrigued by this man, he. He made him a samurai retainer. He made. He made him a samurai retainer, and he definitely had him in combat. There is combat that has been documented. For Yasuke, the fact that everyone's trying to gloss over it. But again, like, we get both. Best of both worlds. We get fish out of water and. Which is a really interesting historical figure, and at the exact same time, we get a female shinobi, which. I mean, I give it to you, the probably aren't that many cases of documented female shinobi. But just because they're documented doesn't mean it didn't exist. And number two, I mean, there should no be. I highly doubt even if there were, even the males, they wouldn't be documented to begin with.",

You know, I was about to, like, freaking just, like, go against everything that he was saying in this video, but then I was like, wait a second, he's right. Like, I fought against or not fought, but argued against so many people who were like, oh, you should play more indie games, stop playing these mainstream games. No, I like these mainstream games just like I like indie games. You can like both. And then the whole console Wars thing. Like, people assume that because I have a bunch of PlayStation stuff, they assume that I don't like Xbox and I'm a PlayStation fanboy. Bitch. No, like, no, for your information, I'm an Xbox Game Pass partner. Hello? Stop making Assumption. And then the people who use playing on the hardest difficulty as a bragging right. Good for you. I'm glad that you were able to beat it on the difficulty that you know that you beat it on. Like, I don't have time to sit here and, like, perfectly master a souls born game. I don't have time for that. I got way too many things in my life to sit down and just play that one game over and over again. Instead, I'm gonna play games that I can play through relatively quickly and enjoy and have a good time. I don't like getting frustrated. I Don't think most people like getting frustrated, except you sadistic people who consider. The only thing I will say about his last comment regarding the female content creators and. And this is. This is just. This doesn't apply to all female content creators and all female gamers and all that stuff, because I have a lot of female content creator and gamer friends, so I don't put them in this category. But the only issue I have is the whole gamer girl mentality thing. Like, you. You market yourselves, and this is. This is going to the content creators. You Mark yourselves as, like, a gamer girl, and I. I understand that, right? I get it. You do it to get views and get people joining your streams and all that stuff. You get your Sims. Right, that. I understand that. But that. That it tends to make, like, a stereotype that a lot of people don't see past. And I. I don't like that. I don't. I don't agree with that. But you do you. I don't care. It's not gonna affect me none. But I'm just saying, like, it paints a bad image sometimes, because then other people and other men and all that stuff will look at female content creators who are gamers in that way, and they're not that way. So, yeah, other than that, you play whatever you want, you enjoy whatever you want. I don't care.",

You say that unity had a dual protagonist, which is wrong. You call Yasuke Yusuke. You call a shinobi a sonobi. Then you go on to say that Yasuke is one of the most well documented people in Japanese history. So how can they make a video game that has him as one of them playable characters? I've never seen somebody be more wrong in my life. Yasuke is up there with Shakespeare as one of the most least documented people in history. All we know about Yasuke is that he was a 6 foot black man that showed up on a ship in the mid 1600s. In that he later became became a sword bearer. That is all we know. Now, sure, they made Yasuke into a samurai for this game, but it's Ubisoft. Give them a little creative freedom. They created the Assassin's Creed games, they can change the profession of what Yasuke was.",

Uh,   Uh his fingers are moving, but they're not moving.   fingers   are   moving   but   they're   not   moving He's not aggressive. He's not jumping everywhere.   not   aggressive   He's   not   jumping   everywhere Here's another great example.   another   great   example This is an actual gaming competition.   is   an   actual   gaming   competition Those two guys are competing against each other and it's intense,   two   guys   are   competing   against   each   other   and   it's   intense as you can see. But notice how they are calm,   you   can   see   But   notice   how   they   are   calm chilled. Yeah,   Yeah they're playing hard against each other,   playing   hard   against   each   other but they're not jumping around.   they're   not   jumping   around They're not moving around.   not   moving   around This guy was about to score,   guy   was   about   to   score but notice it was just subtle.   notice   it   was   just   subtle Like, you know,   you   know he didn't jump around and do all theatrics.   didn't   jump   around   and   do   all   theatrics Very subtle, but very intense.   subtle   but   very   intense I'm sure on their set, their shooting set,   sure   on   their   set   their   shooting   set there's one or two gamers and they can easily point out that mmm guys,   one   or   two   gamers   and   they   can   easily   point   out   that   mmm   guys it's not that aggressive.   not   that   aggressive But I know it's cause they want to make it dramatic and to like   I   know   it's   cause   they   want   to   make   it   dramatic   and   to   like give that vibe of the action and the,   that   vibe   of   the   action   and   the you know, the intensity of the game.   know   the   intensity   of   the   game But yeah, I just pick it up.   yeah   I   just   pick   it   up",

She wasn't around for the boogeyman stories, but all she saw was the beginning of the game, where I lost my son. And then she saw, all the sudden, I have a chance to be back with them again.

    "voice_to_text": "Them are licensed to you, not sold. I've only been saying this forever. Physical media. Buy and support physical media. When you buy and support physical media, they will make more physical media. Generally speaking. I don't know if you notice this, but games that don't get physical releases are games that typically the company isn't sure that it's gonna sell well. Which is also kind of like a catch 22, because if it they did release it as a physical media, then people like me would be more inclined to buy it. But I get it. It does cost more to develop physical copies of games. But at the same time, never once have they decided to lower the price of digital games to say, hey, you know, it's cheaper if you buy it digitally. So what you're paying for a digital copy is the same amount that I'm paying for a physical copy, and I get to have the game. And before anybody says, oh, but you have the physical game, but it's not actually on there. No, it is. I've tested out every single one of my physical PS five games, a bunch of my PS four games, and guess what? The games are actually on here. That wasn't all the PS five games I have. I have a lot more than that. Now, granted, you'll be playing the game on the day one build if you don't update it, but it is playable. It is there. And how did I test this? Well, I disconnected my PS five from the internet and I installed the games and I played them. If anybody's watching this, I urge you, please, please, please support physical media. We already see a lot of these games go and disappear, and without emulation, they would be gone forever. The Wii library, the, the DS library, the 3 DS library, all gone without emulation. I, I did that cause my computer's over there where my physical games, they're not going away. I have them. I can play them whenever I feel like.",

Picture an open world 2K game, right? Call it 2K Worlds. You can run around with your friends, do whatever you want. But when you enter whatever facility you're going to, it turns into that. For example, NBA. There's NBA facility, it turns into NBA 2K. When you go in there, your friends can enter there too. WWE. Enter the WWE facility, turns into WWE 2. It would take a lot of work, which is why we're never gonna get it, cause 2K doesn't like to.

A game that I would love to see that it never exist is an open world zombie game, but a simulation of the world. So taking for example, get Google Images, Google Maps to simulate every road in the. In. In the world, and you have. You get the feeling of an actual zombie apocalypse. So not every house has to have access, but, you know, you can raise some of the houses for supplies. But if a zombie apocalypse ever happened, we could play a game that we could simulate to actually know what the zombie apocalypse would feel like. You don't need special special effects zombies like, you just need classic Giorgio Romero zombie. Slow, steady paced. One bite, you're done. Um, but obviously fit around the world. So in certain countries you don't have guns. Here in UK we don't have guns, but we can always get like swords and machetes or even like drive cars to run them over. That would be a game that I think would go quite popular because people would be building their own camp or building their own base around a certain area of where they know is comfortable. And if you really wanted to expand it, do it so people can play online. People can go and explore someone else's area of the world, you know, Make it so the world has actually gone into a zombie apocalypse and see how it would go from there. I think that would go. I think that would. That would do really well.",

But I think you're really off base with this one, man. Because of the fact that Xbox has been doing poorly, we should be okay with the fact they disclose these, these few studios. We should be okay with the fact that hundreds, if not a couple thousand people might be losing their jobs. Xbox as a brand is performing poorly. Hi Fi Rush was a critical darling. Everybody who played that game loved it. Sure, Redfall wasn't great, but it was arcane Austin's only ever miss. And it can be said that the management decisions were the reason that game was made in the first place. So when do we stop giving these companies a pass? When do we stop giving Phil Spencer in the entire C suite a pass? Because I'm not okay with a multi billion dollar company having a bad quarter and that meaning that hundreds of people lose their jobs. Hundreds of people that make 50, 60, 70, a hundred thousand dollars a year. Where Phil Spencer and the entire C suite are making millions. How about just a 10% pay cut for the people who make decisions? I guarantee that would save Microsoft more money than cutting all these studios. And I don't wanna hear it doesn't work like that, because it can work like That, and it should work like that",

I genuinely don't know Balder's Gate I know you like very slow  steady paced  action RPG games you can handle some slower stuff you like to really delve into things  if you like Ellen Ring I know you wanna play stuff  that lets you go at your own pace really explore at your will I know you're not gonna play something like  persona but again that's a broad Assumption I might not be correct about this type of stuff just cause you played Red Dead  and that's your favourite game does not mean  you haven't played  smaller titles and even if I do have that thought I'm not trying to gatekeep  from those people I'm just trying to say  you shouldn't be afraid to explore something new try some weirder games  even if that is  a popular title that you've only heard of if you like Red Dead play Metal Gear Solid 5 if you haven't you don't really need to know the story just try it  we have game passes  on both consoles now with  numerous things just give some new stuff a try  if you're not really familiar with a new game that's all that video is trying  to encourage you to do was it mean  yeah I don't regret it though I regret the ghost of tsushima hate  even though no one really cared",

If I could get this Warhammer game, I don't care if I couldn't play any others for the rest of my life. And what I want is an Adeptus Mechanicus themed extraction shooter. It could even pair with the game Mechanicus itself. The Arc Mechanicus you live on has been tasked to go and find out what happened to a human colony that disappeared. You land on this world, only to find all the colonists destroyed and Necrons active on the planet. Something happens to where you cannot return to your arc mechanicus and can only retreat to certain safe zones. You would go into raids on this planet looking for loot, uh, you would fight Necrons, you would fight other Adeptus mechanicus elements that are also on the planet. You would take all of this stuff back to your safe zone, your hideout, uh, and you would build up a life until you'd be a to be rescued by the Arc Mechanicus. The potential for really cool NPC is the potential to delve deeper into the Adeptus Mechanicus lure is all there. And you could call it simply escape from Tomb World.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is the majority of the gameplay. Where is New Vegas? So this is what I mean precisely when I say, Bethesda Fallout fans don't actually like fallout. Um, because you don't want a fallout game. You want a looter shooter where everything is right next to each other, and you get that boom, boom, boom, and then bang, and then, oh, look at. Look at that. Oh, Todd Howard says, looky, looky. You don't actually wanna fall out, kid, and that's fine. You know what? That's fine. But I think it's really telling. It's really telling that your response to playing the game for a little bit was, oh, New Vegas fans must be on something, because, dude, I haven't even been to New Vegas yet. Like, I've been playing for, like, five hours, and, like, the game still wants me to explore stuff. I'm over that. I should be doing the boom, boom, boom, boom, booms. I should be doing the big boom booms. And listen, I like Fallout 4. I played dozens of hours of Fallout 4. Um, I think it's by far, gameplay wise, the best game. You're right. Gameplay wise, Fallout 4 is the best game. It is the least like a fallout game. I don't play fallout for the boo, boo, boo, boo, boom. Look, I have to walk 30 seconds to get from Salem to Concord, because that's how. That's how things work. Everything in Massachusetts is right next to each other. Like 30 steps away. For some reason, I play it for the story and the exploration and the RPG elements. And if you don't like that, that's fine. But I think it's really telling that you walked into the game going, this game's gonna suck. Because fallout New Vegas fans like it. Maybe look into that feeling, because that's really, really bizarre if your feeling is that a majority of fallout fans like this. So I think it sucks, and I'm not even gonna give the game a chance. I'm gonna walk into the game and bitch about how much it sucks. Maybe that's a you thing, my dude.",

And they've downloaded it. They've made videos against it saying oh my God, don't play held I have this terrible game made, leaving bad reviews when the game actually looks pretty sick and I wanna play meanwhile. They've got a TikTok account, they've got a Facebook account, they've got an Instagram account, they've got a. A Windows account, they've got an Emma, they've got a outlook, they've got a Gmail, they've got a YouTube. Um, what else would they got? They probably got a LinkedIn. Ha ha ha. You know what I mean. Take the spread across the world and all these different social medias, but as soon as they have to make a PlayStation account. Wait, I'm not doing what I'm told! I. I. I want to play the game I originally bought on steam without making a PlayStation account. All we do is moan. It's insane. The amount of entitlement the PC players have thinking they're the master race at this point is ridiculous. Fancy crying because you have to make a PlayStation account? Who gives a shit? It's free. You have 40 another social media accounts. What's the big issue? I think now people are just looking for the chance to moan and create clips and fucking put stuff up on social Media like, for instance, most of these fuckers, you won't make a PlayStation accounts have a Facebook. And that's. And that's not. Accounts getting thrown everywhere around the world, sold to everybody. So, you know, quit being. I'm not gonna say it in case you get banned. Stop crying over nothing.",

Sony is about to single handedly kill hell divers two. That's crazy. So basically anybody that plays Hell Divers to on PC and doesn't own a PlayStation or doesn't have a PSN account, you're about to be locked out of that game even if you paid for it. Which brings me to another subject. With one of their last updates on PSN, they updated the terms of service and everything. And the license agreement. They say that the games are licensed to you, not sold. You do not own the games you pay for. Looks like I'm about to move right back to getting physical copies. I should have never stopped. I mean, I didn't stop, it's just getting games off of PSN was more. I ain't gonna lie, downloading the games was more convenient than anything else. For years I've been saying Xbox need to start winning again cause PlayStation got their heads up their asses. It almost looks like PC is the place to go now. What y'all think? Go ahead and hit that follow button.",

It's standard software licensing agreement, dude. Uh, it's nothing new, it's nothing nefarious. That's how it's always been worded. No one ever pays any attention to it. Um, no one ever. It forces it. Um, but yes, that's correct. When you buy a CD or like a displace or physical game cartridge, whatever, you're not buying the software. You don't own the software. You. You own a license to use the software. The people that made the software own the software. They are licensing it to you. They are letting you use their software that they created. That's the legal terms of it. Always has been. Always has been, never been any different. Um, so I like this whole idea of like, oh, I buy a physical game cause I want to own it. It was never true. You never owned your physical game. The only thing is that, you know, the companies don't enforce this licence thing and don't revoke licences from anyone that owns physical game. They just don't. So you, you pretty much as good as own it, right? You, you, you as good as own it. You just don't technically legally own it, right? Sony's not. Look, the guy in the video says, uh. Uh, Sony's following the footsteps of Ubisoft. Ubisoft's not Following the footsteps of anyone? Sony's not following the footsteps of anyone. This has always been a thing. This was kind of stuff that used to read in instruction manuals back in the 16 bit era and probably before that. Um, yeah, I. I mean, I. I know there's a stereotypical thing where people don't read, um, terms and licensing agreements and all that, um, but, like, I've seen this go viral few times recently where people are, you know, trying to champion physical games, then, like, don't buy digital because of this. It's like that. That's the same shit you. Same shit you agreed to, same shit when you put in your physical game and he asked you do terms and conditions. That's a win there on pretty much every game you own. Like, not. Not pretty much literally every game that you know, that you own. So, yeah, I don't know what to tell you. You read one license in agreement that was given to you by Sony themselves, and it has the same stuff that's on every game. When you accept the terms and licensing conditions. When you first blew up a game, um, they used to be in instruction manuals. The reason why they're now in the game is because games don't really come with instruction manuals anymore. So you have to accept before you start the game. Yeah. Anyway, how's the brain?",

And obviously go watch his video if you haven't, but the toxicity in the gaming community is out of control now with games like call of Duty, Overwatch, League of legends. That stuff is to be expected. Right, but I have seen an outrageous amount of toxicity in even offline single player games now. He was talking about Final Fantasy. Now I can't speak on Final Fantasy myself, but for me it's the last of us too. The last of us has to be one of the most toxic communities I have ever been a part of, and this is spanning across many social media sites. I honestly don't think I've ever met people more hateful than in The Last of us fandom, and it's sad to see because it is one of my favorite video game franchises. In The Last of Us two is in my top three favorite games of all time. And I am all for debating with people about it and just talking about it, but with this game in particular, I feel like I'm constantly met with toxic behavior. What I can't seem to understand is the fact that a lot of these people that do have toxic behavior in certain types of fandoms, they don't even seem like they're fans at all. So why are you here, like, spewing hate about something that you Don't even like. Like, did you ever think to maybe just go enjoy something? It's just weird as fuck. Besides the one fandom that I named, what are fandoms that you're a part of that have just toxic people in it? Let me know in the comments.",

Dudes talks about how gaming is boring but all you play is the quad stack. Then yeah you suck. But like that's not most. Most people that play those games are generally happy. Secondly, like the majority of the GTA 2K audience. Like they've never heard of Ghost. Assumption they only know The Last of us maybe because of the movies. They only know Red Dead because it's GTA adjacent. But like, they don't know those games so I don't know what you're talking about. Thirdly, like you got a lot of nerve talking down on somebody for they taste. And then you bring up Persona 3 and Persona 4 is like the measure of true culture. Oh really? You like the most popular RPG of the PS two era? Like that's his basic of a preference? You just switch to a different popular genre. Less popular genre. NGS3, Resident Evil, Vice City. Those were all dumb popular games in their era. It's just that that era was 18 years ago. They don't give you no strikes. Like play what you want and stop judging people.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I put a lot of thought of this and I think I got the right formula if you hear me out in Avatar game RPG stuff with the format of Mass Effect 2 and attack on Titan 2 the Video Game why do I pick these two I'll explain attack on Titan 2 was such a great game where like you played your own character and somehow you were somehow incorporate into the real story without having to go through like every other thing that other characters have you truly felt like you were your own person and you gradually went up the ranks to become a full fledged scout that get into Erwi small circle  Mass Effect 2 also did the same thing it said you have more freedom of travel open game world you can go to any planet that you wanted truly and as the game came to a close you felt like the people that you included we all became family by the end know that you knew their story you gained their loyalty and it truly felt that you two were a team by the end of the game both these games have something in common that the fact is that while you were getting to know these characters you also got their stories you weren't you learnt what they liked what they don't like reasons they had difficulties and all that and depending if you did their personal missions to get their loyalty you definitely got an insight of their characters and their backstory so how do we start this story first we create our character then we select which nation our character comes from now you can also switch if you're a Bender or non Bender and for non benders you can select what weapon you would prefer which would be a sword a staff a spear anything even hell even a bow and arrow and depending on which nation you are it depends on how your story starts for instance if you're in the Earth Nation you are either gonna start your character in omashu or you're gonna start your character in Boston say Reason 4 because those are two major cities that the endgame usually visits or not usually visits but they're the ones where a lot of plot takes place if you're in the Fire Nation you are most likely a citizen or soldier now I'm kind of iffy on the soldier part because honestly I really don't know how I'm gonna like create the age gauge and all that so you can either be like you know between 15 or 17 oh hell maybe as low as 12 because honestly let's be real it feels kind of weird that if you create an adult character and he's travelling around with a bunch of kids so I know let me know what y'all think about the age rage thing moving on and if you're in the water nation you're most likely gonna start in the same village as Saka and Katara I would say you could choose to be in the Air Nation in this game but you be 100 years past tense and as the game goes on you meet various characters of these which depending on which nation you're in you might meet these some of these characters sooner rather than later now this is where the attack on Titan format comes in and attack on Titan you were able to have up to four if I remember correctly three to four people on your team so there's a five man squad now while the other characters are non playable they were still able to act on their own so they can take down their enemies all that even with some in some certain situations you could even do co op video game moves or even co op finishing moves and all that or hell they can even come in for assist if you're in Dane way I categorise it is with support characters it's either you could do a finishing move healing move or an assist or defend characters like a Tara she can either help you with an assist or healing characters like Aang can work as defensive characters or support characters like Toph Zuko or Sokka can work as support or even co op finishing move and then characters that you have like Boomy Iro John John hell maybe even where's he at where's he at Master Pot soccer's teacher I don't know why I can't pronounce his name or remember right now they are one shot catchers when you summon them they one shot a character but the fact is you can only use them like at once once a time maybe a dirt maybe a time limit has to be but here's the thing there are one shot and they are the characters who take the longest to each round now I relate to Mass Effect 2 the way I was saying to attack on Titan you can learn the characters and this also helps for people who never watched the series or even read the books you can learn about each character's history you don't have to but it would be helpful if you knew their history about like how like you know what made them them for instance when you join the game there's a part where you're not on a mission and you guys saddle up you can go around the little area get in get a little camp talk about their history night you can learn about angs how his culture got genocide you can learn about Katara or Sokka and how their mom was killed and as the story goes on and more characters coming to play when you're not on missions the campsite more characters come in you can talk to them optional you can talk to them learn about their history and all that and honestly it helps like to build relationships you know this is what makes relationships is what makes the coordination a lot stronger so if you don't talk to this person very well the coordination their attack damage is not gonna be up that way for instance if you talk to Sokka more than you do Zuko Sokka is gonna get more damage points whenever you summon him for an assist and if you do it with Zuko talk to him what do you do Sokka is vice versa talk to every character until your infinity is maxed out and you guys can do top damage and again back to Mass Effect 2 remember in book 3 how everyone but talk at their solo mission with zoo you can go on third party with them you know develop the relationship between them you see sometimes again a lot of people don't still don't trust you go at this point so you can help you know build that relationship to him so y'all's coordination goes back together but just because you're a part of the main store now doesn't mean you go on every quest as like with the ang when he went on the spirit he went on that spiritual journey I'm just gonna call it a journey he went on that journey with the Sea Line you're with the rest of the group you don't go with him on so while you're there searching for him and all that you gear up for the war and all that and you can either go with Sokka and Sookie and Toph on there or you can go help Zuko and Katara with their mission and then once you done with either or you can go help Aang with his mission now we all know that Aang did not need help with his duel with Oza I mean he kind of did because you know if he didn't get the Avatar state he would have been past tense but you know you get to the point where you're fighting with Ozai and then all of a sudden we get the moment when he gets his Avatar bring back and it's just lights out from there and then by the end of the game you stand alongside your friends as Zuko is appointed to Fire Lord the war is over and you are all having tea and uncle I roshop so guys what do you think about my take on this let me know in the comments and till next time",

Now those of you follow me for a little bit, fair play to you will know that my whole journey is based on exactly what he just said. Nobody is gaming wrong, nobody is gaming incorrectly. Their own gaming journey is their own. But you're missing out if you're not playing the older generation of games. He articulates perfectly what I've been saying. You can play your yearly release titles all you want, you can play your own games all you want, have you on play them. But you're missing out on a whole heap of history and a sense of gaming and playing games if you don't go back and play older generations to experience them for the first time, or to understand where your favourite games came from or to understand how they were made. Gaming history opens your eyes so much. And the joy of it is you can go back to these. Especially as an older person that wasn't around during the time when Halo came out, or the Hyper Amalga Solid when it first came out, or when Pokemon Yellow first came out, or when anything on the snares or the N64 when it first came out. You weren't around for that time period. Going back to as an older person, you might have a better Appreciation for it and you might be able to sort of gauge or reignite your love for gaming based on that experience. One quick example Paper Mario in a Thousand Year Door. I never played this until 2023 and my god I was not a Mario guy. I didn't have Mario on 64 when I was a child. But this I could appreciate much, much much much more because I got the GameCube in 2021 and actually I felt better about it cause I had a better holistic approach to gaming and it changed my mindset on gaming. It's an amazing time. This is morning rambling now, but I just wanted to get on quickly and highlight this video. Please go watch it, please go share it. Please go appreciate. If I can give it a trophy I would. Amazing.",

Now, there are probably several video games that would fall into this category, but the one that comes to mind the most for me is this game right here. Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island. And everything about this game is great except for one thing, and I bet you can guess what it is. That's right, it's baby Mario crying over and over and over again until you rescue him back. Otherwise, this game is pretty dang solid. I love the artwork in this game. Just the whole vibe of the game is awesome. But when it comes to Mario crying, oh my gosh, I lose it. Now, I'm sure I'm probably gonna receive some flack over this because this game is kind of popular with certain people, but this is my opinion, and everybody has their opinion on what they like and what they don't like.",

Earlier this week, the California courts ruled in favor of Activision in their lawsuit against engine owning, who sell cheats for games like call of Duty, Counter Strike, and battlefield in order to pay that massive sum to Activision and hand over ownership of their website domain to them. Activision first sued engine owning under DMCA, the American copyright law that Bungie also used in their own Destiny 2 cheating lawsuit recently. You won that one in Activision followed suits, or at least in theory, because engine owning is quite simply refusing to comply. They claiming that the people targeted by the lawsuit are long inactive and have even backed up their domain to try and circumvent the forced hand over to Activision. This might seem like a silly response, but it does put Activision in a biz of a bind. They'd have to spend even more of their money, or really your money that you gave them for a slightly shinier pistol, on further legal battles. Some of those could even be outside the United States, which put their odds at the same place as your odds of getting a refund from them. What do you think engine owning brave gamers for standing up against big evil Activision? Or should they finally put down the cheats and just get good Let us know.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey everyone, I'm Anna and I'm the studio head for valorant and I'm here to chat a bit about player behavior in the game. Player behavior is a complex problem space. Our systems cannot catch everything. They require constant attention and tweaking and improvement. Sometimes it has to be painfully manual or dependent on our players reporting things and on our processes staying well tuned. But at the end of the day, there are still some people in this world who want to take out their insecurity or their bad day or their whatever on some stranger through their computer screen. And that's exactly what we're experiencing and addressing right now. But I also wanna make sure that I say this out loud. We have no room for these types of behaviour in our game or in our community. Valorant is a team game. It's better played as a team. The strats are better, all of it's better. When you tell someone to just mute comms to avoid harassment, you are essentially putting the harassed person in a position to not communicate, to compromise how they wanna play the game to accommodate you. Muting is a tool for people who choose to use it, not something that is there to justify bad behaviours. Competitive games need to have room for banter. We believe this and I do understand the fear. The fear that we will sanitize gaming by over addressing these issues. We have no interest in doing that. We do believe that a person should not be in a position to have to grow a thicker skin or whatever other unhelpful suggestions have been thrown out there just to avoid threats of violence or literal hate speech. There's no room in our community for the most egregious behaviors, and we're not going to compromise on that point. If you need to make truly evil statements under the guise of regular shit talk to enjoy gaming, then please play something else. We won't miss you. Look, I know this message is intense, so let me say this. This is not just about preventing the worst. It's about promoting the best in each of us. It's about ensuring that people can share in the joy of the matches. One and the tough losses. And the amazing feeling of community that gaming can create.",

These are an extreme form of punishment so they will only be applied in the most extreme cases, with clear evidence and manual review, like we do with anticheat 3. We will be beefing up the teams needed to support more manual reviews 4.

Who cares how many Queef Tilly and polygons my character has if it's some Ubisoft open world design that has me breaking out the nightcap and candle? When Elden Ring first came out, so many people were like dude, this looks like a PS three game. Yeah, Elden ring, the game where no matter where you go or where you look, you're in a living painting. Would seeing every single eyelash on the tarnished face or seeing real time ball sweat dripping off on the back of torn really make the game more fun? Even if it did look like a PS three game? Who gives a shit? Some of the funniest games I've ever played are on the PS two and they look like this. That's because the only thing that matters is gaming gameplay and art direction. Should anyone care about the ray tracing? Or the 30,000 gigacharts per fart if you have to turn them off to run the game? If you have a PC that cost less than $10,000. This is what's leading to the collapse of the triple A games industry. I just become so inflated every single person who's ever touched a video game in their life have to buy this one game for it to make a profit. So then They can't take a single creative risk.

There was no reason to ever do it beyond that. Just going back to world of Warcraft, in the beginning, world of Warcraft was, here's a bunch of skills and a bunch of talents. You can do whatever, like be the character you wanna be. What ended up happening? Someone just told you, this is the best version of that. And then people said, well, if you're not that, I don't want you in my party. I'm trying to get the highest damage possible. So when we start talking about MMORPG games and we discover the meta, the optimal, the efficient thing, is that no longer a choice that you're making because you enjoy the game, and a choice that you have to make because mechanically, you need other people to enjoy the game with you. Special shout out to path of exile as a side note. The second that I played that game and saw the huge skill tree and was like, wow, there's so many options and went to click something, everyone went, no, don't click that. What are you doing?

    "voice_to_text": "So the people who defend skill based matchmaking are always saying stuff like, you just wanna win when you play online. All right, bring it. Yes, that is 100% the reason that I play competitive games, because I wanna win. I see it's already been brought in. For those unfamiliar with the term, skill based matchmaking refers, as the name suggests, to matching people up with similar skill levels in video games in particular. And I suspect even those who are not familiar with that specific term immediately recognize how this is an almost universal thing we do in competition. More generally, outside of an occasional exhibition activity. We don't see grandmasters in chess routinely beating up on new chess players or World Cup finalist beating up on elementary school soccer players. And we don't see these things because putting two people who are significantly different in skill level into a competitive activity prevents the person who is of lower skill level from actually learning anything. And it makes the win by the higher skilled player fairly meaningless. The new player not only learns nothing because the game typically is over so quickly there's not a chance to practice and learn, but the skilled player has not really demonstrated any sort of skill. And so for those who are against skill based matchmaking, I have the following question. What is it about winning that's so important that you'd be willing to sacrifice any of the intrigue or interest in the Game in order to avoid the opposite losing where is the enjoyment or even demonstration of skill when, for example, a world champion arm wrestler successfully defeats a toddler? At what point does winning lose all meaning in life? Cause for me, winning a competition that was never a competition at all isn't really a win either.",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, I'm convinced this is satire, but the amount of people that are hyping up Hellblade to and comparing it to like PlayStation exclusives that are actually treating it like it's a slam dunk for Xbox. Brother. What. What are you. What are you huffing right now? Like, I don't know if this is a troll or not, but the seer amount of it. I'm just gonna assume it's true and I'm not gonna be nice about it. So you're. You're comparing Hellblade to all? I'm just gonna say right now, graphically, it is one of the most impressive games I've seen ever. That's about it. It is a five hour game. Imagine being Xbox right now. You have already lost the console war. Okay? The console war has now become cringe because it's not competitive. They were outsold 5 to 1. When people ask the question why aren't there more exclusives being made, Xbox has paid a couple billion for Bethesda, a couple billion for call of duty. Why aren't there any more exclusives? Because literally every company that they bought has done everything in their power to have their games released on all platforms. Because according to them, it doesn't matter how good their game is. If only Xbox was able to buy them, they would fail. In other words, Xbox did so bad this generation that it doesn't even matter how good the game is, it'll still fail. So Xbox finally gets an exclusive. Hell, blade 2 Hell, Blade 1 was pretty good, so they make another one. Absolutely zero promotion for this game. You got to the point that people were actively feeling bad for Hellblade to saying oh, Xbox just want wants a reason to get rid of the studio to save some money. And that's what I think part of it was. Only for this game to come out. Graphically looks amazing. Let me preface that again that they won't stop glazing that. Other than that dog shit. If you like the game, you like the game. But guess what? Ain't nobody paying $70 for five hours of gameplay. But wait, it's actually eight. You paid $70 for eight hours of gameplay? Mother, you are either rich or in denial. Like the Copium is so strong around this game that to defend it, they're actually saying well I would rather play my eight hours of masterpiece then my 60 hours of over bloated content. Really? Okay, okay, come over, come over. Elden Ring is 60 hours. You think that's over bloated? I like. I'm with you. There is over bloated games. For example, Ubisoft Assassin's Creed Odyssey took 300 hours to complete. Severely over bloated. But to say the optimal masterpiece length of a game is less than 10 hours? Brother, I would hate for that to be the norm. Like I'm sorry, under no circumstances so the game under 10 hours be sold at full price. I don't care how graphically amazing that Game is. Oh yeah. Comparing it to Horizon Forbidden West is stupid. You can play this game on a PS four and was at the start of the console generation. And yeah, you would get more hours of enjoyment out of this game. Blow in all compared to this. But there you go. That's my thoughts.",

Worst part is, it won't even take the whole team 2. These two motherfuckers will be chilling. These two motherfuckers handle everybody going on. That team is capable of taking on Bucky in a 1 v 1, and Ali is nowhere near as accurate as dead shot is with anything in his hand. And that's not even including the fact that bullets travel faster than arrows. This point is either dead shot is mowing the whole squad down his bullets. A Bucky does the same thing with his own gun, except as explosive to the mix. And that's if he's not getting jumped by everyone else and probably still winning. I will say though, a fight between Asian 47 and John Wick is definitely something I'd like to see, cause in my opinion these two are actually a good match for each other. As capable as John Wick is, I'd still give it to Asian 47. Cause that motherfucker was biologically engineered from birth to be a hitman. Trained to kill you in almost every way under the sun and moon since birth, and has easily came out on top against other motherfuckers like himself. On the question of who win in a fight between these two if they fought, i'mma go with the guy that was made to be The best",

This is a third person game coming out the Warhammer 40K franchise. Warhammer fans been waiting on this. That fan base is crazy. This game looks like Helldivers 2 in gears of war had a child. I know. Warhammer was around first though. Relax. You guys know I love hell divers, but this game has almost everything I want out of hell divers. You play as a space marine fighting against alien species. Space marines are genetically modified and they got these big ass suits of armor. This game has a whole story campaign. You can play solo or co op with friends. Gameplay is straight up ridiculous. Brothers. Big ass swords with finisher execution moves on the what really has me hyped though. They just announced multiplayer and Pvp mode. But not even only that bro. The weapons and armor are all fully customizable. You can change the color, the helmet, the melee weapon, the ornament. Look at this shit bro. I need that and I desire that. Different melee weapons, like gauntlets. You could put booster jets on your armor to lunge at people. Dog, I need this shit. Indubitably held. Iris, you got till September to get your affairs in order. Dog, y'all gotta rework that armor system soon, cause this shit ain't it. Let me know what y'all think, but damn I'm hyped For this game",

Haha it's mostly cause people are not actually able to probably combat against the vehicles, which is understandable. The gauntlets are just overpowered. They're so annoying.

And people say this time and time again that these are the worst images I've seen. These are the worst images I've seen. But for my understanding of the situation currently, this bombing, this latest bombing took place in the Rafa crossing, located in an unretent where thousands, hundreds of thousands, of my understanding of people were sent there, were displaced to this tent. Again, this is UNRA. This is the UN. These are displacement tents that the UN put in place to keep people safe. Right. And those are the areas in which Israel just targeted. Remember all the claims about the babies that the White House has continued to make, even though not the White House necessarily, actually, Joe Biden himself has continued to make, even though now those articles have been disproved, and the White House itself has had to come forward and say that this is not true. I just saw a man carrying a baby, fully baby, and. And that is a image I will never get out of my head. The absolute sanction violence by the United States that we have been seeing take place in Palestine for the last eight months is due to the fact that lies were made about children who were, as well as great victims. These stories have now been debunked, but when you put information like This out into the world, it is very difficult to take it back. And so now we are seeing the ramifications of that. I'm going to strongly, strongly, strongly encourage you to interact with the videos and the images that we are seeing coming out of Rafa right now across all social medias. We have to make these stories, these situations, these horrors so undeniable that everywhere you look, someone is going to see this. Because there are still people today who have no idea what is happening around the world, not only in Rafa, but in the DRC, in Sudan. These are the atrocities that we are forcing upon people. Us in the west, we are forcing this upon people because we continue to put these violent, evil maniacs into office, and then they go and commit these atrocities. We have got to stop this, and we cannot stop fighting for the rights of people all over the world.",

I might be cracking some jokes, but I honestly want to know how the gaming industry got this way. I might not work in the gaming industry, but I feel so bad for everyone who puts their heart and soul into their craft just to get treated so poorly for their efforts and dedication, and blamed for disappointing games and practices. #bg3 #baldursgate #baldursgate3 #larianstudios #jokes #gaming #hifirush #gamers #gamingindustry #gametok ",

    "voice_to_text": "what is with major game development companies obsession with doing every little thing to increase profits except trust their creatives what's with that they'll have micro transactions up the prices of their games lay off a bunch of their workers do all these things imaginable instead of just letting the creatives make good games as if it's not the creatives that made them the billion dollar companies that they are today like it wasn't the executive sitting in a chair because he's not the one coding he's not the one writing he's not the one voicing he's not the one doing the character designs doing the music composition it's the creatives and it really just feel like there's this aversion to trying by these big companies it's almost like they're offended that gamers want them to try to make a good game people work extremely hard for their money okay the income that most people make does not go as far as it once did of course they want their games to be worth the money that people are spending I remember in Baldur's Gate 3 first came out and there was all this discourse about you know from these bigger companies about like oh you know they're afraid that gamers are gonna you know have higher expectations higher standards they should have realistic expectations you know making a quality game like this is it's just it's not standard it's not you know normally possible what  do they think Baldur's Gate 3 happened on accident the writers were getting ready to sit down to write this nice little D&D game and they just oops trip and fall over the chairs and smash their hands on the keyboards and then accidentally write this great game and they read it back and go oh my god that's brilliant let's keep that and then Beth Park she's getting ready to go you know cast the talent for this game and she's had walking down the street and trips and falls and whoops and rolls like a bowling ball into Devora and Devora accidentally pushes Sam and Sam accidentally drop kicks Elizabeth and then Elizabeth goes flying and knocks into Neil then Neil gets sent like a ragdoll into the studio like oh my god and then he when he lands he hops up and just wow there's Astarion  and then everyone's like you know what guys I love it we're keeping that you're all casted oh and Neil that thing that stance that thing that you do can you keep that in I think that works for him like no no everyone worked incredibly hard on the game which is very evident from like the behind the scenes stuff that they post and you can tell they're passion about it from the way that they speak about it from the behind the scenes that you you see you know and they have fun with it and so of course it's like when you're passionate about what you do when you love what you do when you care about what you do  you're gonna be willing to work hard for what you love and all of those things combined end up creating incredible things whether it's games TV shows films etc when you love what you do when you care about what you do you create magic you create lightning in a bottle it's not a happy little accident okay they're not Bob Ross I really want to know like when did this divide between the executives and creatives start like what what started that like I know yes there are shareholders but it wasn't always like this and it's not every major company you know there are companies that really care about creating quality games that really care about their stuff like Nintendo  the CEO instead of you know to avoid layoffs he took a pay cut you know that to me again like a that's gonna get the trust of the creators but to me that really says like no he loves gaming he loves gamers he cares about his employees he cares about the craft he was willing to do that to make sure that the people that put him in the position he is in is taken care of and also the gamers are taken care of because they have the staff they have the people there to continue to create these great games that Nintendo makes I don't know but I'm just just so tired of these antics from from these gaming companies like oh yeah we're gonna use AI let's just fire everybody let's just you know remake the same games let's just remaster the same games like what is going on what what happened what happened I'd really like to know like honestly because the gaming industry  just has just taken this nose dive and you get like these little these little gems of games that prove like hey great games are possible trusting your creators works out and the executives are just like no like oh hi Fi Rush you're successful awesome gonna close your studio and then we're gonna say hey we need more games like you what is going on someone please explain to me please and thank you",

    "voice_to_text": "The CAR 98 is back! I was divided to play season 4 early. Here's everything you need to know this CAR 98 is identical the one that we use back in Modern Warfare 2019, and is still in the marksman rifle category. But there's a few differences with this brand new CAR 98 in Modern Warfare 3. The reload is a lot faster than the original CAR because it reloads every bullet as a group at the same time instead of individually loading each bullet one by one, which is much slower. you could add new attachments on the CAR that make it much faster, such as changing the sling and even removing the stock, which was not possible before. And overall, this new CAR 98 handled very fast and clean. I had great movement damage and aimed outside speeds, but there was a huge difference in the hip fire. I was hitting over 90% of my hip fires even from a distance with pure accuracy. Which also makes this CAR 98 super good in close range. And it was able to one step on multiplayer consistently at most ranges from the chest up. Here's the CAR 90, a build that I was using in this gameplay. Which is also gonna be the quickscoping warzone meta. But the real question is, does it also one shot in warzone?",

I've been getting away. This is exactly the type of people Palestinians in Gaza have to deal with, and far, way worse than that. Imagine the victimhood complex they have. Actually cursing all the Muslims and then saying that they are being antisemitic. How many videos we have seen so far for IDF soldiers coming back to Europe or the United States and started doing exactly this? And this is what happened to people when they have the authority to do whatever the hell they want and they think that they are still in Gaza. I want you to look at this photo that was published by this soldier on his social media, holding a picture of a young girl from Gaza. And he actually captioned the video by saying, this naughty Fatima sent me a letter to the warfront. My loved one, I miss you. And I think about You everyday love Fatim. I'm not gonna comment much on it. I want you to tell me what do you think of this in the comments. And don't be very upset. Try to find words that you know can keep the video on the for you page because my previous one was taken down. But I want you to see the picture that he's holding. This is actually a disabled lady that you can see that she lost one of her leg and she actually lost one of her arms. And most probably he stole this photo from her house. And you know what I think they are being encouraged by their communities on social media. Like if they post more they are more considered to be like heroes and doing more thing. Cause for sure if your community is not encouraging such a, you wouldn't be doing it. Let me know what you think of this in the comments. Don't forget to share this video. Put it in your stories and do it. Please check the link in my bio. This is very important. And see you next video.",

And earlier this year we even got a much higher quality version of it without all the text and everything. This is actually one of the later iterations of the logo though, as there's an earlier one in existence which is a bit more elaborate. Though it seems back when they were using this one, the intent was to only use the logo for the box art. Now, one of my personal favorite details about the box art is if you zoom in on the star man, there's Ness reflected in his visor. What's your favorite video game box art?",

And I asked this question because I'm very against prison labor in all forms, but especially forced prison labor. And a lot of the time the response I get to that is people saying, okay, if you don't wanna do force prison labor or whatever, don't commit a crime. And like, having to completely disregard the fact that, you know, black people and people of color are wrongly convicted more often or often given harsher sentences and all of that kind of stuff. Ignoring all that, I still believe that people that have been convicted of crimes deserve rights. I feel like it gets complicated the more that people try to, like, segment what kind of crime someone has done or something. But I do think people deserve to be able to vote. I think people deserve, you know, safety precautions in their workplace, wherever that may be, whatever the conditions might be. I believe that they should be able to sue if they have gotten injured on the job. I don't know. I believe people should be able to say, hey, no, I don't wanna work. Maybe I wanna get my master's degree, or maybe I wanna do, like, religious studies, stuff like that. Do other things in jail. And other people don't think that way. I do genuinely believe a lot of people see people convicted Of crimes as slaves, which I think is problematic. we should all be alarmed that this is, like, the system we operate in.

After last season I didn't think this could get any worse, but once again epic has outdone themselves and gave us a real stink the both. The cars have made them way too OP. Not only did they increase their HP by a lot, they know how mods so kids that grenade launchers and miniguns on top of them. And at first this sounds really fun and exciting, but once you play a couple of games you realize this season is really not enjoyable. And that is because every game is gonna be based around cars, build fights, and hell even gunfights are basically non existent unless you're fighting all spawn now. I won't have a problem with any of this rental separate from pubs because A. I'm sure there's people out there that love this season and think that the chaos is fun, but that isn't me. Personally, I like to play Fortnite. I like having normal fights where I get eliminated because I got played and not because they're using some item that requires zero skill at all. I'm sure they'll lift the cars, but since the season based around them I thought it's gonna be a crazy change. So it looks like I'll be spending most of this season in creative.

And I know I'm not the only person who complain about this. I'm pretty sure there's plenty of Youtubers and tiktokers who complain about it. But my guy, we're paying 40 bucks for Black Ops, a game they came out in 2010. That's ridiculous. Why are you charging 60 bucks for Black Ops 2? It's an old game, ain't nobody playing it. I just wanna play it for myself to revisit the old call of duty campaigns and I might even wanna do an analysis. But I cannot in no way, shape or form justify paying in that much money just to relive a note experience. Well Josh, if you so worried about it, why not play the Xbox 3 60 things? But here's the thing. I can no way, shape or form justify reliving those games in the 7:00 20 p resolution in a 1080 p in the 4K display. It just ain't. It just ain't working for me bro. That shit is like Vaseline all over my screen and I can't get jiggy with that. So I hope with the Microsoft and the call of Duty Direct, if when they put these games on Game Pass or whatever, I hope they put these old games on the PC Game Pass as well so I can find a better alternative than paying Those, you know. Then paying all that almost fucked up my take. But you have a good day.",

Any chance I get to to point this out and say, hey, you know, this game's not as good as you make it out to be. Silent Hill 2. Everybody absolutely overhypes this game. And when I got around the plane and I was like, nah, it's alright, it's alright. Like the game is. It's okay, the story is great, the game itself is okay. It's just. Whatever. I've said it before and I will keep having this discussion. Silent Hill 2 as a game is really not that good. It's a sloppy mess. The character himself is unlikele, but I understand why. And the gameplay loop that's in it is really not that good either. What stands out with Silent Hill 2 is the story. The story is really good, and the ending made me cry. I will always give that to them, that the story is really good, but the game itself just. It's not it. There's a lot other games that are much better. Silent Hill 1 and 3 are better games. In Silent Hill 2 as a game, though, the sloppiness in combat can be felt within all of those games. What? I recommend somebody to play Silent Hill 2 well, just for them to see for themselves whether or not they like the game and if they can Get past the sloppiness that is that game. And before you get all twisted saying that I'm calling it a bad game, not saying it's a bad game. I'm saying I don't think it's as good as everybody else thinks. Stitch, comment, all that fun stuff. Let me know what you guys think about what game it is that everybody seems to love, but you're just kind of me.",

This is the Fruit Roll UPS parlour, and at the arcade are tricks and Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Games like the Reese's Puffs, Snowboard Sloan. But you had your own house, you can decorate your bedroom, like, go to the store and pick out your furniture. They had a pet store, get new clothes. Then there was the famous Millsbury Gazette that would let you know what's happening in the town. And on November 21st, 2,010, it was announced that players would be graduating from Millsbury, which was a nice way of saying that Millsbury would be no longer. And everyone got a yearbook with a picture of their buddy and their house and their 15 favorite items. And that was it.",

And it's showing me that some people really don't know all the random places black people manage to pop up in history. Samurai, we got Yasuke. Pirates, we got Black Caesar, who escaped his slave ship by stealing a rowboat, raided other ships to say, afloat in a mass. Such a large fortune and reputation across the ocean blue that the real life Blackbeard said, hey, you wanna join my crew? Cowboys, we got Bill Pickett, who literally invented an event that still hosted at rodeos across the nation. Knights, the Roman army had a black soldier who LED his own legion and was declared a patron site. And that's before we mention an entire continent's worth of warriors, legacies and inventions. All the people upset that Yasuke has appeared need to accept that we've always been here. Don't fight with history. Get some therapy.",

Reduce healing per second from 100 to 50. It will now be much harder to stay alive in your well, but you will get radiant for 8 seconds when a player exits your, uh. Well of radiance. Bubble is getting a buff as far as defensive capabilities go. You don't even have to be inside the bubble anymore, you just gotta be near it to get a void overshield. Allies near the ward of Dawn Dome now have a void overshield tickled trickled trickled on overtime, similar to the volume behind a bastion barricade. Weapons of light is getting removed by default, and you will only have weapons of light if you are using helm of Saint 14 inside the bubble. You will now have 60% um. Damage resistance.

    "voice_to_text": "This guy is not a gamer. That's what this guy said to me in a video talking about various different popular video games that I don't like for various different reasons. I'm just interested what makes someone a gamer, and what is the measurable disqualification of said gamer status? I streamed the Xbox 3 60 Classic from Raven Software Singularity last night for about four hours. Does that make me a gamer? I have a gamer score of hundred 55,073 points on my Xbox profile. Does that make me a gamer? My most recently played game is an indie title called indica, a game I'd be willing to bet that you've never heard of. Does that make me a gamer? So far this year I've completed Banishers, Ghost of New Eden, Suicide Squad, kill the Justice League, alone in the Dark, Dragons Dogma 2, Pacific Drive, Ultros, rise of the Ronin, Stellar Blade, I played through Borderlands 3 again, and I've put a good amount of time into Powerworld, Hell, Divers 2, hawked, and Fallout 76. Does that make me a gamer? My top five favorite games of all time are The Last of Us, The Witcher 3, Bioshock, Fallout New Vegas, and the Mass Effect trilogy. I'm wondering if that makes me a gamer. Truthfully, I have no idea what makes me a gamer. I mean, I'm caught up in this existential crisis and, uh, I. I. I don't really even know, like, who I am anymore. Jerebo here. Has declared it. Uh, I'm not a gamer. Because I haven't completed seven specific video games. Even though there's thousands of good video games that have come out over the last 40 years, because I haven't completed seven of them, and because Jerbo declared that I'm not a gamer, I've made the difficult decision to just call it quits. It's been a really fun ride, but I. I can't continue to lie to myself, and I can't continue to lie to you guys. So thank you for interacting with my content, but I'm done. I'll still be on TikTok, though. You can follow me at the Underwater Basket Weaver, where I truly hope you guys will interact with my new content. That's hopefully a little bit more true to myself. So thank you, Gerbo, for helping me realize the truth. And I'll see you guys later.",

Well now Modern Warfare 3 are adding the DNA bomb into multiplayer as a kill streak. But there's actually more! A fan favorite weapon is coming to the game called the CAR 98K and it will be free in the Battle Pass. Random skins are also coming to M W3, and they can happily take my money for these.

    "voice_to_text": "So with a EA saying that they not only want to put ads in your favorite video games, they are actively putting money into developing it. The internet has kind of taken this as a. A last stand, and I don't blame them. Understand, EA is quite possibly the worst gaming company ever, just followed by Ubisoft. But the thing that makes EA the absolute worst is that you know how like every other gaming company tries to innovate? Like the make a better technology, making a better video game. Yeah, EA just finds new ways to monetize the products that you already kind of like. Like, I understand EA executives want there to be a commercial break in your favorite sports games. Imagine calling a time out and fucking mad in 2027 and then you gotta watch a Fucking Burger King ad. Understand that means that all sports games have to be connected to the internet 24 7. The worst part about it is last time I talked about this, there was really people in the comment section that said, well, it'll add to immersion. I'm sorry, I'm. I'm convinced you're either a bot or an active employee of EA. Or even there's like an EA executive holding your family hostage telling you that you gotta type this online if you want immersion in your sports game. And the way to get that is the watch commercials. How. How about this? How about you pause the game every two Minutes. Watch three Burger King ads in a row on YouTube and then there you go. Don't ruin it for the rest of us. But. Understand this won't just affect Madden games, this will also affect single player games. Like people have already done this in protest to just point out the obscurity of this dog. Imagine if you're playing Star Wars the last Jedi and you see a fucking billboard that says Nuka Cola, the favorite drink of the Empire. Understand there is already patents on this technology that is owned by Sony, EA, Ubisoft. They all have patents on this. The moment one company feels comfortable enough to do it, everybody's going to do it. Understand at this rate if nobody like does anything, there is going to be a day where games are going to come out at their normal standard version at $70. But then there's going to be a 90 to 100 dollar version of that game that is going to get rid of ads for you. And they are going to find a way to make it illegal to mod ads out of a game. Like, I'll tell you this right now. I've never been a huge EA fan, but I refuse to play another EA game until they walk this shit back. Understand they not only wanna put ads in your favorite video games, they want to decrease the cost of every game. Make it cheaper by offloading a lot of their programming In motion capture to basically chat GPT. Yeah, nah, fuck that. Bye bye.",

Now, what you're gonna see here is two voices. The first will be Ryan, the second will be Co pilot. And he's gonna be having a natural conversation like he would with a friend while he plays. Let's watch this experience. Hey, co pilot, how's it going? Hey, I'm doing great. And it looks like you're about to dive into some Minecraft. Ready to build, explore, and maybe dive a few miles? Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to make a sword. My son plays this game all the time and I have no idea what I'm doing. No worries. I'm here to help you impress your son. I see you've got a crafting table in front of you, which is a great start. To craft a sword, you'll need some materials. Can you open your inventory? Just press E on your keyboard. Yeah. Do I have what I need? Let's see, you got some sticks perfect for the sword's handle. But it looks like you're missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold or diamond. Alright, let's pause it there for a second. Did you see how co pilot not only could understand that he was in Minecraft, but he could also understand Ryan's request for help and assess the inventory on his screen? Well, it gets better as Ryan continues. He gets surprised that co pilot amazingly identified and it tailored interaction. Let's watch. Let's start by gathering some wood or stone. Shall we head out and find some resources? Yeah, that sounds great. Oh my god, what's that? Oh no. It's a zombie! Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach. If you can find a shelter or dig into the side of the hill, do it now. Just make sure it can't reach you.

You see, all you basic humans out there might go with a simple answer like Skyrim. Looking at you, honey. But I'm gonna go with a video game that I feel is a bit more esoteric. And people have forgotten about this, but it's so amazing and shouldn't be forgotten. The video game Freedom Fighters for the original Xbox. Freedom Fighters was a video game that came out in the early 2, and it was way ahead of its time. You could recruit fellow freedom fighters, and you went over and fought the Soviets. It was just great. It was a good, fun time. But then it ends on a massive cliffhanger. Spoiler alert. You repel the Soviets out of New York City, right? And everyone's jovial, everyone's celebrating. We're like, yay! We're not. We're not controlled by the Soviets anymore. The Soviets are just a not fun time. Let's all have fun and celebrate that they're gone. But the main character, Chris, he's all solemn, right? He's sad and. And yeah, I get that. He's, like, lost a bunch of stuff, right? Like his. His brother gets unalived, right? And he's had to see the horrors of war. But then when the other person comes over to comfort him, like, hey, why aren't you celebrating? He's like, well, they're just gonna be back. Like, Like, they're just gonna send their armies back here. There's no reason to celebrate. And that's when you, as the player, kind of like, oh yeah, he's got a great point there, and that's really sad. But then the credits come up and you're just kind of like, okay, well. Oh man, can't wait for Freedom Fighters too. Except I'm still waiting because it never happened. Where is freedom fighters too? Alright, are the Soviets actually gonna come back, or is Chris just kind of like, being paranoid for no reason? Did the Soviets invasion of America kind of just make them realize? Mulligan, we. We kind of just made a mistake. We're never gonna go ahead and try and rectify that issue ever again. Uh, you know, maybe we can all just kind of forget that that ever happened and try and move on. Uh, or can we finally get a sequel that actually ends the story? Freedom fighters, guys, it's a good game. Everyone should go out and play it right now. Like, literally go out, spend money on freedom fighters. Then. Then the higher UPS in video game land will be all like, hey, people are spending money on this game. Maybe we should do a sequel, because now it's worth it.",

And I've had a ton of black people message me, stitch their, stitch my video to their videos, basically calling me an Uncle Tom, this and that. Listen, so for those of you who don't know, I am a game director. So I've been making games for like, 6, 7 years. I run my own gaming company. We've made every type of game you can imagine. So when I'm talking about this, I'm talking purely in a business standpoint. Making the first Assassin's Creed Japanese game and having the main character be a black guy is a bad idea. It's literally a bad idea in every single shape or form. When I say this, I'm not talking about whether or not the story of the samurai was real. I don't care. I believe or not, I don't give a shit. I don't care. I also know that there's another main character that's a Japanese girl, but most of the time, that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a main male character. But we all know that what we really want is a male Japanese character. And I think that's completely fair. The Assassin's Creed game that was set in Africa had a black guy. The game that was set in Italy had an Italian game that was set in London had Londoners. So why would You make an Assassin's Creed game that set in Japan and make it be a black guy as the main character? That's ridiculous. If you want to add Yasuki into the thing, add him as a DLC. Simple, everybody's happy. But making him the main character is a complete bad idea.",

    "voice_to_text": "What are some things you don't like about video games? Now, before you start to comment your dumbass answers, hear me out cause I'm at the fucking rant. So I'm playing Sonic Frontiers, right? This game just came out two years ago for Sonic Team on some multi platforms. I know for the jump. This game has seven out of tens reviews. It's just lukewarm reception, not a masterpiece. It's just a casual Sonic things and what you expect out of a Fucking Sonic game, right? So I don't beat the main campaign and now I'm doing this whole another world DOC part, which is like another side mode. We can just collect shit, play with Tails, Knuckles, Amy, all that shit, right? So I'm at this part where I'm supposed to jump this fifth tower or whatever. And mind you, I've been probably invested about three to four or five hours into this shit, cause I don't collected everything that I was supposed to do. So tell me why after running this fifth tall ass tower, after trials and everything, and this shit is hard as hell. Once I get up to this bitch and I'm talking to this motherfucker when it's a cutscene, tell me why the after this cutscene, I'm stuck in this long ass loading screen, right? I'm sitting there waiting. I think it's gonna be a boss battle. I'm waiting for like two minutes. I'm waiting for four minutes, I'm waiting for seven fucking minutes. And nothing's about to happen. But once I close the game and I restarted it, guess what? Guess what happened? I started all the way to the fucking beginning. Basically, my whole point being is that this game requires you to manually say because the auto safe system is fucking ass cheeks. Sonic team. Fuck you guys.",

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so the tweet says what are your top 5 must play PS two games for somebody who has never experienced the console before? Honestly, just coming up with 5 games for the PS two, that's kind of hard. But fuck it, let's give it a shot. Never played a PS two. You gotta go with NBA Street volume 2. Don't even worry about the first one, the second one is everything you need plus more. no sports game captures the essence of the 2 better than NBA Street volume 2. Once again hitting y'all with another EA Big game SSX tricky. Anybody who even still owns a PS two is mandatory that you got this in your collection. This goes without saying. If we talking PS two must play games, then the GTA trilogy is definitely on that list. I could just pick one of these three so I said fuck it, need a whole trilogy. If you're new to this console and you wanna know just how much of a technology leap that this console took over the PS one, you gotta play Middle Gear Solid 2. Where? This game came out in 2001. And honestly, looking back at this shit, these graphics are still impressive. The graphics in this game set the standard for damn near every game moving forward this generation. So we got a sports game, a racing game, action adventure game, and some open world games, but what we don't have is a Fighting game, and that's what I come in at with Mortal Kombat, Deadly Alliance, and I won't need that. Big of a fan of the 3D era Mortal Kombat, but Deadly Alliance was my shit. Honorable mention the OG god of war, because you cannot call yourself a friend of my boy Kratos unless you've been there from day one. So if you ain't never touched the PS two, you gotta touch the OG god of war. It's mandatory. so those are the games that in my opinion are must play PS two games. So if you had to put somebody onto that console, you tell me what game that you haven't played.",

    "voice_to_text": "You wanna know what makes The Last of us such a timeless classic? Is the fact that the difference between this game and most games is that when other games end, they just end. The story wraps up. There's nothing to debate or discuss. So when it comes to The Last of us, it's been 11 years and people are still asking was Joe right or was Joe wrong? Like, this man really had the key to potentially save humanity forever, but he didn't take the opportunity and decide to save Ellie. We watched Joe lose his humanity when he lost Sarah, but then we watched him regain his humanity when he met up with Ellie. And it took a minute too, cause he wasn't fucking with her at first. That's exactly why I say Bill is one of the most underrated characters in this whole universe. Because people don't realize he's part of the reason why Joe regained his humanity. We can talk about that in another video though. And what makes the game even more diabolical is the fact that it really took his time and made you bond with them too. The dialogue they shared. Especially when Ellie drop this line right here. Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking except for you. And that line is why this scene is so impactful. Instead of saving the entire world, he decided to save this one girl. But was it selfish? Was His own heartbreaking emotions more important than the survival of the human race. But at the same time, it also poses the question, would this shit have even worked in the first place? Because her death could have easily been in vain. But unfortunately, we never know. And then that leaves me into The Last of Us Part 2, and how this also is a time was classic. A game that y'all hate on a little bit too much. I will make a video about that, too. Because when Joe killed that doctor, who just so happened to be Abby's father, she did whatever it took to get revenge for someone who she loved. But y'all blame her for yet somehow don't blame Joe for this. So I ask you, put yourself in Joe's predicament. You play the game. You know the story. Was Joe right or was Joe wrong? The fact that we can still ask that question 11 years later just goes to show you that this game is absolute perfection.",

Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

Everybody else knows that they're boosted, but they don't know. And I can't tell if it's sad, if it's funny, if you wanna let them live and their ignorance. But this is the case right now with this person. My. My Kiriko, slash Zed. He was on my team a lot of times. He was on support, that when he was on the enemy team, he was on DPS. Um, this was 5 a M. Quick play, so there wasn't really a lot to pick from. Normally he would never be in my lobbies. A long story short, he decided to switch off Anna and goes then into Sombra and proceeded to get farmed. Now, look, it's quick play. You're allowed to play what you want. I definitely had games where I played into my counters, but we've still won. Sometimes we lost, but I wanted to play who I wanted to play, so that's fine. But when I'm doing that, I'm opening myself up to criticism by my teammates and the enemy team, and I have to be okay with that. He was not. And that's fine. It is what it is. So, of course, the very next game, he's on the enemy team, and this is pretty much how it went. Now, granted, I don't know if you guys know how my mama works, but my mama Is at least two wheelers higher than his. So I'm gonna get worse teammates, and that's, you know, it happens all the time. That doesn't really bother me. You know, you lose some, you win some. It's just a game. But it does make me wonder, like, do they choose to be oblivious? Do they genuinely think that they're the ones that are doing the work? Like, I think it's pretty obvious. At least, you know, I know when I'm not playing well, and I know when I look at a scoreboard and just how people are playing, who's the problem and who's not. And it's a little embarrassing that everybody else can see what you can",

From the fucking designs of the character to the little things you need, to the crafting table, to the round table, to. To the boss you gotta fight, to the wounds you gotta get to, um, upgrading, being wise without that team, testing which ones to use, going back rebirth and all that. To the co op, to the Pvp. So to see the random players within your game, to see how people die and laugh at it, to see the messages, how funny they were, the weapons, the upgrades. Absolute Cinema. 10 out of 10 across the board. This is my favorite game that I've ever played for America on stream. And that's facts. They didn't release the DLC on top of that. Bro, don't you go up in a hurry. Your mama be worried. Oh, it was all part of the story.",

Y'all gave me a chance to explore a new game that is not in our category that we don't normally do. And we beat it and we had a great time. I've never seen this many people tuned in, not even for my subathon. That just goes to show gaming is really huge. And I really respect elderly going to the. Going to the ratings of the game. I've played Red Dead Redemption 2. I've played, um. We beat in Minecraft. Um. What else? Um. What else? What else? What else? What else? We did a lot. We've done a lot of shit. Okay. And to the souls community, bro. First of all, y'all niggas are some gamers. Second of all, this game is a masterpiece. Did it deserve game of the year? Yes, 100%. I don't give a fuck who it was the winner up on. I don't give a fuck who what is. Who was the winner. God of war! Love. God of war! I love you. I love you. This game is a cinema. Although I died multiple times, it was very rewarding. I literally enjoyed every boss death. It felt. I've never felt some shit in my. In my. In my. In my soul like this. I don't know what game compared to this right now. This is an absolute cinema. From the fucking designs of the character. To the little things you need to the crafting table, to the round table to. To the bosses you gotta fight, to the rooms you gotta get to. Um. Upgrading being wise without that team, testing which ones to use, going back rebirth and all that. To the co op, to the Pvp to. To seeing random players within your game. To see how people die and laugh at it. To see the messages how funny they were.",

This is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. And this is gonna be a big issue. So if you don't know, the newest Assassin's Creed was released. Well, the trailer was released, and then they were basically saying that it's set in Japan, and then instead of a Japanese protagonist, a Japanese main character, we have a black samurai as the main character now. Cool. I have. I have no issue with that. If you wanna do a black thing, that's fine, whatever. They could have done that as a DLC though, as a extra content, as anything else. But making that the main character of the series, of the. The game is a bad thing. This is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. First of all, it's gonna cause division. There's obviously gonna be people who don't like it because the guy is black or whatever. Cool, whatever. But making him a central character in the first Japanese game is one of the worst decisions ever, and it's gonna backfire badly once again. For those of you who don't understand, the main issue is the fact that he's. That he's a black guy in ancient Japan. That doesn't really make much sense in terms of, like, um, I. I know the story of the Samurai, I know that some people say it's true and all that, but you should have chose. They should have chosen a Japanese guy.

There's been leaks going around of lightsabers, jetpacks, and a new warzone map. It all launches on May 29th. We know it'll be Vanguard themed, but the CAR 98 and STG making a comeback. We're also getting a Gundam and fallout bundle. An in game event revealing BO6, a MIL sim operator from OGM W3, Sergeant Hammer, a Frank Woods operator, plus the Mustang and Sally pistols. Now if the new LTM in warzone is related to Gundam, you'll be playing rebirth with jet packs and lightsabers. You see, M W3 is around 200 40 gigs already, so we're adding another hundred gigs on top of that. The Halo Master Chief Collection is six games in one, and it's only 100 and twenty gigs total. Now this has got me thinking. Hey, they're bringing back for. Can season 4 be cottage just poorly optimized or see, they're bloating its size to fill up your console so you can't play other games?

Japanese characters, how that equates to me tap dancing and me performing or whatever. But yeah, you got me. I mispronounced his name wrong. Is Yasuke. Just like Sasuke. I get it now. But I don't see how me wanting two Japanese characters in a Japanese theme game makes me some kind of whatever y'all have been calling me. And if it's because I said he's a retainer, why you mad? Cause that's what he was, a retainer. I mean, you can say it's a kind of samurai, sure, whatever. But is it a samurai or is it retainer because of its retainer? You can't be mad at me for saying something that's a fact. So again, I'm just waiting to see something logical.

I mean, but other than that, what do y'all got? You know, raccoons and whatever kind of things you wanna throw. That don't mean nothing, man. It doesn't apply to here, so it doesn't mean nothing to me. I'm a 5 foot 5 black, Muslim raised man. You think I ever heard all the jokes in the book? Everything y'all got is not phasing me, I'm just waiting for an actual logical rebuttal to what I said, and I have not seen one.",

I shouldn't have to play a game where all I say is hi and the whole game is thrown and I'm in hell for the next 40 minutes because men are being emotional about it. That is not normal and that's not how the old Cod days were. Because I promise you, as a man, you have never had somebody throw on the basis of your gender. That doesn't happen. You can say it happens. You're lying. I'm sorry. I don't know why that's such a common thing in the comments of my videos. You guys wanna be oppressed so bad that you look at a man calling me a telling me he's gonna tell me to get back in the kitchen and say it's not a woman thing and say that that happens to you too. It doesn't. There's a reason that historically male dominated spaces are known for being toxic and unsafe. That goes for gaming, that goes for sports. Any male dominated space is a bad one. That's not me being sexist. That is me saying there is an inherent issue with the way that you guys have your locker room talk that makes everybody else feel unsafe. I don't know how you could possibly find it fun to make other people feel unsafe. No woman is Asking men to make gaming a safe space with sunshine and rainbows and everything. But could you please be normal? Because I wanna be able to enjoy playing the game without my life being threatened, without my body being threatened. Because I'm existing as a woman and men are the ones making it unsafe. I do not care if you feel targeted by me saying men, or if you feel attacked by me saying men, you are part of the problem. If you feel attacked by that, you're part of the problem. If you say, just mute them, you're part of the problem. If you sit there and let them say that me and you don't intervene, you are part of the problem. Because I have a lot of male friends, a normal male friends who don't say slurs and don't threaten people and just play like normal. I understand it is not all men. But if you are not one of the men doing this, it is entirely on you to help stop the men who are. If you don't understand that, and you don't understand power imbalances and gender hierarchy, it's not my place to teach you. I'm not your mother, I'm not your teacher. Close the game for five minutes and educate yourself. But stop making this a bad experience for everybody else who's just trying to play the game.",

I just downloaded Fallout Shelter and I've been playing the fuck out of it. I've been enjoying it. That's how you know shit's grim. That's how you know there's no turning back. The light at the end of the tunnel has been snuffed out. Bro, I got so desperate on Fallout Shelter because I was like man, this cannot be all I'm doing. I downloaded Fallout 4 and I made one of my residents in Fallout Shelter in Fallout 4. And whenever I would send this motherfucker on Wasteland Expeditions, I'd boot up Fallout 4 and play as them. I would pretend that I was him going on the adventure, and whenever I was done close Fallout 4, get back on Fallout Shelter. Send that motherfucker back. Get back to business. That is never the answer. It's never. Man, this Elden Ring DLC doesn't drop soon if they don't put out like a new Resident Evil or something man. Fuck dude. I've been so desperate for just a lick of fun. Anything. I know. Fortnite Ain't gonna give me that shit. I'm a Fortnite supporter. I always have been. That being said, that's probably the least fun game out there you can play right now. If they added the X Men, I'd forgive them. But they're not gonna do that because half those motherfuckers are Battle Pass locked and the other half are cable. I'm good, bro. I was so desperate for a good time, and I hopped on the JoJo's fighting game for the first time in, like, a year. One of my buddies, dude, I was fucking their ass so badly, bro. I was sweating and convulsing. I was hyperventilating. They don't even wanna play games with me no more. They almost didn't even watch a movie with me last night, man. We were gonna watch something. I don't remember what we were gonna watch. This movie by the dude who made a coyote. It's called like Z Ram. Motherfucker bailed. It's. I don't like what you've become, man.

Y'all remember Assassin's Creed 2? Leonardo da Vinci was in that game. Wait till y'all find out he never built weapons for assassin's in real life. Or what about Assassin's Creed 3 where you play as a Native American during the American Revolution war? Wait till y'all find out he wasn't actually there for the declaration of independence. Matter of fact, bro wasn't there at all. He didn't fucking exist, bros. The first main character in Assassin's Creed to actually exist. This isn't the first time he's been shown as a samurai either. Yasuke's been all over game shows and movies as a samurai dog. I just think a game in Japan should have a Japanese main character. My brother in Christ, he's right there. Everybody's ignoring her. A Japanese Shinobi ninja sounds cool as shit. You don't even gotta play as Yasuke, you could play as her the whole time I watched. Y'all hate on this game because it was a ghost of Tsushima clone. So what do y'all actually want from this game? Y'all should be mad at a 130 dollar ultimate edition. Y'all should be mad at them locking Missions behind pre orders. They've always taken historical events and built their own story around them. I'm not saying it'll be good. These characters might be ass. But is this really that big of a deal to y'all?

And why are you taking two promotional videos that I got paid to do opposed to the videos that I just do for fun? Like you post every couple of months? I post consistently through the month. Plus I don't even post long form on the regular. I post more shorts than I do. But what does this have to do with you being wrong? Oh, you're projecting. I'm. That's what it is. You're projecting. I'm sorry, sweetheart. What did you. What did you say? Can be felt across the earth by Kakashi and Sakura who were still on the Ninja War battlefield, not in the final valley. Like how you tried to lie in your response with. Somebody explain to me why I know More about Naruto than you basic fans do, buddy. There's a map. The. The valley at the end is in the land of fire. That's where they were. You know, Google is free. While the saying some. If you read that chapter after they had their little bullshit conversation, Sasuke leave Naruto chases after. And they're not that far from the current location. Which is why after the battle, Sakura and Kakashi literally could just walk to them. Because they were in the area. I don't know how else to tell, bro. Is they have a map. They have a whole map. Like, you're really bad at this, Draco. This is sad. Can y'all do me a favor? Can y'all go let him know he took an L, please? Wait, hold on. Let me give myself a prediction. This next video will be him still hiding behind an AI, yapping, and then projecting. I gotta stop using big words. You don't understand big word? This is pitiful. Can I. Can I get a better debater? Please? Can somebody find me a better one? I think the one I got is broken.",

However, though, if you are vanilla flavor flavor and your attitude is as messy as a melted ice cream, motherfucking tragedy, your ASS is rotten as a smell of tuna. I find it funny when people ask for authentic stories and authentic characters. They really want it, but then when they get it, they are the same ones to reject it because they think it's pandering. It's like, how can you be okay with this but not be okay with this? Like, how can you be okay with this but not be okay with this? Some of y'all vanilla people really think that black people only spawn in the 1600s, and it's kind of sad. All it really took was a quick Google search to find out who Yasuke really is. And I did not know that there was a Black Samurai in Japan, which is newsworthy to me. Now, whether or not this game is gonna be good, I'm gonna buy it because I got to show support because we don't get these stories so often when y'all have so many other stories out there that Penarthy y'all, and we can't have one for us or anyone else.

I am. I'm not gonna lie to you and say that some people were coping a little bit too hard. Like, her mannerism. She got the mannerisms down. Like, Bella Ramsey is objectively a very talented actress, but like, there's also a point where you lose me, understand? Bella Ramsey is going to have to play basically female John Wick. Like, the themes of season 2 are so much darker than season one for every single character. Here's the thing, Bella Ramsey can play a child, and she can play a child really well. Yeah, now. Now you're gonna have to play a Ellie who merks a pregnant lady. And I even say, I'm sorry, these look like you 14 year olds going on a school trip. Like, that would be okay in season 1. Season 2. No, no, no. Like, the themes changed and like, it wouldn't bother me if you didn't have people that look like Dina. Like, how do you miss on Dina too? And Dina is really cool in the site. Like, I don't want them to mess up Dina either. And, like, how do you miss with Dina and Ellie? But, like, you get a almost perfect casting of Jesse in the. Throw gasoline on the fire. How does the actress for Abigail look more like Ellie than the actress for Ellie? But, like, here's the. Here's the after part. This actress right here was offered the role of Ellie in season one, but they turned her down for Bella Ramsey. Like, I, I, I kind of understand because I'm, I'm sorry. This does not look like a 14 year old, but I'm sorry, now we have the reverse issue in this looks like a 14 year old trying to play an adult. Let me clear this up again. Bella Ramsay is a great actress, but do you know what the male equivalent of this is? This is like Timothy Salome trying to play Cal Drogo from game of Thrones. Timothy Salome is objectively one of the most talented new actors right now. He's not pulling off Calidrogo. That is the equivalent of Bella Ramsey trying to play Ellie in part 2. Like, I'm sorry, at this point, for anybody who knows what's coming, you are setting up Bella Ramsey for failure. She's gonna try her best, but I'm sorry, it's just not gonna hit.",

    "voice_to_text": "X defiant is about to be a top three FPS game, all thanks to a major decision that players have been begging to see from call of duty. The peak call of duty games and X defiant actually have a lot of things in common, one of them being the brains behind the operation, Mark Rubin, who worked for Activision as the executive producer during the Modern Warfare series. But more importantly, he understands better than anyone that skill based matchmaking has played a huge factor in a call of duty struggles. So today the team released a statement confirming there will be no skill based matchmaking in the casual playlist for X Defiance. The statement continues on saying skill based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive, constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and varied, similar to how prime call of duty was. X defiant will find matches in order of these priorities latency avoided, players, party size, region, input device, and then platform. Once in the lobby. Teams will still be balanced though. They also confirmed that ranked will be added in a future season, and those matches will be prioritized based on ranked points.",

It ain't no hating shit, nothing like that. It was just a challenge. Mainly for myself. Right? I'm just a person who loves Elder Ring and souls one games in general. There's a lot of people that were talking shit about Carson that the whole time, you know. I'm saying if we're keeping it 100, he's playing very well. People talking shit cause of how long it took him to Beat Tree Sentinel. But I know now they still haven't beat it in the game. Been out for 2 years. And as far as the main story, he's basically halfway through. And I know man. That have dropped the game. That haven't got half as far as Kai. So all in all bro, I hope Kai really finishes the game. I hope you can do this shit. I believe in you bro. Is definitely doable. Just gotta download the boss's moves bro. And sometimes it take a little time. But you gonna get that shit, bro.

It was people yelling into their mic whatever slurs that they heard on the elementary playground. Sorry to ruin your little internet dreams, but it also wasn't like that for every game. There were some online games that they were pretty chill for. The people that, like, attended land parties and had real life friends to play games with, they wasn't so excited to be weird online as many of them was.

I mean, of course, they're still generators, they're still exit gates, there's just more of them. Uh, we've made five maps bigger to accommodate all of the action, all of the chaos. And we're also doing way with perks in this mode instead, introducing a new sort of 2 v eight exclusive system called classes for survivors. That's right, yes. So when it comes to survivors, basically, once you've chosen your character, you can select and equip a player class, and this class is effectively your power for the match. And it helps players identify what your role is within the team. Instead of mixing and matching perks. Instead, we really wanted to focus on a particular playstyle for this, and whether it's generator, repair, healing, looping, speed, that kind of thing. That's what we're really going for with these classes. But we will be introducing a new mechanic, which is a team power. For example, if you are the Wraith, when you cloak yourself, if your teammate is within a certain radius of you, they will also get the undetectable status effect. We're doing away with hooks as well. There's no hooks into V8. Instead, once it was down to survivor, they'll be able to send them to a cage. This works very similar to Pyramid Head. It will teleport the survivor to another part of the map, away from The and of course, this still counts as hook states. So once you've been hooked three times, you'll be out of the match.",

This game is honestly so chill and a lot of fun, and I love a chill, just sweet man. And that's literally every single man that plays this game. So he's husband material. Next up we have Elden Ring. Of course. I always talk about how amazing Elden Ring guys are, but seriously, if your man plays Elden Ring, you need to make him your husband. They are genuinely just the most sweet, amazing guys you will ever find. Third up, we've got Titanfall two. Men that play Titanfall 2 have to be so loyal cause there's not that many people that play this game anymore. Most of them have moved to APEX. So if he plays Titanfall 2 still, you know he's loyal and you know he's husband material. Next up we've got god of war. I love men who play story games. Men that play story games are honestly just the best. And if he plays god of war and is super into the story, he's definitely husband material. And last but certainly not least, we have Fallout 4. The story of this game is absolutely amazing. It is genuinely a really, really interesting game, and the guys that play it are super, super into it and I love that. So if he Plays Fallout 4.

Overwatch is the best FPS game of all time because it's the only FPS game that I've ever played where the better team always wins. Whereas in games like Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant or CSGO, if you have one player that just pops off they can single handedly win you a game even if the rest of their team is worse than the enemy team. That's what I love about Overwatch is that it feels like if your team is better, you will win. Because teamwork and team play is valued much higher than individual play in Overwatch. That is also why I absolutely hate Widowmaker, because she is, in my opinion, the only character that makes this statement untrue. Widow is the only character that can single handedly carry her own team to a win when they do not deserve it. You could have Helen Kellers as supports. Hank and your other DPS in a widow could still win you the game. And I'm saying this as somebody who has been that widow player. I know it's so foreign for you to wrap your mind around the fact that someone can have an opinion on something that is not detrimental to them. It can even be beneficial to them at times. But still, they can point out that It's problematic to anybody that says all you have to do is go dive. Do you realize that you literally are reworking your entire camp just for one character, regardless of the map that you're playing on or the other characters on the enemy team? If that doesn't scream problematic, I don't know what does.",

Or people who talk shit about games before they even get a chance to play it. This game looks trash. Bro, shut the fuck up. It ain't even came out yet man. This one needs to be addressed every single time. Male gamers who give female gamers a hard time just because they women like yeah bro, tell us you don't actually get no poom poom without actually saying it. Yeah yeah bro, I know girls Probably gave you a hard time for being a gamer. But it's probably cause your ass don't take a fucking shower. Y'all boys be swag, listen dirty as hell, and wonder why you don't get no hoes. That shit is preposterous behavior, my boy. Put the controller down sometimes, touch some grass, and learn how to talk to women. It ain't that hard, my boy.

    "voice_to_text": "It's okay for a game to be short. Hellblade 2 is dropping in a couple of weeks and it looks very solid. It's running on Unreal Engine 5. The graphics look insane. There's a lot to be excited about with this one. When the trailer started dropping, everybody started talking about how this felt like it could be Xbox's answer to god of war. But it's totally not that. This game is going to be six to eight hours long, and it's not going to be a full priced game. It's only 50 bucks instead of seventy. Obviously we'll see how good the game actually is in a couple of weeks, but I'm all in on shorter games that pack a punch instead of companies always going for bigger maps and bigger open worlds with hundreds of hours of content. I totally get the concept of bang for your buck, especially with games being as expensive as they are. 70 bucks for a game like Dragon's Dog Mewtwo that you can play for weeks and still not technically feel like you finished everything would keep you busy for longer. But a game like Hellblade 2 that's about seven hours long, or even a Spider Man 2 that takes 12 to 15 for the story, or about a day if you're trying to 100% the game is the sweet spot. I love that. Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I've got other things that are going on in life. I Don't mind if a game is shorter if the content and the story that it's delivering make the time that I spend playing the game more memorable and worthwhile. I'm not saying that every game needs to be seven or eight hours long, because some games need to be hundreds or thousands of hours because of what players expect from them, which is totally cool. I'm just saying.",

Especially the Lost Legacy expansion with Chloe and Nadine. Because for some strange reason I like Lost Legacy better than the main game. I don't know, maybe that's just me since we own Naughty Dog. While I do wish that they would make a new game, I had no problem when they remaster The Last of us because The Last of us is another game that I will replay the shit out of. I played the original on PS three, played the remaster on PS four, and of course I had to get over PS five. I was a no brainer 11 years later in the replay value in this game is crazy. Whenever I'm feeling nostalgic but don't wanna go back too far, I go to a game like Max Pain 3. See, Max Pain is an old game that has very modern control so it's easy to play. This. Tell you, out of that whole PS three and Xbox 3 60 era, Max Pain 3 might be one of the top five most best age games. I don't care how many times me and my old lady beat this game, we will continue to replay it. It's kind of like a tradition at this point. We already do for like a third playthrough. What makes the Replay value on this game so great is because no matter how many times you beat it, every time you play it is still gonna be challenging. Hands down the greatest co op game ever made. Honorable mention. I don't give a damn how long this game is, I'm playing this shit again. It was crazy that every time I replay this game, I run into a situation that I didn't experience the last time. Alright, so those are the games that I love replaying. What are some of the games that y'all love replaying?",

Just kinda just playing the game. I feel like everybody has these games. And so I'm gonna go first. And of course, knowing me, I have more than one answer. So first answer is gonna be my, I guess, my original answer before the other game released. And so this game's been my, like, just chill game for the longest time for a number of reasons. One, it's a chill game for me to just stream because I get to just have conversations with everybody while I play it. And two, is a chill game for me just because I can sit down and I can play through the entire game in one sitting. And that game for me is gonna be RE 3. This is a very chill game for me. Like, it didn't used to be, used to be a stressful game, but it's very chill now because I've been playing it for so long that I could just sit down, play the game and have conversation with people on stream. Now, this other game is kind of a chill game for me because it's a world that I enjoy getting immersed into and characters that I love, uh, interacting with. And so that's gonna be Final Fantasy 7 rebirth. Like, that's a chill game for me because the open World is so vast and you can do a whole bunch of things in it that it's easy to just get lost and just enjoy myself playing the game. And most of the time I don't like that about open worlds, about getting lost and stuff. But because this is different, it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's universe that I enjoy being in the game. Like, I'm okay with that. Kind of want them to do the same thing for 5 98. As always, comment and stitch because I always want to see your responses.",

Literally has a clause we've confirmed now with 5 people where it says engaging in malicious comparisons with competitors or belittling the gameplay or providing subjective negative reviews of the game. And people are just signing this without reading it just to get a game key. So I'm not playing this game anymore. Don't expect me to play this game anymore. It's ridiculous. And I hope some much more popular people than me blow this up cause that is very not okay. I've just extremely not okay. Just for reference, that's just for codes. It's not for like sponsors. It's just to get a game code, man. Wow, so they want you to sign a non disparagement just to get a game code? You know, there's a word for that. It's actually two words. It's called access journalism. Hopefully, uh, some more people talk about this. Just how ridiculous it is. They ask you to be professional about the game. Nothing wrong with that. It says you are not allowed to give a negative review professional about the game. Bro, that is not being professional. Being professional is whenever you tell them they're good professional. That is the opposite. It's definitely like Marvel or someone big Korpa is going crazy. And that's not even a sponsor. Yeah, that's insane. Yeah, I think he has every Right. To be annoyed about it. And also, I don't think that he should stop streaming the game. I think stream the game and shit on the game if you think that there's something wrong with it. And if they shut you down, you are a martyr. And you're gonna get so much attention, everybody's gonna support you. Cause they're not gonna execute on this, and it's just gonna make you look good if this happens. And I understand, like, this is kind of like a bad way of. Of going about things, but, um, I'm just being realistic. Right. Like, this is kind of like. This is what my vibe of the game is, is like, this game just looks like Overwatch. Point 5. It doesn't piss with this way until they see my red box. It looks like. Yeah, there you go. You know what it looks like? It looks like if Nexon made an Overwatch clone. That's what it looks like. It's like a phone game company makes the phone game or PC game version of Overwatch. Like the game. It just looks cheap. So, yeah, Seagulls totally right about this. Makes sense now why lyric and shroud says they don't have access to the Alpha. I don't know what they expected from mobile game developer. It is textbook access journalism. There's nothing good about it. What a surprise. It looks like kind of a terrible game too. So, uh. Yeah, that's what you get.",

    "voice_to_text": "This game is gonna actually Deebo Overwatch's player base. Marvel Rivals is doing everything Overwatch does but better. It's almost as if they have my guy Jeff Kaplan secretly working on this game. I cannot stress enough the abundance of parallels there are. The pacing is steady just like Overwatch. The game modes are the same from 2CP to pushing the old payload. The characters are even. All either direct reskins or fusions of Overwatch characters. Take Star Lord for example. His blicks shoot just like tracers, but then he has this move that's basically like Reaper's death blossom. And his ultimate is soldier 76 is tactical visor. Yeah, this game has tons of similarities. Enough to keep anyone who enjoys Overwatch satisfy. And then there's the several things that put this game a cut above. There's the obvious stuff like the fact that this game will be free to play. The fact that it has beloved Marvel characters who all just like an Overwatch banter back and forth with funny voice lines. There's the fact that Marvel rivals is 6 v 6, which is a revert back to the classic Overwatch, which I believe was the best time for the game. The third person perspective works so good in this type of game. So many characters flying and moving around. It feels a lot more controlled from this perspective. Not to mention the fact that you can actually see what skins are rocking. This game has the traditional tank Damage and support classes, but it also has these team up moves you can do. You put certain characters on a team together. It even has a built in clan system. They call it factions. As well as a built in tournament system. And overall, even with this being an alpha, this game is incredibly polished. You can tell that net ease is taking this game serious and leaving no stone unturned. Some of y'all know this. I worked really close with the Overwatch crew team for for years. I have a lot of love for that franchise, but that also means I had a front row seat to its fall from Grace as Activision and now Microsoft have continued to destroy the quality that Blizzard first put out. And now with this hungry Marvel back game that's doing a lot of the same stuff people loved about the old days of Overwatch and more. I'm not too biased to admit that.",

The whole point is it was gonna be completely different with PvE and missions and shit. Never fully happened, bro. The new character skill trees out the window never happened. Now the game is more grindy and monetized than ever. I get back on to play with friends every now and then, but I quickly remember why I stopped playing. This one is bad, bro. The biggest chokehold on me for a decade. I have everything, bro. Apartments, a submarine. There's no need for me to get back on and play this. Game. But I just downloaded it last night. It's like every couple months I gotta get back on and play. I don't know why. Had to stop playing cause my character was living better than me. Shit was sad. For real.

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

I mean when it's done tastefully it can actually be fun. Like the old need for speed games. They used to have Best Buy and Burger King ads all across the map. But I hope you didn't forget that. They have tried this once and it definitely didn't go to plan back in 2020. EA put ads into UFC 4 for the boys that would pop up in the middle of fights. EA was forced to backtrack as players were rightfully upset. Especially since there was no mention of this before launch and they added the ads a month after everyone already bought the game. Although the CEO says they're in the very early stages of testing, it's clear EA is putting a lot of thought into how they can get ads into the games that you're paying for.",

And would y'all believe me if I said the switch came out back in 2017, seven years ago? I didn't believe it at first, I'm not gonna lie. But then I remembered I have my switch since 2018. Yeah, this switch right here, I've had it since 2018, and it's been holding it down. I'm not gonna lie, the switch had a great life cycle, and I look forward to this newest console. If his back was compatible with the switch, i'mma sell my switch. Cause if his back was compatible, there's no point of having it. And the switch was announced back in March of 2015. I was a senior in high school. I was 18 years old, and I'm 27 now. It really goes to show that Tom really flaws. But. Yo, Nintendo, if y'all watching this, when it comes to this new console for the controllers, can y'all please make sure the shit don't got stick drift on it? I love the switch as much as the next person with the stick drifting. These fucking bum ass Joy Cons is fucking annoying.

Go to Tsushima's upcoming PC port. Will not be sold in any countries without PlayStation Network. That includes 177 regions around the world where the game had been available for pre order until just recently. Anyone from those regions who did pre order will be getting a refund, so at least they aren't charging customers for a product they can't use anymore. But if you're from one of those 177 regions, you can't play ghost of Sushi MA on PC anymore. But as you can see here, this is a refund email from Green Man Gaming specifically calling out we have to refund your money because you're from a country without PlayStation Network support. So far, developer Sucker Punch, surely wary of the backlash that hit Arrowhead a week ago, has confirmed that players will need to log into PlayStation Network to access the game's multiplayer features, but the single player content can be played without it. Sucker Punch implies in their email that this decision came from Sony, and that would track, but it's a shame that so many people will be locked out of a game for a problem that is solvable. If only Sony would allow it to be.",

If you want the proper conditions of toba or repentance, Allah says, you admit your sin, you seek forgiveness, you promise not to do it again, and that's it. You're gone. Right? Done. I stopped the sin. I admitted it. I sought forgiveness from Allah. I promise not to repeat it again. There goes. May Allah, subhanahu WA ta'ala grant us the ability to turn to him at all times.

Israel was warned by the United States that if they were to commence with the ground invasion in Rafah, that shipments of weapons would halt. So today, this Israeli official, Talib Guth Liab, sent a message to the United States. She said, the US is threatening not to give us precise missiles. Then mockingly, she said, oh, yeah, well, I got news for the US. We have imprecise missiles, and we have the right to defend ourselves. So maybe instead of using a precise missile and taking down a specific room or a specific building, I'll use my imprecise missiles and I'll just collapse 10 buildings. 10 buildings! This statement was the official response of Israel to the halted shipment of weapons. All because the United States told them to not enter a Rafah and begin the ground invasion, and they didn't like that. So now the amount of unaliving and destruction will be on the United States's hands, as if it's all one big oops. 10 buildings instead of a specific room. Yesterday, images of specific rooms were released from Rafa, and the only people who were victims in those specific rooms were children. And let's not even mention the fact that maybe, just maybe, one of the hostages might be in one of those 10 buildings. Oh, wait, but that doesn't actually matter, does it?",

Swift is so red hot, she even has nation states squabbling over being a mere stop on her errors tour. Why? They call it the Swift effect. You see, wherever Taylor Swift goes, so do people's wallets, and everyone wants a piece of the action. It's partly the reason she was time magazine's person of the year in 2023. She's so mainlined into pop culture right now, even universities want in.

Even if the Collector's Edition is not that good, which I've been disappointed before. First in line to pre order that Collector's edition. At this point it even stems a little bit the shimmy gummy tensei. First in line to pre order them cause I got a problem. Yep. I have a couple others that I'll do that with too. It's not just those two, but let me know down in the comment section what's your day one purchase game, series or franchise?

    "view_count": 23700,
    "voice_to_text": "We just got an update in Helldiverse 2, and here's everything they changed. Starting with the R9 Eruptor has increased explosion damage by 40 and removed shrapnel from explosions. This helps with players either blowing themselves up or their teammates around them. And over in enemies, we have increased shriekersight and hearing range. Then we have increased gunship hearing ranges. Well, we also got a list of gameplay fixes, such as fixing issues with damage over time. Firing the Punisher plasma while wearing a shield backpack will no longer damage. Helldivers fixed an issue with scopes not being aligned in first person view. The sound when stimming no longer plays, even when it's interrupted. Ager orders with the kill test now track scores correctly. Helldivers can no longer land on tall rocks in eradication missions. Helldivers can no longer land on top of bug pillars in terminative control missions. Fixed an issue for players not being able to reinforce after leaving and rejoining. And the list goes on. With the number of crash and menufixes, this will be the last update until May 9th, which is when we'll get a new Polar Patriots Warbond full of three new armor sets, three new capes, and four new weapons, such as the P13 verdict, the AR sixty one Tenderizer, the SMG seventy two Pummler, the PLAS one O 1 Purifier, and the Incendiary Impact Grenade. What weapons are you most excited for and what do you wanna see the mad next?",

Well, you should, because it's actually all the negative reviews that the game got when PlayStation announced PC players would have to connect to a PSN account. But now that they changed their mind, the community is rallying to create something to commemorate this victory for democracy. It really started to blow up when CEO Johan Pilsett tweeted this image of a quote accidental cape design, which got community members making other versions of the design. This one, dubbed the Prodigal Sun, even features a tall blue column referencing Operation Cleanup, the new campaign that the community is working on to reverse the effects of the review bombing. And it's working. As of now, the game's rating has moved up from overwhelmingly negative to mixed. What's even better, though, is that Arrowhead is apparently thinking about making the graph an official cape. They just haven't thought of a good name for it yet. What do you think it should be called? Let us know!",

It was just shown via an internal email that Microsoft is shutting down four Bethesda studios Arcane Austin, Tangle Game Works, the people who did Hi Fi Rush, Alpha Dog, and Roadhouse. Arcane Austin was the people responsible for Redfall. That means there will be no further DLC. So yes, if you spent the hundred and like $50 for all the DLC content, you're gonna be compensated for that. You will not see that DLC. I feel like this isn't really that surprising. I mean, it's again, super unfortunate. This should never be the case whatsoever. I do believe Roadhouse is gonna be merged with another studio, but Alpha Dog is shutting down. But Tango Game works. What the. Hi fi rush is an absolute masterpiece. If you've never played The Evil Within, I could not encourage you more to do so. This is a underrated masterpiece. This team is such a talented studio. I would have never expected to see this. I mean, this just got added to the PS five. Also tweeted out. Just this super small thing. Super freaking tragic, man. I genuinely feel for these guys. This. This has absolutely nothing to do with freaking talent, which is absolutely baffling. I freaking hate this trend that we're seeing in the video game industry, but these are genuinely talented people and just get completely freaking cut.

Not because of the whole controversy that surrounded it, mainly because I've been playing this game for about two to three months straight, and it's been a fun experience even though it's the same thing over and over and over. I appreciate the fact that the devs have keep on updating stuff regarding the guns. I'm glad they made some balancing changes here and there, but at this point I really wanna see like a new enemy type or just something new besides the same thing regarding the terminus. And in the automatons, once you get past like level 20 and everything else, like you pretty much got everything you needed to take care of these, um, you know, these bugs and in these bots, once you done maxed out and all the ship modules and getting air, all the strategims, like, we're just basically leveling up at this point. Me personally, I think like the level capitals are could have been better at 60 or 70, but now is increased to 1 50. Is like, what are we doing at this point other than doing the same thing over and over and over? And I hope that we have like a big overall update or something, because this game really needs some new stuff going forward. I don't hate this game. I love how nervous to this game has done a lot. It has brought my me and my Friends. We play together, like, almost every day. And it's also like a good excuse just to talk about life and just playing it. But now with this other game coming, like X define, and it's free, I might be playing that a bit more often. You know, hopefully we get some new content. I just wanna share my thoughts at the moment.

There's a remaster I think on on steam, and it's half detective game, half martial arts game, and a little bit of an RPG game. And it's just legit, man. Like it's so good. The detail, the characters.

I've sided with all four of the main groups that you can get in Fallout 4, and this is what I Learned when siding with the Minute Men. The Minute Men are definitively the right option to choose when it comes to doing a good playthrough in Fallout 4. Not only are they just fighting for the good of like, the world, they just wanna make the Commonwealth a safer place regardless of if you are a synth or if you are a human. They're not necessarily racist by any means to ghouls or super mutants. While super mutants are obviously gonna cause trouble, if you're a good super mutant there's no problem. Preston Garvey, as annoying as he is, is probably one of the most morally good people throughout the whole entire franchise of fallout. He literally holds the ideas of the Minute Men and he wants to just help the Commonwealth, help it be a safer place and help people that need help. And I do think that the Minute Men are the canon ending of Fallout 4. It just makes perfect sense for the Commonwealth.",

    "voice_to_text": "PlayStation just made a massive announcement out of nowhere here tonight on the future of Hell Divers 2 on PC and democracy. Just one for players all around the world. Last couple of days have been a nightmare, not only for people in other countries who just lost access to the game, but also with Arrowhead Studio who had to do massive damage control on a decision they weren't even responsible for. Even encouraging people to refund the game and review bomb it so Sony would finally listen. That plan seems to work, as PlayStation officially walked back the PSN requirement with this announcement on X. On the post they said hell divers fans we've heard your feedback on the Helldiverse 2 account leaking update. The May 6th update, which would have required steam and PlayStation Network account leaking for new players and for current players beginning May 30th, will not be moving forward. We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Hell Divers 2, and we'll keep you updated on future plans.",

Your favorites are probably like what? Sly Cooper, Psychonauts? Maybe like cookies and cream for the PS? I city, Persona 4 and five. Look, there is zero hate to this guy. It's totally bait, but you know I'm gonna bite. Look, there's already multiple things wrong with this because like, who cares what people's favorite games are? Your favorite game is some top 10 best selling shit that was a game of the year contender. I absolutely adore games like Psychonauts 1. It's one of my favorite PS two two games and I feel like it doesn't get enough credit. I am also somebody who thinks The Last of Us Part 1 and part 2 are complete masterpieces. These things like changed my perspective on gaming. I love lesser known Metroid Vanias like Fist Forged and Shadow Torch. I also love the extremely popular Hollow Knight. This is like my favorite video game of all time. If they sold well, they were popular, and they were nominated for game of the year. Probably for a damn good reason. Your favorite game is some top 10 best selling shit. But put that aside, your argument crumbles cause you choose GTA, Vice City, Persona 5, and Metal Gear Solid 3. These are. These are insanely popular titles and Again, that's the point. Nothing wrong with that. I think games like evil within 2 are an absolutely underrated masterpiece and more people need to play it. Guess what, I also love Dead Space, the incredibly popular horror game. phrasing this differently would have been a totally different story. There's nothing wrong with asking people like, what their favorite obscure video games are. I swear to god, two things can be true on this app. Somebody can love the PS two version of Transformers and also have The Last of us as their favorite video game of all time. Genuinely get where you're coming from. You wanna see people talk about other games rather than Red Dead, Ghost of Tsushima, God of war. I get it. They're usually critically acclaimed for a reason. There's nothing wrong with that is people's favorite game. I'm sure if you ask them they like other video games.",

Peter, the horse is here. I digress. So there is still that factor, but I still don't like him. He's still my least favorite. Why? He always moving and grooving like that? It's gonna be a no for me.

Come to find out these PC players are heated their review bombing Hell Divers 2 just because they have to make a PSN account. Y'all are not real. This is some of the most crybaby shit I ever seen. Held average 2 has been one of the best games that dropped this year. They listen to the community, actively update the game, adding new weapons, strategies, outfits, natural disasters. They added all types of shit to this game and this shit's been peak. But because you have to make a PSN account. You talking about this the end of hell divers too? Y'all boys are pathetic. It takes no longer than 2 minutes to make a PSN account bro. What are you mad about? When I played Red Dead 2 I needed a Rockstar account. When I played Minecraft I had to make a Microsoft account. Even when I'm trying to play mirrors edge I need an EA account. But there's literally no reason to complain cause that shit doesn't take any time. Weirdest part is it's not even hell divers fault. They don't have control over that shit. The only people that have the right to be mad are people from these countries. They should still be able to play the game and Sony needs To handle that ASAP. But if you can make a PC account but don't want to because you're an almighty PC player and can never stoop down to a console account, just shut your lame ass up. But yeah, man, all the real soldiers keep fighting for the democracy. And yeah, i'mma see y'all boys next time.",

For the past few weeks I've been playing Fallout 4 and all my comments have been the same play New Vegas! So I decided to give it a try. New Vegas is obviously outdated, but I'm loving it. Turns out I noticed everybody kept saying the same thing. New Vegas is better than Fallout 4 and people were being so toxic on my live chat I decided to put it to the test. I made two videos, one about Fallout 4 and one about New Vegas. All the comments in the follow for video were super welcoming, excited that I was part of the community, excited that I found the game, and excited that I'm at least giving it a try. But the Fallout Vegas video? It has 3,000 hate comments. Listen, crazy thing is that I actually like Vegas a lot. I don't know. As a community, you guys need to realize that with the show, given the game's exposure, you cannot feel a certain way. When people have different opinions, that's their opinion. Did I say a few controversial things to get it started? Yes, I guess. I guess. But listen man, I just wanted to see it. And look, it came true. All the new Vegas fanboys came crawling out of Reddit all up in my comments. Do not believe everything you see on the internet.",

You responded by accusing him of, quote, attempting to distract us from the immoral and illegal war policies of your extremist and racist government. And you said, quote, it is not anti Semitic to hold you accountable for your actions. Senator, can't both things be true? There are legitimate criticisms of the Netanyahu government, but some of these protests have also clearly tapped into a deep undercurrent of antisemitism. Look, Donna, Anti Semitism is a vile and disgusting ideology which has resulted in the deaths of many, many millions of people in the last hundred years. And we got to oppose it in every form. And do I doubt for a moment that anti Semitism exists? That is growing in the United States? That is part that exists among some people in. In the protest movement, of course. But here is the reality right now. What Netya was right wing, extremist and racist government is doing is unprecedented in the modern history of warfare. They have killed in the last six and a half months 33,000 Palestinians, wounded 77,000, two thirds of whom are women and children. They have destroyed over 60%",

Cause if you are serious, I'm just gonna go ahead and say this. This is no disrespect, but that's. It's just really. It's not like they're forcing us to play for PlayStation. Plus, we don't have to do that. It's just created a PlayStation account. I already have a PlayStation account. Mine's already. This is one of those topics that I am oddly qualified to talk about. So if you don't know, I work in IT. I work specifically in a lot of secure locations. That's about all I'm going to say about the topic. And because of that, I have a lot of information and a lot of knowledge on why it is important to protect your data. And the reason I'm bringing that up is because Sony is notoriously bad with user data. But we'll get to the data stuff in a minute. And I just wanna say here, no hate to Japan. Amir, of course, me and him are mutuals. Uh, I just love having discourse with my mutuals. I think, uh, and having a discourse between your mutuals that's respectful is very good for the community. So I chose him as the person to stitch here. So the first thing I wanna talk about is how you say that you already have a PlayStation account and it's already linked. Well, simple Simple and easy. Not everybody has a PlayStation account, and not everybody wants a PlayStation account for this one game that they're going to play. That means they're going to get a bunch of emails and all of this different stuff. And you might say, oh, they can just create a new email and use that. What if they forget the information for that new email that they just created? And now they can't reset their password for the PlayStation account? And now they can't get into Hell Divers because it logged them out for some reason. Something else to think about is while it does say it on the steam page, it doesn't say it anywhere in the EULA and user license agreement. And that goes for the Hell Divers document I just showed you and Playstations only document for steam. Nowhere in this document does it say that you need to have a PlayStation Network account to play one of their properties. And wow, you always can be changed at any moment. And your agreement to that document is literally you booting up the game. It's a little weird for them to do some.",

You guys really responded on the screen sharing aspect. Where you can play this on your screen. You said, well I want both screens on that TV. Well, that's super easy. First off, it's super easy to screen right over to your TV. But the issue is that it's one screen. You get the bottom screen right here. A lot of people don't like that. They want both screens up there. Understandable. Also, as far as the latency goes, there barely. I mean, I'm being honest, there's not a lot at all. First off, you can save as well. So look right there, you can save your game progress. You can put cheat codes in as you guys saw. But alright, all you do is you hit the settings button right here. You're gonna go all the way down until you see this right here. Nintendo DS gonna click right there and you're gonna put show top screen only. Now it's going to put both screens on there. Just like that, that quick. If you don't like it up and down, you can also have it horizontal. There you go. Which we will keep it like that for now. So you go there. Boom. Now you still have it on the bottom, so you can still scroll and look. Right here, but you have it over there as well. Look, there's a lot of new emulation stuff coming out for your phones, specifically iPhone on the App Store. And you can follow me right there to stay up to date because three DS is also coming soon. That's a little tip and trick. Honestly, this is amazing. So hit that follow button right there. And if you haven't, go to my bio. Delta game emulator is right there. And then we have a disco right here that talks about emulation and growing your own platform.",

All hell Divers two PC players on steam are now required to link their accounts to PlayStation Network. And that decision is going down about as well as you would think, with fans all across Discord, Reddit and X lashing out on PlayStation and Arrowhead threatening to abandon the game completely now. The whole reason for this big change, Sony says, is to protect players from griefing and abuse, and giving other players who were wrongfully banned the right to appeal, even stating that this was always planned to be in the game, but was delayed because of server issues at the time. Making matters even worse is that the FAQ on Sony's own support page contradicts all this, claiming that signing into PSN is optional when playing a PlayStation game on PC. Obviously now the rules have changed with the popularity of Helldivers too. How long you think now until Sony starts trying to charge PC players for PlayStation Plus to play online?",

You have gears of war. When did you ever think you would see that? You got Indiana Jones, a game that nobody cares about in Forza. And this is all coming from an insider. So most of this is probably true. Take it with a little bit of grain of salt, but man, this is crazy. Xbox is going to become a more stream like. Like, this is crazy. At least we're gonna get the games for affordable prices. You know, they're gonna have sales is more open to developers. So this is actually kind of a good. We're getting more of the beloved Xbox games on PlayStation. I actually like that. I do love that Sony isn't giving in. They aren't giving any of their first party games to Xbox because PlayStation is the king of the gaming world. We all know that we have the better exclusive games. Xbox doesn't have any any good exclusive games. Halo, it's in its heyday. It was good, but now we're moved past that. We have better games.

What house he was standing, cause he didn't know, but he was living with an ex girlfriend of one of my pals. Tell me. So I knew what I actually was in. I knew where he was. So when I've put the plans in place, everything was in place for me to go snatch him, take his feet in his hands.

PlayStation Network accounts are free and easy to set up using this link. No, I will not be creating a PlayStation Network account. I have requested a refund for the game and I have changed my review to negative. That is not happening. This is not a troll, this is directly from them. I refuse to do this. No. Absolutely not. Not a little bit. Not at all. Not even one more. Steam will not refund you. Don't give it. I'm still putting in a refund request. I don't care if steam doesn't refund. I put in a refund request specifically because they are removing my access as a player. Unless I create a third party login account. I will be refunding. Whether steam says yes or not is up to steam. This is unacceptable. And yeah, you can see pretty quickly that the player base is not too happy about this. I expect this to get much worse real fast. I can't believe they did that. That's the dumbest thing I've seen a company do in a while. And to be real with you, the only reason that's happening is not for security. That's happening because PlayStation is the publisher. That has nothing to do with security whatsoever. You do not gain inherent security by tying this to a PlayStation Network account whatsoever. That is not inherent security to do so.

Heat the mixture over medium flame, whisking until the sugar dissolves completely. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer gently for 10 minutes. Strain into a sealed container. Squeeze in fresh lemon juice and lime juice along with 1 teaspoon of citric acid for a tangy twist. Lastly, add 5 drops of neon blue food dye for that radioactive glow. Allow it to cool, cover tightly and refrigerate. Assemble with ice 9 tablespoons of the syrup and top with Seltzer water. Stir it up and voila! Your very own taste of the waistland awaits.

This one surprised me for a lot of different reasons. Like the game itself surprised me of how much I enjoyed it. With that being said, last of us part two. I have 208 hours in this game. That is a lot of time in that world. I played this game over and over again. I played it on the different difficulties. I've played it on bunch of live streams. I've done speed runs. I've done no. Like, I've done no gun challenges in this game. The only thing that I haven't been able to beat in this is grounded. Permanent death whole game.

However, I don't believe in peaceful protest because the people who are having peaceful protests will always be made out to be violent. People will always have. Such as what happened with the Zionist attacking the peaceful protesters and they got demolished, they got their face beaten in. Um, I don't believe in not fighting back. I believe that sometimes, and I think right now in this world, violence needs to be met with violence. I think we are seen as pushovers. And the reason why I say this is because I feel like a lot of, like, peaceful protests are LED by people, and then a lot of violent protests and those that are liberating are LED by people, black and brown people. And we always are subjugated to, um, having to suffer the consequences. Yet we are the ones who get the point across faster. We are the ones who understand that peace is A white man's, um. Uh, word. The ones who do peaceful protest are, to be honest, white. So it's hard to understand that. Saying that quote, um, I'm not against, you know, peaceful protest, I'm not. But in my opinion, I feel like we've gotten to the point in our lives where life, the world is in complete and utter shambles. We are watching the genocide happen. The world is not listening to us, we are not being listened to. Um, and I think it's time. I think it's time. But I think people need to be the ones at the front line at this point, because Zionists are the ones who are now taking and attacking people. Cause we are usually on the front line.",

What is wrong with y'all? Bro, genuinely, this was your chance to win us back, bro. You could have made up for this. This could have been the redemption our people have been begging for A new Batman Arkham game, and you guys make it a VR? At this point, put me on the phone with Warner Brothers. Bro, y'all are tweaking. You guys are getting too good at making stuff that we almost want. Imagine this game if it was a regular game in the Arkham series. They could have finally did Arkham Batman beyond. They beyond suit and Arkham Knight was so tough. Better yet, and what actually makes a lot more sense, we could have finally had fear toxin Batman. Imagine playing as for your toxin Batman. Look at this shit, bro. What if I saw this? I would never commit crime again. They could have gone crazy with the animations and had enemies running away from you. Oh my. I'm not saying that a VR game is gonna be bad. We haven't gotten gameplay. The trailer was just Batman chasing rats around the city. All I'm really saying is we don't want this shit. At this point, y'all are just using Arkham Batman to sell every other thing that's not Arkham. If that's how y'all kill this man, Off. Let him be dead, then. If you're gonna bring him back, bring him back right. For a real Arkham game. At this point, they just don't want money, bro. There's no way. I'm still not over them shooting down the Batman beyond movie. I didn't forget.",

In the patch notes, Arrowhead said patrol spawning was increased when there are fewer than four players, but this was actually meant to correct a mistake. Arrow had released a statement in response saying that their intention was to always make the world feel more full, and that soul lobbies were previously experiencing 1 6 of the amount of patrols as four player lobbies, thus making them feel a little too empty. And the passion increases that amount to one fourth. So in conclusion, Helldivers 2 was unintentionally too easy for solo players, and now it's at the difficulty Arrowhead always intended.

Xbox announced that they will be doing a Xbox game showcasing on June 9th, and following that, they're gonna be having a redacted direct. This was the photo that they provided of this redacted game. It was very easy to find out that this was actually meant for call of duty, because that logo was found in the files of call of duty and even on the floor in the pre game lobby called Cerberus. And this is tied directly to the next call of duty title that was gonna be called Black Ops go for. But it's looking like from this artwork, it's actually gonna be called Black Ops 5, so they're gonna keep the names going. Good news is there this reveal is actually gonna be a deep dive, showcasing not only just the trailer and the reveal, but the actual gameplay footage, some of the characters, the storyline, cinematic trailers. Just to give you an example, they did the same thing last year with Starfield Direct, and it was 45 minutes long. So that means we're gonna get 45 minutes or around that area. Brand new reveal for call of Duty Black Ops 5. What are your thoughts and opinions on this? Do you think this is a little too early for them to start revealing it? But once you get more information, I got you guys covered, so don't Forget to follow to stay up to date on all those call of duty news and updates!",

    "voice_to_text": "My gaming hot take for this week is more of a PSA, a call to action to return to the classics. Make sure you're going back and playing some old games. There's people getting into games all the time, coming in and playing their Fortnites, playing their, their war zones, playing their little battle royales. But I would assert that games are great now and they're fantastic, but I think that people need to do a better job of going back and playing pieces of history. I've experienced this over the last few years getting into retro collecting. I grew up on the PS two and in Onward. Going back and playing NES as NES games and N64 and older stuff and getting that more holistic view and more holistic experience with video games has made me so much better about understanding the overall medium and able to talk about in the way that I am right now and. And talk to you about it and have our platform or whatever. It's not about cred, though. It's just about really enjoying and. And really harnessing the whole picture of gaming. This last weekend, I played Guitar Man, Megaman 2, and I started manhunt, and that was an amazing weekend. But I'm also playing stuff like Stellar Blade and, uh, Final Fantasy 7 rebirth and getting the whole picture. And my opinions on those things are getting informed by the old things. So it is just a call to return to Retro. Even if it's a little bit difficult to get over the janky controls, get over how old some of these games look and play. You just played milligure solid for the first time. What an ugly game in comparison. But what great voice acting, what great cinematic experience that you can have with this game. I don't think you can fully understand cinematic gaming without playing the original Mill Gear Solid. And people will say that like that game is unplayable by today standards. You are out of your mind. That game is great. It plays fantastic. It's ugly, but it's amazing. Dude, I played it for the first time in 2023 and I think it's the 10th greatest game of all time that I've played. So return to retro. Go play some old games.",

    "voice_to_text": "So after the fiasco about breast jiggle physics, UM farm folks did post this kind of long winded apology. Just in case you didn't see what I was talking about or you don't feel like clicking through the video that I made on it. Literally yesterday, this was what they posted. It was an eight second long video of three different versions of breast jiggle physics, as they call it. They did say in this tweet that it was time for some serious game development talk, and they also said that this was a burning question. They also responded to their own Twitter post saying who wants to see 150%? Which is like, so much boob jiggle. I can appreciate the boobs are going to jiggle, and I can appreciate that you're putting, you know, like, a little bit of effort into an appropriate amount of boob jiggle in your characters, but I don't think that this was a thing that you needed to ask your community at all. This was asking for gross comments. Like, you had to. Like, I don't think you consulted with a single woman on your team before posting something like this. And then as far as the apology is concerned, I think that most of it is fine. It's your standard we fucked up apology. But the thing that bothers me about this apology is like, the first sentence of this is them saying that they've had people reach out concerned about The breast jiggle physics, which is why they posted this in the first place. No, you fucking didn't. Not who. Who. Who commented that? Who said that they were concerned about the lack of realism about boobs jiggling in a character in a cozy farming simulator? I don't. I don't believe I want proof of that. If they had just, like, not included that part of the apology, I think I might want to actually try this game again. But I don't know, something about, like, immediately passing this off to, like, will people ask for it just feels like you didn't actually care about any of this and you still quite don't understand why people are upset about this. Also, before the apology, after the original tweet, their community manager was apparently like, in their discord. I've seen the screenshots and stuff. I'm not in their discord, so I wasn't there to witness it personally, but their community manager just, like, didn't seem to get why people were upset about this and, like, really was doubling down a lot, and it just. It comes across as gross. So I'm still not into this game. Uh, to each their own. If you wanna try it when it comes out, by all means, please do. But, like, we're not hurting for farming simulators. We have so many to choose from, and I think I wanna choose one that has a team that maybe understands the type of people that will be Playing their game and like, how to not be weird about it, I guess.",

Oh, so it's basically one of the most advanced Tetris techniques in the whole entire world. Alright, so back in the 2, these are just hold the buttons left and right, but that was too slow. Yeah, so eventually we evolved to pressing it really fast, maybe like 10 to 15 times a second. But even that got too slow. So player named Cheese Fish invented a technique called rolling. Or basically, you put your thumb on the D pad and push the controller into your thumb. And this way you can get five fingers on the controller into the D pad really fast. And this can lead to really fast excessive inputs at over 30 hertz a second. 30 times? Wait, yeah, but I don't think that really looks like 30 times a second. Well, it's not actually 30 times a second, but the pace that I'm going at results in 30 times in a second if you extrapolate the data on the game. Yeah, yeah, we're actually smart and think about that. So wait, people just all use this now or something? Yeah, pretty much every major player uses the rolling technique now in NES Tetris tournaments. Hmm. I see. In the glove. What's that for? So basically this reduces friction. Cause if I'm rolling without a glove, it's easy to get caught. And for my hands, To get sweaty. But if I'm wearing a cotton glove, it actually glides really fast. Oh, okay. Thank you, bro. Yeah, no problem, bro.",

From all the comments that I've received lately is people are not happy with Nintendo. So I'm wondering what will get you to buy their next console. If you took all my bias away, I would really just be looking at the games. I would need a new Mario Kart or a new 3D Mario to come out with the system. Or heck, even a new Zelda game, because the games are really what makes Nintendo great. Would being as powerful as a steam deck be enough? Or a more customizable experience like themes or music on the e shop. Or, you know, an online that actually works with voice chat in all the features that the other systems already have. I'm gonna buy it no matter what because I'm a Nintendo fanboy. They could sell me a rock that just says Nintendo Switch to on it and I'd. I'd buy it for whatever. Whatever they're charging. I'd buy it. But I'll be really interested to see how they come off of the success of the Nintendo Switch.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, what are some signs that a video game might suck? If the game's focus is graphics over gameplay, most likely. It's a L bro. Trust me, nobody cares about a pretty looking game that plays like shit. For example, I played this game recently and my favorite thing about it was the story because the gameplay was ass. Oh but them graphics. Beautiful. But then the exact opposite happened with rise of the Ronin because it looks like a late gym PS three game. But that gameplay. Chef kiss. I ain't gonna lie to you. If I see the words Ubisoft or EA and some folks would say but there's the two. But after they gave me high five rush, I don't know if I can hate on them right now. Here's another one when the trailer shows zero gameplay, is this for a movie or video game? Especially if it's for a brand new IP? Cause we don't even trust you yet. GTA 6 trailer show no gameplay, but it didn't need to because it's GTA. Meanwhile, I still don't trust Phantom Blade Zero because I have yet to see some gameplay. Trailer look crazy though. I ain't gonna lie, but without the gameplay I don't trust it. Another one is if it's an easily identifiable copycat. Like if I can clearly see you trying to cash in on another game swag, I don't know if I can fuck with you bro. Cause long gone are the days Of true crime, streets of LA and Sleeping Dogs. We trusted the GTA clones back in the day, but nowadays cut that out. And lastly, free to play. Is it always a L? No because Fortnite still going strong. However, nine times out of 10 that the game is free to play, you gonna be paying a lot of money still. You are finna be micro transaction to all be damned. All for a game that probably ain't all that great. Y'all know the rules man. Comment below and tell me some more signs that a video game might be trash.",

No offense to the religious folk or the man upstairs, but I just don't think he's gonna come pick up a shovel with me. Nor is Jesus Christ gonna wire my bank account and reimburse me for my construction costs. And before you yell blasphemy, just know I've been to more Sunday services and youth groups than I can count. But right now I'm not too worried about my own salvation when I'm driving by homeless, intense cities every day, knowing that my 25 thousand dollar tax payment this year went to wars and death. I think god is a gamer and we all live in a save file that he abandoned a long time ago. No shade to the church, but I don't have a shiny collection plate. What I do have is a willingness to work hard to start a business, to post my life on social media, to tattoo myself for viral views and TikTok live gifts. To film the battery and the most intimate moments with my fiance and post them all for sale. Cause none of this gets built without money. And I don't know if you've noticed, but everything's unaffordable. Corporate agreed with political backing is buying up all of our residential real estate just to rent it back to us at a profit. So I don't really care what Jesus would Do I'll stoop to any level to say fuck the people at the top of this human food chain",

And I'm some money with a white leg horn to make a chicken called. Who knows the name of it? It's called a zombie chicken. Okay. What's really cool about these, I am Somanis, is they have a gene called fibromelanosis. What that means is everything is black about this bird. I'm talking about not only the feathers, the meat, the skin, the comb, the waddles, the feet, the toenails. Everything about this bird is black. Which really cool is you could cross it to that white leg horn and you're gonna get a bird that's mostly white feathered with black features. Okay? Feathers I consider primary feature, secondary features we're talking about the waddles, the comb, the feet, the toenails. If you can get a White Bird to have those black fiery melanosis features, that's incredible. I have about 18 in the barn and I wanna go ahead and show you those. Now introducing zombie chicken. How cool is that? Feet black, waddles coming in black, comb black. Look at that, it's white, got some black stocks on it. And this bird's incredible. It lays like a white leghorn cause that's its mother. It's gonna lay a large to a jumbo white egg almost daily. And it's got really, really, really cool genes to it. You there are other breeds out there to Make a zombie chicken. But you're gonna wanna want these two to be the most productive. The Leghorn lays almost every single day. So if you wanna get the bank for your buck and make these zombie chickens, grab yourself I'm smani rooster, white leg horn and an incubator and have some fun.",

Stop by the tavern to see the damage from last night. We went wild. Last night was a painting, bro. After that, filmed a quick music video. Stop by my boys to run a quick pod.

Not a lot of maidens came out tonight. So I thought about hitting the brothel. I really got to start duck at pinching. I didn't mind watching my boys get after it though. Got a little too slosh, so my boys wouldn't give me my reins. Don't let that man have his reins. He's got my reins. It sucks cause I ride better drunk. But you know, they're just Looking out. After that, I walked home. And that's all she wrote. Then I'll run it back again tomorrow. Don't forget to follow your boy, yo",

    "voice_to_text": "Just a friendly reminder that Sony and Microsoft have both played with the idea of putting in game ads in your favorite video games. And I want you to understand something. The only thing that's keeping them from doing this are people that are hitting them with all the backlash. Like, understand that they have been trying to do this ever since the last Street Fighter game. I remember when that game was coming out and they played with the idea of all the loading screens were gonna be ABS, but they immediately ran that shit back. But understand, they play with this idea all the time. Put it in the perspective how out of touch some of these developers are. Let's look at a little guy from EA. This guy was an executive at EA seeing over battlefield, and this fucking guy had the idea of charging for magazines mid gunfight. And guess what? The reasoning that he gave for charging per magazine like that, that is him saying this is that there will be less by your hesitancy when they're about to win a gunfight. Dog, the entirety of gaming will be cooked. Understand, I'm okay with paying $70 for a good gaming experience, but putting fucking ads in a video game is insane. Like, imagine we went through all the tech of getting rid of loading screens only for them to have fucking commercials. Even if you're playing through the Kratos verse 4 fight and you're having The time of your life. You are fully immersed. You are getting into it. Then right when this happened, BK, I swear to all that is holy, if we get to the point that I have a Burger King ad in between my boss battle, we're done. Understand? If they could do it, they would. Two years ago, it was unheard of for you to have to pay for ABS on a streaming platform. Now that's the standard, dog. One of the first micro transactions in gaming was horse armor. That was $2. Now call of duty has micro transactions that cost more than the fucking game. You know, we're entering a slippery slope that, I'm afraid where it leads.",

I'll go first. I was very excited for this game. The trailers made me excited. It looked really good. It looked like what I wanted it to be like. They marketed this so well, and then the game release and is like, what am I playing? That game would be Resident Evil 6. Capcom marketed this thing so hard, and they knew what they were doing with the marketing. They didn't show us the rest of the game when this got announced. The only thing they showed us was Leon's campaign. And they're like, oh, this is a return to form. This is what fans have been asking for. We're going back to how things used to be. And they tricked us by showing Leon's campaign, because Leon's campaign had zombies in it. And on top of that, Leon's campaign was darker, and it had more of the horror atmosphere that we wanted in Resident Evil. Lies. Complete lies. When I play the game, I was like, what the fuck is that? As always, leave your comments and stitch and make sure you guys are following. I'm trying to hit 50,000 followers. I'm very close. I need to get to that 50,000 Mark. Help me out here.

But what's a game that you won't ever play again? Here's my answer. And don't forget to go ahead and stitch this video so that way I can see your comments and your responses and all that. And leave comments so I can read the comments, cause I'd love to see those. And make sure you follow for more as we're trying to hit the 50,000 Mark. Game that I won't ever play again. And it's not because it's a bad game, it's because I don't want to ruin the experience that I had playing the game. And this is because the type of game that it is, it's a decision based game. You make decisions in this game and it affects your playthrough and affects your ending within the game. So the way that I see these type of games is that your first playthrough is your truest playthrough. Everything after that is just you trying to get achievements or trying to see the different paths that you could potentially take. So the game that I'm talking about is life is strange. I'm not playing this again. I love this game so much. I will not play this again. I got the ending that I got. I saved the town. Those you guys who know who played the game understand The sacrifice that I made to save the town. I cried so much on live stream. Like ugly crying on live stream during that moment. And I cried after the live stream. Mourning the loss that I took in that game. I won't play it again because I don't need to. I know the choices and I don't need to make the other choice to to get it. I. I don't. So yeah, I won't ever play it again. Don't forget to stitch, leave comments and hit that follow.",

During the most recent update, Fortnite brought back the Tactical AR, a new Nike collab, Billie Eilish appearance, and more. But this update also comes with some controversy. Under the social privacy menu, you'll now find a new see confrontational emotes setting. And when enabled, instead of user actually seeing the emote, instead they'll see the player who is emoting just standing still with no emote sound. Many players have been complaining about how sweaty and toxic Fortnite has become, so epic says that they're doing this because they want emotes to be a source of good vibes. This new setting applies to the laugh it up emote, whip crack, make it plantain, and the iconic take the out. It's also safe to say that we likely won't be getting any new confrontational emotes in Fortnite anytime soon.",

    "voice_to_text": "We're in the middle of a mental health crisis, but Nashville has this place where if you're arrested you can get mental health help. It's something they're trying to create all around the country, but we found ours is almost always empty. Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall spearheaded the Behavioral Care Center -  tired of seeing mentally ill people locked up - he used money from his jail budget to build a treatment facility inside the jail. Daily jail logs reveal  the BCC has 60 beds, but many times over the last year only about 15 of those were filled. Some days the program had as few as 10 participants, meaning 50 beds in the highly touted program were sitting empty. And that's very concerning it runs at about 20% occupancy at best. Judge Melissa Blackburn oversees Davidson County's Mental Health Court. After seeing the numbers, she thinks there's room to help more people. NewsChannel 5 Investigates questioned Judge Blackburn about this man, Johnson Lloyd, who sat in the Davidson County Jail for nearly a year waiting on a mental health evaluation. When he was finally found incompetent, he was released. He then went up to Bowling Green, where he was arrested for raping a woman. I know they do not take dangerous individuals or very difficult individuals, but he may have been someone once medicated, he may not have been. Why are there so many empty beds? So it was never targeting to solve the mental health problem, and all the people who complain about bed counts, I wish they would call me. Some do, here's what I would tell you, you weren't around helping me design what we needed. So are you disappointed that it's only about 20 to 30% full? No it only is designed to treat a certain type mental illness. The sheriff says the center cannot treat severely mentally ill people. There are no locks on the doors. It's designed for people who need basic help like getting back on their meds  to keep them out of the criminal justice system. But projections from years ago when it was being built, calculated half of everyone arrested would qualify for the BCC and it's beds would be full. The sheriff says arrests are down dramatically. When he planned the BCC, he says 100 people a day were being arrested. That number went down during covid and it's not gone back up. He says now 60 people a day are arrested. The sheriff says it's up to the state to build more hospitals to treat the severely mentally ill. But I wanna know what you think.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, what's a video game that would have been perfect had it not been for that one thing? I'm talking everything in the game checked out for you, was almost there, but it just. Something threw it off man. Because LA Noir did not need to be open world at all. Overall story, the game was extremely linear and straight to the point. The open world added nothing of value to the game. Overall it's pretty big and nice, but there was nothing there. Listen, if you play the story of this game straight through and you do nothing else, I promise you you didn't miss nothing. Next I got Cyberpunk 2077. No, I'm not talking about the launch at all. They fix that and redeem themselves. There's no point in bringing it up over and over again. What ruined it for me was the fact that it was a first person shooter. I don't understand the point of me creating a character if I can't see him. The game is fire. Bragging like cook when they made this game. But if this game was a third person shooter, not a first person shooter. Not gonna lie, probably would have been a 10 out of 10 for me. Personally, I think Batman Arkham Knight is in the Mount Rushmore of superhero games. But them Batmobile missions made me wanna jump off a cliff. Dog, I swear I hate it driving that damn thing. I don't know if everybody else feels That way, but for me personally, I hated it. Bro, Arkham Asylum in Arkham City did perfectly fine without that damn Batmobile. Also, Tsushima, while an absolute masterpiece, had one of the most boring and empty open worlds I've ever experienced. Exactly why I don't like open world games like that. Bro, just let me do the story. Might get mad at me in the comments because I'm talking about your beloved ghost of Tsushima, but I gotta be honest. Bro. Lastly, Jedi fall. In order fight the countless bugs and glitches that was in this game. This game hands down has one of the worst map systems I've ever played. And that no fast travel was cooked. But again, had you going all the way to the back of the map doing what you gotta do. And you had to travel all the way back on foot. A lot of you breath. It wasn't for YouTube I probably would never beat this shit. Colorado. Great game. Replay value though. In the trash. So y'all tell me, what are some games that you think were almost perfect had it not been for that one thing?",

Bro what the fuck is this guys had me on board with this game. The first trailer came out like a year ago. I was hyped. At this point, being a Star Wars fan is no different than being a call of duty fan. You grew up on this shit, you're probably gonna give it a chance every time something comes out. And when the shit does come out, you're probably gonna be disappointed. Look, I'm not saying the game is gonna be bad. It could have great gameplay. I don't know yet. Like I said, the first gameplay trailer that dropped a year ago. I liked what I saw. But this is a single player story game with three different price points. And a battle pass bro why? Standard edition comes with the base game. Thank god. At least we still get that for 70 bucks. Old edition gives you 3 days early access. And a season pass. Again, why the fuck is there a season pass with this game? The ultimate. The Ultimate Edition comes with a season pass. Rogue infiltrator bundle A savac shark? What the fuck even is that? Petty and bring up helldivers 40 dollar price tag again, but I'm not gonna do it. Instead I'm gonna use god of wars my example. This game had a deluxe edition too. Ten more dollars, bro. That's it. There was no season pass. You just got all this cosmetic stuff and there's a lot more stuff to get. And they fucked around and dropped a whole ass DLC for free. This right here. Back this up, bro. We're done with this shit. We done with the 90. There's so much content and stories to be told in Star Wars, bro. It should be easy as hell. Bro, A game like that does not need a battle pass. That trailer definitely did some damage to my height, but let me know what you guys think.",

Here's everything you need to know. A big part of this game is making your own home. You'll build a chicken leg cottage and decorate the insides as you wish. You'll need somewhere nice and cozy to keep all those witchy recipes. The open world looks like a gorgeous autumnal land where you'll find and pick ingredients with which to brew your magical crafts. Better yet, you can discover animals that you can tame and bring home with you. The character customization. You can change your skin, your hair, your face, and your clothes, but you play as the same character. This is something they may develop later on, since the game is coming out in early access. And this isn't just an empty sandbox. As you explore the procedurally generated world, you'll discover settlements where villagers can ask you for help. They'll give you quests, and you can choose to help them or to hinder them. So will you be a good witch or a bad witch? The game is called Riker and we should be getting it this year on PC. Would you like to see it come to consoles? Tag that one witchy friend in the comments and follow for updates!",

This makes a lot of sense because we have the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 coming out with shadow as the antagonist. We have the video game Sonic X Shadow Generations, which was also announced earlier this year. If you go on the Sonic the Hedgehog website they have this whole page about shadow and cool facts and how cool he is and shadow is that cool. Other than the one game of Sonic X Shadow Generations and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie with shadow, what other shadow content do we think we'll see from Sega? Could be more games, movies, and shows, or just merch. I really hope it's more games because he's a video game character. Personally I'm hoping for shadow the Hedgehog 2 with more shadow, more guns, and more just edginess from the early 2.",

You have too many opinions about kids games from the 90s. Stop it. You were exposed to far too much shit on the internet at far too young and age, to the point where it skewed your entire perception of the world around you to this day. Ha ha ha ha. You need to be cut open and study. You are blinded by nostalgia. That's it. There is no other reason to like this one. It is ass in every aspect. Why is it got a schlong? You are my younger cousin. That is hands down the only person in the world I have met who enjoys this console more than anything. Get a PS five. Speaking of your normal like, there's nothing special about you, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. How does it feel to have a loving and unbroken family? Wait, wait. Shit. No, I'm asking the wrong person. Sorry. Be honest with me. How much of your game library is pirated? Don't worry, I'm not a snitch. I won't tell. I feel like you were forced to grow up Far too quickly. But your parents overcompensated and gave you a lot of really cool toys as a kid. And you thought that made it okay somehow.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I have a question for everybody that plays valorant if you could change fix and or add anything in the valorant what would it be if you said the replay system you're wrong that's not what I'm here to talk about I'm here to talk about the Item Shop because that item shop is atrocious it is bad this for slot item shop is bad this is bad we have over 600 skins in the game and to get the skin that you want you have a less than 0.1% chance of getting it you know how low that is that is bad we need to change this and I'm going to explain how I would love to change and rework the item shop i'mma be so real it has been over a year and I have yet to see the prime vandal in my shop you know how bad that is I have to wait over a year to spend $20 on a cosmetic that I will get bored with within a week really come on Riot like we need change the item shop is bad and we need change I'm being so serious no because really think about it for two seconds right I have to wait over a year to see one skin that's not rare or exclusive I have to wait over a year for a skin cosmetic that cost 17 18 dollars but I have to spend 20 dollars on that is terrible I do not like the item shop sure maybe in 2020 2021 and a little bit of 2022 the Valorant Item Shop was fine because there weren't that many skins so you had a better chance of getting a skin that you wanted at the time but with the game having over 600 skins it's gotta change it's gotta change like you\u2019re bound to get something new everyday but it has to change here is how I would personally rework the item shop add one of everything and I mean one of everything so all the pistols the the machine guns the snipers everything add one of everything into the shop so let's say that you want the prelude To Chaos Vandal right you want the prelude right now since there's one of everything you see that you're getting a vandal skin in your shop but maybe you don't get the prelude instead maybe you get the Sentinels of Light vandal and you don't want that so you're like okay even though the sentinels of light is already in the shop I have a better chance of getting the skin that I want because tomorrow I'm getting another vandal skin guaranteed but yeah we can't get that we can't get that the item shop is bad and I feel like there should be more outrage about it because I am just genuinely mad that I have to wait over a year to even try to get a skin that I want that is ridiculous Riot Games Valorant please change your item shop I'm not asking for the replay system I'm not asking for much just please rework your item shop so that way we can at least have a better chance of getting the skin that we want because what's gonna happen when you have a thousand skins in the game at that point you're going to be in the negative somehow and the negatives of being able to get the skin that you want if we get a thousand skin to Valorant and they're still doing that for skin item shop rotation stuff I promise you at that point don't even try and get a skin because it's not worth it imagine having a thousand skins and you have a less than 0.000001% chance of getting the skin that you want that's insane I think there should be more outrage and I think that Riot Games needs to update the item shop honestly",

Not everybody gonna like the same thing. Because y'all love elder ring, I just don't fuck with it. In fact, I'm not really a fan of souls like games period. The only souls like game that I really, really rock with was lies A. P. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a challenge, but damn, some shit is just too much for me. I command all my elder ring players as a huge, huge fan of GTA. I just cannot get with GTA online at all. And I tried. I've tried so many times. It's just not my thing bro. Dark cars, the micro transactions. It's just. I don't know bro. The mission is been milked to all be damned and that's really what turns me off. Care what nobody say. We could have been got GTA 6 had it not been for GTA Online. I'm putting these next ones together as one cause usually they have the same kind of community, but 2K and call of duty please respectfully go to hell. Again, no disrespect to anybody who likes any of these games. I just don't understand why I love paying for the same game every single year with nothing different. This next one. I ain't gonna lie. Y'all might slander me for this one, but breath of the wild and tears of The Kingdom. Sorry, can't ride with it. Never really been a huge fan of Zelda games anyway. Except for the 164. That shit was clutch. But everybody loves these games. And I remember during The Game Awards, everybody just knew that tears of the Kingdom was gonna take it, and it didn't. I ain't saying that it didn't deserve a chance to win, but when it didn't win, I didn't really give a damn. Now this next game is gonna be a throwback for my OG gamers. Kingdom Hearts. Never really fucked with it, bro. Everybody growing up love Kingdom Hearts, and I was like the eyeball out of the bunch, cause I was just like, I guess in no hate towards anybody who like the game. It's just not my thing, bro. So y'all tell me, what are some games that everybody else loves, but you personally, you just don't fuck with like that?",

Government Accountability Office says that the FBI and DHS should use the same strategy that allow them to police extremism on social media to regulate the gaming industry. And the Anti Defamation League Super Reputable says that 20% of adult gamers and 15% of kids playing games report being exposed to white supremacy while gaming. What constitutes extremism, you may ask? Racially or ethnically motivated violence, anti government or anti authority sentiments, animal rights or environmental extremism if you're pro life, apparently. And all other domestic terrorism threats, which the FBI has already said includes going to church on Sunday. This is super constitutional.",

I'm a cocktail server and this guy ordered a pina colada. I asked would you like alcohol or no? He responded Virgin like you. Well, at least I really hope you are. I've never been more skeeved out by one sentence in my life LMFAO. Bothering people at their job. Bothering retail slash service workers is low hanging fruit. These people can't leave and have to be professional. I sometimes call the store phone from the back to relieve them of the guys that don't get the clue. I get bad vibes from male feminists. I don't mean men who support women's rights, I mean men who make a show about it and actively talk about how feminist they are. Because it's almost never genuine and either at best a desperate attempt to get into a woman's pants, or at worst hiding their darker nature. Boy moms. This classmate became a mom a couple of months ago to a baby boy and I think he was maybe 1 month old and she was already posting about how he belongs to her and no girl would be enough. Every once in a while she posts things like that. Being persistent, not just asking where someone lives, but after the person tells them the general brought her area where they live, the questioner then Asks them to be more specific",

The Hail Davas 2 community wants the dares to add melee weapons to the game, with many believing the addition will help them further in their fight for Super Earth. One of the players had posted and read it the number of melee kills they had gotten, jokingly saying they won't stop until the devs add a proper melee weapon. Currently the only melee options players have at their disposal is their gun, which can be used to blungeon enemies. Somebody said a swore for quick slash and through mobs and a hammer for cracking armor would be extremely democratic. Joke. One player somebody says sometimes all the aliens need is a good bunk, but the butt of the gun ain't satisfying enough. Reply one comment to give me a hammer or a fucking lightsaber. It's important to note that the dev still have loads of content from Hell Divers. One to add with the illuminate Faction and Sabres amongst the most hype additions. After all, Sabres were usable. And Hell Divers one proven grounds unique missions where players could try out new gear. Yeah, they need to go ahead and bring all that old content over to the new game. Man, I need to go ahead and do that shit ASAP. We need All the swords, all the hammers, whatever melee ideas they could think of, we need that shit. I would love to see something like the gravity hammer from Halo inside of Hill Davas. That would be fire. Y'all let me know what y'all think, man. Do we need melee weapons in Hill Davas, too?",

    "voice_to_text": "Here's how to easily edit make it look like you can backflip. First get out of the way and get a video of your background. Then stand in the video and jump into a cannonball and then land on your feet. We're just using the free features in CapCut. On the clip of your cannonball, hit remove BG, Auto Removal. If there's any spots that messed up, like in mind you can see the tree for a little bit. Just scroll through the footage and see if there's any mistakes. Then in remove BG we're gonna hit custom removal and select eraser and then you can just cover over what you don't wanna see, like the tree. Now the clip that looks pretty good. It's me with no background. Tap on that clip to select it and then hit overlay and drag it in front of your blank background. Go to the moment right before you start tucking, and you're gonna hit on that keyframe diamond to save the position. And then go right before you start untucking and you're gonna rotate this with two fingers all the way around in the 3 60. So now I do a full backflip, but it looks weird cause I'm rotating around the middle of the frame, not around the middle of my body. So to make it look good, we need to use a reference video. So insert a clip of you doing a backflip for real. And this is gonna replace Your blank background. So now you can see where the body should be during each part of the flip. Now it's a piece of cake. Whenever you see that your body is going off of the reference video, just rotate it. And since it key frames are turned on, it's gonna save each of these positions. Take your time. And then this is the final result.",

Got portable vrs that are super realistic now. I'm staying away from them things for at least right now. Ready Player One showing me a lot when it came to VR. I don't know, I don't think we're ready for that stuff. And when it comes to these new handheld gaming system, not only do they give you better graphics, they give you better games. Two reasons why you should leave the switch for the children. Because that's the thing with the Nintendo Switch. All of his games are made for kids. And I know someone's gonna say, wait a minute. All the games 99.2% in. And it's something weird about a 38 year old man playing Kirby. It's just something weird about that. And of course, this is no knock towards Nintendo, because look, bro, they. They boom me like Metro. When I was working at Best Buy, the Nintendo Switch ran sakuras around PC, Xbox, and Sony. I'm telling you. My manager used to always say, women and kids make businesses rich. But hey, this is just my opinion. At my big age of 31, I don't need to play the Nintendo Switch.

At the start of fallout 4 you can use VATS, which is a key component of synth, before you even have a pit boy or anything. And you aren't able to use VATS at the start of any other fallout game.

I've been loving them. This game will also feature a classic mini map with red dot. They have map voting, fast movement as well as specialist like abilities in game. There's going to be over 24 weapons on launch. And a lot of the developers that are working on this game currently worked for call of duty in the past.
