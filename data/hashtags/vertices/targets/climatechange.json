I went to Tesco's, and I've been to co op, and I've been to oldies. If anybody on here knows when get some cheap olive oil. Um, extra virgin olive oil, not that Olivia thing. Um, for less than. I don't say. \u00a36 50. Just cheaper. I'm sick of this. I need some olive oil, but I don't wanna pay all that money. Might get someone to rob it. Oh, did I say that? Ha ha ha ha! Not me. Do it.

    "voice_to_text": "Something really, really strange is happening in our oceans, and the wildlife is clearly reflecting that. Groups of whales have been coming together before beaching and unaliving themselves, and scientists have no clue why. This specific group was located near Australia, and the general Assumption was that they may have just wandered too close to shore by accident. But the exact same thing happened near Taylor's Bay. And according to the locals who were trying to help, the whales and dolphins sounded like they were screaming for help. Check it out real quick. First stranded before two PM yesterday at the rocky beach in Taylors Bay. They were screaming. It is probably the thing that's stopping me from sleeping, because you can hear the screaming and your ears. Um, they were making more than a noise. They were really yelling out for help. And even after the locals and rescue teams help the wells back into the water, they rebeach themselves further down the coast, almost as if they refused to go deeper into the ocean. Over in the beach in Oregon, a female anglerfish washed up, which is really strange. We consider that they live two to three thousand feet deep. And with the huge anomaly that we were initially told was a glitch coming back, people's speculation is starting to grow and theories are starting to circulate. I touched on the first theory that states that very large creatures, or a very large creature, possibly Leviathan, has entered Our oceans ecosystems, eating the wildlife and scaring them as well. But there's a second theory stating that some sort of frequency device is being used or tested, heating up the oceans and scaring the wildlife. Leave a like. Let me know what you think.",

A lot of people think of the internet as just being in the cloud. Really, it is taking up this huge space of these gigantic computers, which are data centers. In Northern Virginia, we have over 300 data centers. There's around 100 million square feet. And they use a lot of energy. Artificial intelligence requires servers to run much hotter. Water cooling will be necessary. And where will that water come from? One chat GPT request, for example, that's the equivalent of pouring out a bottle of water and powering a light bulb for 15 minutes. You multiply that times billions of requests, you can start to see the cumulative impacts. AI is driving the need for additional power to meet this demand at an unsustainable rate. Scale of the energy use is 20, 30, 40 times more or square foot than anything else that we familiar with. Diesel generators are the backup power for AI applications or any data center application. More fossil fuel emitting infrastructure that historically and currently impacts low income communities and people of color. We're contemplating a tripling of the entire energy infrastructure that we have today. And the effect on the average taxpayer, the doubling of their utility bills. Everything that's needed to support this industry is paid for by the rate payers as a whole, which is you, me, it's everybody. The Subsidize are the richest corporations in the world. There's so much money to be made. Renewable energy goals, sustainability goals, they are not at all front of mind. We need to have a plan for how we're gonna do it sustainably.

He says it\u2019s all to protect American jobs from China\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d on trading practices. But will it actually change much? #ElectricCars #ElectricVehicles #US #America #JoeBiden #China #Channel4News #C4News",
    "voice_to_text": "President Biden is adding a huge tax hike on imported Chinese vehicles from 25% to 100%. In fact, he's increasing border taxes on a whole range of Chinese green tech, like solar panels, semiconductors and lithium batteries. And it's all to protect American businesses from China's so called unfair trading practices. American workers are, I cannot work and I could beat anyone as long as the competition is fair. But for too long it hasn't been fair. For years, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese companies across the whole range of industry. And when you make tactics like these, it's not competition, it's cheating. China has become a powerhouse for electric vehicle or EV manufacturing in recent years, especially from this company, BYD, which stands for build your dreams. It overtook Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest electric car seller last year, selling 3 million vehicles in one year. Why? Because they're cheap. In some cases, BYD cars are three times less expensive than American models, and Beijing wants to keep them growing. The Chinese government has invested billions in BYD. In Shenzhen, where the company is based, taxi companies can only use BYD cars. Elon Musk says if there weren't any trade barriers, Chinese electric cars could pretty much demolish most other companies in the world. In spite of all of these warnings, the US doesn't actually import that many electric cars from China. That's in part because Donald Trump introduced a 25% tariff when he was President effectively driving Chinese electric vehicles off American roads. So some people say Biden's announcement is just posturing, a symbolic move to gain voters in an election year. After all, lots of US car manufacturers are based in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Chinese government has called it typical political manipulation from Biden and has promised to retaliate.",

And six clean steel projects across in America, creating, supporting thousands, thousands of union jobs. Next, a 100% tariff on electric vehicles made in China. People say wow, cause we're not gonna let China flood our market, making it impossible for American auto manufacturers to compete fairly. We're also implementing a 25% tire fund electric vehicle batteries from China and 25% tire fund critical minerals that make those batteries. I'm determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers, period. We'll do it by following international trade laws to do it. American companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and batteries. And thanks to my bipartisan infrastructure law, we're building a network of 500,000 charging stations all across America, creating thousands, thousands of I B W. Jobs across America.",

On top of this, He\u2019s been helping to secure oil deals with Petrofac for the Bahrain royal family worth billions.

We refuse to sit back and allow the biggest culprits of the climate crisis to dictate the future of our planet and their dying industry.

Liam, how can we believe a word that you say when you are in the pocket of the people obfuscating the reality of the situation that we're in? The ICC, who are here today, have been unequivocal in the condemnation of new island gas rigs. Right? And yet you seem to be representing the interests of the people causing climate breakdown. Who do you work for, Liam? Do you work for us? Do you work for the people who've come here because they genuinely want to see a green transition?

For microwave pyrolysis, in particular, we have to mix the plastic with carbon that we actually make from the process as well. So it's not an extra costing. Now let's turn it on. After some time of the machine being turned on and the temperatures rise, we also get natural gas made from plastic waste. An amazing product that can run a generator that will run this machine itself. Take a look at that beautiful, clean, burning, smokeless flame."

The mechanical tree  can do the work of a thousand trees. It's an enhancement, an engineering improvement, to a natural system. A living tree that can pull  carbon dioxide out of the air. Inside each of those discs  are six of these leaves, oriented around in a circle, kinda like the slices of a pizza. The tree's circular leaves are filled with materials  that bind to carbon dioxide and pull it from the air. So zero emissions are not enough We will need negative emissions. Which means the removal of carbon  from the environment and their storage in some kind of reservoir. If we have enough negative emissions, we can counterbalance the emissions  that we are still producing and reduce the concentration of  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. There\u2019s a lot still to learn about removing  carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. How do you feel about a technology  that turns nature's abilities up to a thousand?",

It's transformed my life in so many ways that I just had to share with you. Let's start with my skin. I used to struggle with hormonal acne, eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. It felt like a never ending battle. But since adopting the carnival lifestyle, my skin has gone through a remarkable transformation. I now have this glowing, plump, and healthy complexion that I never thought was possible. It is like a complete 180 degree turn, and I could not be happier. Next up, let's talk about my body. I used to suffer from constant bloating and digestive issues. It was uncomfortable and frustrating, to say the least. But after making the switch to a carnivore diet, I've never felt better and leaner and stronger than ever before. And those pesky bloating problems, they're a thing of the past. Now let's get into something even more significant. This carnival lifestyle has actually cured my autoimmune disease. It's like a dream come true. I no longer have to live with the constant worry and discomfort of red, swollen, itchy, inflamed skin. I take zero medications now, and this is truly a testament to the power of this lifestyle. But wait, there's more. I've also experienced a remarkable boost in energy and mental sharpness. I used to have those midday crashes, so much brain fog. But now I Am on top of my game throughout the day. My focus and clarity and confidence have never been better, and I'm accomplishing more than I have ever before. There you have it folks, my incredible journey with one simple diet. Comment below with what changes you have noticed on the carnivore diet and drop a heart down below in the comments if you want free access to my steak and butter Gang support group and free forum.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's too hot for humans lately, but it's also too hot for planes. Yes, that is a thing we have to deal with now, and here's why. Plane might seem to stay in the air because of magic, but it's really just science. Air moves around a plane's wings and gives it lift. When the air is hot, its molecules move much faster. This makes the air less dense, and that means planes have a lot less lift, and it makes it harder for them to take off and stay in the air. So when it gets too hot, pilots and airlines have to make some hard choices. Maybe they toss passengers and luggage off the plane. Maybe they delay the flight until it gets cooler. Maybe they make you sit on the runway in a plane without air conditioning where you roast for hours. None of that is good. What it all adds up to is more delays. As if air travel needed more of those. Believe it or not, hot weather causes more flight delays than cold weather. And as the southern US experience for the past several weeks, global warming means the air just keeps getting hotter and hotter. Climate change was already making air travel worse by fueling more turbulence and extreme weather and changing the speed and direction of wind. Extreme heat is just another way. Will ruin your vacation. Will this be the thing that finally wakes more of us up to take action? And stop burning so much fossil fuel, I. Maybe we could even skip some plane trips. They're pretty awful these days anyway."
