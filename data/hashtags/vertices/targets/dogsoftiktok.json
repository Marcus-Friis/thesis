This comes after recent attacks. Can taxi has still continued despite the new law that has been put in place. Now, I don't agree with putting the dogs down whatsoever. It comes down to the owners, but what you have to bear in mind, they now know, the government now know where every single Excel bully is registered. And was this potentially all part of the plan? Did they see this coming? Miles off. But if you saw it on TV this morning, they were having live debates and there's a number of people that are agreeing with them that they should now all be put down. Just isn't fucking fair on the dogs. So when do we think this is gonna happen? Will you let it happen? What? Where do you think this is going, people? Let me know below.

Well I have the best IQ test that you're gonna challenge your dog with! it's important to know that there's different types of intelligence in dogs According to the renowned researcher and sociologist Dr. Stanley Coren there are three types of intelligence in dogs. Ok so let's have some fun with this test #1.. the towel test!  no not like this Alow your dog to smell and get familiar with a large towel or blanket like this\u2026 once comfortable you're gonna place it over your dog's head and this task will provide insight into your dog's ability to problem solve. good boy hey Give your dog three points if they got out of that blanket 15 seconds or less\u2026 two points 15 to 60 seconds and one point if it's over a minute. Test #2 the hidden treat test! Place the treat on the floor and place the towel over it\u2026 you can even place the treat within the towel. Grab your stopwatch and see how long it takes for the dog to get to the treat. Give your dog three points if they got that in under 15 seconds\u2026 two points 15 to 60 and one point if it's over 60 seconds. Game #3 the cup game! Place two or three empty cups upside down in a row while your pup watches\u2026 place a treat under one of the containers.. distract them for a few seconds before allowing them to look for the treat. This will test your dog's memory and will help determine how well your dog can learn and retain information. You can even take it to the next level to see how gifted they are by remembering and sniffing where that treat is in the cup. very good boy Capone! Give your dog three points if he goes straight to the container\u2026 two points if he goes to an empty container before finding the right one.. 1 point if he goes to both wrong containers before finding the right treat. Ok Capone  the last one is the problem solving test.  Ok so you're gonna find a piece of furniture that's low enough to the ground where your dog's paw can fit under there. This task will test your dog's reasoning and problem solving skills. Ready,  Capone? there it is see what he can do good boy he did it! Three points goes to your dog if they could do that under a minute just using their paw\u2026 two points if they use their head first and then following it with their nose and paws and one point if they just give up completely. I'm gonna put the scoring right here on what that means Comment down below your dog's point total! Ready smarty pants?"

    "voice_to_text": "So I need some advice about dogs. So if anybody knows any, anybody with dogs and their dogs have had litter mate syndrome, can you, um, please tag them? Because I need some advice. What. What do I do? So two weeks ago, Pippa attacked Dolly on her ear. She had a massive punch, a wound through one side to the other. Ended up in the vet. Pippa had to go to a dog sitters for a week. Um, Pippa's been back now for five days, I think. It's been fine. They missed each other. I was like, oh, maybe we've turned up, you know, a little corner ear. Then today they've had a fight over a toy and Peppa has drawn blood again, but this time it's on, like, a paw. But, you know, like, they have the paw and then they've got the pad here. Well, it's on that pad and that's bleeding everywhere now. I just don't know how many times we're gonna see blood. What if I got up one day and. And peppers fucking murdered her? I would never forgive myself. I mean, what. What can I do? Like, do you have to end up splitting up litter mate syndrome puppies? Or can I get a dog trainer in and it'll fix it? Because I. I just need an answer. I just don't know what to do. Poor fucking dollies getting battered."

The woman's death is unexplained because they need to actually have on the medical examiner's report an autopsy done and then the exact facts put out about why the dogs turned, etc. It has been addressed by the police and by the public and also by the victims family that the woman was mourned to death. Now, because people excel bully dog owners. I understand you have a little dog in this fight and so you want to support your dog, but the way to do it is not by trashing a woman and the fact that she has died, making up misinformation. Now, I've had people contact me to say she didn't have a single dog bite. That has not been put out anywhere. I've had people contacting me to say, well, I've seen private messages from a neighbour and no one knew the dogs existed because she kept them inside all the time and they weren't looked after. Then you go and look online and there's five or six neighbours report about they told their children not to stroke or approach the dogs because they're scared, because they're exiles, etcetera. So you're actually putting out misinformation in order to feed your propaganda. Because I don't care about one way or another anything else apart from a woman has died. So let's look what the family have actually said. So this is a Family member, a relative, told the son, we miss her. She was sincere and loved by everyone. Then added we asked her to get rid of the dogs. The bond with owners and their dogs is too strong. So why would a family member bring up the dogs at all if in fact the dogs had nothing to do with her death? Now, I get why you love your dogs and that you really do not want Excel restrictions to get any tighter and dogs to be destroyed in that, I get that. But by pretending that this hasn't happened and that woman hasn't died, or prioritizing what you want more than this victim's family isn't helping anyone. And it's a misinformation that's really, really riling me up because it doesn't need to be done. Like, it's down as unexplained, but the dogs have been taken and the family are saying that she has actually been mould by the dog. And also the police have said that. So it's unexplained because they want to explain the whole circumstances around why the dogs turned. So there is absolutely no point to keep having this conversation. A woman was 50 years of age and she died. She was a mother and a grandmother.",

    "voice_to_text": "We're about to fly Bark Air on their inaugural flight, and, of course, I recorded the whole thing. The experience started when we landed in New York with a car for Brooklyn, I guess not me. The car took us to the private terminal of this airport, where we got to meet the captain. Brooklyn got her passport. And the nice thing about this being a private charter is because you're flying out of private airport, there is no TSA line, there's no waiting. And then when it was time to get on the plane, the dogs got to go potty, and they just walked us right to the plane. Bark let me bring my mom, which was so sweet, so that she could experience this. By the time we got on, all of the dogs had already met, so we just got to settle on the plane. We had eight people and four dogs on our flight, concierge and a flight attendant. Before taking off, we got to meet and hear a little bit from Matt Meeker, the CEO of BAR. He gave us a menu, which mostly was for the dogs. Even had earmuffs that the dogs could wear. And then we were up in the. Now, the Bark Air model is pretty simple. It's a paper seat charter service. So you pay for one seat, which includes you and your dog. There are 10 human seats available on the plane. They had tons of amenities for the dogs. Brooklyn got doggy champagne and a ton of trees now. One thing I was a little skeptical about was they mentioned it was gonna be like a dog park in the air, which to me sounds like a nightmare. hold that thought because Brooklyn got to sit in the cockpit anyway. Each flight will be different. If the dogs are friendly, well behaved, and under voice control, they are able to get up and roam around. If there are any nervous or reactive dogs they will cater to them. Bark being bark. They had a ton of fun surprises like shoes on a platter for the dogs. The humans got drinks, snacks, a little goodie bag, and most importantly, a way to get our dogs from point A to point B safely. I have a ton more info in the caption like price, what routes they fly, what the dogs do for the bathroom. The whole experience was a 10 out of 10. It was so easy. The dogs did great, had a car waiting for us. Please peep the steps for Brooklyn. And then we made it to Cali!",

This will be the first time testing it out, so let's see what happens. Go eat it. Amen. Amen. Go eat it. So we have to start over. And after he was done giving all his hugs and lovings, I tried again. You ready? All right, come on. Go sit down over there. Sit. Go eat. Eat it. Eat. Amen. Amen. Amen. Okay. God is good.

    "voice_to_text": "Hi, guys. So I just wanna make a quick video about some of the hate mail I've been getting in regards to the video I made about a woman who lost her life on Monday after she was attacked by exile bullies that she had in her own home, her pets. Now what I find really, really hard to kind of cope with is the fact that because people have exoperable dogs and a passion about their own dog, they will push an agenda even in a case where a woman has lost her life. Like, to me, human life is always gonna come first in these stories when they have been attacked. Like, this woman loved her Excel, bullies refused to get rid of them after the ban. Absolutely went against what her family and friends and neighbours were saying and she end up losing her life. So the fact the comment section and the message I'm getting a full of having a go at me because I've actually honoured this woman's life by telling her story, to me, it's just too far. Like, honestly, come at me all you like, but, you know, try and open your mind a little bit to the fact that just because you love your XL bully dog and you trust your XL bully dog around your children, your babies and all the rest of things you put in the comments, doesn't mean that works for everyone. This woman lost her life. She Was 50 years of age. She had children, she had grandchildren. And so I'm going to talk about that case. The police report says she was mauled to death. So for people who saying like, oh, you know, that's, um, that's a mistreat, that's a lie, or she died in some other way, she wasn't mauled to death by herself.",

This is the government website for the Americans with Disabilities Act, which govern service animals. And they have a frequently asked questions list which includes, does a service animal have to be professionally trained? And right there in black and white, the answer is no. You can train your service this animal yourself. There is no test, there is no certificate. You just go online and buy a fest that says service dog. Go to a website called Amazon and you can just order it. So that's what I did. I bought Wendy a vest. As soon as that vest came in the mail, Wendy traveled with me everywhere. She's wearing that lopsided piece of shit. She can go wherever she wants and nobody says a word. It's insane. She's the ultimate travel companion. Keep going. Haha.",

That your response shouldn't be, oh, I was just saying hi, it's fine, I was just saying hi, I'm getting all snotty about it. Your response should be, oh, sorry, I won't do it. Would you stop when they ask you to? Like, I asked them to, but no, they carried on doing it. Like, I had to say that. That was extremely rude and it's disrespectful to do that. Cause imagine she was aggressive, like, I was picking up her poop as well. So imagine she was aggressive, at least stepped out my hand and they got bit. I won't take that as my fault. I'll take that as their fault for talking to a random dog that they don't know. Like, she's not invested or anything.

I feel like they're fine to be friends with in social and casual settings but if you were looking for a really great supportive friend  that you can lean on these type of friends are not it"

Hound, beagle. Just give up. Just fucking give up. They are just the hardest dogs to train. Put them on a fucking 200 acre piece of land in a farm. Perfect dog. But apart from that. Oh, fuck No.3. Little fucking dogs. Any little fucking dogs. The most aggressive, the most stubborn, the most hard to train at the little dogs. Why is that? Because the owner always distinctly babies these dogs and cradles them and acts like a baby. So as soon as they give them to Uncle Charlie and Aunty Frankie, guess what happens? They throw their toys out the pram. They're not gonna take no for an answer, and they're just fucking little twat faces. They are easiest dogs, honestly. Pit bulls, bulldogs, Rottweilers and German shepherds. They're really scary aggressive.",

Cause he saw the video I made about him yesterday and it was like, well, what video did you make? Cause you're always talking crap about your husband. Valid. Thank you for asking. The one where I said yesterday that I wanted a dog and he didn't want one until we have a kid and I thought it was dumb and he needs to get me a dog. Yes. For all of you who hit him up was like, get me a dog. He was like, why is everybody telling me to get you a dog? What's going on? And then my video came up on his for you page. Huh? My video came up on his for you page, and he said he would give me a dog under certain circumstances, which he does not think I'll be able to achieve, but here we go. He said if I can get this video to 2 million views in two weeks, he will get me a mini golden doodle within a week's time. So that means three weeks from now, i'mma have me a doggy. Now, if you know of any rescue shelters you know that I can hit up, maybe they got one, you know, I know that's very specific. It doesn't necessarily have to Be a golden doodle. Just something hyper allergenic. I can't really do a lot furry. I'mma lose my mind, you know I'm saying. So if y'all know of any between Shelby, North Carolina and Charlotte, let me know, because I'm going to achieve this goal. This video will be at 2 million before two weeks. Please help me with that, y'all. I need you to share, I need you to save it. I need you to comment. I want a puppy so bad. I want a dog. I want a dog so freaking bad. And I definitely want one before we have kids. Cause his idea was to have a dog after we have kids. And who wants to train a dog and kids at the same time? I don't. One at a time, please. And the training for kids never ends. I've had a dog before. I've trained a dog before. After I trained that dog to go outside, it continued to go outside. Okay? I don't want to have to do that in kids at the same time. So please help me out. I appreciate y'all. And sir, I think it's laughable that you didn't think I was gonna be able to achieve this. To go. I accept your challenge, and I'll see you in three weeks. My dog. Thank you."

Like it's a psychosis. Like, is this a normal thing? Um, I don't know, I. I just feel really stupid for allowing myself to get like this. But I'm just curious, does anyone else go through this? Is"

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, so who is gonna tell me that when you own a dog, there's a chance that one day they might wake up and just say, hmm, I don't feel like feeding myself anymore? Don't get me wrong, I love Prince, but over the years, he just got progressively more and more bougie when it comes to eating. I can't do it anymore. What I'm about to show you, no word of a lie, is his daily food routine. Two to three times a day. This is how you know Prince means business. He literally sits here on the carpet and shakes until he start warming up his food. I think he would rather starve until he withers away than eat kibble, so we have to hand cook him these duck patties. Now, this one's already broken up because it was from breakfast earlier. With filtered water, of course, and now he's ready to eat. Haha, only if it were that fucking simple. Step 1. Lure Prince down to the carpet. Yes, he will only eat on carpet. He will not eat on hardwood floors. Step 2. Let him smell it. He has to decide if he's in the mood for food or not. He will attempt to run away to his mom. Here. This is normal. Step three, bring Sylvia. He needs both of us there just to show you guys. This is what happens when you try and feed him on anything but a carpet. Brother. Ew. What's That. What's that, brother? Step 4. Negotiate with the dog. This is a bit of a gamble, because some days he likes to sit with his back to me. Some days, Sylvia like, it's unpredictable. Expect him to swerve out of the way a few times. This is how he likes to assert his dominance. The next step in his routine, hide and seek. He just likes to sometimes run away and hide. I don't know what. I actually don't know what he's doing. And after that, as long as we alternate feeding turns, he will eat. It's honestly kind of a simple routine. And after the 900 step routine, it's time to play with this toy, aka bite my hand off.",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him."

Why skateboard Blue Tavius Devon and icy Le Flair Hawkins okay, not a dog, but this is Keanu Maserati Mayweather y'all. This took me out. My neighbor's cats are at my house so much I gave them names from when they're at my house. Meet Frost Alabasta Jones and Tampaca Sparkles Carmery Louise. Just call her cat. I present to you Sir Leviticus Bartholomew von Strahim, esquire, first of his name in ward of the food bowl. This threat taught me that Bartholomew is a popular name amongst pets. Jersey Raekwon Margielo Augusto Allison the hat is so cute! Omarion DeAndre Debarcus Branch Orion for short. Guinness Cosmo Burrito Mimosa Bellini, Tostado Mojita Hennessy Platano meet the fabulous put in the shade Myers Cold Cecilia, Marie Magdalena, and Ollivander Saint Laurent's. My Dog's name is king because he's always dating office. This is Lola Bean being a also known as Beanie or Big Bean. Brick Gucci Mane Le Flair Carmelo Snipes Petty I can contribute. Here's Frederico Suabacito Dorico Loco Despacito El Chico Davars Jorgasin Rico for short. Chocolate latte Chapman Pepa Le Pew aka Pepper Air or Papita. He said my daughter, period. This whole post deserves a moment. Jatavius Cantrell. Look at the matching sweaters. I mean. Meet Raven Rontenique Smith Rontenique Spaniel Day Louis look like he's been through a lot of things. Is he okay? Cara Zorelle Knowles Savage Laquante Baker baby, we welcome all the bunnies! This is Winter Penelope Shatire Miller, aka the original gangster Winter P. This is Whiskey Frost, aptly named after brown liquor for his brown fur and whiskey colored eyes. I had to include this comment because ain't that the truth. Your pet literally needs a government name so they know when they're acting up. It's the law. I mean facts. Hendrix Quiverius. He's so cute! Toodles! Tyrone Coco Howard. Yeah! Fashion of it is Simone Nicole Falcons. We call her Nova for short. Bella, Don Ray, Ashantiqua Snow with you. Tiara Gucci, Marianne Bethel. A lot of y'all were like how is she pronouncing these names, baby? Sometimes it takes me five to six tries. Dutchess Elizabeth the second. And I did all I could to raise her, but SIS has zero cooth and carry on like she was raised by wild horses. This is Sir Wrangler Michael Thomas Pierre Johnson, Mr. Gucci, Lucifer Antoine and don't forget the Mr. Yes ma'am point Dexter Dexter aka Sexy Dexy Alexander Hamilton Edwards Harris. This is Jonathan Jamarcus Joy star Malcolm X little twin curious Rico Twinkie for short. Y'all already know barkeavius. My fudgie own fudgie Shafter Campbell. This is Braxton P. Hart in the brig and the last one, jacquetavia, is Aquino bit in Harris if you have an outrageous pet name. Stitch this video because we want to see them all."

    "voice_to_text": "improved access to veterinary care saved my cat's life let's talk about it today is May 10th which means that it's Access to Veterinary Care Awareness Day and so sharing my own story I hope that it allows my veterinary professional friends who really think about how we can play a role in bridging the gap between owners and access to veterinary care I have a community acquired cat where I found him in an abandoned apartment he wasn't chipped, he wasn't neutered, so I kept him, but then he started having horrible vomiting and diarrhea and as someone who had just barely scraped enough to pay for him to have food and water and everything that he needed in my apartment I didn't have the several hundred dollars to take him to the vet to work up what was going on with him so I actually saved up to take him to the Humane Society, and pay for their surrendering fee, because I wanted him to get the care that he needed, The Humane Society actually told me that they couldn't take him, even though I was willing to pay the surrendering fee so I had to take him to the municipal shelter in the area and I knew the statistics the cats that went into that and came out of it alive. I cried, I took him to the shelter and I walked up to the front door and I was like I'm here to surrender my cat that I clearly loved, and was crying about, and there was a rescue there who was doing diversion on purpose, for those who don't know what that means, they were talking to people who were looking to surrender their pets they were asking \"why\"  is it a health issue so that we can help out with and I explained to them like it's because I don't know if he's sick I can't afford it if it is something serious and so they're like, well how about we pay for you to go to the nearby vet clinic it's a walk in clinic, you have to wait all day and we'll pay for him to be neutered [at another date] and if you think that you can keep him otherwise like let's let's keep him out of the shelter it was wild; so I went from the shelter where I had been emotionally preparing to surrender my cat to this veterinary clinic where they saw him, they did a full work up on this rescue's dime, and he was otherwise healthy, was probably just dietary discretion because we had just found him, who knows what he had been eating for a week in that apartment and because of them I got to keep him and I still have him. people wanna talk about access to veterinary care like it's this horrific situation, of a poor person getting an animal that they can't take care of, but sometimes in situations like me, where I was able to take care of him otherwise and it was just that upfront cost that I didn't have the funds for, cause I didn't plan on having a cat ultimately then thanks to Banfield (which again I'm not sponsored by them) I was able to get him on a wellness plan and he has received top notch veterinary care ever since I found him and if it wasn't for that rescue intervening at the shelter you would have probably been euthanized, this list is from VetBilling, and it's kind of a good, comprehensive starting point, for what veterinary professionals can do to learn more and take action including learning about the importance of access to veterinary care adopting a spectrum of care approach to treatment rather than asuming gold standard is best or achieveable by everyone, you can offer a variety of payment plans types include sliding scale options like a EmanciPet does; VetBilling, VetBilling  other companies exist like that, you can embrace cultural sensitivity and DEI initiatives because it actually does improve profitablity, you can provide telemedicine services which have all of my friends that have companies, and veterinary clinics do that as well, and you can create an in-house angel fund or affiliate with third party charitable fund too I'm so grateful for the rescue that actually was committed to increasing access to care by helping me get my cat the care he needs, because if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't have him, and he probably wouldn't be here \u2764\ufe0f",

He's written on them occasionally in the past, but he really wasn't that enthusiastic about it, even though I told him this is a new way of going places, doing things. This isn't totally a new trick. It's more an adaptation of a different one. Meaning he's able to balance on an exercise ball. This thing just has erratic movements, and he's not the one controlling where it goes. Last year, after he rode it for a minute or two, he would hop off and want nothing to do with it. But this year, he's showing a lot more interest in trying to get on. This is something he continues to show interest in. I may have to get some kind of grippy surface for it. That way the traction is a lot easier than the slippery plastic. But one thing's for sure, minion found a new way to go places, do things. He's just gotta really concentrate, because he just never knows when the mower is gonna stop, lurch, turn around, whatever might happen with it. He's also not really sure where it's going. Probably has something to do with writing it backwards. But when he's done, he just hops off, and if he's interested again, he'll wander around over to it and take a look at it and evaluate it all. He's getting it figured out.",

Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough",

I had Lyme disease back in 2,018, and I said never again. So I start found out about this little trick, and I started using it on myself. And it seems like when I do this, I don't have to worry about ticks for about the next two months or so. You just kind of take and get about 10 CC's, or in fact, I got 12 here. I got a little bit more. Just put it on the back of your neck here. Let it just kind of Run down. Just wear this all day, and it will soak into your skin. Makes you look like you kind of have greasy hair for the day. There we go. That's enough of it. So. And that's what we do to prevent ticks.

    "voice_to_text": "Let your dog sleep on your bed. It will change his life for these three reasons. Firstly, sharing your bed with your dog has positive effects on your physical health, such as lower blood pressure and reduced heart rate. Additionally, cuddling with your dog in bed releases oxytocin, which is a hormone that boosts your immune system, overall well being, and strengthens the bond between you and your canine companion. Secondly, many dog owners actually sleep better when snuggled next to their furry friends. 41% of people surveyed say that the rhythmic breathing of their dog calms their mind, and this, combined with the sense of companionship a dog brings to the bedroom, leads to a more restful sleep. Before we reveal the last one, comment below if your dog sleeps with you. Finally, allowing your dog to sleep on your bed helps address certain behavioral issues such as separation anxiety or destructive behavior. Sleeping close to you can ease their anxiety and provide them with a sense of security, reducing these unwanted behaviors.",

Fritz here is 32 we haven't asked him to do a damn thing since we got him am I wrong to spend all this time and money pampering him oh look a cigar! now that's a nice blunt I have these questions because I'm wondering if I'm doing this all wrong when our horses quality of life falls apart we normally call the veterinarian then we stay with them while they are injected and peacefully fall asleep telling them how much they are loved and how we will miss them and we will meet them again at the Rainbow Bridge only then do we dig a grave I may be a 63 year old meemaw harboring some silly newfangled ideas in any case I eagerly await your response Sincerely, the Yankee Farm Wife",

And I cannot believe somebody has got me on this app to defend that breed. And I don't have Aussies, but I got my start with an Aubrey trainer who had Aussies. Um, I've been around quite a few good ones. Not a lot, but a few of them. And I have a lot of friends who are very involved in the breed, so I feel like I know at least a little bit about the breed to speak on it. Australian shepherds, at no time have been classified as a dog that has a lot of eye or has any eye. And in this comment, when you're talking about dogs having eye or being upright herders, um, those are antithical to each other. Like, you can't have both of them. Like, a dog that has eye is not gonna be working upright, and a dog that is working upright is not gonna have a lot of eye. Being a loose eyed breed is one of the trademarks of the breed. that's what separates them from border collies and Australian kelpies. And in that video, I wasn't putting down any breed. All I was talking about was how this dog, in this video, does not showcase the breed traits, the working traits that Australian shepherds are supposed to have. That's not tearing anything down. And then another comment, you said that you weren't gonna talk about that specific dog or it was unsportsmanlike or something like that. Who does it serve to not be willing to talk about dogs and programs and breeding programs that are going against what your breed is, what they are, what they're supposed to be?",

    "voice_to_text": "tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entirely true I'll go first when I was 8 years old my family and I moved to a small town in the Midwest and it was a farm town it is built in like the early 1800s I think it's part of like the Homestead Act or something it was you know had a bunch of acres a barn that I burned down like it was an active farm back then lots of history people definitely passed away on the property that we knew for sure and manded and wasn't like very obvious as a child I was super intuitive and I didn't know what to do with that intuition so I naturally got a Ouija board and of course I dragged along my best friend and my sister and and a couple other times a couple other friends on this Ouija board journey where we would go and sit at the top of the stairs to the basement and we would turn all the lights off and turn candles on and then ask this thing questions and it responded and I don't tell people the story it sounds psycho it sounds like the fact that other people are there to verify all of these things and validate gives me inner peace but I don't tell people um but it worked it um and unlike what I thought would happen when it would move you know even when we lift all of our hands off of it it's still moving um is how aggressively it moved it wasn't gentle it was like very sharp and so so much time would pass when we were in there talking to this entity as well like we would think 10 minutes went by and would be two hours like insane being little kids we wanted to know questions and answers like who are we gonna marry when we grow up or how many kids are we gonna have or just questions like that and every single time we start you know it would give us answers at first like and it would tell us about itself we would say like what's your name and it would just say demon dmln like over and over again um when we would ask questions about me it would at first it would like give us answers and then it would just spell bitch repeatedly b a t c h b a t c h b a t c h horrifying like any question about me also sorry if I seem lackluster I already told this whole story and it deleted it was so freaky also having like visuals of like hands reaching towards the plant shit like in the candlelight flicker this entity gave us detail saying that it was like buried in the cemetery um the cemetery that was like local like the name was legit it gave us like I think it either gave us a plot number or it was just like the last name and we did go there and what we found was crazy",

    "voice_to_text": "And why are you bringing her in? Um, because, uh, she doesn't recognize us no more, and she is over like a growling. And, you know, the heartbreaking thing is that someone gave up on chikita when she needed them most. The minute I saw that video of someone turning in Chiquita, I knew that I had to take action. And I immediately reached out to the rescue, and I said, I'll adopt her. That day, we jumped in the car. We headed from Los Angeles straight down towards San Diego to meet with Frosted Faces Foundation, a senior dog rescue. So this is happening. We are adopting this sweet girl. She is worn out right now. She's sleeping. I fell in love with her the first second that I saw that little tongue hanging out in Chiquita. What a great name. I called her Chiquita Banana. In fact, we even ordered her pajamas that had little bananas on it so that she could wear Chiquita banana pajamas. Check this out. She got a little bedroom there, a little crate. Oh, she's such a sweet dog. She's on medication now. Doesn't seem to be as much pain. See, she likes being pet. I've seen. I've seen dogs that look like they're just not gonna last in their day. Have years left with just the right care and attention and diet and love. Now, we were really excited to meet Chiquita, but I. I have to tell you, we were just as Excited to meet everyone at the Frosted Faces Foundation, because imagine going into a place and it's just a bunch of cute old senior dogs that just. Just wanna love you, and they just wanna be loved. It's really such an amazing place. If you ever get the chance, you have to go visit a senior dog rescue. It's one of the sweetest things in the world. Okay, we're back in LA. How's your. How's your first car ride with us, sweetie? Hmm? She slept the whole way. And we adopted Chiquita. We got her home. We were really excited to get her on a nutrition plan, to do everything that we could to help her. Look at that girl. You got your own backyard. But then things turn for the worse. It's like Chiquita's little body just gave up. It's almost like she knew she was safe now and she was loved and that she could let go. When I think about Chiquita, still makes me sad. But there's also a little place of happiness because. Because although we would have liked to have her here for years, even. Even months, just being able to have Chiquita for a couple of days so that we could show her that she's important and that she matters and that she's safe. I know it made the world of difference for us. And I think it really made the world of difference for her in our final days. My hope is that By sharing Chiquita's story that her life matters because it inspires other people to adopt senior dogs. And remember, adopting a senior dog is for them, but it's also very rewarding for you. And a special thanks to Frosted Faces Foundation for everything they do. And if you believe in senior dog rescue and helping dogs, please share this because I want the whole world to consider adopting or fostering a senior dog.",

Everybody, I've explained this numerous times on this app. I don't know if you're new to my page or what, but this. This is safer for them. This is much safer. Allows them to be out here and not be running around doing stupid things when I'm out working other dogs. Um, because they can get very, uh, overalls, they can get a little excited, they can hurt themselves, they can break through fences. They get. They do a lot of stupid things if they are not compliant. Somehow, um, tad, for whatever reason, has a very Sad demeanor when he's on the chain. I assure you, he's never been beaten on the chain or anything like that. He's just the way he is. Every one of these dogs has some weird quirk about him. But they line up when it's time to work.

I was gonna have me a ginger dog. My kavapu lovers group told me that was not the case. Turns out when a feffle f up here has the fading gene that poodles can carry, just like her mama, we both got a genetic mutation in us. You wanna see what my dog looks like now? Prepare to be shocked. Now you can call me a dumb dumb because I didn't know about this, but all I've had my entire life is ankle biters. Miss my little patchy boy so much I can't even talk about it. I got to thinking about it. Nobody talks smack on dogs for having a fading gene, but they sure got a lot to say when women do.

How does it feel to constantly obsess over those thoughts, situations, and scenarios? You put the oh my god in OCD. A Doberman owner is exhausted, but physically and mentally exhausted because they have an addiction. And whether the addiction is family, friends, or work, it's slowly killing them. Please focus on you before you forget who you truly are. If I were to assign a letter grade to a Dalmatian owner's mental health, it would be ADHD with a heavy emphasis on the D. A basset hound owner has difficulty sleeping, can be easily frustrated, and has tension in the upper back. You, my friend, have anxiety. The Saint Bernard. I know you don't want to hear this, but you're actually doing pretty okay. Hey, while you pick your jaw up off the floor, I will remind you of the sobering fact it could be much worse. If you have a poodle, do you remember that person in your life that asked, have you ever considered therapy? That wasn't a suggestion. It was an intervention. So you have a mixed breed from an animal shelter. You adopted this perfect little angel because you are mixed bag of emotions, on the verge of a level 7 breakdown, and needed something to fix you. Unfortunately, you transferred all of your issues onto this dog, and now you have a trauma bond. Please, Take all the issues listed above and multiply them by 3. At this point it's comical to talk about your mental health. In fact, just remove the word health mental."

So if she has one of these type of dogs, don't come in there to play with her. Bro. She serious. She gets like a regular shelter mutt. Uh, she just got a dog to say she has a dog. Alright. Boom. If she gets any type of hybrid dog breed, meaning Ozzy Doodle, Golden Doodle, Bernadoodle. If she got one of those type of dogs, she either A. Got the dog to put in the back of her Jeep, B. She got it for aesthetic purposes, or C. She has pet allergies and she needs a hypoallergenic dog breed. If she has any type of Maltese poo be Sean freeze a small little dogs. Um, she's rich. Um, don't go in there thinking that you're about to tell her what to do with her dog, cause she's not hearing none of that. And she gets a pit. She just enjoys an active lifestyle.

When you say you're not gonna marry women, for some women who know that being married to some men means nothing but unpaid labor, unappreciated labor, that it means that you're gonna weaponize your incompetence, they don't see that as exciting either. When you say that you're not gonna pay all the bills. Now, how many of you are really paying all the bills? And the alternative that you all offer is because if you don't take one of us and accept us as we are, you're gonna have to die alone. Have to get you a pet. Have you seen how some of these women treat their pets? Have you seen the stakes? Have you seen the. The skincare routine and the massage? Have you seen how these women treat their pets? They love those dogs. Oh, they love those cats. Have you seen their apartments here on TikTok? How well furnished and clean and well kept they are? You're not threatening these women by offering to take off the table something that you never brought to it.

But if you didn't know that Shih Tzu's, those little fluffy guys with the little tails are so cute. Yeah. No, they were bred to kill. No. 2, a Malinois. Kind of self explanatory. They are not a dog. They are a machine. They are a meat missile. There's a reason why the military and the police use them. They're not a family dog, they're not a house dog. And I don't have 47 hours in a day to train a dog or work with a dog, and that's what they basically require. And then number three, any doodle. Any doodle, any doodle. It doesn't matter what it is, I don't want anything to do with a doodle. The behavioral issues that come with most doodles.

I'm so sorry I missed that. I was on vacation in the Virgin Islands wearing a bikini. Shut up. I'm not even that tan. Oh my god, wait. I love your necklace. \"I am microchipped.\" Oh my god, that's so beautiful. I'm into poetry, too. Hey, Rochelle, he's a dog. Whatever, Tyler. You had your shot with me and you blew it. I gave you a chance to change, and you refused. How was I supposed to get taller? If you cared about me, you would have figured it out. Whatever. Hey, Bud, you want the rest of my sandwich? I don't want it. Oh, wow. Someone is hungry. You're eating, like, so fast, and just with your mouth. Aren't you embarrassed for eating like that in front of a girl? I guess not. You don't care at all, which, of course, only makes you hotter. Uh, Rochelle, are you so blinded by the need to be popular you can't tell that that's a dog? Whatever, Trent. You had your shot with me and you blew it. You couldn't be what I needed you to be. I'm sorry my family isn't rich. So was I. Hey, Bud. Ready for your walk? I got your little girlfriend outside. Wait, you have a girlfriend? Were you ever gonna tell me about her? Are you just gonna sit there and let me throw myself at you like an idiot? Oh, so now you're not gonna talk to me? Fine. I hope you and that slut are happy by the way. I heard she eats grass, barfs, and then eats her own barf. You know, I've never done any of those things. Just so you know, I'm not strict about condoms. If you don't have one, I'll just say, \"Be careful, okay?\" and still go along with it. Not that you'll ever benefit from it. Rochelle, he's a dog. You can say that again. Bye, Bud.",

No. 2 the German Shepherd, aka the Velcro Dog, is a clingy companion, always ready to follow you on all your adventures. The soft sound of his nails on the ground as he follows you is surely a sound you're familiar with. Before I reveal the number one choice, subscribe or your dog will be relieving itself in your kitchen. Number one the French bulldog. That companion who follows you everywhere and never lets you out of their sight. These little balls of four melt hearts with their licks and tender glances.

So for the people wondering why your catalogue is chasing after your kids or your other animals or people, this is why. They were bred over generations and generations to do this specific thing. You have to be able to meet that knee. Like that one just flew 10ft in the air, landed beautifully, might I add, and then wasn't face and was just ready to keep going. They're fearless, which is what makes them so great at this job. But if you don't have \uffe1a one thousand bowl at your disposal or some other similar outlet to give this dog a job to do what it is bred and born to do, probably don't get a cattle dog."

    "voice_to_text": "You know, the story of consciousness, it's occupied so many deep thinkers over the decades, over the centuries. Go back to, to, to deck heart. I think, therefore I am. This is like a declaration of consciousness. And I have a kind of an orthodox view of consciousness. Very simple. It's as long as people keep writing books to explain consciousness, they're offering us evidence that we have no idea what it is. Think about it, right? Look, go to the bookstore or the library and try to find books on the mind, on the human mind and conscious. The shelf after shut, people still writing about it. If we really understood consciousness, the book would be written and we'd be done and we moving on to the next problem. Okay, Newtonian gravity. We're not still writing books on it. It's like 2 books on the shelf. A Newtonian. We got this, okay? Nuclear fusion, we got this, right? The things that are well known that we don't keep writing books about because we've moved on. So the, the. The number of times and ways and people who are talking about consciousness, for me, is evidence that we still don't know what it is. First, my second point is, who are we to say that we're conscious? If we met an alien 10 times smarter than us first, we would look like worms or something. They. They might not count us among the ranks of intelligent species in the galaxy. The. The audacity of us to say, let's go out and look for other intelligent life. Really? Who said we're intelligent? We did. So what kind of measure is that? All right, if there's a species out there smarter than us, compared to us, then we are. Compared to, let's say, chimps. There's no way they would rank us among the intelligent species of the galaxy. They'd be embarrassed that we lived in the same galaxy as they did, particularly after they looked a little closer at civilization. So my question is, if there's a higher level of consciousness attainable by higher, smarter beings, who are we to declare that we are conscious at all?",

    "voice_to_text": "You wanna hear something crazy that's happening in the United States right now? A federal judge in Texas, Reid o'connor, this guy just made a ruling that stripped one of the key provisions in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that requires health insurance companies and employers to provide free health services that include cancer screenings, diabetes screenings, HIV prep medications, depression screening, etc. This is something that's gonna affect over 100 million people based on this ruling. This is the same judge that about 4 years ago, tried to strike down the Affordable Care Act from being law, and then it was upheld by the Supreme Court at that time. The reason why this happened was because a case was brought forth by 6 individuals and 2 Christian owned businesses who did not want to provide free HIV prep medication because they did not want to promote homosexual behavior since it wasn't in line with their religious beliefs. It's likely that the Biden administration will appeal this ruling, but if it's upheld by the 5th Circuit Court of appeals, then this is going to go to the Supreme Court again. While I do believe that we need to have systemic changes to our health care system, breaking it down without trying to build it up at the same time is not the way to do it.",
