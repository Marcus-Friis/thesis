So one player per spend opponent revealed after the video is complete. Let's go ahead and take the defensive player right off the bat. Will go TJ Watt. Gonna win the Joker but don't really care for it to be honest. Give me Baltimore's defense. Baltimore's defense with TJ Watt. Sounds like a dream. Sounds like a dream come true. Give me Joe Burrow. I almost accidentally clicked on the wrong one. UM could go Diggs, but he'll probably want to trade since burrow doesn't throw them the ball enough, so. Give me a Sam Laporta at tight ends. Trying to see what we got left. I like a Mark Cooper. I like Alvin Kamara, but give me Chris Godwin. Give me Chris Godwin at wide receiver. Two Gary Wilson. People forget how good Gary Wilson is. Gary Wilson will be my wide receiver one. Yeah, give me Aaron Jones. I'm good with that. Give me like a Detroit Atlanta online. Something like that. Cincinnati's online? I mean, that's not exactly the best, but I think this team is respectable. Again. I'm not gonna keep my hopes up. I've done that way too many times. Nick, you're my opponent. You'll probably beat me, I'm sure. I'm sure you'll get like Patrick Mahomes CMC and Detroit Online or something like that. But good luck, brother. Congratulations. A cousin Michael in the W. I'll talk to you guys later.",

It's been a few hours, like I'm assuming, I'm gonna go on for. But if you guys vote for me, I'm gonna need y'all take some drug tests. You know the drill. I'm owing for. We're trying to avoid going on for one player per spin. My opponent will be revealed after this video is complete. Alright. Um. Hmm. I think Slayton's on the Eagles, right? No, we're not gonna do that. Um. Why is this happening again? Let's go with Tyler Higby. We'll go ahead and go with Tyler Higby. I trust that the rest of my team will age very well. All right, let's go with. Let's go with Kansas City's defense. Oh, shoot. Okay, ignore the tight end part, because that's a. That's Higby. Higby is taken. Let's go with Detroit's old line. The tight end positions taken, y'all, just so you know. Um. Let's go with Nico Collins at wide receiver. I could go with Aaron Rodgers, but honestly, I feel like I can find about quarterback now, so we'll see what happens. Um. Could go with Jared Goff. I'm not gonna do that. Could go. You know what? Let's go with Saquon Barkley. I like the Saquon Barkley pick. Thank you. Thank you very much. Lamar Jackson. I know I could go with Davante Adams, but I need a quarterback. Justin Jefferson, baby. Alright, defensive player. Who do we got? Um, I'm gonna be honest. I don't even know who the best player on Washington is. Um. Shows my knowledge about the Washington Commanders. Um, I'll put it down here. Alright. Opponent revealed. Cousin Michael, you are my fifth opponent. Will I have my first win the season? I'm not gonna count on it. But I wish you the best of luck. Can you beat this team?"

No local news, no community news, nobody sharing this story. This is fake. It's very obviously fake. You click on the con, the account, and all they do is post AI pictures with outlandish rage baiting stories. And I've seen several people, several accounts re share this story. But a simple Google search, there's no court documents, there's no news stories, there's no social media post outside of people reposting this story from the real Dax Dot news. Outrage baiting. And honestly, we have to be very cautious of this in United States. It is a election year. Stuff like this might seem like, oh, just rage baiting, just for engagement, just for revenue. But watch, these stories have more of a political change the closer we get to November. They're meant to do damage to a community. Be wary and please invest in a little bit of media literacy."

To travel, to get married, to have kids I can't even imagine I want to have a big family but I'm even at that point where I'm like does it even make sense to? if I can't even financially take care of myself? you know? and I think the biggest thing for me too is that I feel like I failed myself and there are times when I feel like I've even failed my family my parents that immigrated from Ghana to live in the United States  and raise their kids to be great and amazing here and I'm like I just feel like this below average joe shmoe that pays the bills to get by but\u00a0like,\u00a0what\u00a0else\u00a0what\u00a0else\u00a0am\u00a0I\u00a0doing? but long story short I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to see everybody's stories and I don\u2019t wanna take too much of y'all's time I don't even imagine this will get on the FYP because you know tiktok algorithms but anywho I hope that we can all get through this and help one another",

Mary   messaged   me   and   she   was   being   very   upfront   from   the   beginning She wanted a cheesecake and she wanted it. Now.   wanted   a   cheesecake   and   she   wanted   it   Now I told her we don't facilitate same day orders,   told   her   we   don't   facilitate   same   day   orders but if she wanted something a bit rushed,   if   she   wanted   something   a   bit   rushed we could facilitate her during the course of the week.   could   facilitate   her   during   the   course   of   the   week So she agrees.   she   agrees I send her my invoice along with the payment instructions   send   her   my   invoice   along   with   the   payment   instructions like I do all my customers.

    "voice_to_text": "hey everybody you all know I like to dress up as different specialties in medicine but I am actually a board certified ophthalmologist and I wanna talk about something very important for a few minutes blindness if you ask 10 people to give the definition for blindness you're gonna get 10 different answers I\u2019d guess a lot of people think that being blind means you just don't see anything just black and that is rarely the case blindness is a spectrum and I want to explain what we mean when we say that there are two main parameters we use to assess visual function there's your visual acuity that's your ability to look across the room and read the letters on the chart then there's also your visual field which is your peripheral vision all around you let's start with visual acuity in the US we consider perfect vision to be 2020 if you have 2040 vision that means that what you can see at 20 feet someone with perfect vision can see at 40 feet so they can move back 20 feet and still see the same thing you're seeing if you have 20/200 vision that means that what you can see at 20 feet someone with perfect vision can see at 200 feet they go way back and still see it the largest letter on the chart that's usually about 20/200 but some people don't even have that level of vision they can only see finger counting or hand motion or some people have what we call light perception vision where all they can see is light coming from different directions all of that is still useful vision even if you can only see a hand moving in front of your face you can still see that somebody is standing in front of you or an object is off to the side you may not be able to tell what that object is but you know something's there or you can tell where light is coming from and that can help you navigate the world so clearly there's a range of visual acuity so what's the definition of blindness well depends on who you ask and what kind of activities you're doing let's take driving for example most states require you to have at least one eye that sees 2040 Vision in order to qualify for an unrestricted driver's license so if you have 2080 Vision in both eyes are you considered blind well according to the department of transportation yeah I guess so but people with 2080 vision often can navigate the world just fine they can perform their normal daily activities and take care of themselves and do things they like to do without much difficulty people with hand motion vision they have a different definition of blindness because they certainly need help crossing a busy road whether it's a guide dog or a white cane or someone helping them but they can have conversations with people they can know you're sitting in front of them they can look you right in the eye and talk to you and and that's a level of function that's slightly different but you know maybe they're considered blind as well then there's peripheral vision so we have a way of measuring this in the eye clinic we put your head in like this bowl thing and you hit a button when you see a light and it maps out your visual field so this is an example of the readout we get don't worry about all the numbers and stuff basically white space means you saw the thing so that big black spot right there that's your physiologic blind spot we all have that we don't see it though our brain just filters that out this is the peripheral vision of someone with glaucoma so you see all that black space so this is the person's left eye and basically what that shows is they cannot see from like midline up they don't have any superior vision out of that left eye due to a disease called glaucoma and this is the peripheral vision of someone who's had a stroke so this bet is both eyes left and right and this person has lost all their vision on the left side they don't have any vision to the left this is someone who does not qualify for a driver's license because almost all states require you to have a certain amount of degrees of visual field but this person can't see anything to the left they might actually have 20/20 perfect vision straight ahead but they have no vision to the left you can imagine how dangerous that would be not being able to see anything coming off to that side so these are often very difficult conversations we have with people would this person be considered blind well they are severely limited this is a a major change to their lifestyle for their ability to function especially if they live alone so this can turn someone's world upside down and there's a person like this who only has a very central small island of vision left they have some disease or several diseases that do this that can just take out all of your peripheral vision this patient has no peripheral vision just all they see is a really small island right in the center so they might read 2020 on the chart 2015 on the chart but their their their function is severely limited by their lack of peripheral vision is this person blind does this person consider themselves blind the point is vision is complex it is incredibly important to everything we do and there is no one definition of blindness it affects different people in wildly different ways",

Because Trump is coming for those institutions. He knows their power. And I think he has regrets that he didn't work hard enough to corrupt them last time. So he's coming for them, and that's a danger for all Americans. He's gonna put people in positions in those organizations. He. He didn't have all stars the last time. He'll have the bottom of the barrel this time. But people who will wanna do his will. And that should worry every American. This election matters because of a reason like that. People have to participate. You cannot sit on the sideline. I don't care how you feel about Joe Biden, you must vote for him because the consequences on the other side are too severe.",

Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going.

    "voice_to_text": "Number one reason why most men can't compete against me whenever I challenge them to the Alpha Dom challenge is not because of anything super complicated or intrinsic. It's actually something very simple. But most of men don't want to face it. And what they should be facing is the fact that when they were very, very young, society, feminism will culture anything, reached up their tailpipe and rip their spine out directly. And they personally think, because they've been brainwashed enough by the matrix or whatever you fucking wanna call it, that if they agree with women, that's how they get them. Have you been paying attention to history from the dawn of mankind till now? Cause I gotta tell you, constantly being favorable and agreeing with women is not how you get them. For one, women like drama. For two, they like what? Men that have a spine or women that have spine? And the easiest way to stand forward. Because healthy enough, no one on this planet really has a spine anymore. So the reason why women are dating you is simple. You're not masculine enough. You have no dominance in you. You're not confident in yourself. You're too scared. You're constantly running around saying, oh please, I agree with you. Yes, the bear is better than the man. And then you get a lot of likes on TikTok and maybe Utah Tube and not really so much on Instagram. But then you wonder why you don't Have women. You don't have women because they'll like your content. But if you're smart enough, you know that women actually want to date men. Not whatever you are becoming.",

This shoe right here does not get much airplay from me, although it is a beautiful shoe. A lot of people tend to hate on mids. Not me though. This shoe is inspired by the Aztec culture, specifically Miklan, which was the god of the underworld. As you can see all along the shoe you have this Jaguar print. You obviously got the teeth around the toe box. Premium suede on that toe box as well. The Nike swoosh design is inspired by the Aztec culture. The Jaguar glyph on the back has a bejeweled eye. And again the jaguar print all around the collar. And this is the other shoe by the way. They have mismatched tongue tags. This one says siempre, the other one says Familia. Now show me the most underrated Jordan one in your collection."

She looks a little worse for the wear on the stool. After two dominant rounds from Elkin, Clarissa Shield gets a little confidence boost. And she has back. And that right hand is gonna help it as well. Elkin will take that attempt. She was in deep, and now Shields has got a nice sprawl. She's got her legs back. She needs to learn to let her hands or feet slide there. There's a shield heavy on the hips here. Elkin's hands are still locked. That head covered there. Pushes away nice. They could get up. Pounding from the top. Claressa Shields putting it on Brittany Oaken, who's clinging on for dear life. Take shots! Brittany's not protecting her face there. She's gotta get moving or get back to a better guard position there. Shield has to address her legs. Can't let Elkin get control of her legs here. Keep her hips. Nice roll. It's again Teresa Shields on top and hurting Brittany Elkin. This is a better position for Brittany. She might be able to put Shields to her back. She needs to get that left leg out and get a better base. Shields just gotta keep her hips in the fight there. It's too upright to pass to, to punch, and Belkin could bowler over. More right hands from the top. Claressa Shields continues. To pound away at the head of Brittany Elkin. This is where Shields should try to get back to her feet. If she can disengage. I know she's landing some big shots, but those are big shots right there. Oh, boy. And the referee stops it and waves it off. Claressa Shields. The quote, wow! Successful in her MMA debut with ground and pound. What the fuck? A sprawling brown captain pulls it out with the rest of Shields in round 3."

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

Israel was warned by the United States that if they were to commence with the ground invasion in Rafah, that shipments of weapons would halt. So today, this Israeli official, Talib Guth Liab, sent a message to the United States. She said, the US is threatening not to give us precise missiles. Then mockingly, she said, oh, yeah, well, I got news for the US. We have imprecise missiles, and we have the right to defend ourselves. So maybe instead of using a precise missile and taking down a specific room or a specific building, I'll use my imprecise missiles and I'll just collapse 10 buildings. 10 buildings! This statement was the official response of Israel to the halted shipment of weapons. All because the United States told them to not enter a Rafah and begin the ground invasion, and they didn't like that. So now the amount of unaliving and destruction will be on the United States's hands, as if it's all one big oops. 10 buildings instead of a specific room. Yesterday, images of specific rooms were released from Rafa, and the only people who were victims in those specific rooms were children. And let's not even mention the fact that maybe, just maybe, one of the hostages might be in one of those 10 buildings. Oh, wait, but that doesn't actually matter, does it?"

That's more than any other musician in the history of musicians and things. So after thrilling countless superfans across five continents, and with 152 shows in the hopper, she has her sights sets on Europe. This has been the most extraordinary experience of my entire life. Swift is so red hot, she even has nation states squabbling over being a mere stop on her errors tour. Why? They call it the Swift effect. You see, wherever Taylor Swift goes, so do people's wallets, and everyone wants a piece of the action. It's partly the reason she was time magazine's person of the year in 2023. She's so mainlined into pop culture right now, even universities want in. We're talking the elite ones like Harvard and Stanford, who are offering courses on how Taylor Swift is cranking up the economic dial wherever she goes. They even gave it a name. Swift Denomics.

There are two parents, mom and dad, and four children. This is the Hum Don family here. From left to right. Al Yaman is one year 4 months old. Next to him is his older brother, Anas, who is eleven. Next to him is his mother, Islam. Next to her in the back is Nesma. She's nine. And in front of her is her sister Sana, who is five. In the foreground on the far right is Ahmed. He is the father. I've been in contact with this family every day for the past week. And I have received updates and many, many photos before and after. We've had video chats. We are in constant contact. First we need to raise $150 per person, coming to $900 total for updated passports. Then we need $5,000 per adult, $2,500 per child under sixteen to cross into Egypt. And then we'd like to raise provisions for them to sustain life for as many months as we can after that. I've put a thing to my thing in my thing where you can find me and you can click and go do the stuff. So I don't have a huge platform, but there's. There's a big pocket full of you here. So if y'all can donate what you can, that would be amazing. Um, I really wanna help this Family. And I want you guys. I hope that you guys can help me help them. So let's do this. Um, this is one of many, many families, and, um, this is the family that I've chosen to help. So thanks for listening, and I love you all.",

If you look at the, uh, postings on TikTok and the number of mentions of Palestinians relative to other social media sites, it's overwhelmingly so among, uh, TikTok, um, uh, broadcast.

And the more you do things like this, the more you actually go and see nature, look at the natural world, and use your own discernment to decide what this earth actually is. Whether it was created or not, whether you really come from a Big Bang, whether what we're being told is far from the truth, it's completely up to you.

It was like I was eating a cheesecake. It was like a blueberry cheesecake or it. It kinda tasted like Chobani. I never got Chobani flip as a kid growing up cause my mom thought it was kind of a waste of money, and she's kinda right cause I would never buy. I think the vanilla is mixed in with the cheese, which really brings out that rich flavor of the goat cheese. This is like the Pinnacle of sweet cheeses. I could eat this whole thing, but I'm not gonna cause I'm out of Lactaid. I'm going to Isonok in like a second here. I'll just save it for when I'm back. Overall, this was a great cheese. Probably the best sweet cheese I've had so far. I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10 bonus round green apple. I recently said in a video that I was colorblind.

And you said, quote, it is not anti Semitic to hold you accountable for your actions. Senator, can't both things be true? There are legitimate criticisms of the Netanyahu government, but some of these protests have also clearly tapped into a deep undercurrent of antisemitism. Look, Donna, Anti Semitism is a vile and disgusting ideology which has resulted in the deaths of many, many millions of people in the last hundred years. And we got to oppose it in every form. And do I doubt for a moment that anti Semitism exists? That is growing in the United States? That is part that exists among some people in. In the protest movement, of course. But here is the reality right now. What Netya was right wing, extremist and racist government is doing is unprecedented in the modern history of warfare.

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. This might be a little controversial, and you are 100% in your right to disagree with me and comment whatever you wanna comment in my comment section. However, I do not believe in peaceful protest. Again, in my opinion, um, peace is a white man's word. We know that saying, and that saying is very true and alive. The reason why I don't believe in peaceful protest, however, I do go to peaceful protest and I'm okay with people having peaceful protest. I am not the one that is in charge of protests. However, I don't believe in peaceful protest because the people who are having peaceful protests will always be made out to be violent. People will always have. Such as what happened with the Zionist attacking the peaceful protesters and they got demolished, they got their face beaten in. Um, I don't believe in not fighting back. I believe that sometimes, and I think right now in this world, violence needs to be met with violence. I think we are seen as pushovers. And the reason why I say this is because I feel like a lot of, like, peaceful protests are LED by people, and then a lot of violent protests and those that are liberating are LED by people, black and brown people. And we always are subjugated to, um, having to suffer the consequences. Yet we are the ones who get the point across faster. We are the ones who understand that peace is A white man's, um. Uh, word. The ones who do peaceful protest are, to be honest, white. So it's hard to understand that. Saying that quote, um, I'm not against, you know, peaceful protest, I'm not. But in my opinion, I feel like we've gotten to the point in our lives where life, the world is in complete and utter shambles. We are watching the genocide happen. The world is not listening to us, we are not being listened to. Um, and I think it's time. I think it's time. But I think people need to be the ones at the front line at this point, because Zionists are the ones who are now taking and attacking people. Cause we are usually on the front line.",

Alright, well, I guess it's time for me to do the impossible here, because no one has done this apparently. So let's see what we gotta do here. And uh, this one actually looks a little bit more difficult than the other ones, I'm not gonna lie. But we're gonna start off with that green one. Get that green one out the way. Okay, then I'm gonna go with red. Get the red balloons out the way. So now I can get the blue balloons get out of there. Then I can get the orange. Then I could get the green balloons out of there. Yeah! I won! Of course I won. Because this filter is not hard at all. If you would like to play this filter yourself, at the bottom of this video, it should say green screen video. You click the arrow to the right of it, a drop down should come up and then you should be able to play this filter, see if you could beat it. Once again, I think it's absolutely easy. As you just saw, I literally beat it in like 10 seconds. So yeah, give it a try. But it's not impossible. I think almost everyone has probably beaten this filter. But I don't know, pretty easy."

And Mike's last fight was an exhibition and those punches looked more like soft kisses. I don't know, I think this is his easiest match yet cause he obviously has more power and skill and like this fight's gonna get ugly quick.

    "voice_to_text": "We're in the middle of a mental health crisis, but Nashville has this place where if you're arrested you can get mental health help. It's something they're trying to create all around the country, but we found ours is almost always empty. Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall spearheaded the Behavioral Care Center -  tired of seeing mentally ill people locked up - he used money from his jail budget to build a treatment facility inside the jail. Daily jail logs reveal  the BCC has 60 beds, but many times over the last year only about 15 of those were filled. Some days the program had as few as 10 participants, meaning 50 beds in the highly touted program were sitting empty. And that's very concerning it runs at about 20% occupancy at best. Judge Melissa Blackburn oversees Davidson County's Mental Health Court. After seeing the numbers, she thinks there's room to help more people. NewsChannel 5 Investigates questioned Judge Blackburn about this man, Johnson Lloyd, who sat in the Davidson County Jail for nearly a year waiting on a mental health evaluation. When he was finally found incompetent, he was released. He then went up to Bowling Green, where he was arrested for raping a woman. I know they do not take dangerous individuals or very difficult individuals, but he may have been someone once medicated, he may not have been. Why are there so many empty beds? So it was never targeting to solve the mental health problem, and all the people who complain about bed counts, I wish they would call me. Some do, here's what I would tell you, you weren't around helping me design what we needed. So are you disappointed that it's only about 20 to 30% full? No it only is designed to treat a certain type mental illness. The sheriff says the center cannot treat severely mentally ill people. There are no locks on the doors. It's designed for people who need basic help like getting back on their meds  to keep them out of the criminal justice system. But projections from years ago when it was being built, calculated half of everyone arrested would qualify for the BCC and it's beds would be full. The sheriff says arrests are down dramatically. When he planned the BCC, he says 100 people a day were being arrested. That number went down during covid and it's not gone back up. He says now 60 people a day are arrested. The sheriff says it's up to the state to build more hospitals to treat the severely mentally ill. But I wanna know what you think."

We put the baby in there, and now we're going to, um, tie it up together with a zip tie. And then I go ahead and trim that to make sure it's not sharp.

And then this is his birthing set for home and includes everything that they're gonna need to get the baby out of his amniotic sack.

But we're gonna do a filter story time while I try to get this nail done. I don't know if I'm gonna actually be able to beat this. I get tap fast enough. So I recently had someone trip and spill a drink on me, which was no big deal. I didn't really care. I was nice. But something was wrong with this person because they thought it was my fault that they spilled their drink on me. Oh, look, I won. But essentially, as soon as they spilled the drink, they blame me and said that I should watch where I'm going, even though I was standing completely still when this happened. And they had the audacity to say that they were glad that none of the drink got on them, as if they had it just poured a drink all over me. Now, I was, of course, mad, but I was ready to let it go and just say whatever until they told me to buy them another drink. At that point, I just told them to go buy their own expletive drink and watch where the expletive again they're going next time, cause there is no way I'm doing anything for them. And basically, after that, the friends I was with grab me, sort of usher me out of there, shared Some very heated words with the person, and we left. Moral of the story, if you're gonna spill a drink on someone, at least own the fact that you did it. But honestly, this is probably some way to get a free drink or something."
