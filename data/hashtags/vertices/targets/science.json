A guy responded what if they're vegetarian or pescatarian? She replied I send them fries too. Another guy replied damn, even if I was a pescatarian she would have got me. Yeah, I'm a slut. A plate of chips would have gotten my attention. Hmm. Another reply if a shorty sends wings to a table and gives me a little wave, I'm folding like fresh laundry. Applying pressure at its finest. A random lady. I love the term applying pressure. It's my favorite term. Applying pressure is finest. Another random lady commented noted. I just needed one guy I found attractive to cosign this. Thank you sir. He then replied again you're welcome and I appreciate that. Surely you almost got me without the wings with your smooth ass. Another guy replied on God she's smooth as fuck. Ha ha ha ha ha what's up? I. Yeah. Hand up. Hmm. My heart would flutter. Hmm. If a baddie if I'm on a on a fucking Twitter thread hmm.

    "voice_to_text": "TikToks doing this thing where they tell me what they want me to make videos about, and apparently right now, orangutans are the new hot thing. You guys cannot stop hearing about orangutans. But let me do you one better. Orangutans aren't even like, my number one great ape. They're like my third favorite great ape. First has to be humans, because we do a lot of stuff. Third is orangutans. But second. Second is this bad boy right here. You know what this is? You might have said a chimpanzee. Well, you would be so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. This is a bonobo, okay? Bonobos are like, top tier chimpanzees. Everything about a chimpanzee, that's bad, bonobos do better. Okay? Bonobos are nice. Chimpanzees have war with each other, okay? Bonobos, when they have a conflict, instead of having war, they just make love. Literally, that's their solutions. The conflict is to just make love with each other. Over the smallest drop of a hat, they'll do that and they all get along. They're very nice. They're very nice to people. Now, they do look a lot like chimpanzees. And a really interesting thing is the geography. There's a river in Africa. Okay, there's a lot of rivers in Africa, but there's one in particular that on one side the river there, it's a chimpanzees habitat. On the other side of the river, it's the bonobos habitat. That's where they're both from. And they're just like the Geography of that river. Cause they don't like to swim. You didn't know this? They don't like to swim, they don't go across the river, so they diverge genetically. One group became bonobos, which behave very differently then chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are basically the devil. And these guys are like the angels of the great ape kingdom. They're great. If I could have a pet benobo, I would. So let's forget about orangutans and get Benobo's trending",

The brain organoids, the tiny human brains that we can grow in jars, have been released for commercial processing access. If you're not familiar with these guys, they are human brains that have been grown from stem cells. And they have brain waves very similar to a premature babies. I'm not kidding. The limitations on their use and their growth seems to be hypoxia due to the fact that their disembodied brain and don't have a circulatory system. They can be attached to a computer chip and have better processing power than our most advanced AI. A Swiss company, Neuro Platform, is debuting their biological computer chips and giving access to private citizens to use the processing power of the brain organoids. While there are 16 brain organoids to a chip, they're maintaining thousands of them. They also have mouse and rat brain organoids, but they explicitly used human brain organoids. There have been some advancements in being able to keep them alive longer, including keeping them in a media that's oxygen rich and shaking them. They live about 100 days, so they will constantly need to be refreshed. As for the company, you personally can get access to their computation. It is going to run you about $500 a month if you're in education. I am frustrated. This is brand new technology. It is pretty spooky. Those are functional little eyes that Can perceive light. They are immature human brains. They have all the structures that a human brain should have. They're just never reached that point in development because, you know, the lack of a circulatory system. But scientists are doing their very best to make them bigger and more complex. At what point are we gonna bring ethics into the equation?",

    "voice_to_text": "I've been in Japan for 10 days. I got two STDs, chlamydia and gonorrhea. I have it. Let's talk about it and let's rate it one through 10. Starting off with side effects and symptoms. I have lower abdomen pain, which varies on and off. And it feels like I have to pee non stop, but nothing comes out. And when I do pee, it burns like lava. And I also have flu like symptoms such as headaches, sore throats, and dizziness. The pain is pretty bad, but I can still function. So I would rate it about six and a half out of 10. Let's break down the physical aesthetics. I have redness, soreness, and inflamation. And I've been waking up with a lot of discharge. It's very uncomfortable, does not look pleasant at all. Let's talk about the only good thing that came from it, which is the exposure. It's been putting a lot of people on notice, making them do better. And it hit everywhere, even hit Black Twitter. And my whole entire family has seen me in this terrible state. I've been getting made fun of a lot all across the internet. But you know what they say, all exposure is good exposure. So seven out of ten all around. I would rate this experience a 5 out of 10. I hope it does happen to me again, but it was a great learning experience. Now, by all jokes aside, I didn't do anything for day 10, I'm not feeling too good. I'm not gonna lie to you guys, but I did go and get my antibiotics, which is a good thing. Tell me why I'm just now finding out that Japan is paying people $75,000 yearly just to have a kid and live there. This is my last chance. I'm crashing out. I'm calling all everybody. If you're a girl in Japan and you wanna have a kid with me so we can have a good life, let's do it. Everything is for educational purposes. TikTok. I don't know what's next for me, y'all, but stay tuned.",

    "voice_to_text": "let's talk about Terrence Howard this is him when he first started exposing his research anytime you start talking about things that's outside of the norm this is usually what happens that's until he went on the Joe Rogan podcast now they're saying Terrence Howard just Mic dropped all the science on Joe Rogan your move conventional scientist got a lot of explaining to do this guy said there's literally nothing more important on earth than listening to Terrence Howard right now this is just an example I need y'all to listen to this there's been a lot of debate at the moment in the world of physics and metaphysics there's been this incredible interview with Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan Show everyone's talking about is the fundamental unit of creation is it a particle or a wave call where's Terrence is suggesting that um the flower of life is the key to all the secrets of creation so Terrence Howard is looked at the negative space between four bubbles or four spheres and we get this kind of shape like a tetrahedron and he's saying that that shape there is the atomic structure of hydrogen and as you know hydrogen constitutes 99.9% of the universe so this contradicts this whole theory of protons and electrons and black holes because he's saying everything has a male par and a feel par  so his work was based on the Walter Russell's Cosmology of octaves and frequencies and light so a lot of people are saying asking me like is is he the next Tesla well I believe that his popularity and his um deep understanding of the sacred geometry and the pentagons that nest um definitely constitutes him as one of the next progressive thinkers in the world because one of Terence Howard's most fundamental discoveries is he took three pentagons and he put them together at 120 degree angle and then he put another three next to it and he essentially got a shape it like um the Doja Cathedral that has 12 vertices well this link pin he's saying is the new propulsion system that can be like a drone so if you turn that into a drone put four of these constructs together you end up with this amazing new technology that can fly like a UFO can rotate on its axis it's a technology that's never been done and it's even submersible it's gonna get rid of cranes so he's saying that the golden ratio Fi ratio the work that's been suppressed for hundreds of years is now coming to the fallout so that's why I welcome his research because he's saying that 24 spheres or bubbles the negative spaces is beautiful architecture of sacred geometry these contain energy and we can harness this energy in a new and progressive way I believe that he is definitely in a positive sense offering putting on the table a new propulsion system based on the flower of life and the sacred geometry if y'all ain't seen this video I dropped in 2022 about Terrence Howard I need y'all to check it out"

Did you see, though, where he was talking about how excited he was to go to Neil degrasse Tyson and show him his findings to get his opinion on it? And Neil degrasse Tyson, like, completely shut him down. Like, literally treated him like he was nothing and totally threw shade at him and wouldn't hear him out. Like, kept telling him that he needed to listen to a bunch of these other scientists. And, um, Terrence Howard was like, no, but you gotta, like, like, look at this and. And really look at it and tell me what you think and I'll address. Tyson was like, oh, no, I don't think so. So now they're talking about a debate. A debate between Neil degrasse Tyson and Terrence Howard. I think that would be, like, so epic. Like, would they put it on pay per view, or would it just be like one of those things on YouTube that gets millions of views? What do you think would happen? I would love to see Terrence Howard and Neil degrasse Tyson debate each other. I have not really like Neil degrasse Tyson for a long time just because of his smugness. And I kind of think that celebrity got to his head, and he stopped really being a scientist and started being more of a celebrity years ago. And I think That's where I fell out. Um, but I would love to see Terrence Howard and Neil degrasse Tyson debate. What do you think?",

    "voice_to_text": "What's a good Dinner Party Fact?  I feel like it has to be something that isn't only interesting,  but also allows other people to contribute to the conversation and share their own experiences and stories.  One of my favorites is that most haunted houses that have been investigated have been found to be in places where there is a higher than average level  of carbon monoxide gas or other nearby pois0ns that cause hallucinations.  So, those stories of hearing sounds going bump in the night,  or seeing shapes moving across the surface of mirrors or glass,  or even getting a sense of being watched...  are actually probably being caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the brain.  Now I'm skeptic, I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural,  but I love a good ghost story. I feel like sharing this fact around the dinner table gives people permission to share those slightly spooky experiences that everyone seems to have had,  but has gone a little bit unexplained. Anyway, I'm curious to hear your favorite Dinner Party Facts",

    "voice_to_text": "This is going to blow your mind. A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

And as it did that, the surface had nowhere to go, so it wrinkled. Mercury is the wrinkliest planet in the solar system. These folds can be 1,000 km long and 3 km high. They're huge. Next, you would wanna head here. Even though Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. I'm sorry, Pluto. It does have the Caloris impact basin, which is one of the largest impact basins in the entire solar system. The diameter of this is about 15 kilometers across, for comparison. That's how big it is. The object that hit Mercury to form this giant impact basin was at least 100 km in diameter. And this also formed a ring of mountains around it. And these mountains can get up to 2 km high and stretch for 1,000 km. Also, the middle had filled with lava. This was all lava. Finally, you should climb those mountains, which are the tallest peaks on Mercury, and look around. From there. You would be able to truly see the most heavily cratered planet in the solar system. Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere to protect it, so any asteroids that come towards Mercury hit the surface. So there, Are tens of thousands of impact craters, which would definitely be a sight to see.",

And I'm pretty positive that if he wasn't concerned with ace and his crew being on this island, he could have just flipped it upside down in the ocean. Endurance isn't a problem at all. Like he could spam this shit over and over and over again and if he did, it would no doubt destroy the earth. Like not just the earthquakes that they're gonna be magnitude 50, making big ass chasms in the earth, but you can't forget these big ass tsunamis. And all of this shit can set off underwater volcanoes. Or just regular volcanoes. Which brings me to a kind who could also just set off every volcano, causing a permanent volcanic winter and an uninhabitable surface magma all over the place. So they can't blow up the earth, but they can destroy it? Wait, there is Fujitoro who can just rain down meteors as he pleases. He could definitely destroy the earth that way if he spammed it.",

    "voice_to_text": "And when you say rebuild the periodic table, what do you mean specifically? Well, the way the periodic table is laid out. The periodic table they have. Now, let's see. It looks. It looks like a box. It looks like a straight box. But they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon. What do you mean by tone? Same tone, same Kiev, same KV, 40.5 hertz. The next one would be like 81 hertz. You go to silicon, it will double up and would be 162 hertz. You'll go to cobalt, and it'll be 324 hertz. It's take the angles of incidence or the tones that they create. You know, their color. Like, you can turn color back into sound based upon. It's the same wavelength, it's just twice as long or much longer. So all you have to do is keep dividing light the. By two. You keep dividing light by two, and you ultimately get back to the audible sound of it. Because there was a relationship between light and color, sound and tone, matter and shape. Walter Russell's periodic table that he put together. Now, you compare that to mendelaos periodic table, and you'll see something completely different. It's unwinding. Whoa. And you see, there's a relationship that hydrogen. You had figured this out at a young age. I had already seen this. This was all inside of that palace. I had access to it, and I knew the relationship. She saw This. In dreams, I saw it as a circle. Everything was a full circle laid out, and each area was just expanding. Like wrapping a rag around your hand. The first wrap, you know, it's so tight. This is how I saw it, more so, but as a vortex. You'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen, carbon, silicone, cobalt, rhodium. They're all bonded. They're all sit as the middle point between two noble gases. So those things don't really exist. It's only one substance. Now, the problem is, the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen. That's the first visible element, because before it is too dense for us to perceive it. You understand what I'm saying? As you reach into the next octave, the carbon octave. And they call that the. A bisexual tone, because the carbon has two tones to it. It has a negative side and a positive side. The part where lithium behaves. Lithium is contractive, beryllium is contractive, Boron is contractive. But the moment you get to carbon, you balance it out. Gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus 4. So it's a double tone. Nitrogen is minus 3, oxygen is minus 2, chlorine is minus 1. Now, the balance of this, all of those are maids. Chlorine and lithium naturally mate. If you have lithium bonded with any other element, the moment that chlorine is introduced, it will break all bonds violently. So it can bond with chlorine. Same thing. With beryllium and oxygen. That's why it's it and what they've tried to keep from us. If you have. You wanna break water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen, all you have to do is introduce barillium. Or the sound of barillium and oxygen will violently break away from any other thing, even hydrogen. To bond with that barillium",

And the one point is because I think that when people say this, it's genuinely coming from a good place, but it is, unfortunately, a very messed up thing to say, because tell me I don't matter without telling me I don't matter. Uh, yeah. So while the priority was definitely having a healthy baby, it is not, in fact, the only thing that matters. My physical, mental, emotional health also matters, as I am the caretaker and creator of the baby. Yeah, we're moving right along. And this one is a two for one, and it's, well, I had a C section, and I was fine. Even better is when it's a man telling me that his wife had a C section and it was totally fine. Yeah, it's almost like you and me or me and your wife are different people with different experiences. And I love, love that you had a C section and were totally fine, but personally, I'm not. So I'm gonna give this one a 0 out of 10. Y'all are in for a real treat with this next one. Don't worry. You'll forget all about your traumatic birth by the time you're ready to have a second one. I Don't think I will, because memories of my traumatic birth haunt me anytime I'm alone with my thoughts. Also, I had to sign a paper saying that my form of birth might negatively impact my fertility and ability to get pregnant in the future. So might not be able to have a second one even if I wanted to. Yeah, negative 1 out of ten. And last but certainly not least, I can't believe somebody has actually said this to me. Well, think of the alternative. If you didn't have that birth, you and your baby might have. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Like, obviously my baby's life was at risk, so I chose to have the birth that left me with the trauma. I signed up for the damn thing. Doesn't mean it still wasn't horrible. Yeah, negative 5 out of 10. Don't say that shit to somebody.",

Cryogenics programs have been around since around the 1960s, where people have immersed their bodies in liquid nitrogen in hopes of waking up at a future date when medical technology has advanced. But it still remains mostly out of reach. In fact, the bodies of people who have been cryogenically frozen have started to degrade. This is through a combination of just poor storage and the human's body is intolerance to being frozen. I would say in every single case of someone who has cryogenically frozen their body, they're not going to wake up. However, that doesn't mean we won't get there soon. There's many animals that can be entirely frozen and then wake up in the next season when they thaw. That's because they have bioprotectants naturally in their bodies. And by borrowing these animals techniques, we're working on making better cryoprotectants for humans. And we've done it with the brain organoids, you know, the tiny human brains that we can grow in jars. Growing tiny, fully functional human brains is really advancing neurological research. In this case, they flooded it with the cryoprotectant and then revived it, and it suffered no damage. At least no noticeable damage. All the future where we can really just walk into a cryogenic chamber and wake up a thousand years later is pretty far out of reach. In the next few decades, we Might actually get there."

    "voice_to_text": "How many people do you think are looking at the moon right now? Personally, I have no idea. Let's figure it out. First, there's about 8 billion people in the world. However, the moon is really only visible to about half the population. To give in time, because if you're on the other side of the earth, then the earth is in the way. So that's 4 billion people who could be looking at the moon. Next. I would imagine that people probably aren't looking at the moon while they're sleeping or working. And that's roughly half of a person's life. So at any given time, roughly 2 billion people are awake and not working while the moon is visible. Okay, what next? Apparently, in developed economies, people spend about an hour or two outside every day. Let's just suppose that it's double that for a world average. Three hours. So about a quarter of a person's time they could be looking at the moon is when they're outside, reducing our number to 500 million. Now here's where it gets sketchy. I have no way to estimate how often a person is actually looking at the sky. So let's just assume people on average look in random directions while outside. The center of human vision is about 2 degrees across. So this circle makes about 0.03% of the sky. Because the moon is in exactly one of these circles, the probability of 0.03% of looking at the moon. So if we assume that's the Percentage of people who are looking at the moon. That leaves about 150,000 people. Now, I have no idea if that number is high, low, or just right. But as with all these orders of magnitude calculations, take it with a grain of salt.",

The vast majority of it contradicts what the author is even trying to communicate in the story in the first place. And most of the people using it don't even know what they're talking about.

messed up medical system but also gives me a sense of pride for being able to guide people through one of the hardest times of their life I'm Doctor K I'm a board certified neuro-ophthalmologist which means I specialize in brain tumors that affect your eyes and your vision so I'm at home eating dinner enjoying my dinner one night when a local optometrist text me about a patient saying hey I have this patient that's lost half her vision on one side I'm not sure why I think she may have had a stroke but can you get her to see you as soon as possible so of course I'm you know finishing up my dinner I text back no problem I'll get her in tomorrow so next day patient shows up she's with her daughter and I'm like hey you know I'm Doctor K tell me what's going on what happened this is where the story starts to get very odd so first of all the patient doesn't speak English she's from another country and she's with her daughter who has to translate so I go to the daughter like okay like when did your mom notice the vision loss and the daughter is like she never like said anything about vision loss and I'm like okay but I mean she's lost half her vision so surely she must have said it at some point The daughter's like honestly Doc she didn't know or realize anything until the doctor told her and then referred her to you and I'm like wow that is strange like any other symptoms besides the vision like weakness on one side numbness tingling anything like that paralysis and the daughter is like no but she has had a cough for a while and I'm like okay like we don't care about the cough and I'm talking about like signs of a stroke like no numbness weakness paralysis one side loss of speech anything like that and the daughter is like no but Doc like she's had this cough for like nine months and I'm like I don't think the cough has anything to do with their vision loss but like okay tell me what's going on with the cough and the daughter's like she's had this cough I keep taking her back to the doctor but like they haven't done anything they just keep saying it's allergies so I'm like okay let's put that on hold like look we need to concentrate on the real problem here which is the vision loss and she needs an MRI as soon as possible because getting an MRI for vision loss is standard of care that's when the daughter just kind of breaks down she's just like thank you so much doctor thank you so much for caring and I'm kind of like this is normal like anyone would order an MRI in this situation I do it all the time for vision loss like I mean I appreciate that but like why you know why are you saying thank you like that daughters like Doc you don't understand my mom has had this cough for nine months I've taken her back to the doctor again and again they keep saying it's allergies they keep giving her cough medicine but finally I just knew in my gut that something was wrong I took her back to the doctor and I pleaded with him to please order some more testing and I'm like wow that's crazy okay like what what test they finally order the daughter says they ordered a chest X ray she's gonna get it later on this week so I'm like okay I mean I still don't think it had anything to do with the vision loss but like keep me posted on the chest X ray let's get this MRI order cause that's really the most important thing because I need the MRI I think she had a stroke most probably but I just wanna make sure there's not something crazy like a brain tumor or something rare like that I doubt it but like let's just get the MRI let's so I order the MRI couple days later I get a call it's from the neuroradiologist they need to speak to me ASAP that's never a good sign when you get that call from the neuro-radiologist but what was even worse was I call a guy and he's like trembling on the phone he's like shook by the results of the MRI like almost having a hard time telling me the result and this is a guy that reads MRIs all day long he's seen everything so that's when I knew this was gonna be something pretty bad can see the right eye and the left eye and over here you see all this white area which is all edema and a very large gigantic tumor which is sitting right there in the brain that's occupying space and pushing the whole brain over to the left side you can see this massive tumor here with a lot of edema pushing the entire brain squishing everything over to the other side causing huge mass effect so I called the daughter and I'm like look um I have some bad news for you this was not a stroke there seems to be a very large growth or tumor in the brain causing the vision loss daughter is just like thank you thank you so much Doc thank you so much and I was like wow I never had someone thank me for diagnosing them with a brain tumor but then I'm like so by the way like we need to figure out what's causing this whatever happened with that chest X ray and the whole cough thing the daughter's like Doc I'm so mad I knew something was wrong I just knew it that's why I kept taking her back and she had the chest X ray this week showed that she has lung cancer in her lungs and that's what was causing the cough all this time that's what I'm like fuck because I knew in that moment what I was looking at on the MRI was actually lung cancer that had spread to her brain and it was now my job to tell her that so I give her the bad news that I think it was actually all related after all the lung cancer was caught too late spread to the brain of course the daughter is like you know Kid Doc what do we do what do we do from here and I go into full on doctor mode of course I'm like look she needs to see a neurosurgeon she needs to possibly have surgery have as much of it removed as possible she's gonna need some steroids to reduce the swelling probably radiation chemotherapy I mean we need to just get her into the er as soon as possible and do everything we can for her and instead the daughter was like Doc just tell me the truth how long does she have to live and I was kind of taking it back by that question because that was not what I was expecting but I in that moment realized the daughter actually was looking out for her mom's overall best interest she understood that the chances of all the treatments I just recommended were actually very small and prolonging or saving her mom's life and she just wanted her mom to be with her family if these were gonna be her last days so I had very mixed feelings about this I don't even know if she's safe to get on a plane but I understood where the daughter was coming from and I'm like look you're right to be honest even if we do all of that it's not looking good and as the doctor it's my job to recommend the full on treatment but if you and your mom decide that's not what you want I have to respect that that's what they did they chose to go home and be with their family and this is a super sad case because I can't believe this patient was misdiagnosed for so long but I also know that doctors are fallible things can happen and if you ever sense that something's wrong like this if you have that gut feeling that something else is going on always get a second opinion always try and find another doctor always try and find the solution"

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hello, want to give some important updates for pass the hat? I first started pass the hat because I had families reaching out and I could assign those specific families with specific people that signed up. But now that so many people know about pass the hat and Operation Olive Branch, you don't need to depend on getting assigned. You can go to Operation Olive Branch, which again as at the top of my link tree, and look through the master list and find a family and support them. You no longer have to wait on us. Assignments will still be opened so we can make sure every family has a decent amount of people. And for some people that don't see this video and don't know, but please take the initiative yourself and go pick a family and still hashtag pass the hat and still tag Operation Olive Branch. Ultimately, pass the hat wasn't meant to be a long term solution. It was meant to be triage to help these families while they're in the middle of it. Raise as much money as they can to escape and meet basic needs. But OOB is going so far past that they are thinking 5, 10 steps ahead. I'm not gonna be here doing this forever. I was not meant to run a non profit. Again, I am surrounded by so much trash right now, which is to say, I have no organizational skills. But 0 0 B is gonna be there, and I Intend to help however I can. So these are your new instructions for pass the hat. 1. See a video that says, pass the hat. Oh, now you got the bug. 2 you go to Operation Olive Branch and pick your own family to support. 3 you make videos about them, you put their gofundme in your link tree, whatever it takes to reach their goal. And 4, you tag three to four friends, creators, family, whoever, and pass the hat forward so they can do it, too. This way, you don't have to wait. This way, the word gets out faster. This way, more and more families can be assigned. There are over 12,000 families waiting. The faster we can get people to their goals, the more and more people we can help. Please, please, please spread this new initiative. This means people can work faster, and it means once, eventually, we're not in the triage phase, and we're in the rebuilding phase for the people of Palestine, you guys can have a solid base, a mantle to be by. And that is Operation Olive Branch. Thank you guys so much for your help. Keep going, and, uh. Free Palestine.",

I had a really good physics teacher. Really inspired me to study electrical engineering. Went from there. And so how do you apply for an PhD? Boy. So, I mean, through the website, I guess, but do as much research as you can. As many. Much undergrad research, and then, yeah, just, like, find a specialization. So how was your experience here at MIT? Loved it. The blast. Work hard, play card. What is your favorite memory that you've had here? Winning the LaCrosse New MAC championships sophomore year. Oh, yeah, yeah. So you do LaCrosse here? Do you do anything. Do you do anything else besides LaCrosse or a member of fraternity? Um, and I did, yeah. Undergrad research here. Was MIT your top choice when you apply it? No. What was your top choice? Naval Academy. Oh, wow, really? That's interesting. Long story short, I got a Navy, chose Navy, and then tore my knee. Couldn't go to Navy, so my backup is here. Awesome. You're. This MIT is your backup? Oh, yeah. Backup school. Biggest flex ever. Yeah. Yeah.

    "voice_to_text": "energy update with some major twists so if you're into this topic keep watching cause you might be able to help me out by show comments how many of you experience the Aurora borealis this past weekend and out of those of you who saw it how many of you couldn't see it unless it was on your phone meaning it didn't really show up in the sky and the only time you really saw it was when you were looking at it through your screen I asked because this has been the Schumann Resonance this entire weekend not really a peep and that's suspicious with all things considered I would have guessed that this chart would have been blasted in white but it's not why well when we are looking at the simulated matrix that we call reality we have to be aware of predators coming from all different angles from the food we eat to the water we drink to the clothes we wear to basically any item that we purchase to the air we breathe to the legal drugs that they prescribe you to our true history and past accomplishments that could fundamentally shift our existence for humanity towards the better if only it wasn't suppressed we just need to face the fact that we have been lied to about everything so it's safe to say that me personally I only take official announcements from our government entities with a grain of salt this includes NASA and even are currently accepted and pushed science now I know this is going to trigger all of the flat earth haters in the comments but listen I'm going to go ahead and say this off the top if most people think it's unacceptable to force anyone else's religion down their throat why would this be any different because science after all is its own religion everyone is honestly allowed to believe whatever they want especially when our true history is not even being taught to us in our schools so chill  we embrace every opinion here on my page as we open our minds and ask the important questions so if you're being a damn idiot in my comment section I'm on a blocking frenzy right now do not threaten me with a good time but with that being said here's what we do know harp is a weather modification pew pew used by our own rulers oops I meant for the exploration of Earth's upper atmosphere and geospace environment of course my bad but just like everything else they tell us right to our faces what they are doing they just don't take any accountability to actually make sure we get the important information necessary it even states on their official website that it was previously owned by the US Air Force and it was gifted to the university of Alaska Fairbanks in 2,015 that's suspicious but not as suspicious as this harp was doing a research campaign the same time as the solar flares well can harp actually produce artificial Aurora borealis actually yes they can or as can be artificial pause to read but we can't complete this video without also mentioning the weird elephant in the room of what we all saw during the eclipse in fact if you're anywhere on TikTok you've probably come across at least one video of people talking about an artificial sun well is that possible yes this is an article from the Smithsonian this new man made sun is 10,000 times more intense than sunlight on earth ha ha research China and what they're doing I'll help you a little further China's artificial sun just broke a record for longest sustained nuclear fusion isn't that fun I say all of this to say this when I say that we live in a simulated matrix this is what I'm talking about everything about our existence is either a lie or an illusion that's it which is precisely why we ask the questions here on my page now I gained over 7,000 new followers ever since I put out the let them eat \ud83c\udf70 video and I find it so fascinating that almost every video I've put out since that one my engagement has barely changed that's suspicious you just have to critically ask yourself why would they be suppressing important information like this because it's the illusion that they are trying to sell you and when someone like me comes from behind the curtain and says this is all an illusion they don't want you to know that because the longer they can keep you in the illusion the longer they have you under their thumb so what about all of these Ascension symptoms that everyone's been feeling at least this weekend well do yourself a solid and look up Havana syndrome and what causes that this world is no longer operating in the realm of conspiracy in fact everything that these people who you claim are dumb idiots are saying there's information out there ha ha ha you're just choosing not to look at it now of course I'm not saying that the symptoms that everyone is feeling during this awakening that we're experiencing are all due to these energies that they are artificially giving us however they do seem to correspond with certain events that take place such as the actual energy that we receive coming in from the earth versus the artificial energy that they are putting out onto the earth do I know that what I'm saying right now can completely contradict things that I've said in previous videos yes and absolutely but that's the whole point of my page is to ask the questions and to not get so married to a certain idea or a specific way of thinking about the reality that we exist in right now because we don't know the answers we don't have the truth they are not telling us the truth there needs to be some other research that we do next corresponding between the Ascension symptoms and what we are experiencing and how they could be happening simultaneously and not necessarily be connected a simple explanation for that would be they are trying to bombard us with all of these electromagnetic energies to try to stop us from awakening but the awakening is going to happen no matter what we see that that's clear so I just wanted to give you this energy update let you know that none of this weekend showed up at all on the Schumann resonance so if that gives you any sort of clarification in mind about what is actually going on here great if it gives you more questions to ask great the point of all of this is to try to find the truth try to find the reality our real reality of where we're living how things are going what this world is actually looking like around us outside of the simulated matrix that they're giving us so I would love to hear your thoughts your comments your opinions all of it is accepted but like I said if you're just here to cause hate and draw shade on people or their opinions in my comment section I will block you I have no problem with that okay that's all I love you bye",

And the whole thing is powered by the renewable energy source known as gravity. I like to call it the Slap Chop for aristocrats. The guillotine featured a really innovative form of cervical manipulation. When the blade was dropped, it applied gentle pressure to this area separating the lower neck from the upper neck, thus liberating the head, the rich. I mean, the person undergoing this procedure would only feel a tiny pinch, maybe some vibration, before the massive fluid loss LED to unconsciousness. And while this form of social equity, I mean, punishment might seem barbaric by today standards, it's important to remember that it was actually a huge leap forward compared to breaking people on the wheel. If the guillotine were to make a comeback today, I think that we could give it an update, a little bit of the rasmatazz. Because if you're gonna send out the social elites, you wanna make sure you do it in style. One more fun fact about this machine. If the blade of this device had not been sharpened recently, it could take two to three drops for that cervical manipulation to occur. If you were from a rich family, they might pay the executioner to make sure that the blade was freshly sharpened, thus reducing your pain and suffering before you received the ultimate Ring dinger",

    "voice_to_text": "The shower curtain effect is how shower curtains tend to blow inward at you whenever you take a shower and over the years there have been tons of hypotheses for why your shower curtain seemingly tries to consume you whenever you're trying to wash your body. And you just got feet for free so don't take it for granted. First up it's been thought to be just the fact that the hot water heats the air inside the shower so the hot air rises and escapes above the shower curtain and that creates low pressure which pulls the colder air in from the bottom. Weirdly it still happens in cold showers so that can't be it. But the most popular explanation has been the bernuli effect explanation which holds the air pressure decreases as a fluid speed increases Bernuli effects got a lot of applications like you can use it to calculate the lift on an airplane wing but it's not fully sufficient to explain lift altogether it's also the reason carburettas work. In the case of the shower the thinking is that the rapid speed of the water increases the speed of the air around it too that creates negative pressure which sucks the shower curtain in towards a leg hug. In 2001 David Schmidt of the university of Amherst created yet another explanation for the effect using computer simulations he drafted a model of a typical shower and separated that shower space into 50,000 little cells he ran the simulation on his home computer in the evenings and weekends basically he said whenever his wife wasn't using the computer and after two weeks of running those simulations  his Space Odyssey age computer had generated 30 seconds of simulated shower runtime. The simulation showed that it wasn't burnoulie effect nor was it the chimney effect drawning that curtain in towards your leggies. instead the simulation showed that the shower spray creates a vortex inside the shower stall just like the center of a Hurricane or cyclone. tThe shower spray centric cyclone creates an area of low pressure which draws the curtain in for you David Schmidt won the 2001 Ignobel Prize in physics for this work: The effect is pretty weak so if you don't want it to happen you gotta get a heavier shower curtain or one with magnets on the bottom we have these lightweight clear curtains and I just spray it some with water with some water to weigh it down Jesus I can't speak today ha ha",

    "voice_to_text": "space station just did a cymatics experiment and it's wild just as wild as the water ones the bubble ones in all forms the Chladni plates the CGI ones and the oscilloscope cymatics they're all sick but this one blows them all away because this is what I've been trying to explain the whole time this is how sound actually looks it's a bubble so the gold thing is a speaker with an air bubble with water around it sound goes through it that's how you see it and we can calculate it with equations and stuff we have to see cymatics on earth like this because of the gravity thing but it allows us to look at the geometry of the frequency every frequency has its own geometry more harmony equals more symmetry particle colliders explore the smallest vibrations by mapping these tiny little particles we can see that they also have a geometry particles of the same shape or geometry resonate with other particles that are like them these form groups of atomic elements In a container, the resonance brings these atoms together vibrations that fit perfectly  inside a bigger vibration are called harmonics elements in harmony can vibrate together to form these little biological machines billions of these inside of you  doing all kinds of things to keep you alive more harmonics equals more organization  of matter into more complex systems this is a starfish egg when it gets fertilized it emits a frequency that sends a signal to all the cells inside of it that overtone is the signal to divide that frequency can organize a cell and then it can divide it geometry is just dividing a space like controlling an RC car that signal gets read and interpreted by the car and the car does stuff but there's more this is ferrofluid microscopic iron flakes in a fluid kinda like your blood when an electromagnetic current is passed through it at a specific frequency it can organize itself then, in a confined space, it can connect an entire system together kinda like your nervous system now you can connect systems together into an even more complex organism that is controlled by a mind interestingly enough the brain emits signals in these subsonic to sonic ranges same frequency we see in the space Cymatic here If this made sense to you it's your brain reading the QR code of the geometry translating that into a frequency and  understanding it on a vibrational level there exists a book about these geometries and it's amazing I know this because I wrote it it's part of a series that I'm writing It\u2019s a system of knowledge called esoterics, it's very old the intro book is Codex it starts with a high level overview then goes to Geomatrix which is the nuts and bolts of how it works hidden history covers the cultures  that used it and taught it Harmonic alchemy covers the philosophy  and methodology of implementing this So that you can use it for your life if any of that sounds cool to you I've got a bunch of bundles out right now you can find that stuff here if it doesn't work for you just message me I'll refund you you can keep the stuff the link in my bio will take you to all this and the physical copies that are on Amazon",

    "voice_to_text": "what can aliens tell us about religion something that's really interesting about the alien phenomenon is that how it expresses has a lot to do with the cultural conversation at the time so in the 50s alien stories had their own vibe in the 90s they kind of converged into a different kind of story based on the cultural conversation most seduction stories follow a similar narrative so first there's a feeling of unease anxiety feeling unusual there may even be in a compulsion to go to a specific place at a certain time and then there is the capture in a spacecraft an examination usually some kind of like medical exam of you a conference where you get to talk to the aliens a tour a loss of time a return a theophany which is just this feeling of of oneness or even a spiritual mystical experience and then kind of the aftermath so if you're a believer all of those similarities point to the idea that most alien abduction stories are real because these stories these are people who haven't met each other and yet they're having the same subjective experience but if you're skeptical it's easy to see that these images and these storylines really get into our subconscious and then when we feel unusual the brain goes out to kinda find an explanation and then this subjective experience comes out of it because all you'd have to say if you're skeptic of aliens is just to say that because we have a similar subconscious narrative similar images that of course these stories would have some similarities and what this tells us about religion is the same thing either the similarities between religions or new death near death experience stories are the same because they're pointing to some actual real external reality or the similarities of religious experience and spiritual experience are are the same because we are swimming in the same collective unconscious the collective unconscious is a term by Carl Yeung that talks about the part of the mind that contains memories and impulses of which you're not aware of individually but is common to humankind in general and also kind of where the story is and what things are going on kind of in the collective so I'll be honest when I first started studying religion and spirituality over 20 years ago now uh I was more under the impression that the similarities that we see with religion is because there is actually you know a god or a transcendent reality that it was pointing to but the more that you got challenged and the more that I Learned about the human brain it became very clear to me that the similarities that we see in our experiences in our stories in the gods that we create is not because of an external reality it's because we have a subconscious individually but we also have one collectively and so even how religion changes over time is not necessarily because god is kind of guiding that it's because our collective subconscious also goes through changes and even though I didn't really want that to be true I wasn't seeking for that to be true because I wanted to sin or I wanted to lose my faith in god uh I didn't want any of that to happen uh it it just became more clear over time when you study the human brain that it's not uh god creating us it's us creating gods and the similarities that we see are because we are similar",

Our children cannot read! Our children cannot read, let alone writing a paragraph, let alone comprehension. They cannot read. They do not know how to sound words out. They were not taught that. And if you're wondering, well, then why do my. Why does my kids just keep getting passed on to the next grade? Because that's what they're doing now. They're not holding the children back. They're moving them on. They're graduating them. Knowing that your child is illiterate, our next change makers, our next law makers, our next voters cannot read. I beg of you, take the tablets and the cell phones away. Practice letter recognition and sounds and reading with your child, please. And i'mma keep it a stack with you. They've been new. They've been new to babies. Couldn't read and didn't care. You know, when they started caring, after the pandemic, them test scores plummeted. First of all, like, test scores for reading were, like, pretty stagnant for the last, like, decade. But after the pandemic, they plummeted, and now they were, oh, we gotta do something about it. Columbia University, I'm looking at you. You fully backed balanced reading. Fully backed it. Teachers College was 100% pushing out balanced reading. That's why the kids don't know how to sound things out. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, please go do some research. Now they're trying to push science of reading. That's the way. And if you're like, what? Science of reading? That's what we was doing. And by we, I'm talking about millennials and older. The one. The little, ah, book, eh? You know, when we were sounding words out, that's. Yeah. Now they're trying to bring that back. And if you're like, wait, they stopped doing that? Yes, for years they stopped doing it. I'mma say this last thing and i'mma be done. If you have the opportunity and the privilege, right, because like, taking off from work is a privilege, you need to start. And by you, I'm talking to parents and guardians. Start going to these PTSA meetings and these district meetings. They are passing so many policies and they're banging on the fact that parents and families are not going to show up. You need to know what them, what those policies are and how they're affecting your children, particularly black and brown children. They know families can't or won't show up. You need to be more involved with your students schooling. Their life quite literally depends on it. Alright, I'm done.",

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions"

    "voice_to_text": "I wanna keep this short, but I just wanna say that somewhere there are some surgeons who are eating crow right now, who are eating their words right now. Because for a long time, we anesthesia professionals, they were just so many of us, I guess, that some surgeons really felt that they were, you know, above us. It was a privilege for them to, um, invite us into their operating room. And I don't know if this person is a real surgeon. I think they're a troll going around harassing health care workers on this app. But there is a severe shortage of anesthesia professionals right now to where some small hospitals that surround like the bigger cities are closing down. Cases are getting cancelled, cases are waiting months. And then impatient cases are taking more, way more days than they normally would in the past. Instead of 24 hour turn around, are you talking about 48, 72 hours or maybe even longer? Because there is such a severe shortage of anesthesia professionals. As he's in, major markets are facing major anesthesia provider shortages and declining reimbursement. Anesthesia used to be a seemingly unlimited commodity. Jeff Dot, O principal at Ventura, California based Physician Surgery Center, told Beckers, now, this person is not a physician, they just run a surgery center. They were lucky to be invited to work at your surgery center. We were so lucky to be invited. Okay, I'm tell you a story. When I used To be in one city. I heard a story I heard, and I think it's true, that some anesthesiologists were literally washing cars of surgeons in order to get them to work with them. Because we used to follow the surgeons around from multiple. From hospital to hospital. And so there were no exclusive contracts. We're not just one hospital. And because some anesthesiologists were basically fighting each other to get the surgeons to work with them, they were washing the surgeons cars. It's not that damn serious. Anywho, the tables have now turned. And if centers have anyone to cover anesthesia, it usually comes at a hefty price. Yeah, it should. Anyway, all I'm here to say is, what goes around comes around. Anyway. So I really hope this is.",

Now, normally what the brain should do is say, well, it's halfway between red and blue, so it must be green. I'm getting a lot of stimulus in the red, I'm getting quite a bit in the blue. Halfway between red and blue is green. Okay? But you've also got a green sensor in the middle, and the green sensor, because it's picking up red, and blue, isn't picking up anything at all. So the brain, I mean, your brain could go fuzzy and say, system error. Cause in one sense, in a physical sense, there are no purple photons. Purple doesn't exist, okay? It's entirely created in your head. What the brain does is it essentially is invented a colour purple, which essentially represents. Not green, okay? It's a color to represent the weird, unexplained absence of green. But in physics, it doesn't exist. So this is my point here, which is that",

And so we can eat food, foods like high flavonol cocoa in order to be able to actually get the stem cells to work a little bit better. Now, how do we know this, this actually functions, works in people? Well, clinical studies have been done with high flavonol cocoa to show that in, like, men who are in their 60s with heart disease, they could actually eat just have two cups of dark chocolate, hot cocoa a day for a month, and they doubled the amount of stem cells in their bloodstream, and their circulation improved measurably. And then what's even more important and impressive is that there was a study called the cosmos study that was completed recently. Yeah. Yeah. That showed that eating high flavored cocoa decreases the risk of cardiovascular death. Yeah, right. Over a period. Like a stag, like I said. Exactly. Except. Except maybe the. By.

Today, April 28th, is my birthday, and there are two things I would like for my birthday. Number one, my audience has always skewed slightly male, and I love my male audience members, but I think it would be cool if more women followed me on TikTok. I share fun facts, I talk about science, I talk about paleontology, I talk about evolution. They're mostly biology topics. I just think it would be really cool if the ladies hung out and heard me out on the Dinosaur facts, and then we would all have a good time learning about dinosaurs. I also think it would be really cool if everyone went to American Forests org and gave them some money. American Forest is one of the oldest reforestation charities in the country, and one thing I really like about them is their mission takes into account forests as infrastructure, how good it is for quality of life to live around trees. Trees are windbreak, trees are shelter. These are nice places to hang out. And they care about equity in reforestation because a lot of large scale reforestation projects tend to ignore lower income communities and communities of color when they are thinking about which places should have nice Woodlands. So that's what I want for my birthday. Happy birthday to me! Thank You so much for listening. Love you guys. Bye.",

Hammer an apple repeatedly with a chopstick and it won't just fall off. It gets tougher just like we get braver in life. That's a nursery for you. Cut a straw, fill it with water and place it between 2 cups. Watch as the water slowly moves from one cup to another. That's the siphon effect. Can't push a disc through a hole in paper. Fold it and it slides through. That's an optical illusion. Attach a magnet to a battery's negative side and place a copper coil on the positive. The coil spins fast, just like in electric cars. Write on paper with lemon juice, heat it and watch the secret message appear. Magic! Pop a balloon under a bottle and flick it to snuff out a candle with your DIY air cannon. Break a needle and then heat it. It returns to its original shape. That's the magic of memory. Metal stick one end of a tissue into dirty water and the other into a clean cup. Soon you'll filter out clean water thanks to capillarity. Make a mini fountain by poking holes in a plastic bottle, filling it with water and twisting the cap. Demonstrate a typhoon's effect. Set up two bottles with batteries. The one representing a skyscraper stays upright, showing how buildings resist wind. Sandwich of paper between two magnets. Add a Screw and a battery and connect it up. You've just made an electric fan. Doing science experiments is way more fun than scrolling on the phone. Let's inspire kids to explore more.",

So, the way you do that is, you find the closest living relative to your animal that has gone extinct and for us that is a small marsupial species called the fat-tailed dunnart. The developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne, Pask raised $15 million for a de-extinction project that recalls \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d In partnership with American company Colossal Biosciences, which counts, wait for it, Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and even the C.I.A. among its backers. He's adamant he'll replicate the genome of a dunnart \u2014 a mouse-like marsupial \u2014 he'll turn it into a much larger Tassie tiger. We'll let him explain. We examine all of its DNA, we compared that to the DNA of your extinct species, the Tasmanian tiger, and we look at everywhere that those two genomes or those two piles of DNA, if you like, are different. And once you've identified to those differences, it's just a matter of then going in, and making all of those edits to turn your fat-tailed dunnart genome or cell into a Thylacine cell. And you're saying that dunnart that little, little field mouse marsupial dunnart is closer than say the Tasmanian Devil? But that little dunnart is a ferocious carnivore even though it's very, very small one, and it's a very good surrogate for us to be able to do all this editing in."

If god is perfect, right, and he is flawless, and there's no more desirable state than what is perfect, how could you say that god would want to create? Because that would be saying that god plus creation is something that is more desirable than god existing alone. Similarly, you could see it this way. The state of affairs that exist with god existing alone is perfect. The state of affairs that exist today is imperfect. God would desire it less to create this state of affairs than him existing alone. Because imperfection is desired less than perfection. Because imperfection contains flaws, which are undesirable traits. And if you were to say that the creation that we exist in right now is perfect, well, then there be no reason for god to create. As a perfect state of affairs is indifferent to another perfect state of affairs. And that contradicts the story of Genesis saying that god intends to create us and that god wants to create us.

Also, every year, we have groups that come with us, and we give out little goodie bags. This year we gave out an actual bag. We did a T-shirt which said, let's get naughty. We also had a naughty girl banto that Bella sewed. And then a magnet you could hang on your door. And if you didn't know, name necklaces are super huge in the swinging lifestyle.

Wendy said she would \u201ceat crow\u201d if Kanye and Kim's marriage lasted longer than 72 days, which it did. While that's normally just a saying, Wendy actually had a chef prepare some crow for her to eat- In many religions such as Hinduism, crows are said to be the messengers of our ancestors, and that they can cross the divide between the physical and spiritual worlds.

    "voice_to_text": "reiki can't possibly work so why does it this was an article in the Atlantic talking about how some hospitals are offering Reiki and the debate this brings up because Reiki delivers demonstrably good effects without a proven cause so we have a number of solid studies that show that Reiki can regulate your nervous system alter your experience of pain reduce side effects of chemo and improve surgical outcomes in 2018 the New York Times reported on a group of scientists who were studying Reiki and their conclusion was that we have a biological response to an active caring that somehow calls forth healing and the more intense and focus it is the more healing it evokes and that Reiki simulates archetypical caring gestures deep in our subconscious likely drawing from the feelings we get as children from our mothers that was from Ted Capchick a Harvard Medical School professor now could it be something more than that sure in the world of energy and consciousness and quantum entanglement and inner connection there could always be something more there's a lot that could be in there in that kind of god of the gaps and this is actually a really good way to gauge whether you're more of an empiracist or if you're more of a rationalist so empiracists are more likely to say if it works and it does we have studies to show that this improves things then I'm gonna use it so Stephen Fry is an example of an atheist who says I'm more of an empiracist than a rationalist he talks about this uh he did a podcast with Jordan Peterson about this and he doesn't believe in god but he's very open to things that help even if he doesn't know why and even if he doesn't understand it and what he talks about is you know a time when we were trying to reduce infant mortality and they had a group of students wash their hands and infant mortality dropped and they didn't know why and so they didn't keep washing their hands cause they didn't understand the connection and Stephen Fry was more of the more of the kind of person to say hey if it helped drop infant mortality let's do it let's wash hands even though we don't know about germs yet a rationalist is someone who tends to be more skeptical who would look at Reiki and say our best explanation of this is this is just a really heightened placebo effect because we have these deep evolutionary brains that allow us to tap into our own uh inner healing when we have community and rituals and touch and intention that help us to heal and improve and this is why you know Mormon priesthood blessings can work even if there's no Mormon God behind it so rationalist is more likely to say I'm more willing to use treatments that activate inner healing without the placebo effect because their core values and their heart hierarchy of values has truth or skepticism or rationalism as higher on their hierarchy values the downside is if you have to understand everything sometimes you miss on placebo effects that actually help like could help you recover from surgery so Richard Dawkins or hitch would be kind of classic rationalist types so if you're using Reiki and you feel like it helps you that's great the only place that I have to draw the line for no nonsense spirituality here is if you say that you understand how like we just understood how anesthesia works like three years ago so if you're gonna tell me that you understand exactly how Reiki works that's when I get red flags because you'd have to understand the nature of reality the nature of the universe evolution what's going on with quantum physics spookiness to fully explain what's going on here so I'm skeptical of anyone who's super confident that they know what's going on here but if we kind of are skeptical to the truth claims kind of around this and just use it as a tool it seems to actually work"

You're feeding fungus, which means that's your next crop of mould. The good news is white vinegar kills mould and won't kill you. But if you have any mold in your house, please go and spray it with vinegar and quickly leave the room. You only need to come back in 10 minutes and it will be dead and that then you can wipe it up. But make sure you have gloves on, ideally a mask on. And then ring the plumber or the builder. You gotta find out why it's there. Shouldn't be there. Is there a leaking tap behind the wall? Is that. Does the guttering need to be cleaned out? You need to chop down a few trees and get that sunshine into the house. It should not be there. Mould is toxic. We should have no exposure to mould at all.

And even if they were volunteer, they would go in, they'll find out what's on the other side of a black hole. But none of the rest of us will ever know because they cannot communicate back out cause nothing comes out of a black hole, alright? They can't even send an SOS with radio signals, because radio waves travel at the speed of light, and the speed of light is insufficient to escape the black hole. But the theories of the universe, general theory of relativity, that gives us the black hole in the first place. If you take those equations into the black hole, it tells us that an entire other space time opens up in front of you. As the future history of the universe is left behind, a whole other universe opens up in front of you. It's freaky. But the general theory of relativity has worked in every other way we've applied it. So this is particularly intriguing to us all, that perhaps the universe with its black holes is just this sort of Swiss cheese of universes in some higher dimension where you would might have access. So it's intriguing and I want to know the answer to fact. If I know I'm Going to die soon, send me into a black hole. That way I'll die knowing rather than just a drooling on the bed, you know, Just.
