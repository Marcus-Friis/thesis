    "voice_to_text": "This is going to blow your mind. A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

Black COVID masks and white grocery bags in their hands. Cause they're carrying something. After they saw another neighbor outside, they left and came back ten minutes later. They park at the end of the street and walk down the sidewalk to the front of my yard to place a hidden camera. The neighbors alerting each other they found the device very quickly. A seemingly elaborate operation. Last week we told you about a similar situation in Chino Hills. A camera disguised as a rock. But legally, experts say there isn't much that can be done. But this isn't the first hidden camera story that we've done this month out here in the England Empire. So those who are victimized are asking you to do your part. Search around in your bushes, your sidewalk, anywhere among your property. As the fear is, this is part of a bigger scheme. First and foremost, I don't think that camera angle was necessary, but I get you trying to make A point. Got it. Listen, I'll tell you what. If I find a hidden camera in my neighborhood or on my property or something like that, I'm turning into a blaring real quick, okay? That's a black Karen. I'll be a blaring to protect my neighborhood and stuff like that. Cause that has to be about kids. What else could that be about? Or abducting like, women. What else could that be? Like, why. Why you setting up hidden cameras in neighborhood? There's no need for that. Private investigator maybe, but no, I feel like a private investigator wouldn't do that. They wouldn't need to, cause Temecula is pretty safe. Okay? I grew up in Marietta, right next door. Temecula's pretty safe. So, um, I would say that has to be like, they know the community's safe. They know people's guards are dropped, so they're doing that on for a reason. That's what it has to be. That's just my opinion. I don't know. Anyways, be vigilant, y'all. I know some people that live in Miriad and Temecula and stuff like that, and they just be leaving the door unlocked, leaving their car. Car doors unlocked. Just be. No, don't do that, y'all. Don't. Don't let your guard down just because you think you're in a safe place. That's how they get you.",

    "voice_to_text": "New information is being released right now exposing Gypsy Rose. And it looks like the only thing she may have been a victim of is having a crazy con artist for a mother. But not a mother with Munchausen. So you may think that that little girl right there is Gypsy Rose, right? It's not. It's another little girl that was diagnosed with the exact same rare chromosome disorder that Gypsy was diagnosed with in 2,011. This is what Gypsy was diagnosed with. The app does not like it when we say this word, so I'm just gonna put it right here. And if you read up on this disorder, it explains all of Gypsy symptoms and procedures. Mole head, increased possibility of mild or moderate developmental delay, slightly unusual facial features, loose joints, double joint seizures, disturbances of the eye. Feeding tubes. Feeding tubes were necessary for Gypsy. All of Gypsy's medical procedures have been proven to be medically necessary. Her mother was not abusing her in that way. Her mother claimed that she had cancer. And because we don't know DD side and never will, we don't know why. Didi was claiming that she had cancer. But Gypsy never received chemotherapy. Gypsy never received a treatment that she didn't need. And at the time of Didi's unaliving, Gypsy had not been to the doctor for years. And I wonder if it's because her mother was advocating for her diagnosis for years and finally got it. It's clear. The Didi was a con woman, and she was taking full advantage of this situation. As a single mother with a disabled child, maybe this is how she felt she needed to make her income. But with all the evidence that we have, I fully believe that Gypsy was in on this con when she was old enough to understand. Because Gypsy was reaping the benefits of every con that her mother pulled off. And at the end of the day, Gypsy was diagnosed with this disorder. But her mother was never diagnosed with munchausens. Gypsy has been caught in lie after lie after lie. So why are we believing everything that she says about the past with no proof of seeing? Her stepmother had been working so hard to try to silence the people with the information about Gypsy's medical records who are trying to share the truth because they know if you knew the truth, you would see Gypsy's true colors.",

    "voice_to_text": "Do you still not realize that they're all playing multiple roles? And I'm not just talking this guy. I'm talking all of them. Why don't we take a look at two supposedly different individuals in Benicio Del Toro and Brad Pitt? They look kind of similar, right? Kind of real similar, even in their younger years. But that's all it is, right? Similarity. They just have similar features. They couldn't possibly be the same person, right? Let's take a closer look and see what we can find. Did you ever see when Benicio won an Oscar? He kind of runs like somebody I know? I don't know that there's just some similarities to it. Maybe it's just me. Although he does celebrate as he's being handed an Oscar. Oh, and did you see who just happened to hand him that Oscar? Brad Pitt's wife. And she just happens to be looking very adoringly at Benicio and seems pretty chummy with him for photos. But again, it's just coincidence. I'm making too much of this. Kind of like the coincidence of them sitting very identically and having the exact same mannerisms. And did you know they both just happen to be known for eating food a lot in their movie rules? You handle food better on screen than anybody I've seen, and I want it. But why would they do this? You're probably asking yourself, why would they go through the trouble? I'll tell you. It's to give you the most Skewed sense of reality possible. So you don't know left from right and up from down and round from flat. And you have to ask them and rely on them for all the answers. Cause then they have all the power. So the sooner you realize this is a reality and this is a reality, the sooner your mind is open to what reality actually is. And you can take your power back. That's what I did. And I feel better than ever. And of course, this is all for entertainment purposes. These guys are probably just from the same genetic line. Way, way back from that English king. That all the presidents are related to entertainment purposes only.",

They are absolutely in defense contracting. The 1950s, they pivoted hard and started making satellites. They were like, hey, we're so good at canned peaches, we should try war. You know what? They don't make fucking jars. They got out of the jar business. They're too busy in aerospace. And then I went down this crazy rabbit hole of all these different companies where they're like, yeah, we make a thing you've heard of, but our true passion is war machines. AMF makes bowling alley equipment and funny, aggressive animations. They also make nuclear power plants and missile launch systems, which means some of their animations were not that far off. Honey. Well, home security, air conditioning. Also the autopilot system that we use to drop the bomb. Singer made typewriters and sewing machines and pew pew. Texas Instruments makes calculators and also big pew pew. General Electric has made toasters and fighter planes. And I know they're general, but I didn't know they were at general. And just a couple years ago, John Deere and the Roomba company joined forces to make an automated robot that patrols around Military bases.

Video started circulating seconds ago on the Iranian News Telegram of rescuers stating that there are no survivors. This was also just now stated seconds ago on El Jazeera. Earlier today, a helicopter containing Iran's president along with Iran's foreign minister suffered what was considered a hard landing near the Azerbaijan border. Here's a map of the crash site. When it crashed, signals were detected by the armed forces of the helicopter and a cell phone from somebody on the flight crew. Turkey then sent 32 mountain specialists to help. On top of that, Russia went ahead and sent 47. Most analysts believe the reason it crashed was due to the bad weather. While all of this was going on, Republican Senator Rick Scott from Florida said, frosty said, the world is now a safer and better place. That evil man was a tyrant and tea. He was not loved or respected, and he will be missed by no one. He's gone. I truly hope that Iranian people have the chance to take their country back from murderous dictators. Turkey also sent a drone that has a live feed going. The drone then detected a source of heat from the crash site. The Gulf Cooperation Council has expressed their solidarity with Iran and the Iranian people. Now Iran's Vice President Muhammad Mubarak will be taking on the role of president until An election is held within a maximum of 50 days.",

Cryogenics programs have been around since around the 1960s, where people have immersed their bodies in liquid nitrogen in hopes of waking up at a future date when medical technology has advanced. But it still remains mostly out of reach. In fact, the bodies of people who have been cryogenically frozen have started to degrade. This is through a combination of just poor storage and the human's body is intolerance to being frozen. I would say in every single case of someone who has cryogenically frozen their body, they're not going to wake up. However, that doesn't mean we won't get there soon. There's many animals that can be entirely frozen and then wake up in the next season when they thaw. That's because they have bioprotectants naturally in their bodies. And by borrowing these animals techniques, we're working on making better cryoprotectants for humans. And we've done it with the brain organoids, you know, the tiny human brains that we can grow in jars. Growing tiny, fully functional human brains is really advancing neurological research. In this case, they flooded it with the cryoprotectant and then revived it, and it suffered no damage. At least no noticeable damage. All the future where we can really just walk into a cryogenic chamber and wake up a thousand years later is pretty far out of reach. In the next few decades, we Might actually get there.",

Here's another one of pro mania being so proud about being at the White House. Right? But what if I told you this gets much deeper than you'd like to think? For example, right here, this article paints it very well. Here's a statistic for you. A third of people ages 18 to 29 prefer to get their news supposedly from TikTok and other social media. So the White House is supposedly working on new ways to get its message out to these audiences. More than 20 people were. There were ring lights and audio equipment taking it all in. And it's supposedly part of a White House strategy to reach younger people where they are, which often is supposedly scrolling on a device with help from influencers. Influencers such as V from under the desk news, who says to be at the People's House having lemonade. Waiting for the president to speak is a very exciting moment. As you see, like it says here, that's V, host of under the Desk News, which provides minute long daily news wraps to 2.7 million TikTok followers. Oh, and there was supposedly a special briefing for V and other content creators ahead of the ceremony. I wonder what was discussed in that special briefing. Honestly, people can't realize that there's two motherfucking sides to the same motherfucking coin. At this point, you're just choosing to remain door minded. Truly a mindless little consumer that chooses to be an NPC. Not caring about who the fuck they're voting into the fucking house. Not giving a fuck about who they're voting for to lead us as the people. So I guess it's time to cancel V from under the desk news and Mr. Pro mania himself, right?

The road transmission is placed into the neutral position and the marine transmission is placed into drive. Once in the water, steering is done with a touch of a joystick. In the cockpit, a rudder angle indicator is located beside the rudder controls so you always know where the steering is set. The front wheels can be used in conjunction with the rudders to improve steering in the water if needed. For tight maneuvering, an additional instrument is provided to indicate the angle of the front wheels for landing and turning. The rear porch doubles as a swim deck. An optional fold down deck is available that will expand the deck 16 feet farther to the rear and by the full width of the vehicle.

And you, I can't even say seriously, you sitting across to me, you are Melissa. And there are, like, conspiracy theories that run so fucking deep. Like, does it annoy you that there will be people that comment on this episode being like, that's Melissa. That's not. When did it start? My second album? Like, I don't know. Obviously I am me. It's so dumb. And why do you think people think that? I think that they've done that with other artists. I'm not the only one. I think, like, other people have that. I feel like yours is, like, really prominent. Oh, I mean, I feel like you might believe that. I'm honestly the one that started the conspiracy theory. I went undercover to interview Melissa. It's fucking crazy. And I just have Empathy for you. But it's good again to know you don't give a fuck. I remember, like. Like, what are people talking about? And then I went and started looking and like, oh, people are fucking insane. So you don't care? So your name is Avril Lavigne? Yeah, but I knew you have believed it.",

But if you're still not convinced, hang on to your seats, because I got some new information. And it all stems from this beautiful statue constructed in 1848. You see, that statue is actually a statue of Lucifer. And it's called the genius of evil. And when you look closely, there are some pretty unmistakable similarities between this statue and a certain statue in the NYC. Let's start by examining this chain attached to Lucifer's ankle. Could that be a symbol of being imprisoned in the bottomless pit for a thousand years? And you probably have never noticed, but I sure did. A very similar chain attached to that whole statue of Liberty. And when you look at the faces of those two seemingly unrelated statues, they sure bear an awful similar resemblance. And did you happen to notice what Lucifer was holding in his hand in that statue? A 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 point crown. Well, have you ever noticed how many points are in the statue of Liberty's crown? And did you happen to notice what type of fruit was hanging out in the bottom of that statue as well? And, well, I really don't have to go here, do I? And although small and at the very bottom of the statue, did you Notice this torch laying on the ground? That torch that just also happens to bear a very similar resemblance. That torch that Lucifer, the light bearer, is often depicted with. Often depicted with right in plain sight. So much in plain sight that you probably look right past it and might even unknowingly be rooting for it. But nah, it's all just a coincidence. They just happen to look alike and have the same pointed crown. And the same torch in the same association with an apple. And the same chain. Just a big coincidence. Just the way this is all a coincidence too. No one really worships any fallen angels and pays tribute to them through characters that a lot of people look up to. Just like the Vatican would never actually call their telescope Lucifer. It's just all jokes. It's all for fun. It's all entertainment. But stay tuned for some more information on that. But like I said, this is all for shits and gigs. For your entertainment. Cause that's all I am. Satire and entertainment purposes only."

And then if you haven't seen it, there's \u201cI'm a Virgo\u201d, which is a fantastic show, but it also has several minute long monologues about why capitalism is bad. And like, all of these things are true, right? All of the issues that these shows are pointing out are completely real issues. They're worth criticizing.

The Vatican is preparing guidelines for apparitions and other supernatural phenomena. I literally can't make this shit up. Look at this. Vatican is preparing to release a document giving guidance on how to discern supernatural phenomena. As you can see, the Holy See Press Office announced upcoming document will be published May 17th, saying that this doctrine of faith is in the process of finalizing a new text with clear guidelines and norms for the discernment of apparitions and other phenomena, saying that an apparition refers to an instance in which a divine entity, such as the saint, the Virgin Mary, or Christ himself, makes itself known to a person on earth. What the fuck? And the Catholic Church is supposedly urging extreme prudence before ascribing phenomena to a supernatural force, warning that being too quick to attribute divine origin to explainable occurrences can damage the faith and warp belief. What the fuck? Last month, the Vatican also released a document providing guidance on the place of human dignity in the modern age. And the document also denounced gender theory, gender transitions, and surrogate pregnancies as violating basic moral precepts. Once again, you cannot make this shit up. Does this not sound like Project Blue Beam to anybody else? And I know. Oh, my god, I sound like a crazy person, right? A conspiracy theorist, right? Kind of ironic how anybody's even considered a Conspiracy theorist anymore. Especially when you consider the fact that it took her own government over 100 years to admit that, in quotations, aliens are real. Does anybody even know what extraterrestrials are? Or how many different species of them actually exist in the first place? People really need to get in touch with reality, man, cause, god, I don't know, man. Something about this just does not feel right. I'm really curious as to what everybody thinks about this. I mean, is this not sketchy to anybody",

This is Moses West, and here's how his magical machine works. First, it pulls an air from the surrounding environment that it then cools down, similar to a refrigerator. This cooling turns the air's moisture into water droplets that can then be collected in a big storage tank. It's like making a small rain cloud inside the machine. This process is called atmospheric water generation, and Moses is using it to make sure that everyone has access to clean water, no matter where they live, how old they are, or how much money they have. One in four people don't have access to clean drinking water. And setting up infrastructure in many remote communities can be tricky and really costly. So innovations like Moses machine could be the key to making clean water more available all over the world. Do you have any questions about this, drop them in the comments so Moses can answer them.

It's a crescent moon, but as you can. I know you see it flickering, but it keeps changing on me, and I can see the same thing happening with my naked eye. So it's definitely not a can. It's not a camera focus thing. It's the moon. The moon is freaking moving. It's moving. And I know it's hard to believe, but the freaking moon is going from a wide crescent to a small crescent. The light is fluctuating. It's doing the same thing that you see on the camera. It's doing it to the naked eye as well."

nice non alcoholic beverage for those who do not partake in the drinky drinks but I'm gonna switch gears a little bit here and actually try one of the drinky drinks this is the Silencio limoncello okay cheers y'all oh oh yeah that's delicious it is not too sweet you got a little bit of the tartness and the lemon oh stunning I would get this again absolutely on a hot day oh man okay the Luca booth already just a winner for sure this is 10 out of 10 this is probably gonna be one of my favorite drinks from the Pixar fast food booth on to the next one cheers y'all yes the booths are opening two weeks after Pixar Fest started but that's okay better late than never here is the spark booth inspired by soul I love the booths the themeing is amazing so we got the chicken and the sparkler okay

curacao mango puree pineapple juice amongst other things there is a glow cube in here so that's what you get with this one very green so let's see what are you talking about no I I I tried it with the straw its cuz you mixed it yeah okay okay I like it big pineapple juice fan and that's what I'm getting like immediately as a pineapple juice so I really like this mmm mmm no I enjoy it I think it's great mmm definitely getting a lot of the mango puree pineapple juice not a ton of the cotton candy I really like it it's very tropical that's a 9 out of 10 for me another delicious non alcoholic drink now for the chicken and waffles this does have a uh peach cobbler topping we'll see how this goes okay let me get chicken this is the chicken and then the waffle these are potato waffles potatoes smashed into little waffles okay cheers I know what you mean I think it would have been better if they left it at waffles not potato waffles it's heavy on the savory and then you just get like the peach cobbler and uh it's like off balance you know what I mean not my favorite thing it's I don't think it's also that bad if they kept it as a regular waffle though it would have been better in my opinion but I'm still gonna give it like maybe a six and a half interesting concepts and it's cute for soul I will say it is cute love this drink we're gonna keep sipping on this and head to our next booth also for those who are wondering no there is no sip n saver pass for Pixar Fest look how cute this booth is we got the Gusto Macaron and the Ratatouille pizzetta I cannot tell you

There's a part of me. Only a part, cause there's a part of me, and I said it yesterday, that's glad he's not suspended. I want Denver to have a legitimate chance, right, to dig out of this hole. But even that part, this just doesn't feel right. It doesn't sit right. There is no justification for him not to be suspended. You can rationalize it like the league is doing. Say, hey, you don't know his intention. Did. Was he slamming it in frustration and it slipped and went all the way out onto the court?

I'm sorry, but if all these countries hate each other and they're all at war with each other, they're not gonna put their differences aside every 4 years to play games. That's ridiculous. So I mean, that's just one more, one more proof of nonsense. Not to mention, you know, the Antarctica Treaty was signed by all the countries in the whole world so that no one can do anything in Antarctica. So they were all able to get together and sign this treaty. Don't you think they would all be able to get together and lie to you? Cause I do. I'm at the point now I don't believe in countries anymore. I believe we have owners. Because it can pretty much be proven. I mean, Black Rock and Vanguard basically own the whole world. So we have owners. And I don't think we have countries. We have dividers, we have jails that were all in.

If Jesus is not real, if the word of god is not real, why is these things happening? Why is the house of representatives trying to take away the Bible? Why are they trying to take out parts of the Bible? These are things that we need to ask ourselves. The Lord said in his word, my people perish for the lack of knowledge. This generation that we live in today, they are taking god out of everything. They want nothing to do with god. The Lord told me today that they are preparing the way for the beast. Everything that the Lord spoke about in the book of revelation is unfolding. Jesus is real, and he lives today. He's the king of kings and he's the Lord of Lords.

    "video_description": "@MSNBC The Donald Trump Time Magazine interview told us everything we needed to know for this presidential election season #politics #news #biden #vote #greenscreenvideo #greenscreen ",
    "voice_to_text": "your observations on Donald Trump today sleeping I know we don't wanna talk about Donald Trump but we have to today and I know it's extremely concerning that his team cannot keep him awake but it's also like a little bit hilarious so you went off about Sleepy Joe for years just to say hold my earrings but anyways if you haven't heard Trump just did a huge interview in time magazine about what his plans for his next term are if he's elected president we need to keep talking about this and spreading the word cause it's definitely the most concerning one I've heard today because he said everything in his head with his chest out loud this time like that's why it's taking me so long to relay this information to you cause I literally had to take days to process what I'd read but it's a long article and I'm just gonna summarize some of the parts that jump out of it to me first of all the professional summary of his plan is the end of our democracy and the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order it emphasizes repeatedly the fact that even the people who worked close to him his first time around and know him the best have all publicly distanced themselves and denounced him even his former advisor had some thoughts on the matter he said if Trump could even carry out a fraction of the goals he laid out here it would change the presidency forever but even his former advisor said he's in full war mode Trump's sense of the state of the country is quite apocalyptic that's where Trump's heart is that's where his obsession is this man is obsessed the first thing maybe one of the most important things is that Trump's influence on American democracy would extend far beyond just pardoning powers it says that they are laying down the groundwork to restructure the presidency to be more in line with a doctrine called the unitary executive theory what this really means is they wanna restructure the way the government works in favor of a more powerful commander in chief what it sounds like as far as I could decipher it is a lot of fancy tricky words to say they kinda wanna get rid of the checks and balances system entirely but the president can just have total control over everything and no one can stop him that is a very strong and scary start and then immediately of course they jump back into very focus on deporting as many people as possible and just funneling tons of money into that strange wall that didn't quite pan out the first time then he also mentions that he wants to be able to monitor women pregnant women and persecute them which is interesting because when all of these bands and whatnot towards women started they emphasized to make it clear that they were never planning on going after the women they wanted to go after the doctors and things like that surprise surprise never mind to that they lied to us and of course he wants to pardon everyone who was involved in January 6th and he wants to be able to personally control like the funds that are going to Congress because again his first time around Congress was the big thing stopping him checks and balances and what not he doesn't want people to be able to say no to him he also just wants to be able to fire anyone he wants who doesn't agree with him and it's important to note that when asked a lot of questions like that he responds with nah I might do that or maybe I don't know you know that that just means totally like the right has proven that time and time again even when they say they're not going to do something like persecute women here they are going back on that the only part that actually gave me kind of like a chuckle out of this whole concerning interview was the amount of time he spent talking about how he was personally gonna go after and persecute Biden for all of his crimes but he couldn't clarify what any of these crimes were and then of course times had to fact check him and say Biden has not been charged with any and the House Republican effort to impeach him has failed to unearth evidence of any crimes or misdemeanors high or low a concerning aspect about this is that a lot of his policies and what not seem to be going specifically after people who have upset him like if you wanna talk about narcissism most of his plans for his presidency sound like a personal toddler fit vendetta revenge tour and then he even alluded to some vague like passive aggressive threats if he didn't win the election at the end which are we all hearing how not okay that sounds it ends by saying Trump doesn't dismiss the possibility of political violence around the election he said if we don't win you know it it depends it always just depends on the fairness of the election and then they asked him more specifically about a couple of strange things he said on Truth Social in which he just completely denied that he said all of it and immediately changed the subject to complaining more about Biden and I know especially myself we don't wanna keep hearing about this and talking about this it's all very exhausting but we have to cause the truth of the matter is that this man is still pulling concerningly high and if we don't stop talking about it it's not going to get better",

Conditions in the deep sea environment include very high pressures, total darkness, extreme temperatures, and toxic chemicals. Bsbsbs. They got ate by freaking dinosaurs. They can't go down there because there's. There's creatures down there probably bigger than my house. what had happened was they went down there and they never came back because that megalog Donna shark probably ate them.

I think we might have found the time traveler. And if you haven't seen this video yet, this guy down here goes into a shed and disappears, and then the next day, this guy walks out of the shed. I first saw this video, I thought it was just fake. I thought it was a joke. I thought it was some sort of skit. So much so that I stitched it with, like, a silly little I'm a time traveler thing. But I've gone through it, and I can't. I can't figure it out. If it is a hoax, it's done well. But I also kinda think it's possible that there's a portal in the guy's shed. Like, I know, I know it sounds crazy, but have you seen the show 11 22 63? Need you to go in this closet, take a look around, then I'll tell you everything. That was 19 6. I always like that show, but it always bothered me that the time portal was in a pantry in a diner. Like, when they have figured that out, when they built the pantry. But I guess, like, they're maybe. I don't know, but it's. It's like the same principle as what happened to the gentleman in the shed. Like, he went in as, like, what, late mid To late 20s, came out early to mid 60s. So he might have spent 40 years in there, like, well, in the past. And he's wearing modern clothes, so he could have brought, like, his backpack, could have had a change of clothes in it for when he came back to the future. But what did. What did he change? Because let's say he went back to 1960, spent 40 years, then he would have come back in 2000. Like, come back to 2024 in 2000. But I'm convinced that is the same guy, because unless they're just really closely related, they have the same walk, the same mannerisms, the same facial structure. I don't know. I think it's pretty close. So if he's from this timeline, if he comes back to 2024, somebody's gotta recognize him. Like, I mean, it's a. Not the clearest picture, but somebody. Somebody has to know who he is. But we also have to start looking in the past. Like, he couldn't have left no footprint. There has to be a picture of him or a story about him or something. Like, he can't have just done nothing for 30 or 40 years. There's gotta be something, history wise, that proves he was there. I don't start in Florida. That's where the guy's Airbnb is. But anyway, internet, do your thing. Come on, guys, let. We need to find this guy. We just need to find him and ask him some questions, that's all. We need to do. Also, um, can somebody find out where that Airbnb is? Where the shed is located? Cause, um, wanna try something",

Like this. I've been giving him from milk from this powder. And she said she'd been using this powder for weeks. So she called Enfamil right away. Meat Johnson Nutrition is the maker of Enfamil formulas. In a statement, the company said, I'd reckon Meat Johnson. We take these complaints very seriously. We received the consumer complaint, have been in touch with the consumer directly, and are moving quickly to investigate the situation. Meanwhile, Chavez says her son isn't feeling well. He started having diarrhea, so I'm like, I'm not sure if it's associated with the worms. A worried mom now plans to have her baby tested for parasites.

    "voice_to_text": "Scientists have discovered an ocean 700 km below the Earth's surface and three times bigger than all the oceans on earth combined. This hidden ocean is deep within the Earth's mantle and has made scientists rethink where we get our surface water altogether. A massive underwater hole has also been discovered off of the coast of Mexico. And as of right now, experts know that it is at least 1,300 feet deep, but they have not yet hit the bottom. Scientists have even referred to this hole as a portal, leading many to come up with strange theories or believe that this hole leads somewhere further than people may think. Now, this reminds me of the Bible verse in Genesis, where it talks about god setting a firmament to separate the waters above from the waters below. If you were able to get to the bottom of the ocean, there will probably be a barrier, and beyond this barrier would be even more water. Others have been bringing up the inner or Middle Earth theory again, believing that some of these ocean holes may lead to different parts of our world deep within, that we don't even know exist. Now, obviously, that's just a theory, but I have to admit that there's been some really strange anomalies going on with our oceans in the last couple of years. Just to give a couple examples, huge red lights were photographed in the Pacific Ocean last year. And the ocean anomaly coming from Antarctica, that we were initially told was a glitch, is now back and even changing shapes.",

    "voice_to_text": "Congress is absolutely not corrupt. No, I don't. I don't see the corruption. Both Democrats and Republicans, by and large, they're just trying to do what we believe we need to do for our districts and for our constituents. I think that there are parts of our system that are corrupting to the general atmosphere. There is in do influence for special interests. Absolutely. Some people do tend to favor large business and that special interest corporations and special interest tsunami of money that comes in from. From special interest groups. And that is a form of corruption. There's no question. I think there's too much money in our political system. I was told at the beginning that I had to raise $250,000 if I wanted to be on certain committees, and if I wanted to be on more important committees or committees with broader jurisdiction, I needed to raise even more money. Buying a committee seat is not something that most Americans know that members of Congress have to do. The number of times over the course of the 11+ years that I heard one of my colleagues say, you know, I agree with you on that, but I could never vote that way because of my fear of a primary is concerning. Citizens United was a horrible decision by the Supreme Court that held corporations had the rights as individuals to make contributions in our campaign. It LED to the floodgates of a lot of special interest dollars. Coming into campaigns without really knowing who was contributing those hours. I have been a big supporter of campaign finance reform. We need campaign finance reform. Change the way campaigns are funded in America. And definitely by demanding disclosure of this dark money.",

now\u00a0the\u00a0problems\u00a0with\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0something\u00a0I've\u00a0been\u00a0researching\u00a0for\u00a0quite\u00a0a\u00a0while way back in October when\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0a\u00a0Bill\u00a0stating\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018anti-Zionism\u00a0is\u00a0antisemitism\u2019 and\u00a0referenced\u00a0this\u00a0definition I\u2019ve\u00a0come\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0obvious\u00a0conclusion that this definition is used to shut down free speech criticizing\u00a0Israel\u00a0and\u00a0policies\u00a0in\u00a0governments\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0world this\u00a0definition\u00a0is\u00a0heavily\u00a0pushed\u00a0by\u00a0pro-Israel\u00a0lobbies\u00a0here\u00a0in\u00a0America because it literally gives these lobbies protections not\u00a0only\u00a0are\u00a0they\u00a0already\u00a0acting\u00a0in\u00a0Israel's\u00a0interests and on behalf of Israel this shuts down a lot of criticism of the pro Israel lobby in America because a lot of it is based off the actions of the state of Israel if you can't criticize Israel legally anymore you can't criticize these pro Israel lobbies the\u00a0author\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act\u00a0is\u00a0Mike\u00a0Lawler and\u00a0you\u00a0already\u00a0know\u00a0he's\u00a0funded\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC\u00a0$180,000\u00a0this\u00a0year\u00a0alone the\u00a0reason\u00a0this\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0being\u00a0pushed\u00a0right\u00a0now is so they can use it to shut down college protests and\u00a0say\u00a0that\u00a0they're\u00a0in\u00a0violation\u00a0of\u00a0Title\u00a0VI and\u00a0let\u00a0them\u00a0pull\u00a0federal\u00a0funding\u00a0from\u00a0schools who allow these protests to continue on their campuses when I was doing my research I came across something that was really interesting this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0Declaration\u00a0on\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0 which\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0IHRA\u2019s\u00a0definition their goal was to fix the issues with the other definition which\u00a0conflated\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0with\u00a0antisemitism the two are not the same and\u00a0fix\u00a0the\u00a0clear\u00a0bias\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0Israel that the other definition is being used for so a group of 200 scholars got together and wrote this definition that makes a clear distinction about what is and\u00a0what\u00a0isn't\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0and\u00a0antisemitism my\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0politicians\u00a0are\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0not\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0definition??\u2019 clearly protects free speech in a way that the other one does not the\u00a0answer\u00a0is\u00a0-they\u00a0don't\u00a0wanna\u00a0use\u00a0it they want to shut down criticism of the state of Israel that's why they use this one we have to all speak out against this act it's an evil act it's an act meant to shut down free speech it's an act meant to protect Israel this is not an American Bill it's an Israeli Bill pushed\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC using\u00a0a\u00a0problematic\u00a0and\u00a0biased\u00a0definition they\u00a0had\u00a0the\u00a0audacity\u00a0to\u00a0name\u00a0it\u00a0the\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act what\u00a0it\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0called\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Don\u2019t\u00a0Speak\u00a0Against\u00a0Israel\u00a0Act please help this video get out there repost and copy the link a bunch of

    "voice_to_text": "Scientists may have finally cracked the code on immortality, why humans age so quickly, while other animals can live for 500 years. Even mammals. Naked mole rats don't seem to age. And jellyfish don't age at all. In recent years, we've discovered many animals that just don't seem to age. And they all share some unique genetic characteristics. But let's talk about jellyfish first. There are five species of jellyfish that once they reach their old age and their body starts to perish, they return to being a youngster again. And while they can engage in sexual reproduction, they don't have to. To continue their lives, they turn back the clock and their cells return to a young age again. When scientists compared immortal and mortal jellyfish, they found that they had twice the number of DNA repair mechanisms. DNA repair is the mechanism in all of our bodies that keeps our DNA together. When you get hit with something like UV radiation, your DNA falls apart. That sunburn you have is damaged to your DNA, and hopefully your body can put it back together. And if it can't, we end up getting cancers. Even if we were never exposed to radiation, the stable ends of our chromosomes, called telomeres, still shorten over our lifetimes. This is, in part, responsible for aging in humans. And every time we've attempted to lengthen the telomeres, what we get is cancer. In fact, the first immortal cell lines came from a woman, Henrietta Larks ovarian cancer. But what we found every time we look into these unaging animals, they have very sophisticated DNA repair and not just an increase in the length of the telomeres. This holds true as well for the world's oldest tree. That's a 5,000 year old pine. But the exciting thing about it is that we could edit our DNA. We could create humans that didn't age. We're not there yet, but I think we will get there. The question is, do you want to live in that world?"

No offense to the religious folk or the man upstairs, but I just don't think he's gonna come pick up a shovel with me. Nor is Jesus Christ gonna wire my bank account and reimburse me for my construction costs. And before you yell blasphemy, just know I've been to more Sunday services and youth groups than I can count. But right now I'm not too worried about my own salvation when I'm driving by homeless, intense cities every day, knowing that my 25 thousand dollar tax payment this year went to wars and death. I think god is a gamer and we all live in a save file that he abandoned a long time ago. No shade to the church, but I don't have a shiny collection plate. What I do have is a willingness to work hard to start a business, to post my life on social media, to tattoo myself for viral views and TikTok live gifts. To film the battery and the most intimate moments with my fiance and post them all for sale. Cause none of this gets built without money. And I don't know if you've noticed, but everything's unaffordable. Corporate agreed with political backing is buying up all of our residential real estate just to rent it back to us at a profit. So I don't really care what Jesus would Do I'll stoop to any level to say fuck the people at the top of this human food chain"

Documents were found that said that they went to investigate because the pyramids were emitting an energy. These documents also stated that members of a certain society visit the pyramids for a reunion. But, like, how come we've never seen these pyramids? Like, it's not easy to hide a pyramid. They're not small. Why are we. Why have we never heard about this before? It is believed that an ancient civilization constructed these pyramids in Antarctica. And then it has something to do with the UFOs. Similar to the UFO conspiracy theories about the pyramids that we know in Egypt. Except these pyramids are two times the size of the ones in Egypt. And Antarctica is already a hub for conspiracy theories. I can make a whole other video about that if you want me to update you as we find out more information about what's going on with these pyramids and what was leaked.

And then like, out of nowhere, I don't know what the fuck it was. I don't even think I had started working out yet, but out of nowhere that shit started tasting fucking weird and did not noticed. After I do weird taste, I tried cooking it different. I'm like, now something right? It did. Not only that, did the meat got bigger? Pause, no Diddler is it just me or are the chicken wings fucking huge? Is it just me or are the chicken thighs large than a motherfucker? Is it just me or is the poultry in this country starting to taste weird? Like, I just seen a video that girl talking about them Popeyes chicken wings and I'm like, I feel you, but it ain't. It ain't just the fucking Popeyes chicken wings. Just like chicken everywhere. But when you go to, like, a mom and pop, like, chicken wing spot and they get them little ass wings. Why don't bitches hit? Why don't bitches taste like meat? Pause, no diddler. And then I started buying, like, the lean meat, the. The meat From Walmart, the chicken that they come in a smaller packs, and it's green on the top. The green label on top. That don't taste funny right now, but how is is, you know, is it me? I feel like I'm tripping again. Like, there's less food in the containers, and the chicken is getting larger and more twangy, if you know what the fuck I'm talking about, because I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I know that I ain't fucking tripping.",

In an episode dating back to 1998, the show hinted at an economic crisis, a nuclear war, and the death of the leader of the United States, all happening in the same year. The episode in question, titled Bart to the future, provides a glimpse into the future where Lisa Simpson has become the president of the United States. In a conversation with her team, Lisa mentions that the previous administration LED by President Biden left behind budget problems and quite a mess. Later in the episode, a news bulletin reports a nuclear clash with an unspecified country, resulting in massive destruction and chaos. While the idea of a nuclear war and an economic crisis is quite frightening, we can certainly hope that these Simpsons predictions do not come true. However, it's hard to ignore the show's track record in predicting major events, which leads us to wonder what else they might have predicted for the future. And precisely one of the latest episodes of the Simpsons contains an even more terrifying prediction than anything they have predicted before. Do you want a part 2 to find out about it?",

There's evidence that there's huge amounts of water 250 to 400 miles beneath Earth's surface, trapped in the rocky mantle between these two layers. So right here, it's possible that there's so much water here that it could be up to three times the amount of water that's in Earth's oceans. But this water wouldn't be the same. Don't imagine an actual ocean down there. This water would be trapped in minerals in. In rocks. It's not liquid, because with 400 miles of earth on top of it and extremely high temperatures, water molecules split and bind into minerals, crystal structures. What I'm saying is the water is in a really weird form. It's not liquid or water vapor. It's trapped inside the molecular structure of minerals. And there's evidence of this in seismic data from rocks melting in the mantle. And because a volcano in Brazil shot out a piece of ringwoodite from 400 miles beneath Earth's surface, and that had solid water bound into it. And scientists don't know if this is everywhere, but there is evidence a actually for large amounts of water underneath North America. So there's not necessarily an ocean of water underneath earth surface, but there could be an ocean's worth of solid water bound into minerals. And that is very cool.",
