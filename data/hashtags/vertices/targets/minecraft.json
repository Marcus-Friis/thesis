    "voice_to_text": "A California man was mailed a package with a western diamondback rattlesnake inside and he is saying that it is attempted murder. So on may the 16th, 60 year old Elijah Bowles and a friend of his go to the post office to pick up this package that he has. After they leave the post office in their driving way, she actually opens the package and then throws it at him when she realizes that there is a live rattlesnake inside. This package had actually been mailed on may the 3rd. It had a return address of Florida, but it was actually mailed from Hayward, California, which is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Elijah Bowles lives south of there in San Bernardino County, which is outside of Los Angeles. He went on to say that the snake was about two feet long and that whoever meld the snake put cotton balls inside the box so that people working with the Postal Service would not hear the snake rattle. The center actually wrote the word fragile in the box and then mailed it from Hayward, California on may the third, and the box had just been sitting there at that post office for several days before Elijah Bowles picked it up. Now Animal Control got the snake and took the snake and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office is investigating."

    "voice_to_text": "Microsoft has changed gaming forever. One of our developers, Ryan, simply shared his screen with Co Pilot while he was playing Minecraft. Now, what you're gonna see here is two voices. The first will be Ryan, the second will be Co pilot. And he's gonna be having a natural conversation like he would with a friend while he plays. Let's watch this experience. Hey, co pilot, how's it going? Hey, I'm doing great. And it looks like you're about to dive into some Minecraft. Ready to build, explore, and maybe dive a few miles? Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to make a sword. My son plays this game all the time and I have no idea what I'm doing. No worries. I'm here to help you impress your son. I see you've got a crafting table in front of you, which is a great start. To craft a sword, you'll need some materials. Can you open your inventory? Just press E on your keyboard. Yeah. Do I have what I need? Let's see, you got some sticks perfect for the sword's handle. But it looks like you're missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold or diamond. Alright, let's pause it there for a second. Did you see how co pilot not only could understand that he was in Minecraft, but he could also understand Ryan's request for help and assess the inventory on his screen? Well, it gets better as Ryan continues. He gets surprised that co pilot amazingly identified and it tailored interaction. Let's watch. Let's start by gathering some wood or stone. Shall we head out and find some resources? Yeah, that sounds great. Oh my god, what's that? Oh no. It's a zombie! Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach. If you can find a shelter or dig into the side of the hill, do it now. Just make sure it can't reach you. Alright, I think I might be safe now. Cool. That was a close one. Great job finding shelter. So that was honestly for us.",

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out."

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States."

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

There's a lot of things in here, but specifically there are changes for streamers and content creators alike. For example, content creators on YouTube can no longer use the word Minecraft as the primary title of their video. They gave us a couple of examples here. So Minecraft the ultimate help app not okay. The shaft a Minecrafters podcast. That one's good. Additionally, creators can no longer pay while their content behind. Maybe some kind of members only content situation? Minecraft assets such as logos and fonts can't be used in ways that promote mods, servers, or worlds that are not related to Minecraft. Minecraft servers need to be for all ages, and those servers must include an entry process that has a disclaimer stating not an official Minecraft product. That's just some of the changes going on here, and this is an important lesson to gaming content creators. At the end of the day, if you make content on YouTube that revolves around a video game, you are at the mercy of these companies deciding what's okay and what's not.

I know it's a bit of work just to build a small rectangular starter house down here, but add a river and some walls around the edge and you have the perfect area to build a giant Jenga tower that reaches Minecraft's build limit and contains 164 bedrooms inside. That's just enough space for all of your friends. If you're up for the challenge, you can build this in your own Java Edition world with this Lightmatic schematic or the world download is available for bedrock and Java Edition. It's all LinkedIn my bio at Charlie custard.com. But anyways, as always, I hope this build gave you some inspiration.",
