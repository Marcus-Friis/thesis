Um, I'm very appreciative of that. Um. Uh, it's, uh, allowed me to, um, play significantly more roles than I ever would have been playing had I not been able to do that. But, you know, I do live here in America. Um. Um, also, uh, English are exposed much more to American films and therefore how American sound than the other way around. Which is why, I suppose, even my own kids do like the worst English accents ever. Because a lot of Americans are only exposed to period films. Largely English period films where. Right. No one sounds like that anymore in England. But so even though they've been brought up with me, my kids still go, oh, no. So I think we have something more of an advantage for me, speak for myself. Grown up in England, watching American movies."

I'm gonna make a production at the end of this video so hang around for that so a long time ago in a place called the 90s TV seasons used to have 20 22 24 26 episodes but the production value for each episode was not like amazing and in the late nineties the Sopranos debuted on HBO and it really changed TV it used filmic storytelling techniques and cinematography in a way that they had never been used on television before and Sopranos was such a big hit every channel wanted their version of the Sopranos they all wanted a drama that would get awards consideration that used cinematography and storytelling techniques that were a little closer to feature films and you know Hawaii five 0 from the 70s so I'm not an expert on this but what I surmise is that as the cost per episode to achieve that climbed the number of total episodes per season fell so if you were FX you did not have broadcast TV money so you would make a great show like the shield but instead of 24 episodes it would only have 13 episodes and over time it seems like as the cost per episode has climbed the total number of episodes have dropped that's resulted in some awesome things including big budget battle sequences and game of Thrones I mean we would have never seen that 30 or 40 years ago but it is also resulted in just less episodes overall and now we're in the era of streaming and I think the streamers have been happy to have short seasons because they expect you to binge them so Netflix just pumps out new seasons you only get three per show but they pump out new seasons and new shows and and it gives the feeling of greater value because new stuff is coming out every week but the streamers have a big problem and it's that you can just cancel your subscription at any time so if I wanna watch the last season of Stranger Things I just wait till the episodes drop then I subscribe watch it and then cancel that is called churn and that is every streamer's worst nightmare so they're gonna do everything that they can to get you from not turning how do they get you to come back week after week month after month so that you're subscribed to Netflix for months and months and months and if you like four shows a year you're subscribed the whole year how can they do that well they just stop the binge model they stop dumping everything all at once they eventize television again and here's my prediction I\u00a0also\u00a0think\u00a0we're\u00a0gonna\u00a0see\u00a0a\u00a0return\u00a0to\u00a0seasons\u00a0that\u00a0have\u00a0*more*\u00a0episodes I think we're gonna get up to 18 20 22 episodes of season because if you can create a hit like the office or like Stranger Things and draw out that attention from three months to six months I think the streamers are gonna Wanna do that I personally think that the best seasons of television have been around 13 episodes but I do think we are going to see return to longer seasons with more episodes"

I strongly believe that George Miller should direct Thor 5. Director of the mad Max movies and recently Furiosa, starring Anya Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth. Not only is he one of the best filmmakers today with such a versatile filmography, from Babe to Happy Feet to the mad Max movies and now Furiosa, he also has an interest in these kind of superheroes, comic book characters, myths. And we know for a fact he can direct Chris Hemsworth in an incredible story. It's time for a tone shift from Thor Ragnarok and Thor love and thunder. Taika with TT's movies, it's time. It's time for a tone shift, and I think George Miller is the director to take Thor seriously again. The reason I know that is because George Miller was actually gonna direct a Justice League movie in the early 2. This was actually a screen test photo of his project. If he had interest in Justice League, he could totally do Thor. This is what he had to say on the attraction to Justice League in the Happy sad confused podcast. I've always been aware of the power of myth. They're timeless in all cultures. Their roots go back to the Greeks, their modern myths and have a new meaning in the zeitgeist. What Do you think. Do you think George Miller should direct Thor 5? Let me know in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "things are not looking good for movie  theaters right now Furiosa one of the summer's first  big blockbusters has only made somewhere around $25  million in its opening weekend and through Memorial Day is projected  to sit around 31 million which would be the worst Memorial Day  weekend sales for movie theaters in like 30 years Furiosa had a production  budget of around $168 million which with its extensive marketing would mean they need to make over  300 million just to break even and we've already talked at great length  about why this might be and there are myriad reasons movie theater etiquette  not being followed there's consumer habits crafted  by the pandemic the prices are way too high and some people would even tell you  because the movies are too woke a lot of people have said Fury Road  didn't even make that much money why would we expect this one to and that's kind of true but I think a lot of us were hoping for  an Into the Spider Verse situation where that movie didn't make  a ton of money and then Across the Spider Verse made double because of  all the people watching it since but I don't wanna breeze past movie  theaters being too expensive if you were gonna go see Furiosa  with your partner it would cost you 60+ dollars  for two drinks two tickets and a popcorn now that doesn't include gas or parking  or getting a babysitter that's a huge factor but I would wager the people that  do have the money aren't going either and this is coming from a guy that once  spent his last $20 to rent We\u2019re the Millers I think it's deeper than that the movie Atlas came out on Netflix the  same day as Furiosa and  became the No. 1 movie  on Netflix worldwide now I know that Netflix probably  cooks their books and it doesn't take into account the  amount of people that turn  that movie on and then just started doing laundry but I still think there's a disturbing  amount of people that wouldn't see the difference  between Furiosa and Atlas it's just content Ted Sarandos one of the CEOs of Netflix is claiming that Barbie and  Oppenheimer would have been  just as big on Netflix that is delusional here's a picture of me watching  Furiosa on my phone if you push all of your  hard won cynicism  to the bottom of your gut then you know and your deepest  heart of hearts there's an aspect of community and  spectacle to going to a movie theater that cannot be replicated these images deserve to be seen  on a big screen but more than that it's about the attention you're in a place where you can't look  at your phone where you're not apt to think about all  of your cares and worries and just focus on the story which is why that I think that the real  culprit from movie theaters dying is what Bilge Ebiri a film critic says here it's the phones it's the fact that we can watch  our phones all day we're addicted to it you're doing it right now there's stuff you should be doing Garfield is struggling even  harder than Furiosa and Family Media usually  does really well Finding Dory made over a billion dollars you might be thinking well Finding Dory rocks minions the rise of Gru also made  almost a billion dollars I think it's more than the prices the theater etiquette or the perceived  political messaging I think when it comes to movies most people just don't care anymore or more accurately the studios no longer have any ability to  predict what people do care about the sequels and the reboots that stuff's not working anymore people rarely turn out for original  stories either I think that there's a huge cultural  shift happening in the way that people view celebrity they have a distaste for it a generational division around  issues of class which I think is actually  a very good thing but there is a difference between  Lawrence of Arabia and Parasite and Kim Kardashian I think we need to separate that  when it comes to art I don't have the answers I just thought it was interesting and if your natural response to this is I just think we're done talking  about HollyWeird I don't care anymore well this is a page that just  discusses movies so if you couldn't grasp that then we're not gonna have  a good discussion",

    "voice_to_text": "the film industry is not dying but what I think we're about to see is a huge shift and it's all about reframing what success looks like we're not witnessing the death of the film industry but rather the death of the bloated budget blockbuster studios are learning this lesson the hard way and the number one thing that has to change immediately is sadly actor's salaries Rock is getting 50 million dollars for this Amazon Christmas movie that has cost them now over 250 million to make is not making them money this was dead on arrival no actor in the world right now is worth $30 million let alone $50 million I'm not talking about cutting the salaries of all actors I'm talking about cutting the salaries of stars right now most actors are not bringing enough revenue with them to justify that amount of money took a deep dive into the top 50 budgets of all time if you look around the top 30 about 70% of those are Disney projects Indiana Jones in the dial destiny should have been a profitable movie at almost 400 million dollars worldwide problem is they spent 400 million dollars making this movie on what thing is Harrison Ford ended up getting paid 50 60 million dollars of that he does not carry that value right now he does not dictate that salary Star Wars has been egregious again 400 million dollars worldwide for solo they spent 330 million dollars making it little Mermaid making almost 600 million dollars had no business not being really financially successful they spent 250 million on this same exact thing with Fast X that was a covid situation that was its own thing but 714 million 340 million it's not profitable what else is happening here outside of actor's salaries studios are out of touch with what audiences want to see something like Elemental Pixar doesn't understand it's the 10th time they've gone back to the well on oh my parents just don't get me it brings us to the most important aspect of this it is the writing bad writing either leads to failure upon release or leads to bad test screenings and then reshoots and the reshoots are where these studios take a bath it is so expensive but that has to do with the CGI because a lot of movies are trying to cover up their bad stories with bad CGI there is nothing of substance there so they try to make visual spectacle but the VX artists are overworked and underpaid all of these VX studios are under bidding on projects just to get the work they are all on studio deadlines doing bad work for not enough money and then they get asked to do it all over again after there are reshoots sometimes during reshoots they're rewriting the story Marvel and Star Wars are great examples of this look at these Star Wars budgets they are preposterous that is because they were lazy they went in without a plan for what the three movies were gonna look like they were writing them by the seat of their pants as they went that is unacceptable early the storyboarding on these movies has gotten lazy there is not a good plan visually going in or from a script perspective for the writing issue snowballs into the VFX issue and snowballs into keeping actors and staff around for more and more time absorbing more and more budget also these productions are so bloated with people there are so many individuals involved now with made up positions that do absolutely nothing provide no value to a production widely documented and widely understood a lot of removing the bloat from these budgets is removing the personnel bloat from the sets actors today getting 20 million 30 million 50 million with the rock today you can be making an entire movie for that amount of money understand stars in the past have gotten more times have changed stars are not as marketable things are different get that through their head take a breath take a step back and take less money to help the actual project be successful as you take a step back and make more artistically and commercially successful projects fans and studios will once again start looking at you as a highly marketable star and your salary will increase mid budget movie with a good simple story good performances good writing that can be successful is the future in my opinion small budget movie that can be sold to a streaming service and also get a theatrical release like we just saw with hitman Glen Powell say all the star I need $20 million the whole movie cost $9 million they sold it to Netflix for $20 million so the keys to regaining the health of the industry this is the direction these things have to go covid inflation consumer behavior has shifted so the ceiling for movies has dropped a little bit right now we have to raise the floor just make it a smaller target by bringing down the budgets the other problem here maybe the most ironic problem is the marketing budgets for these movies get blasted with trailers left and right sometimes I can't get a movie out of my head but not for the right reasons instead to death but the movie trailer has been massacred recently we get these three three and a half minute long trailers that show you the plot of the movie and that's it when you're seeing them all the time and seeing marketing materials everywhere a lot of times it actually has a negative impact on the consumer marketing has to be simplified and bring down those budgets as well make shorter more succinct trailers give a taste of the atmosphere show a couple actors faces and keep it moving just give it all away get some excitement going don't be afraid to not show everything you are begging people to come see the movie and by doing that you are pushing them away you're throwing so much money at it with these marketing budgets it's counterintuitive my hope is these lessons are being Learned as studios take bath after bath after bath but I guess we'll see",

It's an erotic, provocative drama that tells you about a woman who survives a crash with a tree. And then she starts to develop this excitement around trees, and then she joins this group of people that are performing different activities with the trees. Oh, I've always been a fan of the thread level midnight franchise. It's about the secret agent who retired, but he's been called back by the president to save the world because of this golden faced maniac. Our personal thing. It's even better than James Bond franchise. Acotrace or Sled Echo. It's a Soviet film made by Arcadia Donski that tells you a story about a philosopher who loses hope in his subject, so he ventures into this forbidden zone that is believed to have aliens in there to find again the meaning of life. Fun fact, the director was killed by the communists because of the propaganda of the film. Oh, that's a good one. The fattest fart, too. It's even better than the first film, and it's insanely funny. It's for the whole family to watch and laugh their ass off. Oh, this list would not be complete without playback time by Carlson Clay. It's just a masterpiece. It's a story about a man who relieves his life with his dead wife by replaying the tapes of them together. I love Jack Brick. It's a wonderful film. About this retarded assassin who has to go back to business because of his hamster was killed by this Mafia gang. The Weight of shadows or Vaha Tinai in Ukraine. It's a 60s black and white folk drama the tells you about this countryside girl who falls in love with a boy whose parents are the killers of her whole family. So now she's been followed by the ghost of her own ancestors, which is clearly the matter for her guilt. Alive in the city. Ha ha! It's my go to pleasure. Me and my wife love that film. It's about this girl. She is a writer in the magazine in Detroit. And it's about her adventures of finding a perfect man, if you know what I mean.",

But this movie released today on digital platforms. This movie released in theaters on May 3rd, which means it had little over two weeks to cook in theaters. So obviously it's gonna flop now cause who's gonna go see it when they could just see it from the comfort of their home? Abigail, which was considered a failure by most, released on streaming on May 7th, released in theaters on April 19th. Even a movie like Monkey Man that was successful at the box office that released on April 5th, released on streaming two and a half weeks later on April 23rd. Imagine how well it would have done if it didn't release on streaming that soon. Whereas a movie like The Shawshake Redemption, which is considered one of the biggest flops of all time, was in theaters for 10 weeks, obviously had no streaming. A movie like John Carter, consider one of the biggest flops of all time, was in theaters for 15 weeks. A movie like Fight Club that was considered a big bomb was in theaters for 12 weeks. The problem with this one is the average persons not gonna go to the theaters anymore. They know it's gonna be on streaming two weeks later. Also doesn't allow movies anymore to have that word of mouth jump to where more people start seeing it. They start Telling people, and then they start going to see it in theaters. This is A big problem that movie theaters need to figure out fast.",

It's just not right. Ron Swanson was the best part of The Last of us. Also, he's married to Megan Maloney. He's basically already in a gay relationship. These two have a better understanding of what it means to be gay than I do. My only complaint about Noah Reid is that he created a gay character so attractive that I will feel forever let down by every other gay man I meet. No, but I just think Harry Styles shouldn't be allowed to act. Yes, but he needs to cool it a bit. Rupert Everett deserves a fighting chance. No one could have played these roles better than these two. Also, rest in peace Andre. I'm so sorry, but literally any Zara employee could have played Kevin. Gale's an icon. He can do whatever he wants. I don't care that he won an Oscar, it's a no. I was under the impression that Willie was gay until I made this video. Also, rest in peace. No, this petite treat is one of the best allies we've got. He can do whatever he wants. I mean, how else would he pay his bills?",

But wait, in a very short frame, you can see a familiar face. So this means Magnifico eventually becomes the magic mirror from Snow White. It makes even more sense when you realize the magic mirror is circled with zodiac signs. And the same signs are in Magneto's castle. This is the coolest connection ever!",

    "voice_to_text": "You're witnessing the beginning of the end of movie theaters if they don't start addressing this quickly. Because this shit's getting out of hands and it's the studios and the production company's fault. Fall Guy was meant to be the first blockbuster of the Season. 2 A list stars, a big budget, didn't live up to opening weekend expectations. And now, just 17 days after its release, it's coming to digital. Movie theater prices continue to rise, the concessions continue to go up. And they're trying to recoup the money that they're losing by charging more. And it's also killing them. But the real kicker here is that people now know they don't need to go to the movie theaters. They can wait two weeks, three weeks, and they can just watch it at home for twenty bucks. Comfort of their home, gigantic TV, don't have to worry about other people around them. And there are nobody schedule but their own. They don't have to look up a showtime and get there at a certain time. But the entire reason that this is even possible is that they allowed them to shorten the window before the release of digital. This used to be like at least three months, used to be much longer. And now the genies out of the bottle. They allowed them to go straight to digital during the pandemic. They saw that they could get a return on that. There's no more sales of DVDs to recoup The money they lose at the box office. And it's a slippery slope. And the only end in sight is that we're gonna end up paying like forty five fifty dollars to go see a few movies in theaters. And then you wonder and complain why we're only getting sequels and gigantic franchises. This is the tipping point right here. This is the point of no return. If they don't start getting handle on this, it will be the end of movie theaters as we have come to know it. We will be going the way of Broadway where it's just an occasional event.",

    "voice_to_text": "Are movies coming to streaming  services too soon undercutting box office potential and  ruining movie theaters? it's rumored that The Fall Guy a big blockbuster movie that massively  underperformed at the box office will be available to watch at home just over two weeks after  its theatrical debut something that's pretty  common nowadays the argument that I see a lot is that this is contributing to movies not  doing well in theaters it's training consumers to say \u201chey I'll just wait I know it'll be at home in a  couple of weeks.\u201d there's probably some truth to this but I think it's more of a  chicken or egg scenario or at least a lot more complicated  than that I think the distributors are somewhat  forced to do this because the movies aren't doing  well anyway which is in turn accelerating the fact  that they're not doing well they can send the movies home where  people apparently like to watch movies at least while people are talking about it make some extra revenue that they  don't have to split with theaters I think the meteoric rise of streaming  services over the last 10 years and the fallout from the pandemic  changed consumer habits  and expectations without the studio's interference the theatrical experience is always  evolving anyway back in the day movies would open slowly across the  country a few theaters at a time like a traveling circus the idea was to build buzz and  word of mouth It was actually the Godfather that was one of the first movies to open in hundreds and hundreds of  theaters at the same time to massive success so Jaws did the same thing and opened  in 465 theaters simultaneously and became the highest grossing  movie of all time beating out the Godfather so a couple of years later when  Star Wars came out we had the birth of the  modern summer blockbuster and now that's pretty much  the standard but we do have smaller distributors who  operate pretty old school like A24 and Neon they'll open movies in New York and LA and then spread it across the country  and then the world in the successive weeks movies used to be in theaters for six to  nine months Godzilla Minus One had a successful six  month run in Japan that just ended and that movie is still not watchable  at home even though it came out in the  US in December of course consumer habits and  expectations have already changed because Godzilla Minus One is the most  pirated movie in the world because of that in many ways I think there's  just no going back and studios are gonna have to adjust the amount of money they're spending  on some of these movies The Fall Guy cost $130 million I thought it was a great movie I thought it was a really fun time apparently the studio did too but they were wrong if the fall guy had cost $50 million they would be quite happy right now",

One of the first movies that comes to mind when I think about a movie that is perfect and I wouldn't change a single thing is Spike Lee's do the right thing. Terrence Malik's The Tree of life is also perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. The father is a film that absolutely broke me. And Anthony Hopkins, for as great of a career as he has had, I think this is like a career defining performance for men. Perfect. Perfect. Coraline traumatized you as a kid, but it is a perfect movie. Perfect. Perfect. Someone asked me. You only have one movie to choose from for the most perfect movie of all time. I would say there will Be Blood. Perfect. Perfect. It may not be to you, but Mamma Mia is a perfect movie to me. Perfect. Alien, also perfect. Perfect. 10 out of 10. Brilliant. Perfect. No notes. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Tarantino's best is also perfect in once upon a time in Hollywood. Perfect. And lastly, the best first watch I've seen this year. A movie that's not new, but it's new to me. Synaptically, New York from Charlie Kaufman is perfect. And there's a ton more films that could have included that I consider to be perfect, but this is a great reminder that film is subjective and perfect is only perfect if it's perfect for you. Someone please tell me how many times I said perfect in that video.",

    "voice_to_text": "how are we supposed to interpret this portrait of King Charles so Buckingham Palace just released the latest official portrait of King Charles it was made by a painter called Jonathan Yeo he's a very successful portraitist and already the internet has a lot of opinions about this painting about what it represents so let's break it down visually one of the first things you notice about this painting is the color  royal portraits tend to be pretty subdued this colour this bright pink orangey red is far from subdued Yeo and the palace described it as \u201cvibrant\u201d but as many people online have pointed out it looks like Charles is engulfed in flames or blood The flame thing I think they're getting from the very frenetic nature of the brush strokes right you can really see their texture and that's creating a heat and almost iridescence that we might associate with flames and the texture on his suit makes it almost look like his uniform is melting The red undertones are hard not to associate with the blood like color which again as people pointed out it's easy to interpret that as the blood of the British Empire's colonialism Yeo mentioned that he included the butterfly because it's a symbol of change and renewal and rebirth a nod to Charles's climate activism it looks especially fragile and endangered in this environment to me the most striking thing is his head it's a totally different color palette it looks like it's floating when I think of floating heads and Kings and Queens I think of beheading and revolution I would be so curious to hear what you think of the painting I think there's a lot of room for interpretation I don't think it's particularly flattering"

It only works with Doritos. Why only Doritos? You ask too many questions, Billy. The Reese's Pieces Love Child commercial from 2,011. God! Oh, awesome! Congratulation! You just had a brand new orange candy. My sweet candy baby! Oh, god! Love you, peanut butter! What? Hey, cupcake, that's my little peanut butter baby. Huh? This guy. Peanut butter, Bertha. Peanut butter! Taste the peanut butter! The Kmart I shipped my pants commercial from 2,013. Shit my pants right here! Shit my pants! You're kidding! You can shit your pants right here! You hear that? I can shit my pants for free! Wow, I just may shit my pants! Yeah, shit your pants, Billy, you can shit your pants too! I can't wait to shit my pants! Dad, I just shit my pants, and it's very convenient. Very convenient. I just shipped my drawers. I just shipped my nighty. I just shipped my bed. If you can't find what you're looking for in store, we'll find it at kmart com right now and ship it to you for free. Last but not least, the Mountain Dew commercial. Puppy monkey baby from 2,016. Puppy monkey baby! Puppy monkey, Baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby puppy monkey, baby. Why did these ever make it onto TV in the first place?",

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

Sure, was the 2019 remake kinda shitty? Yeah, but. But this one seems kinda badass, I'm not gonna lie. At number nine, I have Moana 2. Moana, in my opinion, is one of the best Disney movies of past 10 years, so of course I'm hyped for the second one. At number eight, we have Alien Romulus. It's. It's a fucking alien movie. I'm hyped. At number seven, I've Gladiator 2. Really? Scott coming back to direct this beast? You got Palma Scout, you got Denzel Washington, you got Pedro Pascal. I'm hyped. Listen, I don't really give a fuck what you think about M. Night. Whenever he makes a movie, I'm excited for it, so. At number six, I have trap, and this one looks like an absolute banger. At number five, I have the Hitman, Richard Linklater, Glenn Powell. Need AC more. At number four, I have Twisters. Glenn Powell, Twisters. Summer Blockbuster. Hyped. At number three, we have A Quiet Place day one. We've always needed a prequel to those first two films, and this one looks like it's gonna be crazy. At number two, I have furious. I'm one of five people in the entire world that didn't Love Mad Max Fury Road as much as everyone else, but come on, I'm not that much of an idiot. This is gonna be a banger. Yep. This is where I'm gonna lose a lot of people. At number one, I have Deadpool and Wolverine. Remember, I'm not ranking best movies of the rest of the year. I'm ranking it on excitement level. I have Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool. As usual. Their first time in the MCU. Come on, the hype level is real."

    "voice_to_text": "If corporations in the US were smart, they would do exactly what all these is doing right now. I've been saying this for a while. All these is coming out and making a huge statement and getting a ton of marketing. Because they're lowering their grocery costs and they're going to create an avalanche of public goodwill that will end up pushing their profits up higher. They're going to be dropping their prices on 250 items. And a lot of these items are staple groceries. Things like meat. For instance, they're taking steak from 8:49 to 6:49, chicken from 2:49 to 2:19, etcetera. They're also lowering cost on things like chia seeds, avocado oil, frozen blueberries, kidney beans. What they are doing is genius and I honestly don't understand why more corporations don't see this. If they squeeze their hand tighter around our necks, were just going to leave bro. We will find a better place to go spend our money. And ha ha, Aldi is really stepping up to the plate here and they're stepping into that spot. My prediction is that because of this, Aldis is going to see a profit increase. Because they are going to take people from other grocery stores and bring them into the store and probably create loyal clients. Because kindness and goodwill creates loyalty. And the same is true for your workers. When you treat your workers well, they will bend over backwards for you. And corporate America has really fucking forgotten This. It's time we remind them.",

There's so much potential there. It's practically begging to be made. Imagine the box office numbers if they announced a standalone Vader movie. Especially if they brought back Hayden Christensen to reprise the role. It would be an absolute gold mine. And yet here we are, still waiting. For all the people who argue that the original six movies are about Vader, they couldn't be more wrong. The prequels are about Anakin Skywalker's journey to becoming Vader, and the originals are about Luke's struggle against him. But despite being the central figure of the saga, Vader screen time across all six movies is less than 40 minutes. A dedicated Vader movie would finally give him the spotlight he deserves, delving deep into his emotional struggles and conflicts, especially in the aftermath of revenge of the Sith. But what do you guys think? Would you want Disney to make a Vader movie, or should they keep making same content they've been doing?",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

Listen, when I was a kid, I grew up watching films like the Transform movie, Oliver and company, and all dogs go to heaven. Movies that had actors sprinkled in, but the majority of the characters were voice by voice actor. And listen, I'm not saying there hasn't been amazing voice work by famous actors. Look at what Robin Williams did with the Genie. Same thing with the original Lion King. A lot of famous actors when it comes to voicing these characters, but they were perfect for the roles. Now I feel like we're just putting famous actors in these roles just to put them in these roles. Look at the Lion King remake from 2019, for example. I'd say the worst part about that movie is Beyonce voicing Nala. And they purely put her in that role to say Beyonce's in this film, not because she's the best for the voice. Listen, I love Chris Pat. I thought he was great as Mario. But is he the best person we could find to voice Garfield? Probably not, but it's because he's Chris Pratt that he gets the role. I was watching Paw Patrol the movie the other day with my daughter. Paw Patrol the movie. If any movie should have mainly voice actors, is this one. Come to find out, Kim Kardashian voices one of the poodles. Listen, I'm not saying To not use famous actors. That sprinkle a little bit of voice actors in there as well.",

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

I'm sorry, do not all people with feet wear shoes? Oh, and for the record, King Lion and Aries weren't talking to each other. I can see how that might have been misconstrued, and I'm not really here nor there with either. I think the suits okay. I don't think it's bad. I don't think it's better than Henry Cavill's, but, uh, not the worst thing I've seen. what Aries said really had me thinking about him putting on his boots, and it gave me just one question. Why the hell is he slowly and casually putting on his boots as the world behind him is about to be destroyed? We are talking about a hero that is faster than the speed of light, and he just sitting there like, oh, my mommy gave me these boots. Let me put them on. It looks like a wormhole is opening up behind you. A black hole. Something not good is about to happen to the city, and the fastest man in the universe is casually saying, oh, let me just put my boots. On real quick. Get your ass out there and do something!

I hate him in every single movie that I've seen him in. I don't know if it's because he plays a bad guy in every movie, or it's just something about him that I just don't like. This was him in Pulp Fiction. This might have been the one that made me hate him first. This was when he was in the mask. Now, his role in Training Day wasn't that bad. He was. He was a crooked cop and everything, but he didn't take a main role. But I don't know, it's just something about his face that just makes me dislike his characters. I'm sure he's a nice person, but the characters that he plays. I mean, maybe that's credit to his acting skills, I don't know. But for sure, this was the one that made me hate him the most. When he was in Blue Street with Martin, fighting over that diamond. He double cross Martin. They were criminals trying to get this big diamond out of a building. New construction, and he wanted it all for himself. I'm glad what happened to him happened to him in that movie. But I don't know, there's other actors that are like that, too.

There are some great movies that we could have had sequels for, but because of how poorly they performed, we never got it. Here are some of my picks edge of tomorrow. Live, die, repeat. Whatever you wanna call it. This movie is fucking amazing. It's one of the best SCI fi movies we've had in the last 10 to 15 years. And it bombed hard. The marketing campaign for this movie was absolutely terrible. And while we are getting a sequel with Emily Blunt. Dude, we could have had a sequel two years after this movie came out with cruise and blunt both. And unfortunately we never got it. If you haven't seen this, which I think some of you have, fucking watch it. It's amazing. The Iron Giant is one of the best animated movies of all time. It is beautiful. It is touching, memorable, incredible in every way. And it bombed. Think this movie was just a weird mix up of like a Cold War story with of a story of like a budding friendship with an extraterrestrial coming from outer space. There was a lot going on in this movie. Also a mother son movie, a father son movie. There's so much going on, they didn't quite know how to market it. And it bombed. Treasure Planet was awesome. Dude, this Movie was so creative. It was so fun. I love the movie, the visuals. This movie is gorgeous. And it bombed. It should have done better. Next up is the best DCEU movie ever made, The Suicide Squad by James Gunn. Super fun, great pacing, great comedy, awesome characters. This movie should have done Better, Man. We could have gotten a direct sequel. This movie was great. We got peacemaker, which I'm very happy about. But yeah, we should have had more with this franchise. And finally, Battlefield Earth. A movie so terrible that it will make you laugh. It's so bad it's good. That's why I want more people to watch it. I wish it wouldn't have gone because it is so bad that it will make you laugh your ass off. And not in a good way, but yeah.",

And it's being reported that we're not gonna get season 5 until possibly midway through 2025. Listen, the appeal when this show first came out was that all these characters were kids. It had a certain charm to it. It has certain Goonies vibe to it. And now, nine years later, this is what Millie Bobby Brown looks like. Joe Keery is going on 32 years old. You're telling me this man's gonna be able to look like a high schooler or someone that's just fresh out of high school? Maya Hawke is off doing big things. Now. Caleb Mclaughlin's out here looking like a young Michael B. Jordan at this point. And listen, by the time the show hit season 5, it had been on for nine years, and it's only given us four seasons. Not only that, it's only given us four seasons and 34 episodes. You know what also happened in 2016? The invention of Pokemon Go. Harambe passed away, and, of course, Donald Trump became president. Listen, I love Stranger Things, but it's giving euphoria vibes at this point where the actors are just aging out of the fucking show.",

People forget that Connor Banks now will answer some mystery last questions for us. Let's go. Connor Banks. Right, Connor Banks. Connor Banks is number five. Beautiful. Three for three. I'm okay with Stevie Weeks. Now, like, if Connor Banks is five, people have Stevie Weeks. Pride of History. Stevie Weeks. Stevie Weeks is number six. Let's go. Alright, you're four for four. If this is a respectable list, Dean Young Bloods on it, we're gonna say Dean Young blood. Number four. Okay. Okay. Well done list. Oh, what about, um, the Iceland kid, Gunnar Stall. Number three. That was. Yeah, that had to be. All right, so you got the top six. I wanna go Gee, cause I actually think he's the best of everyone you've named. I think it'd be surprising if Goon was not represented on this list. Yeah. Okay, so we're gonna say Gila Flam. Yep. Number seven. Okay. Anyway, we're cooking Dad, I'm okay to toss a Charlie Conway. We might burn this. Well, who do you want over it? No, nobody. But I'm just saying he might not get the respect. Well, I don't know. He deserves the respect. Me neither. Me neither. Me neither. Charlie Conway, number ten. Oh, by the skin of our tad have. Do we show slapshot love? Yep. I think Ned's better, but I think Reggie is probably the one. People are saying more when they're surveyed. Interesting. No one's gonna pick one of the hands. No. Agree. Agree. And they said they suck. Reggie Dunlop, first strike. Did everybody play pop? There's no way that they produced a film where there's four skates on all the paws of a golden retriever. There's no way, bro. He glides. John B. No.9. God, that's so big for this thing right here. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine to go. Ned. Here now. Ned Braden. Strike two. Slot shot. Not represented. Not represented. No way it can be represented. Now, come on. I like Julie the cat. I mean, she doesn't even play, dude, but she's nasty. And we know she's, like, best goal in Maine. I'm gonna feel really bad if the women aren't represented on this list and I go with Fulton Reed.

So when the news broke out yesterday that The Maze Runner would be rebooted, I think a lot of fans had the same reaction. Why? And isn't it way too soon to do that? But looking at the details of this reboot, it's not going going to be them redoing the first three movies again. In the article, they actually say here, according to the sources, the reboot is not a redo of the story, nor is it a direct sequel to the original trilogy, which starred Dylan O'Brien. The hope is to make a sort of continuation of the story, yet also return to the elements that made the first movie connect with audiences. Even though it's being called a reboot, it's gonna be more of a sequel. And with them saying also that it's gonna focus more on elements of the first film, I'm thinking they're just gonna stick to people being trapped around a maze. I didn't watch the maze A trilogy until all three movies came out, and I was surprised only the first movie was about the maze. I'm like, this series is called Maze Runner. You only have one movie about the maze? Huh. It's like if Hunger Games only had one. Hunger Games and all the other movies never had it again. So we'll see how this turns out. Are you excited for a Maze Runner reboot",

Not only does it have one of the greatest opening scenes in comic book movie history, but the main reason people hate this movie is cause what they did to Deadpool. Which I get, but the Wolverine scenes are badass. Tom Holland's entire Spider Man trilogy is better than the entirety of the Sam Raimi trilogy. Except for Spider Man 2, which is better than every Tom Holland Spider Man movie. To continue with the Spider Man theme, Andrew Garfield is without a doubt the greatest Spider Man we have ever gotten. And news flash if you hate his character because he's too cool, Spider Man was cool in the comics. Ang Lee's Hulk is the greatest depiction of Hulk we have ever gotten, whether it's TV show or movie. This movie was so ahead of its time that if it came out today people would love it. When it comes to the MCU, people always talk about Iron Man, Thor, the Captain America trilogy. Guardians of the galaxy trilogy is hands down the greatest trilogy the MCU has ever given us. And yes, that includes the team up movies as well.",

They don't care that your babysitter didn't show up. They don't care that you just bought a house. This is coming from someone who sat on the executive board, with the CEO, with the C O O, with all of the higher UPS. They don't care. They don't care what you have going outside of work. It is about the result. It is about the deliverable. And the sooner you remove the emotion out of the work that you do, the further that you can go. Because when you start to think that they care if you had a bad day, then you give yourself an excuse to have a bad day. When you think that they hear that you're doing really well in your personal life, you give yourself an excuse. When you remove the emotion, you will go further. Show up, be passionate about the work that you were doing. If you are. If you don't care about the work you're doing, do the bare minimum, but take the emotion out of it. And stop people thinking that people care. It wasn't until I understood this that I doubled my salary and was able to get promoted. It sounds cold, but it's true.",

Much like a lot of y'all, the rock was my favorite wrestler growing up and I always would be like damn whenever he would make a movie back then. Like Walking Tall or uh, what's the other one he made? The Gridiron Gang. It was another movie, but I can't remember what it is right now. Is one he was with. He was in the jungle or some shit. Some shit like that. The rundown. That's what's called the rundown. And back then I was so blinded by the fact that he was my favorite wrestler, I was like, no matter what he does, the shit is good. However, growing up I realize not only is the rock like a mid tier actor, the shit that he has in all of his contracts when it comes to movies is straight blasphemy. Like, I didn't even know what the fuck a no loss clause was until I started to read up on what the fuck he had in this contract. Like there is literally a portion of the Contract that says he cannot suffer a major defeat in any movie he fucking stars in as long as he's like one of the head characters or some shit like that. And he does not do movies unless he is one of the head characters. And I'm like, bro, what the fuck is this? I can't remember exactly where I heard this, but I think it was on TikTok and somebody said this shit perfectly. The rock has main character syndrome like a motherfucker. And it is bad. And I can forgive all of this shit. I can forgive the no laws clause, the not want to get beat up on screen, the the shit that they say about them on said, all of this disagreement you be having with other act. I can forgive all of that shit if his movies weren't so fucking trash. I am for long past the point of accepting my favorite whoever being in a whatever and saying that it's cool just because I fuck with them. Outside of this new shit that they get into, the rocks movies suck Ass. He literally has zero fucking range. The rock has no range. And I don't care what nobody says, he literally plays the same character in every single movie and it frankly sucks. And for the first couple movies, long, big strong swole motherfucker rubbing baby oil on them in between scenes. That's cool for the first like two movies, but that like every Movie. You and you do the same shit. Made nobody try listen that shit. Get the fuck out of here.",

    "voice_to_text": "Are live action adaptations of shows ever a good thing? Take a look at all these live action movies slash shows adapted from animation. How many of them make you say I would rather watch the live action adaptation than the animated original? For me, Scooby Doo movies, maybe Ruroni Kenshin, and that's it. I don't give a crap about the rest. Compared to their animated counterparts, some of these are downright bad. And the good ones usually aren't better than the original animated show or movie. So why even bother with live action in the first place? Stupid reasons. For starters. 1. People like making money. We already know that most of Hollywood would rather produce a spin on an already beloved IP than create anything truly new. The latter is too much of a risk. God forbid you take risks in art. Art is about profit for shareholders. Second, I think some people view animation as a lesser medium for kids or adults that never grew out of their childlike interest, and that turning animation into live action can make it blockbuster worthy. Also, while I don't think that live action adaptations are made with Oscars in mind, I think it's interesting that over the span of 96 years, only three animated films have been nominated for Best Picture. Animation isn't always given the same respect that live action is. I can, however, think of two good reasons to adapt animation into live action. First, to open up The story to a wider audience, kind of catering to people that have the perspective I just mentioned. As much as I love animation, I know there's people that don't care to watch animated shows, but would probably love the story if it was presented to them in live action. Honestly though, I'm in favor of just encouraging more people to watch animated shows and movies. Second to tell a brand new story that takes place in the animated original universe. An example of this would be Scooby Doo. One of the potential reasons that the Scooby Doo movies were enjoyable is because they were written for live action. They didn't try to one to one recreate the most popular episodes of the animated show. However, I think there's some aspects of animated shows that are really hard to adapt to live action, like certain visual goofs, character designs, and the overall vibe, for lack of better words. Like a live action Adventure Time, no matter how good their CGI budget is, probably won't feel like Adventure Time. I think it's important when adapting from animation to live action to consider the differences and strengths of each medium and really think how could this story or these characters benefit from or be expanded upon in a live action setting? Because a one to one recreation of animation more often than not falls flat.",

So it's time for me finally set the record straight and give you the definitive list. Honorable mentions to Wolverine, Bob the Tribal Chief, Roman Reigns. A lot of these other characters are lucky they've been around longer. They've had time to cement their legacy. But when it's all said and done, you're going to acknowledge him. Death from Puss and boots, the last wish. I mean, come on now. When you hear that run! And last of the endless amount of honorable mentions, I have Han Solo. Taking off the top 20, we have King Kong, one half of the greatest kaiju pairing in history. Let me know the last time you saw a gigantic monster pull women like this guy did. Besides Victor women, Yama. 19 I have Master Chief, the silent assassin. There are few more noble and admirable that have lead me into battle than him. 18 I have Thanos. This man made grimace ball section look hard. Paul. He speaks in quotes and he decimated half the galaxy without breaking a sweat. 17 I have Jack Sparrow when it comes to Caribbean cool. And I'm not talking Carlito if you do it better than him. Pure embodiment of chill and vibes. And I look at that goatee. Come on! 16 I have the original vamp King blade. Who else is pulling off that pose realistically? 15, we have Don Michael Corleone delivering out hits like Italian sausages. He'll do anything for his family, so don't cross it. And just look at that pose. 14, we have the king in the North, Jon Snow. And I mean, when it comes to restoring faith and hope, I just look to this guy. What a man. And honestly, when it comes to Tam top aura moments, you have better than what I see here. 13, we have Caesar, and the longer I stare at this picture, the more regret I feel for not putting him higher. Oh my god. I'm not gonna lie. I just got sent to aura shot. 12, we have Margot, Radius, Naomi, and Wolf of Wall Street. And honestly, when it comes to going or for aura, I don't know, man. She might take it. A generation of men have not been the same since this dropped. I'm not gonna hold you. This the kind of woman you keep her picture on a locket when you go to war. And lastly, for this video at 11, I have Kratos, the ghost of Sparta. If you don't agree with this list thus far, watch your tone, boy."

    "voice_to_text": "Here are the five deadliest film sets ever. No. 5, The Wizard of Oz. Yes, the snow was his best Oz. Everyone knows that. But did you know the actors that played the Munchkins were extremely gropy and alcoholics? In fact, they borderline SA. Judy Garland several times, the actress playing the witch, caught fire during a scene and suffered severe and permanent burns. And Judy Garland was forced onto a diet of amphetamins and cigarettes so she would stay slim for the role. Also, the actor who played Toto the dog was paid more than any one of the munchkins. No.4, the omen. Basically, the production was haunted. The crew's plane was struck by lightning three times, two locations they visited were bombed by the IRA. And the special effects consultant, John Richardson, was in a car crash that killed his passenger. And when he got out of the car, he had crashed by a sign that said Omen 66.6. And it was Friday the 13th. No. 3, the Conqueror and how it killed 46 members of the crew. This film is a bit dated. You can tell because John Wayne depicted a Mongol chief like this. But this film was shot down wind from a nuclear testing site. The director, the crew and the the actors all developed cancer, which resulted in 46 early deaths. It was so bad that John Wayne's children visited the set for a single day, saw their dad in yellow face and Then both developed cancer, like, immediately. No.. 2, raw. This movie was shot with 150 untrained lions, tigers and other predators. Of course, there were many incidents. Tippy Hendron was bitten by a lion, needing 38 stitches. Melanie Griffith had her face mold, needing 50 stitches. And the cinematographer was scalped by a lion before No.. 1. Real quick, if you like fucked up shit like this, please drop me a follow. It really helps me out. Thank you. So No.. 1, the catastrophic Noah's art. The director was completely inexperienced in filmmaking. Regardless, he was giving a huge budget and told to make something big. So when it came to the big blood scene in Noah's Ark, he said no to using miniatures, which is the standard for doing big set pieces like this. Instead, he said, fuck it and use 600,000 gallons of water. Three extras drowned during the filming. Another one needed their leg amputated, and dozens of others suffered broken bones and various injuries.",

This is Restaurant Iris, located inside of a floating art installation called The Salmon Eye, nestled within the breathtaking Norwegian fjords. To get there, you take an electric boat with fellow Extreme Foodies, which first stops at the Chef's Boathouse, where you served a couple of amazing bites and a glass of local cider. Then after another short ride, it's time for the main event, dining inside of the Salmon Eye. The entire experience is a journey beginning under the water surface, literally complete with a thematic seaweed crisp that you collect yourself, and a dreamy sea urchin moose, their version of chips and dip, to welcome you into their space. You then move upstairs and into the lounge for a few more incredible bites. Next, more amazing dishes take center stage at a table with breathtaking views. Each dish had a story inspired by the surrounding nature, from the mountains to the ocean, and all the ingredients are sourced as locally as possible. Then it's time to wind down back in the lounge with tea, coffee and chocolates before heading back to reality. Goodbye, Iris. Until next time."

If you don't remember the plot of Crazy Super Love, it falls this couple, played by Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, that are on the brink of divorce. Steve curls characters trying to get his mojo back. So he links up with this suave ladies man of a guy, played by Ryan Gosling. But throughout the film, this kind of like a side plot where Ryan Gosling's character meets a girl, played by Emma Stone. They fall in love, yada, yada, yada. But that's not the plot twist. It's where we get towards the end of the film. Where Emma Stone's character invites Ryan Gossing's character to, like, a family get together barbecue to meet the parents. And it's at that moment where we realize that Steve Carell's character is Emma Stone's character's dad. Gonna give us this amazingly hilarious reveal. Jacob, it's so nice to meet you.

    "voice_to_text": "Kung Fu Panda Exact says that Hollywood is at a loss about anime successes. Hollywood should not be at a loss at why anime is so successful. It is a very simple answer. Because the only thing that anime creators care about is telling a good story, giving their characters proper growth, proper arcs, cool action, funny moments, things that their audience wants. They know their audience, and they give their audience what they want. So Hollywood should not be confused about this, because yet again, it's very, very simple. It's like business 1:01. Okay, when you're starting any kind of business, what is your job as a business? Just in general? Your job as a business is to please your consumer. So your consumer gives you money, which then makes the business, what, everyone? Profit. So I don't understand how this is so mind boggling to Hollywood. It's just that Hollywood is so caught up in their own little bubble that they, like, forgot, like, hey, us, we. We right here. You have to please us. We're the ones giving you money. You don't please us, you're not getting any money. They are pleasing us, so they are getting our money. There's a reason why anime and manga is beating out American animation and beating out American comic books by, like, a lot, mind you, not like, by a little margin, by a lot. Specifically in the comic book, like, you know, area. It is insane. Manga is destroying American comic books. And this is for a very simple reason. Because, again, manga, anime, all they care about is giving us fans what we want. And that is entertaining, fun stories with good characters, good arcs, great moments, heartbreaking moments, moments that make us cheer. Like they're just. They. All I care about is the story. You know what Iger was saying about Disney a little while ago? Like, we got to focus on storytelling, not messaging. That's all manga ever does is like, this is a cool story. Is it gonna be fun? Are they gonna like it? Okay, yes. Okay, then make it like that. Simple. So simple. This is not rocket science, people. There's no reason why Hollywood should be confused about anime success, or even manga. Because, again, the answer is simple. Just make it entertaining, good stories, all we want."

I believe Quentin Tarantino to be one of the worst, most detrimental and destructive filmmakers to ever make films. And that's not because not any of his films are bad, per se, but the influence that they've had is, like, tremendously bad. See, in the 90s, um, a bunch of filmmakers came up in the indie scene. Steven Soderberg, Richard Linklater, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Quinn Tarantino. And out of all of those new indie directors, Tarantino was the one that took off. And now, as a result, everyone wants to make a cool briefcase movie or do a trunk shot or make the next Reservoir Dogs. I like to imagine A World War slacker and Bottle Rocket by Richard Linklater and Wes Anderson, respectively, inspired annoying film guys to rip off their styles in class enough for Richard Linklater style of mundane dialogue than Tarantino's to be ripped off. And, you know, West Andersen's easy to understand aesthetics are a lot more interesting than Tarantino's just unnecessary violence. And it's sad to me to imagine, like, what could have been.

So for those of you don't know, Sierra Leone is on the west coast of Africa, and they are currently facing an epidemic where there's a drug called Kush that being used all over and manufactured partly by using human bone. This is causing people to come rob graves and steal the bones of buried people. Apparently the drug is pretty cheap to manufacture, just requires one specific ingredient that requires people to steal bones from old cemeteries, in which case the government has actually had to beef up security at cemeteries to stop this problem. And this drug creates sort of a hypnotic high, as ones would describe. They said this drugs first started being produced around six years ago in their country. And the epidemic of users and the increase in grave robberies has skyrocketed since. The doctors are also seeing an increase of around 4,000% of deaths due to organ failures, which is a direct result of this drug use.",

Like is no one else find that shit weird as hell? And before you weird ass lolly loving kid touches coming to the comments talking about some well if they're actually 3,000 years old, then they're actually not children. Motherfucker, you need to be investigated. And all the dumbass technicalities that these motherfuckers use to try and skirt around a clearly obvious little girl's age by just like, magically making that bitch like 32,000 years old is genuinely wild as shit. Like these fucking EDP 4 4 5 will literally show a six year old child get given ferocious fucking back shots going 137 miles per hour. But it's magically okay because turns out that little girl is actually 127,000 years old. Yeah my ass. More like 127,000 fucking terabytes. Like what are you talking about? And then these fucking kid dealers will also try to make the case that it's okay because it's just pictures and drawings. Oh yeah motherfucker, welcome to the James Charles under 18 Club. You're a VIP member. And what's even worse is that that's just not even true anymore because these motherfuckers in Japan Are starting to make lolly in real life. Like these fucking weirdos who made this Japanese AV video where they hired an 18 year old actress to play as a 12 year old school girl when she gets fucked by her teacher. The fuck? Why? And what makes this shit even worse is that you can buy this shit in like literally almost every store in Japan. Like there are 18+ sections in like certain gas stations. No, fucking insane that is. You could be going in, just wanted to get a yogurt, and you'll look to the side and there will be about three gross motherfuckers just in that section just ferociously beating their meat while looking at little children. Also, I do these motherfuckers have zero shame at all too. Imagine the embarrassment you feel when you have to open that curtain up and walk out the 18+ section holding a lolly hand tight in your fucking hand. And you have to walk over to the cashier and hand that shit to him with cash in hand. Are you serious? Well, I don't know about you, but if I'm that cashier, I'm fucking fighting you. Like, I don't wanna start any beef, but like, you're telling me that's not a reason? Like, maybe we should send nuke number three? Fuck it. Oh, but hey, at least Japan has good technology.",

    "voice_to_text": "What if the machines are actually just caretakers for the human race and we are in the matrix on purpose? It's not hard to imagine that the earth has been plundered of all its resources due to centuries of overpopulation and harm to the environment. What if the humans created a race of machines to be caretakers while they rebuilt the world? The matrix is essentially the internet and we wanted to be plugged into it on purpose to maintain some form of existence and survival. While the machines went to work, there was a small rebellious group of humans who said, I don't wanna live like that. So they figured out how to get away so they can start waging war against the matrix. They attempt to unplug other humans to get them to join their revolution. The machines fight back as they're programmed to do to save human life. Agents are even created to fight back against these rebels. Morpheus is actually a bad guy and the leader of this rebellion. His ship is called the Nebuchanezzar. This is the name of the king of Babylon, the same king responsible for enslaving and destroying his people. The opposite being Zion. Morpheus has developed these lies and stories in an effort to get people to join his revolution. Orpheus is also the name of the Greek god of dreams. His evil job is keeping people convinced the machines are evil and that they need to escape. Essentially putting you Into a dream world when you leave the matrix, which is actually the real world and what humans wanted."

She slams the source material, saying that this new movie is going to be made for more women empowerment and less for the male gay. But this is just what's ridiculous to me. What even is the male gays being attracted to women? How god made men, so she said here. So what I can tell about Red Sonya is that the first ones and the comics were made with a very male gazed orientation. This is a completely different story, and it's very women empowering, which I loved about the script. So can women not be empowered if men are attracted to them? None of this seems to be out of actual care for women, because let's be real, the marketed audiences, you know, in the US or your Europe or wherever, men already respect women. I know there is this narrative that men hate women and all that, but if they hated women, why would they even watch it in the first place? This all just seems like a deeper agenda to me and what we're constantly seeing and the demonizing of the male gaze. And while I don't promote creating just a bunch of lustful material that is promoting degeneracy, I do think that this concerted effort in female characters that we see in gaming or even movies where they're taking beautiful actresses and ugifying them, is all an effort to demonize part of God's natural design. And that is for men to be attracted to women and women to be attracted to men. So, honestly, I'm just so over it with this male gaze bull crap. Of course men are attracted to women. Newsflash. Come back at 11 for the next update."

Welcome to the Fantasy Annexe. There's an argument to be made that no one fully understood how crucial it was to destroy the ring. But I think that's debatable. There are more impactful reasons for Elrond's actions. For one, by the time Sauron is defeated, the elves and humans had been fighting in the War of the Last Alliance against him for over 10 years. I think it's very fair to assume that Elrond and Isildur are close by the end of this war. On top of that, Isildur is Elrond's nephew, a few generations removed. You gonna ask him to take out a family member like that? If you're ignoring their relationship, consider the politics. Elrond and Isildur are the highest ranking members of the elven and human armies, respectively. If word got out that Elrond killed Isildur, the political ramifications would be devastating. It may have even started a second war, this time between elves and humans. If none of those reasons are good enough, then I ask you this. At the end of Return of the King, Frodo and Sam find themselves in a similar situation when Frodo refuses to destroy the ring. Do we legitimately think Sam would have or should have pushed Frodo into Mount Doom? Just because we didn't see Elrond and Isildur\u2019s story and struggle doesn't mean that we can expect Elrond to have done any different than Sam. Follow for more fantasy content.",

Last time they gave us a Michael Jackson movie, we got Flex Washington and powder. Like, make it make sense. Like, now, I have to say, I'm really excited for this one. I think what's gonna make it different is that his nephews actually playing him. So when it's, like, the family's involved, it's gonna be accurate. It's gonna be good. Like, look how. Like what? Like, I wouldn't even be able to tell that that was not him. Excellent. Also, the cast that they're picking, like, I would have thought that was Joe and Catherine right up in there. I wasn't sure how it's gonna feel about me along playing a role like that. I just feel like she always plays, like, the it girl. Rolls, but girl slaying. I can't wait to see this. As I told y'all before, we got to get. We got to get her for Janet. I'm excited to see y'all give me a good suggestion for, like, Elizabeth Taylor. This could work. This could really work.

No one tried to break it up, no one to go get security, nothing, bro. They just watch this man get beat up though. And then these people just got back in line like nothing happened. I'm watching like, the dude gets up and tests himself off and just walks off. I thought I was like stuck in a simulation cause everybody was mad, everybody's pissed off, but no one really acknowledged the beatdown. They just acknowledge that. Yeah, he's a messed up person for saying that. I was kind of news. Like the Marvel scene, that's the day I Realized. Yeah. You don't. You don't. Don't mess with these guys and these nerds.
