Let me show you the viral J Lo moment that lives rent free in our brains for the rest of time. And what was your go to order at the Bodega? My go to order at the Bodega was ham and cheese on a roll with an orange drink, if you know, you know, and a small bag of chips. J. Lo did an interview with Harper's Bazaar where she explained the orange drink. Interviewer asked, what was the viral orange deli drink? Because we've all been trying to figure it out. And Jlo said, haha, I know there's been a lot of talk about it, but the orange drink was basically, it's just a plain orange drink. It came in a little plastic container with a little bit of aluminum foil over it. And it wasn't called anything except orange drink or grape drink or whatever. There was orange, a grape, and a fruit punch. And that's why I said, if you know, you know, because you bought it in the Bodega, and it used to go after school and get that for like. I mean, this was many, many years ago. It was worth 25 cents, and I got it with a bag of potato chips, and that was like my after school treat for myself. Even though she didn't call it the quarter water drink in the interview, It was clearly the quarter water drink. If you know, you know",

What do you mean by that? I was a hoe. I was doing a lot of women that I shouldn't have been doing, that I had a family that I could deal with. So I was just out there doing, you know, anybody. Not like that, but I was just picking and choosing what I wanted, who I wanted, because I had a little reputation here in Springfield, and that got me a lot of things, and especially a lot of women. And I regret using them and, you know, regret using who I was. Wow. So you would have not, like, smash the women? I wouldn't have smashed them like I did, no. What would you would have did? What would I would have done? Stay with my one son's mother and been married and been happy. Today, you know, that's probably a regret that I've gotten over. But I would still be with her because I still have some great feelings for her in my heart, but I know how to navigate through that. But I wouldn't have been the whole that I was back then. So what made you be a hoe? It was ingrained in me. My uncle was a hoe. My grandfather was a hoe. My brothers was hoes. My Cousins was hoes. I'm sorry. Might not sound right. My mama was a hoe. I'm telling the truth. You know, say six kids by five different men. Know that qualify",

Their crab traps that normally come in loaded with snow crab and king crab are coming up empty this year. The crabs have mysteriously vanished from the bearing sea off the coast of Alaska, where the popular discovery show is filmed. The population has plummeted from 8 billion in 2018 to just 1 billion today. And now the fishing season has been cancelled. So what happened to the snow crabs? There are several theories. They died from disease. They ate each other. They moved north to colder Russian waters because of climate change. This likely causes because of the heat and the increased temperatures in the ocean. The disappearing crabs means the price of crab legs are soaring across the USA. At Benjamin Steakhouse in Manhattan. Here we go. Look at that. Would you believe customers pay $119 for just two king crab legs? How much have prices gone up? It went up, uh, like hundred percent. Went up 100%. Wow. The crab is served chilled with butter and lemon. And if you love the delicious delicacy, grab them now because they soon may be very expensive and very hard to find. Ooh ha ha ha! Real."

What leverage does a customer have over a very seasoned worker who wants to do the right thing for the company and right thing for the customer? Yeah, I mean, look, the whole thing is kind of crazy to me. It is. We've always said we wanna give people great portions, wanna give them what they want, and our team members. You've not shrunk the portion? No, no, we never have. Like, from the beginning of time with Chipotle, I think there were billboards that said, burritos as big as your head. Like, that's never changed. And our teams, they are focused on giving people what they want. So the whole thing's a little silly. It actually kind of really bums me out when people frankly do this videoing thing, because it's like, it's a little rude to our team members and, you know, our team members, their desires to give our customer a great experience.

I fucking told myself it was gross, and I was gross. I'm fucked. I was doing so good, but a bet to bet. Oh, my god. Just kidding. Whoa! I was thinking this was gonna be some fun, refreshing snack.

    "voice_to_text": "It's time to grab your friends, grab a date, grab some binoculars, because on June 3rd, there's going to be a huge planetary alignment in the sky. That means six planets, all of them except Venus, are going to be visible at the same time. Because planets all travel at their own speeds and in their own orbits, it's special when they all appear in the same part of the sky. So you can see earth is here, all of the other planets are on the other side of the sun. The planets will appear in what seems like a pretty straight line. Not because they're really in a straight line in space, but because they all orbit on a pretty flat disc of our solar system called the eclipsed. You'll be seeing the disc of the solar system. That line is where there used to be a ring of stuff around the sun that the planets formed out of. So I think that's really cool to look at. You can look up specifics about exactly where and when to look. But in general, about an hour before sunrise, wherever you are, look towards the eastern horizon. And you will need binoculars to see Uranus and Neptune. But you'll be able to see the rest without them. And I always think it's helpful to use any free stargazing app to point you in the right direction. The same year as the giant Aurora's and the solar eclipse. We are so lucky.",

Some farms had no running water or toilet facilities. Gotcha. So they were shitting on the food. Gotcha. Yeah, very good. How you get sick?

    "voice_to_text": "So I have made a rather bold claim stating that Light Yagami from Death Note is a dumbass. But now to back up my claims, let's talk about what he could have done better. We're starting off with lights biggest mistake in the series establishing patterns. You have a magic book that can kill anyone in just about any way you want. You should not ever be caught. But light is built a little bit different. He intentionally establishes a pattern because he wanted people to know that someone was out there punishing criminals. And that brings us to lights second mistake. Punishing criminals. If you are trying to reshape society, killing random criminals isn't going to do that. The idea that criminals will stop doing crime because they're scared of being killed by god is just straight up a bad plan. Because fun fact, that's not how crime works. If you really wanna reshape society, you don't kill criminals. You kill billionaires, politicians, world leaders, the people who actually control society. If you are strategically picking who you are killing, that would also solve the next problem light had. The number of times he used the death note. He killed way too many people way too fast, and it was impossible for people not to notice. Again, that was part of his plan. And that is again, dumb. If you gain access to the death note, you need to limit yourself. Personally, I wouldn't use it more than once. A month. Because the more you use it, the more likely you are to intentionally or unintentionally establish a pattern that will lead right back to you. And then finally, Light's fourth mistake, that I think is his second biggest mistake. He kept killing people related to him. Specifically, he tried to kill L right after he was called out on TV. He killed the police officer that was assigned to tail him. And he, generally speaking, killed anyone that he thought was getting too close to figuring out who he is. That is a guaranteed, sure fire way to make sure that everyone knows it's you. So, to recap for light and anyone else who might find themselves in the possession of a death note. Number one, do not, under any circumstances, ever establish a pattern. Number two, you need to pick and choose who your targets are carefully. Number three, you need to spread out those targets so that no one notices that people are being killed. And number four, do not, under any circumstances, kill people who are connected to you in any way at all. It is a magical book that kills people with no evidence. You should not ever be getting caught. If you get caught using a death note, it's because you're a dumbass.",

Do not get confused. Long term, ain't nobody looking at your body, your booty, your face, your makeup, your outfit, none of that type of shit. The only thing that matters is if you have substance. And in this world, a lot of women do not be having shit to talk about. Talkative women be funny as hell, and they make dinner dates fun again. Because for a long time, I used to hate going to dinner for a date because the only thing that's entertaining me is the food. When you got a woman who can just go on a rant about any topic at any moment, I promise you, that's the greenest flag there is. Because a lot of motherfuckers be be silent when it comes to actually having to hold a conversation. Call me old school, but nothing displays your creativity more than the conversation. Because anybody who can come up with something to talk about, a joke, a rebuttal, all of these type of things in real time, is the person that I want to be around. I promise you, all of that other shit means absolutely nothing to me. I'm saying that to say, if you run into a woman who absolutely cannot shut the fuck up, merrier and merrier.

They're transporting the drugs to the DEA, where they will be destroyed. So go ahead and take a look at some video of what I'm talking about. We were just on that ship a little while ago and got to walk around and get a up close look at these drugs. At stacks and stacks of drugs, at the bales. You see, this is exactly how they were wrapped when they were seized from different vessels. So this is a result of eight different suspected drugs smuggling interdictions off the coasts of Mexico and central and South America from late February to late March. Now, wholesale value is about 470 million dollars. So that's just if it's sold as is when I mentioned. When it's cut down and mixed with other substances and sold off. The rear Admiral Andy Sugimoto says the value is closer to 2 billion when this gets out for distribution. The violence, it's a part of this. Overdoses that are a part of this. All of those associated disruptive factors. Not"

First off, I wanna say that my representation has been fantastic. I've had to do next to nothing. Um, he's been gathering the evidence, he's been filing paperwork, he's been keeping me updated on everything that's going on. So I wanna say that, you know, working with this man has been fantastic.

We've talked about what could potentially happen here for a lot of years, but it looks like some critical stuff going down. If you don't know, we have an incident just took place outside of Fort Liberty, former Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. We have two illegal migrants that were spying on Special Forces colonel, snapping photos of his family and his kids. And he caught them. It was competition. He shot and killed one of them. This is a big deal, because other colonels, other people are going on, like Fox News, and they're saying that this is a huge threat. They're in here, they're spying on our top level generals at their homes here in this country, and now they've been engaged. They go on to say that here in this country, these illegal migrants are showing up and our military facilities two to three times a week. A week? That brazen, whoever was just ignoring it, right? Two or three times a week, they're showing up at our military bases, and they're getting turned away. Now, the ones that are showing up at the basis are showing up acting like they're trying to document for some kind of. Whatever excuse they give. They do have passports, the ones that show up there, and they seem to be the forward unit of this invasion of Course, we know there's millions in here at this point. They are also state that they are rolling up on our basis with drones, two to three times a week. Incursions. So our bases are getting infiltrated by drones and these dudes rolling up on them in packs. And they're rolling up on our kernels at their homes, spying on them. Hello? How much more are. Are people waiting for? What are you waiting for? Them to show up at your house taking pictures like, dude, you better get ready. You better get it already locked and loaded. Everything that you got. You better get with your neighbors. You better get plans together. They're here. Enemies here. Cause you've been sold out. They brought them here. So you better get the training. Better be taking your extra time, your extra money. You better get ready. This ain't no joke. They're here just like they rode in the Trojan horse and at night they sprung. It's like they're waiting for their moment. And once it begins, there ain't no going back. This country will never be the same. You better get ready. I'm warning you. I'm warning you, I'm warning you. I'm warning you. It's that time. So y'all better be prepping full scale. Better be training. You better be training. You better be getting with your people. You better be doing everything it takes right now, while you got the time. Before time's up, we got a big event coming. And as soon as a series of events goes into motion, it's like Domino's, one after another, and it won't stop. So a heads up here, I'm gonna leave some links below. Make sure to check out the video clip on my Twitter as well. You can hear from the colonel's mouth talking with an admiral on their Navy. Admiral talking about what's going on.",

And when everyone asked her, what was it? She basically said, sugar, spice, and everything nice. This pink sauce still scares me to this day because she was able to get away with selling a sauce that looked like this and told us to buy at our own risk because it wasn't government approved. And then people started ending up in the hospital because of it. This is Chef P, and. Oh, did she have a problem? She was selling a sauce that caused botulism. It's okay. I didn't know what it was either. Botulism is a poisoning bacteria that was found in her sauce. Let me add that all the sauce was being made inside her house at the time. This should have been obvious from the get go, because people were noticing that their bottle of pink sauce wasn't even pink. It would come out a different color every time. And her reasoning behind this was because the bottle was getting too much light, and in a lot of cases, the sauce would literally explode by the time people got it because of the bacteria from her ingredients. And if anyone's curious what it tastes like, because I know I was, the taste is basically sweet and sour sauce mixed with ranch. You could tell she had to stop selling this stuff because she Would have ended up in either a class action lawsuit or jail. That's when she teamed up with a real company to sell her sauce the right way in stores like Walmart. But right after this claim she was scammed out of all the money and had to start a gofundme because she claimed she ended up homeless. But it was found out she wasn't actually scammed, but instead just spent all of her money. And at this point the company wanted nothing to do with her. You can actually find the pink sauce nowadays sitting inside a Dollar Tree. But if you thought this was finally over, she just came out with the blue sauce."

    "voice_to_text": "Is Jupiter a failed star? Was it supposed to be a star? What we know as failed stars are called brown dwarfs, which form like a star, but they're not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion. So they're not bright and hot like a star. And these brown dwarfs are only a little bit bigger than Jupiter. Jupiter's almost there. And Jupiter is huge. It's the biggest planet in our solar system. But it's not even close to the biggest planet ever discovered. There are planets up to 13 times more massive than Jupiter. And even those aren't browned dwarfs. Stars and browned dwarfs form from clouds of gas in space that gets so massive that they collapse under their own pressure and it collapses into a star or a brown dwarf. And so most of that stuff becomes the star in our solar system. Almost 99.9% of all of the mass in the entire solar system. So after that collapse, a ring forms around the star of dust and gas, and that's how planets form. These gaps here. This is a real photo. These gaps are where planets have brought all of that material together to form a planet. And to my knowledge, we have never seen a planet accumulate enough mass to even become a brown dwarf, which is a failed star and definitely not a star star. Oh, no, Jupiter's not a failed star. It didn't form like a star. It never decided to become a star. It's just a big planet and we love him.",

    "voice_to_text": "The TikTok filter behind me is currently going viral all across TikTok. And the reason as to why it is is for a very wild reason. Now there is a 0% chance that I actually use the filter in my video, because if I did, my video would get taken down immediately and I might even lose my account. So I'm not taking the risk. But pretty much if you go on the filter, this is what it looks like. And then you're supposed to actually click on the image right here. When you click on that image while you're on the filter, a very, let's just say, not so PG video of very popular musician Drake ends up, you know, playing on the filter, and let's just say, you know, he is playing with a certain body part. Now, I have no idea how the filter is still on TikTok, because like I said, it's not very PG at all, and thousands of people are using it. And thousands of people are just getting left speechless after they're seeing the video of Drake, you know, playing with a certain body part in the video. If you yourself would like to go play the filter yourself and see what everyone is talking about, this is the filter name right here, all the way up at the top. And this is the creator's name that actually created the filter. It is definitely pretty wild. Once again, I don't know how it's Still on TikTok. I'm so sorry to Drake that this is even on TikTok. And I'm just really curious to know your thoughts about all this.",

I went with this spam like meat that I really love. It's kind of hard to get out and spread it out, so I always do this with my hands. Use a generous amount as this gives the pizza its taste. Now to give it a nice touch and color, add some corn. And if you really want this real authentic Italian experience, add some canned fish as well. You can use tuna or sardines or any kind of fish. Now to give it a nice color and fresh taste, add some cucumber slices. And of course, don't forget to add a generous amount of grated cheese. Don't hesitate to put a lot. To finish it off, I always put on some cheddar cheese, providing a creamy texture that blends nicely with the other ingredients. Finish it off! Use some butter to impress your guests even more. Microwave it for around 10 to 15 minutes until everything is fully cooked in golden brown. When it's ready and crispy, be careful not to burn yourself, so make sure you are using Protection. Let's cut off a slice and see how it tastes. Can y'all rate this result on a scale of 1 to 10 please? I really did my best this time.",

A few weeks later, I took another pregnancy test. They told me it was positive. I spent my 19th birthday in Clayton County Jail. I didn't get out till I was nine months pregnant. I didn't experience no gender reveal. It was COVID, man. Just chasing the wrong stuff. Ain't had no business doing what I was doing. You get what I'm saying? And I've been getting face tattoos forever, like, since I was a kid, for real. And I used to be like, man, no matter, brother. Shit ain't whatever. Whatever. And, yeah, I regret my face tattoos. I want to get it removed. I went. I went to the appointment. Everything is $5,000 to remove my face tattoos, right? And once I finish paying off my probation, the judge will drop all my charges. I will no longer be a convicted felon. I get my face tattoos removed, I have a fresh start. I'm gonna do it right this time. I swear. I swear I'm gonna do it right this time. I don't live that other life, and it ain't for me. I'm telling you, like, I don't want that for me no more. I want that for my child. I don't been shot. I don't been attempted to be robbed. I just. I don't. Went through the whole nine, bro. I Don't post it up on the block. I did my dirt, you get what I'm saying? And I can't take none of it back. But I. I can't change what I do now. So my next goals, right for right now, is to get my probation terminated, clean my background up, get my face tattoos removed. And from there, I see what life take me. But right now, I'm dedicated, I'm determined. Nothing nobody can say can stop me. All of this. This is a story I could really guide and mentor a lot of young people. I really can't, cause I've been through the whole nine"

    "voice_to_text": "This man's darkened skin color is at the heart of a jaw dropping mystery. This is his normal complexion seen in a photo with his wife, and now he's several shades darker. What's happening here? You can see my sand tan right there from my watch. Like I'm dark, but he is literally like pencil gray. What is going on here? This is my hand. Every year my skin just seemed to get blacker and darker and blacker and then more darker. Monk told Inside Edition today that his complexion began to slowly change after he started taking the antidepressant Prozac last year. How scary to see your own skin change color like that. It's pretty scary. It's just stressful not knowing really what's going on and why my situation hasn't improved. We have found two other guys that have the same thing as him."

I would rather be subjected to gay gays inhumane ideas when it comes to jujutsu Kaisen then have to sit through a single episode of fairy tale. This is still going on? I could not tell you. I dropped this entire show after the fifth episode. It is quite literally the same thing over and over and over again. I don't care if it gets better later on. When you say that, I can only assume considering it's fairy Tale, it gets good around season 5. I'm not even sure if Fairy Tale has five seasons, but I'll tell you this much, I'm not willing to find out. And the fact that this whole thing is trending on Twitter right now is crazy. And the glaze for this show itself is astronomical. People are already claiming it's going to be the anime of the year, as if it's ever been the anime of the year and it's entire existence. There is no hope for this. I don't care who's working on it. Fairy tale is about as predictable as wondering if the Sun's gonna come up in the morning. We already know it's going to. And in this case, we know it's terrible. There was quite literally no substance, any of this at all. I couldn't care less that there was a new season coming out. Nothing about this will change. Nothing. It's still as bad as it was In the first episode, as it is in the last episode of whatever this is.",

Um, usually I hand my passport, which is in my dead name, and they look at it, and they look at me, and they look at the passport, look at me, and I'm like, I'm trans. And there I go. Okay, another what does that mean? Yeah. Today I'm like, you did the same thing. You looked at me with the passport, looked at me with the passport, and then had a quizzical look on his face. And I said, I'm trans. He's like, what does that mean? I had to explain what trans was, and then he's like, okay, so stamp my passport. And we moved on. Now we're getting lattes and a muesli, and we are off to our safari. I do national park. Hopefully seeing most of the big five. And that's what we're doing today. So hope you all have a great day.

We're still using it. So I click into it cause I'm like, who is this from? I follow a lot of these types of people because I run my own business. I have for three years, and honestly, for the past two, I haven't been able to check a lot of them cause I'm so busy. So I look up Sam Ross on TikTok. I follow her, but I don't recognize her. So I'm guessing it's, you know, TikTok just not showing me her stuff. Don't really align with her stuff at this point in time. I'm guessing she didn't exactly teach about what she teaches about now way back when I started following her, but this made me irate. I literally opened it and I was like, I. This can't be right. Like, I thought for sure that it was gonna be like, she heard the word used and she wanted to comment on how horrible it was and integrate that. No, no, she just wanted to say this. And I took a quick scan over the rest of the email, and there was nothing acknowledging this whole thing. Also, I don't even think it would be appropriate to use this as a clickbait to then talk about how that word is not appropriate. Like, I think there's other ways to do that, because I don't even want it typed out. Like, that's just me. Like, I'm dumbfounded and can't believe this. Like, this is horrible. Do better."

First of all, I was lying to teach somebody a lesson. I had a friend named Amber who was a liar. She wasn't even my friend. She's just a girl in my class. But she kept lying. I was like, i'mma get her back, and i'mma lie to her. So I told Amber that I had a twin sister named Amanda. And then my teacher was like, Shawty, you have a twin? I wasn't gonna let up. I had to keep the lie going. Yeah, I got a twin now I really dragged it out. I said I had another twin who went to a magnet school in our district. She was 10 times more than me. That's the only reason why we didn't go to the same school. Teacher felt so bad. She was like, Shawty, you're so smart. So is your sister. You guys should be in the same school together to make your mom's life easier. I thought she was just being sweet. So I kept bringing in pictures of me as a baby. And I was like, this is her. This is me. This is her. This is me. I don't know why she believed me. As an adult woman, why would you believe a 7 year old girl saying this? Anyways, I kept this lie going for Like, maybe two months. Some days I'd come in with, like, my hair different way, just to keep the lie going, you know? I thought at some point, my teacher knew I was joking, but I wasn't lying to her. I was lying to my classmate Amber. Anyways, parent teacher conference comes up. Had good grades. I thought I was smooth. I come home, my mom's like, Shawty, who's Amanda? I. My whole body was shaking up. I cried, I cried, I cried. And you know what I did to get out the situation? I lied again. My mom was like, why would you lie about this? At the time, my little brother did not live with us. He was staying with my grandma. I was like, I just miss my brother so much. I was just making up siblings. And my mom didn't believe me again. Like, I was a pathological liar. I don't lie no more, because clearly I was really. Get away with that shit, but, yeah.

It's a spin off that arguably isn't as good as the original. Like, I don't think I could ever get rid of Jesse and keep bunked. And another thing, bumped is a show that's more for the new generation. Only really watch this show until the Ross kids left, which was like the first three seasons. As we all know, the show had many seasons after that. Along with it, a whole new cast. Show I can't get rid of under any circumstances. Kicking it. Like, kicking it has to stay though. Jesse and Austin and ally are childhood classics. Disney Channel at that time had a lot of hits. Like, I watched almost everything on the channel. If I didn't have Austin and ally and Jesse, I would have had Good Luck. Charlie, shake it up, dog with a blog, Ant Farm. Kicking it was one of the top shows on Disney XD and I mean it when I say that my childhood wouldn't be the same without this show. Same with lab rats. Like, both of these were top tier. Which leaves us with the difficult decision, which show am I gonna keep? Austin and ally or Jessie? What do you even choose? I think at the end of the day, I'm gonna have to go with Jessie. As much as I wanna say both, Jessie was just on a different level. It was always wild, it was always crazy. Something was always going on. From Jessie, I experienced people that followed me through the rest of my life. For instance, I still see Peyton List and stuff to this day. Then I wouldn't wanna not experience camera boy. So I'm gonna have to go with Jessie."

And the company, Disney, is losing $4 billion due to streaming losses. And the reason is very simple, guys. Doesn't take a genius to understand this one, right? A. A Ray fan, a Disney Star Wars fan will understand this one. The reason why Disney lost $4 billion is because these geniuses over at Disney, instead of focusing on characters that we actually like, on stories that we actually like, they made a Little Miss Marvel show, they made a shield show, right? They made an entire episode on the Mandalorian above freaking Lizzo. That's why these geniuses are losing billions, right? It's because they're making these stupid, woke decisions, you know, that nobody wants. Nobody wanted to see Lizzo in. In Star Wars, period, right? Nobody. Nobody was out here looking for a little Miss Marvel show or a shield show. Bro, seriously, just give the people what you want, Disney, and you're gonna make the big bucks. I guarantee you. But as long as you keep doing this woke crap right here, you're gonna keep losing. Because, hey, the real fans, the real Star Wars fans, we're not watching"

    "voice_to_text": "Here are all the problems with Assassin's Creed Shadows. There ain't no way I'm paying anywhere from $70 to $130 for this freaking game. Like, what the fuck? But hey, if I want a three day early pass and to join Ubisoft to pay another, you know, 1799 a month, you know I can do this one too. I guess you came here cause you thought I was gonna be talking shit about these two MC's. Now we're gonna talk shit about anything pertaining to this game and needs to be the fact that Ubisoft is trying to rip us off for the price of this game. I just know I'm gonna get the comments along the lines of a wolf, we go to make money, you know, to an extent, I understand. You know, they got to get their dime too. Seventy dollars was on the high end of the spectrum for games and most people accepted the new price. But 130 bucks for this? No. I'm super excited for this game, but I'm not gonna be paying that price for it. And this definitely gives me Assassin's Creed Syndicate vibe, so I'm really excited about it. Side note, I'm actually doing ahead of play for Assassin's Creed, so stay tuned for that. As always, if you want more, follow for more."

This is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. And this is gonna be a big issue. So if you don't know, the newest Assassin's Creed was released. Well, the trailer was released, and then they were basically saying that it's set in Japan, and then instead of a Japanese protagonist, a Japanese main character, we have a black samurai as the main character now. Cool. I have. I have no issue with that. If you wanna do a black thing, that's fine, whatever. They could have done that as a DLC though, as a extra content, as anything else. But making that the main character of the series, of the. The game is a bad thing. This is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. First of all, it's gonna cause division. There's obviously gonna be people who don't like it because the guy is black or whatever. Cool, whatever. But making him a central character in the first Japanese game is one of the worst decisions ever, and it's gonna backfire badly once again. For those of you who don't understand, the main issue is the fact that he's. That he's a black guy in ancient Japan. That doesn't really make much sense in terms of, like, um, I. I know the story of the Samurai, I know that some people say it's true and all that, but you should have chose. They should have chosen a Japanese guy. Bro, imagine a game set in Africa and the main character's a white guy. It wouldn't work.",

In Atlas, your characters face some pretty intense challenges. If you could give them one piece of advice to make their journey easier, what would it be? And do you think that she would actually listen? Or would she just give that classic J. Lo I roll? Ha ha, ha ha ha. With classic J. Lo I roll? That one or this one? I think in the second. I don't think I have a classic J rock. I didn't know it was a classic J rock. I do have in my life. They call it the flutter. It's that. It's like, okay, that. That might be it. That it might be. How do they know? I don't know how they know. Maybe they talked about it somewhere. I don't know. It's a document. They know everything. And it came up with that question in like a second. It can do things like that. But is it a good question? I mean, you guys tell me. You're answering questions all day. It wasn't as bad as the other Chapin cheats you got. Yeah, cause somebody else did that and it wasn't. It was a very kind of generic question. That one seemed a little bit more. And I think it's because you put in the Atlas part And again, it's like, how you use it. It is in how specific you are. Makes it more interesting. I don't know. It's a tool. It's a tool. Yeah.

    "voice_to_text": "Linda Malton and her daughter were on the popular Greek island of Mykonos, world renowned as a major tourist destination. At a beach front restaurant, they ordered a light lunch, two crab legs, two mojitos and a bottle of water. She was amazed to see she was being charged 598 euros, or about $640. Brenda tells me she felt intimidated into paying. Were you scared that if you didn't pay the Bill, something bad would actually happen to you? I did have that sense, yeah. I said, I'm gonna call the police and. And that's when they said, you call the police, they will detain you in this country. You will not leave. So how much would the Bill be here in the US? Well, I went to a Red Lobster here in Times Square and ordered practically the same thing Brenda did. Two orders of crab legs and two mojitos. The Bill, $60. Judging from the Trip Advisor reviews for the restaurant in Mykonos, other tourists have experienced something similar. Felt ripped off goes this remark. Another tourist says he was charged some ridiculous amount. Brenda says she loved Mickey Mouse itself, with one big regret. I should have never gone into that restaurant."

You also can't mention having a bomb on a commercial aircraft, obviously. You can't say, and I quote I'm going to steal from that store and hurt anyone who tries to stop me, so don't do that! You can't say, and I quote, I'll make sure that immigrant family never feel safe in this neighborhood. That's a no no. You can't say, and I quote, I'll release everyone's private information online. Unless they pay me, of course. You also can't say, and I quote, I want to distribute insert illegal product here because I think it's harmless.

We just choose to ignore that fact and plough ahead drinking Red Bull like it's water. I myself made the mistake of drinking two rain energy drinks and a big ass cup of coffee and sending myself into atrial fib. Why did I do this? Because I had been awake for 30 hours and I had six left to go. The ADA recommends that you consume no more than 400 mg of caffeine a day. Ha! I don't know about y'all, but 400 mg of caffeine to me is one drink. Have you ever heard of Death Wish coffee? I had. I had no idea how much caffeine was in it. So I made a pot of it and I drink a pot of it. That was the most productive I have ever been after having several cups of coffee. I sat down and did the math afterwards because I felt really hot after being really productive for about an hour. Realized I had consumed about 700 mg of caffeine in one sitting. It's not necessarily just the caffeine. It's all of the other god awful stimulants that nobody can pronounce that they cram into all of these cans. Some of them are worse for you than others, but a good rule of thumb is if you can't pronounce what's in the drink, you probably don't Need to put it in your body in the first place.",

Two of my pupils were different sizes. Mind you, I posted this video right after gardening. I really thought the comments were gonna be like, oh, it's no big deal. No, the comments were like, pretty much, count your fucking days. I'm standing in my bathroom high as fuck, reading hundreds of comments telling me that I literally. I'm gonna die anyway. I have not acted upon this in any way. I have no idea why it was like that. I honestly think the comments alone were more likely to kill me. Since we're on the topic, I figure I might as well mention that in order for me to go to the hospital or the doctor or anything, needs to be a limb hanging off of my body. Like, I will never just go. People were getting, like, fucking mad at me though, about it. Sorry. Day on a completely different note, I'm dog sitting all week, and I feel like I should show you guys the dog. It's Walter, if you follow me. You know Walter? This is Walter. He is my nephew. Is very excited to be hanging out with me. Aren't you, Walter? Oh, yeah. He is making me have a new respect for dog owners. Like, these are little children. Came home late last night, like, slightly buzzed for My dinner, and he's sitting by the door like, bitch picking up their poop on the street. Like, if you're in New York, how humbling is that? I'm going out tonight. I'm like, damn, I can't be out long. I've gotta walk. Walter. I'm gonna do another little wing because I honestly ate yesterday. I'm going to an event alone tonight. I'm honestly a season veteran at doing. Okay, let's get dressed. I'm just gonna wear this little two piece set from mango. I never wear this color, but honestly, I feel like it's doing good things for me. When using this alien. I think hyper sense is what it's called. Perfume. And it is so good.

They don't care that your babysitter didn't show up. They don't care that you just bought a house. This is coming from someone who sat on the executive board, with the CEO, with the C O O, with all of the higher UPS. They don't care. They don't care what you have going outside of work. It is about the result. It is about the deliverable. And the sooner you remove the emotion out of the work that you do, the further that you can go. Because when you start to think that they care if you had a bad day, then you give yourself an excuse to have a bad day. When you think that they hear that you're doing really well in your personal life, you give yourself an excuse. When you remove the emotion, you will go further. Show up, be passionate about the work that you were doing. If you are. If you don't care about the work you're doing, do the bare minimum, but take the emotion out of it. And stop people thinking that people care. It wasn't until I understood this that I doubled my salary and was able to get promoted. It sounds cold, but it's true."

    "voice_to_text": "Was Epstein trying to create moon children? Allegedly, his goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000 square foot Zora Ranch in a small town outside of Santa Fe. He was a devout transhumanous, obsessed with strengthening the human gene pool. But what if he was following a less technological and modern method? What if he was actually reading the magical works of Alister Crowley? Crowley's Libra 3 67, titled The Homunculu of the homunculus, is an epistal with specific instructions on how to invoke an elemental or planetary spirit into a moon child or homunculus. And Libra 3 67, he clearly states the location, quote, should be a great desert, for in such do rarely wander any human soul seeking incarnation. Unquote. Epstein's ranch is very secluded in New Mexico, the land of enchantment. The giant circle on the property plays a role as well. Crowley says, quote, let a great circle be drawn and consecrated to the sphere of the work. Epstein's ranch is near the Trinity Site on the 33rd parallel, allegedly where the US government tried to radioactively create a homunculus using the jumbo container. They never actually told us what exactly that thing was for during the Trinity test in 1945. But there's one thing we do know for certain, that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.",

On Saturday morning, a man was struck and killed by another vehicle while changing his tire in the service road of the Katy Freeway near Highway 6. The other driver remained at the scene and police are investigating the accident. On Saturday night around ten forty five PM, a shooting left a juvenile grazed by a bullet at the Missionary Village Apartments in south east Houston. Police say a vehicle pulled up and an argument took place. The argument turned physical which then turned into a shootout. Several people were also injured in the chaos by debris and broken glass. Across town in southwest Houston, a five year old girl was also grazed by a bullet after a fight broke out outside of a party hall around midnight. She is expected to be okay as well. Today. Another shooting took place outside of a Waffle House in northwest Harris County around 4:00am. One person was transported to a local hospital. At 5:00am, a fatal accident occurred in the northbound lanes of the Southwest Freeway just before the 6:10 split. One person was pronounced deceased at the scene.",

Technology rather than just having another voice actor like, say,   AI   Technology   rather   than   just   having   another   voice   actor   like   say Scott Lawrence, who did the voice of Darth Vader in the Jedi games,   Lawrence   who   did   the   voice   of   Darth   Vader   in   the   Jedi   games voice the character.   the   character This is what Darth Vader sounded like in Obi Wan Kenobi   is   what   Darth   Vader   sounded   like   in   Obi   Wan   Kenobi using the respeecher,   the   respeecher which takes James all Jones's voice and repurposses it.   takes   James   all   Jones's   voice   and   repurposses   it Have you come to destroy me,   you   come   to   destroy   me Obi Wan?

In the theater you can watch Home Alone in the Home Alone house. And this was the biggest surprise. This is a regulation size 3 point line with 25 foot ceilings. And the hectic kitchen layout. Well, it isn't so hectic anymore. And the scary attic. Third floor, go! It's scary up there. Don't be silly. Fool will be up in a little while. Isn't so scary anymore. It's actually a beautiful bedroom now. And you can own this piece of American history for $5.25 million. Comment down below. What do you think?",

    "voice_to_text": "So here are four subtle signs you're doing well financially. Let me know how many of these apply to you. Number one is that you have an emergency fund of at least $2,000. Now, 57% of Americans are unable to afford a thousand dollar emergency expense. So I think having doubled that in an emergency fund is the bare minimum that we should have saved. And ideally, you have three to six months saved in a high yield savings account. No.2. You don't try to signal your wealth, you're just simply building it quietly. In modern society, everyone wants to show how much status they have by driving a fancy car or buying designer clothes. The truly rich, though, they don't show off. No.3. You have debt that you can manage or no debt at all. The average American has debt, excluding mortgages, of around $21,800. So if you're under this, that's a good sign. No. 4. Your meeting spending and savings targets. Ideally, we're saving 15% of our gross income every month in savings or investments, and that can include your 4 o 1K contribution. If you're curious about the other signs, I can make a part 2, so make sure to follow my channel for that."

This Chrysler Baron pulls up to Marlene Warren's driveway and out gets somebody dressed like a clown. Full curly orange wig, red bald nose, white face, makeup, big suit, the whole deal. And approaches the door with two foil balloons and a basket of red and white carnations. The clown walked to the door, knocked on the door, and then Marlene answered the door. Clown hands are balloons and some flowers. I'll still remember this to this day. One of the balloons said, you're the greatest. The last words I heard my mother say was, oh, how pretty. And Bang! Clown pulls out a gun and fires at Point Blank range to Marlene's face. It felt like slow motion. I saw her fall, then I. I jumped in action. I got to the door, and she was gasping for air. Everybody in the house was paralyzed from shock. And that gave the clown the time to get back into the car and take off. What do you guys think? Will you be watching this tonight?

The good news with this is that they're showing their true colors to you. One example you can use is if you're scared to post on social media or you're scared to post music because you might think, oh, my friends are gonna judge me. You have to realize these friends actually don't care about you as much as you think. Of course you wanna be optimistic. Of course it's good to have great friendships and relationships. But especially the younger that you are, you gotta realize as time goes on, these people are gonna fall off in your life. They're not gonna be interested in keeping up the relationship with you as much as time goes on. I actually made a song about this right here. You need to go subscribe. Cater cutter music.

    "voice_to_text": "Hello. Today we're doing spam figgy pudding. Finally got it. I've been looking for this for, like, six months. Get that. It's so wet, and you can see all the spices in it. This was released in 2022, so it's been marinating for a while. It's oddly soft. Time lapse. Oh, hold on, I got more. That is so interesting. Slightly sweet, and it's got notes of cinnamon and I think nutmeg. I don't really know what nutmeg tastes like, but I feel like it's a bubble Christmas stuff and, like, it's a Christmas seasoning. So I just kind of pinpointed that. I think spam, especially in large amounts, could be a little overwhelmingly salty. Those sweet, spicy notes bounce it out quite well. What a beautiful sweet and salty thing going on. I never had figgy pudding, but if he's anything like this, I think I'd love it. So overall, I'm gonna give this. And because I miss spam. It's been so long since we've done a spam episode, I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10 bonus round. I'm also gonna see a Lenny in tomorrow, so I'll be camping for three days, maybe we'll have a little food festival series or something like that.

Not a moral question for me, I don't think. I just feel like it's a bit low effort at times. But it is a safe bet for money, which I also need to get through college, so"

We'll talk about that later. Haha. Anyways, um, I just feel like every time I go to the doctor or whatever, doctors come in for 30 seconds. Be like, yep, yep, yep, yep. The nurses come in asking you all the questions that you need. The nurse is the one who gave me the shot in my ass. Not be like, damn, why come the doctors never give me the shot? Why the doctors never touch me? And then I'll be wondering, what the hell? Why does it take so long for the doctor to come in? Because you was just talking to me for 20 seconds, so I know that means you was talking to the other bitch for 20 seconds. So why did it take you 30 minutes to come in here? What are y'all doing? Why are you asking me the questions that the nurse just asked me? Do y'all not communicate in the hallway? You didn't read the notes, and this is no shade. Like, obviously doctors know what they're doing. Y'all went to school. I yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But what the hell do y'all do when y'all are not in our room for those 15 seconds? What are y'all doing? Are y'all typing on the computer? Are y'all researching Are y'all looking at other cases? Like what? What do y'all do",

But Emma comes out of nowhere, finds your videos, likes all of them, repost all of them, and then a bunch of people are just kind of confused but also happy because someone is finally watching their videos now. A lot of people also don't really know if Emma is a real person, or maybe she is like a robot or something. But she has gained over 64,000 followers on her own TikTok account from doing this. She doesn't post any videos. All she does is just like and repost other people's videos. So getting 64,000 followers just doing that is honestly very impressive. So make sure to be on the lookout, because if she hasn't already, she is going to find your TikTok account and she is gonna like and repost all your videos. So make sure to be checking your TikTok notifications because I guarantee you she's gonna appear one of these days. And I'm just really curious to know your thoughts about all this.",

I don't care where they do premium live events because I just watch it on Peacock anyway because I'm not traveling to go to WrestleMania and stuff like that. But like, so it doesn't matter to me where they go for stuff. But are we getting a WrestleMania in Saudi Arabia in 2026? Are we getting a WrestleMania overseas? Potentially London? Again, I don't care. I think it's wonderful, uh, for them to go to other countries for premium live events because we're spoiled in North America, where we can take a couple hour flight or drive to go see any pay per view we want. But just know that in order to give us two days worth of Summerslam that we don't need two days of, um. What are they taking away because they're about to do some shit?

I don't know, maybe he went there, maybe that's why they wanted him. I seems like kicker is like, pretty low on the list of who I want to bring to my school to sit. Because this is like the last speech your kids are gonna get at education before you set them out into the world, you know? And he gets up there, and at first he's. It. It didn't seem to be like that weird of speech I saw. People were messaging me about it, and I was like, what? What do you say? As I was watching at first, I was like, what do you say? He's like, oh, just be a strong man. Take care of. Take care of the people around you. Have good values, all. All something that. And then, um, that. Kept watching, haha. Cause at first I was like, man, what's everybody been out of shape about? That I get, okay, watch it. And then he was like, you know, and to all the ladies here, I'm paraphrasing to all the ladies here with your little degrees, go ahead and have baby or your Life is meaningless. Like, he. Like, he didn't. He didn't really say that, but it. It. It's. It's how people felt. Uh, and it's pretty crazy, cause I looked him up afterwards, cause I was just like, I. Like, the weird thing about him is that because he's the kicker, you know, he really feels this way. He has the least CTE on the team. These are his true and present values. But then I looked him up, and apparently his. His mom is a physicist, which, I don't know. I mean, I guess, you know, I guess to a certain degrees, working something out there. Like, if your mom's a physicist, I can't imagine how many times in your life you've been corrected. Yeah, maybe that's what it is. Maybe it's like, you know, I just want a woman who won't.

You can. You can get that at any time, right? So. So now we're not going on the date because you don't want to pay more than Starbucks? Oh, it's not bad. Money is no option. So if money is no option, then why aren't we going on the date like an actual date? Cause one, you trying to put me on blast like you got your phone out filming this interaction right now, okay, because I thought I was getting pranked at this point, okay? Like, it feels like it's not real because I've never had a grown man take me to Starbucks for a date. What is it, high school? You never had a grown man in general? Cause, uh, you know, you acting really unappreciated. Like you expect me to take. Are you some five dollar restaurant right up the gate? You know what? I'mma do you one better. I'm not even gonna take you home. You know what? Any. Any dude can come and get you and take you out, right? Okay. Let me go ahead and make sure that's the case. Are you serious? Are you serious?

How bloody cute is that? Who am I to tell her that's wrong? I've started to adopt pickle mix too, and I love it. One of my favourites is Bounce Salines for trampolines. Um, she came up with this one on her own. She bounces on him. Why would they not be Bounce Salines? I get it. I'm not gonna correct the girl. Also, I will say that her dream when she grows up is to be a bounce Selena. Um, so it comes up and it does crop up in our daily life quite a lot about Celine. Love it. We're a bigger McDonald's fan in this house and she likes to call it happy Donald's. Mummy, can I have a Happy Donald's? Yes, darling. Yes, darling, you could have a Happy Donald's. Of course you can. Also on Happy Donald's, she loves a Mcflurry. And what does she call them? Mcfluffies. How cute is Mcfluffies? We should all call them mcfluffies. On the theme of ice cream, she doesn't call it ice cream. She calls it ice peem. And I love that too. Oh, and octopus for octopus. Octopus, when a 3 year old says it is a gosh darn cutest little thing I've ever heard in my life. What's some things your Kids say wrong. Uh, that's just too cute for you to correct them.",

Usually they are uncomfortable with honest conflict and they would rather just ignore the problems and pretend they don't exist. This creates shallow and superficial relationships between the family members and there is this fake energy in the air when that happens as well. Another thing that will happen is when someone does try to bring up an issue, they will treat that person like they're the problem and then blame them and say you should just get over it.

If he succeeds, that war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead. And technology and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to charter course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan.

    "voice_to_text": "Top 10 most hated stand up comics 10. Dane Cook accused of joke stealing and known for his hyperactive style and perceived shallow humour. Cook's success has been met with significant backlash from both critics and other comedians. 9. Carlos Mencia frequently accused of plagiarism, particularly of other comedians jokes. Mensia's reliance on racial humour and questions about his ethnicity have further tarnished his reputation. 8. Carrot Top known for his prop comedy, Carrot Top is criticized for being unfunny and for his dramatic physical transformation, which has included significant muscle gain and alleged cosmetic surgery. Seven. Gallagher famous for his watermelon smashing act, Gallagher's prop comedy is seen as dull by some, and his traditional stand up jokes have been equally panned. Six. Kathy Griffin known for her abrasive style and celebrity bashing humour, Griffin's detractors find her mean spirited and overly reliant on easy targets. 5. Larry the Cable Guy criticized for his stereotypical redneck persona and low brow humor, Larry is seen by many as a multi millionaire who exploits and satirizes American anti intellectualism. 4. Jay Leno while successful on television, Leno is often criticized for his unoriginal jokes, perceived laziness, and his role in the late night show controversy involving Conan O'Brien. 3. Jeff Dunham despite a significant fan following, Dunham's ventriloquist act is criticized for being creepy, forced, and reliant on racist and homophobic humour through his puppets. 2. Pauly Shore known for his weasel persona and acting in critically panned movies. Shore's one Note comedic style and limited acting range have LED to widespread dislike one Sarah Silverman. Silverman's crude humour, reliance on her looks, and accusations of sleeping her way to the top have made her polarizing.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today we try an octopus. This octopus is actually 8 pounds, and it cost me roughly about $150. Let's see if it's worth it. Oh, damn. Oh, this fire. This is fire for sure. Let me break it down. This already comes to narize with salt. It comes frozen. This did come in, like, a greyish whitish color, but when I started cooking it, it did turn dark, a dark red, or some may call a purple. Beautiful purple. Texture wise, I personally never had anything that's been mild, firm, chewy, and tender all the same time. But I'm country folks out there. This is gonna remind you of. Of pig feet. It doesn't taste like pig feet, but the texture is that of pig feet. Next we're gonna try the head. The hair, for sure. A lot more chewier than the tentacles, but still has that same mouth flavor. This right here is ginger, oregano, basil, dill, garlic, with a little bit of honey and lemon juice. Damn. Somebody sent me this a little while ago, and, you know, this is the perfect time to try this. Damn. Soft, on point. It's like a well seasoned, spicy Mayo. That's real good. What about us again? Absolutely. But this is why we do different. If you have a grill, I would throw this on the grill, bro. I bet you this on the grill would be awesome. But obviously, I don't have a grill, so it is what it is. Try this on, gold belly. Check this out."

Okay, so I'm leaving work. Tonight is Wednesday, and I made $3,830. Woohoo! It's definitely a good night. Okay, so it's Thursday now, but I worked last night Wednesday, and I made $3,274. Definitely a really good night. Okay, so last night was Thursday. I worked from ten thirty PM until 6:00am, and I was there counting money until like 9:00am, and I made $3,745. Definitely a good night. It was a long night though, and I'm starting to get sick. Okay, so this is from Saturday. I made $2,270. Was slower Saturday than I'm used to, but I felt like shit. My throat started hurting so I went home early. Okay, so it's Monday. It is the last day of my work week. I did not work Sunday night. I was trying to work all seven days in a row for this video, but my throat started killing me. Saturday late night at work, so I ended up leaving early. Took Sunday off for my own, like, physical health. Feeling a lot better tonight. Tonight is the last night of my work week. I worked Monday and I made $1,018. Um, definitely not as good of a night as my usual Monday is, but I'm very happy I made something. It was a slow night in The club. And, yeah, I'll never say no to $1,000. Okay, so out of the past week, out of the past seven days, I worked six nights, and my grand total for six nights of work at my club was $15,787. Um, I'm super happy with that amount of money. Obviously, that's a crazy amount of money to make in a week. It is certainly not my best week, but it is certainly not my worst week, either. And $15,000, I used to make that in, like, many, many money. Four or five, six months of work. So the fact that I made that in one week is literally crazy. And, yeah, obviously, I put money aside for taxes to have a whole video on that, if you're interested. Thanks for watching.",

They have a whole lot of bark in them, and they think they're badass, but when it comes down to it, you're gonna fucking kick their ass every single fucking time. They're in their 60s, bro. Oh, sweetheart, your generational confusion is as bad as your Common Core math. Let's go ahead and go through this. 20 24 - 19 65, and I will give you a huge hint. Not 60. On top of that, Gen X's bite is far worse than its bark. The vast majority of us served, whether it was the country or the judicial system. You don't really wanna go fucking go there. On top of all of that, let's talk about our activism. While your generation has screamed at the sky wanting and demanding change, we went out and actually did something about it. So I'm willing to put my activism against your activism to try to make positive change for this entire country. So let's go ahead and exchange histories. Happy to do it. And we'll see who was more involved, and we'll see who made more changes. Have the day you deserve.",

Liam had to pick up a hemp rope from the garbage dump and sleep on it every day, often falling uncomfortably. Couldn't stand it anymore and decided to spend all his savings to renovate it. Firstly, weld a frame and steps from galvanized square steel. Borrow some screws from his aunt to fix it to the wall. Cover it with eco friendly wood veneer. Put mattresses directly upstairs to create Liam's sleeping area. Add wooden veneer railings to prevent him from rolling downstairs. Install a floor to ceiling wardrobe beside the bed to store out of season bedding on top. Add cabinet doors for dust Protection in the middle hanging area and leave a small space below for bedtime reading. Install a socket to charge his mobile phone and house a projector. Surround the area with his lucky coloured soft clothes. Next, make a desk opposite the end of the bed in the left drawer store all his savings for a bigger house. In the right drawer keep his underwear and socks. Make a wall cabinet on top to store famous books and martial arts secrets given by his aunt. Put a computer on the desk so Liam can work, study and use it as a dining table. He can also practice his inner strength. On the side. Install a projection screen on top so he can enjoy Korean dramas every day. Make a modular cabinet under the stairs. Put a magnetic stove on top to create a mini kitchen. Use the left area as a wash basin and the middle for cutting vegetables. Install a wall mirror cabinet so Liam can admire his appearance daily. The mirror cabinet compartments can hold condiments and toiletries. Build a wall next to the window and install a shower in the brick corridor. Install a bathroom heater 10 cm below the ceiling. Avoid laying tiles. Install a squat toilet that can be folded up when not in use, doubling as a large floor drain. Limited space can bloom with unlimited possibilities. Finally, let's take a look at the overall effect."

This is a very younger version of my husband, the very young picture of us. This was not long after I told him I was in love with him. And he did leave my Auntie Jenny for me. This is us fresh in our relationship. There's a picture of me and my stepson Hugo, who is also my first cousin. And this is around the time when we had our second affair behind my husband's back. It's not many pictures of us, to be honest, cause we've hated each other for a long, long time. He's trying to get his claws into my inheritance, which is not his. And I've made sure my husband has cut him and his horrible siblings out of the will. Here is the most recent picture of me and my husband. I did pick him up from his care home to take him out for the day, but unfortunately he did smell like a dirty hamster cage, so I did have to keep the visit brief. He's quite handsome. He does look a bit like Bruce Willis, doesn't He"

What did you guys have for dinner? I'm just curious. I love hot Italian sausage. Like, so good. It's, like, not too spicy, but it's just the right amount of spicy, you know? I hope you all are having a happy, healthy, and blessed day. Hmm. Don't forget, tag three people in the comments. 8 million views and my whole head shaved. It's so yummy, guys.

How is that gonna help Mrs Jones in clapping with a gas Bill? What does that mean? Don't worry, don't worry.

Well, again, and I note so often when I speak to conservative politicians and they start talking about how they're going to introduce this measure for the economy or that measure for health or this measure for law and order, you remind me that where are the 40 new hospitals?

    "voice_to_text": "Here are seven reasons why you should stop giving a fuck. Number one, you're gonna be dead soon and none of this is gonna matter anyway. If you're lucky, you'll do one thing in your life that matters 100 years from now. Is this that one thing? I didn't think so. Number two, if you wouldn't take advice from them, then why the fuck would you listen to their criticism? Number three, nobody thinks about you as much as you think about yourself. That's because they're too busy thinking about themselves. In short, they don't give a fuck, so why should you? Number four, everything you've learned in life came from making mistakes. Everything you became good at, you were once bad at, so why would you be worried about making more mistakes? Number five, can you control it? No? Then fuck it. Number six, the most important things in life are achieved not by caring more, but by caring less. Wishing you were more confident makes you less confident. Hoping to be happy makes you less happy. And number seven, 99% of your regrets will be the things that you don't do. It's the risk you didn't take, the things you didn't say, the dreams you didn't chase. I don't know about you, but I'd rather feel bad about trying something than not trying anything at all.",

    "voice_to_text": "You know, some. I always thought a woman would never shoot her shot, and it always had to be the man. And then I was proven wrong. Me, I grew up thinking that I was a conventionally unattractive man. I still think this way to an extent. And I always, you know, had crushes. I would confess my feelings to some of them and never worked out. And then I thought I was ugly and I would never find a girlfriend. And then I matured a little bit and thought to myself, you know what? Maybe I'm not ugly. I'm just not these women's type. And because I'm not a lot of women's type, i'mma just, you know, chill out on the whole trying to find a girlfriend shit and just be myself and enjoy life. But because I developed this new mindset of just enjoying life and just saying, fuck trying to get into a relationship, whenever a woman flirts with me, it goes over my head because I'm thinking, you just, you know, either you're joking or you just being, you know, nice, friendly. In my mind, you flirting with me is impossible. So I just never take it serious. Side note it is crazy how taking in people's negativity as factual truths and having low self esteem warped my perception of life. It's absolutely insane. There was one night where I went to this little event thing. It was basically a big ass party. You can go On the bars and shit like that. And there was just. There was these two women that were having a photoshoot. I had to wait till they was done with the photo shoot so I can walk past, you know, because I was just. I was just chilling, just minding my own business by myself. One of them stopped me, and then she came up to me, shook my hand, gave me her name, I gave her mine. You know, just, you know, being real, you know, just nice, formal. We started joking, laughing, having multitudes of conversations. And then the next thing I know, she gave me her number. I didn't ask for it, she just gave it to me. She told me to take it down. She told me to take it down. In my mind, I was like, sure, I can use another friend. Fuck it, I'll take your number. And by the time I got to five guys and took one bite of my cheeseburger, I thought to myself, what the fuck just happened? She was low key flirting with me. Everything she was saying to me, I was just eating it up. Eating it up. I was just, you know, it was like a buffet. Everything she was giving to me, I was just eating it up, eating up. And then she begged me if I could describe the feeling. It was like she sleight of hand, ripped my boxes off my body. And then Stuffed it into her purse. That. That's. That's what it felt like to all the dudes saying that women don't shoot. They shot. They do. It's just. You don't see it every day, but. Well, when they shoot, they shot it. They. It's like a thief in the night. I was not ready for it.",

Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough",

But whoever, like Usher's mother, who's whining like a crybaby. I should sue Diddy. Listen, lady, you pushed your kid out there knowing and took paycheck. Do not put your kids out there. Bieber was put out there. Bieber went to Diddy camp and then usher camp, and these guys just sodomized them. That's what happens at camp. You get sodomized. It's ritualized, actually. So we have to stop. Look, we have to stop looking at as just perversion, sexually and gayness, because it's really ritualistic. It's used for use",

Look at what women are doing in the court system today. What is more evil than breaking up a family? And women do that all the time. Is the answer then that evil comes from women? We are kind of leaving out the fact that, yeah, a man actually left his family in that situation. Most of the time, men don't leave. Women are the ones that overwhelmingly leave. And if you really dig it, you actually do the work in interview men that are the known to be like deadbeat dads. Most of the deadbeat dads don't really exist. I know their exceptions are not the rule, so. And. And if you actually do the work and interview these guys, there's men that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting for their kids.

Imagine being inside a normal sphere. Space is limited and time is infinite. But inside a black hole, it's the other way around. Space is infinite, but time is running out. Right after you cross the event horizon, space starts to shrink, becoming smaller and smaller until eventually collapsing. This collapse looks like one of the possible scenarios for the end of our universe. The Big Crunch. And just like in a normal Big Crunch, this collapse could give rise to a bounce from which a new universe emerges. A universe born inside a black hole. What if our universe was born like this?

It can't be done. There's way too much, like, needless sex scenes in it. And it's not me being approved. It's just like, it feels exploitative. It's like, you know when school says, you did Wolf of Wall Street? He was like, yeah, this is actually about how greed is bad. Is it, Martin? Because you've shown it looking fucking brilliant, and I feel that it's the same report things as, like, yeah, this is. This is actually a feminist movie. Well, is it, though?

Anytime he switch companies, he's got there, and that's like, okay, well, what do we do with him? What should we do with him? I think somebody needs to figure that out, because Andrada is incredibly talented in the ring, but it just seems wherever he goes, there's no creative forum. What do you all think about that?

    "voice_to_text": "So you wanna visit Taliban controlled Afghanistan as a tourist? I'm an American who's been backpacking around the country and here the three necessary steps that you have to take to be able to safely visit the country. Step one, get the visa. Once the government switched, most Afghan embassies closed. However, there are a few Taliban consulates. I've listed them on screen. The most expensive visas are upwards of $300, which are issued in European consulates, and the cheapest is just $100 in Peshawar, Pakistan. Step 2 enter the country. You can fly into Kabul from all the major airports listed on the screen, or you can cross a land border. I came in from Pakistan via the Torkham border, which is one of the most legendary border crossings in the world, and I highly recommend it. Step three 3. Get your permits. This is arguably the most crucial step, because if you're walking around Afghanistan without permits, you could even be jailed. First, you'll have to head to the Ministry of information and culture, which is located at the coordinates listed on the screen. Here. You'll drop the letter with the Taliban officials declaring where you intend to visit. And then secondly, head to the directory of tourism listed at the coordinates on screen, where they'll issue you your permits. Congratulations, you're now registered with the Taliban and fully authorized to explore all of Afghanistan. Follow for more travel content from legitimately every corner of the globe. Ciao."

You learn some team stuff, you do it to a certain point. You put them in jujutsu, they'll have that for the rest of their life. Forever. Yeah, till the day they die, they'll have that jujutsu in their back pocket. Here's the thing in jujutsu, it's not about strength or power and it's about technique. A little girl, I could bring in a 16 year old girl that'll wrap you two into fucking pretzels, okay? And it's not about how strong you are, it's about the technique. They can put you to sleep, they.

This as a chicken burger. And I guess this would be a chicken sandwich. Well, I'm American, and I would call this a chicken sandwich. And I would call this poverty. Now, everybody knows that British English is the wrong version of English, so I'm gonna add, you know, we're just gonna clear some things up. This is a chicken sandwich. This is a Popeyes chicken sandwich, to be clear. And I don't see the spicy Mayo on it. So they ordered the regular version and not the spicy. This is what I expect to see when I order a chicken sandwich. This is just a Greek tragedy. If you offered me a chicken sandwich and then presented me with this, I would think that you were insulting me. Like, what's going on in that house? This is.

    "voice_to_text": "A man served his friends and himself tacos made from his own amputated leg. And even describes what he tastes like. Yeah. The crazier part is that they willingly ate it. So what ended up happening is he was riding his bike, he got hit by a car, thrown in the woods, and his foot. This is his actual foot, shattered in so many places that the doctors couldn't save it. They actually just had to amputate his foot. Now, when he was going under, he said, can I keep it? And they said, well, it's your property. Yes, you can. So his original plan was to freeze dry it and have it taxidermy. He said it'd be really cool to have your foot as a lamp and keep your foot for, like, life. But he said he couldn't find anybody to take him seriously and nobody to actually do it. So he called up about 11 of his buddies. One of them backed out and said, hey, remember that time we talked if we could ever ethically try human flesh? Well, I got us. And I don't know what kind of friends he's hanging out with that. Those kind of conversations, but they did it. They came over and made tacos out of him. The actual images of it are behind me. I can't really show them on TikTok. I don't believe I can. At least, uh, without getting in trouble. So you can go on the internet and Find them. It is pretty entertaining. They actually all ate the taco at the same time. He made fajitas out of. One of his friends said he spit him back out immediately into a napkin. At the end of the day, he said that he tasted like beef. One of his friends spit him out. And the weirdest part about the whole thing was that it wasn't really weird at all."

But Jimmy Neutron's breath, his lungs. His lungs scale higher than you! You're trash! You got all these chapters! It took him one fucking movie?

    "voice_to_text": "How to design a bedroom for 200 kids. My wife and I love children so much that we worked hard for many years to have kids, and before we realized it, we had 200 children. Daily life became a big challenge, but luckily our house is big enough. After discussing, we decided to do this. I called a good friend who runs a business and borrowed dozens of tons of steel. We used several 200 by 200 square steel beams as the main structure, welding 60 square steel horizontally and vertically for extra strength. We poured commercial grade copper floors which will last for 100 million years. For the upper two walls, we used wood veneers to create 200 separate beds, each with its own wardrobe, for the kids to store their belongings. We bought 200 soft mattresses online to ensure comfortable beds and added soft cushions beside each bed to make sure the kids sleep well. We also installed ladders and railings to make getting in and out of bed safe and easy. Next, I drove a big truck to my second cousin's house to borrow some bookcases. We neatly placed tables and chairs on the second floor, creating study areas on both sides of the window. We brought home all kinds of books from the school library, boosting the children's knowledge reserves. Placing tables and chairs in the middle increased their learning efficiency. On the third floor, we set up a row of tables, chairs, and benches by the Window as a leisure area for the kids. Here they can gather in small groups to eat, drink and have fun when they're not studying. We placed all the fitness equipment on the first floor so the children can exercise conveniently. We installed partitions to create an independent gym. On the right, we arranged several snack racks filled with snacks the kids will love, giving them snack freedom. On the left, we set up food stalls to satisfy the children's appetites, knowing that a full stomach is key to capturing their hearts. We then installed stairs and handrails to ensure safety and convenience. In the center, we placed an oversized saint statue for the children to look up to and worship, reminding them of holiness. Finally, we installed access control to better protect the children's safety. With the house decorated like this, it easily accommodates 200 children, allowing them to enjoy a perfect, happy life.",

And the trainee, the front, uh, input shaft seal was leaking. Now here's the real kicker. So we pull the tyranny out to find the leak. It's just dripping, you can see here. And we pull the tyranny out, call the dealer up, send us a seal. No seal, we go. What do you mean no seal? They're like, not available. And that's when we start looking into this thing. There's nothing available for this tranny. An oil pan gasket, that's all you can get. So. Except if you wanna buy a whole tranny. So there's another example of, you know, the manufacturer forcing you out of a vehicle that can be fixed to buy a new one. It's disgusting. And that's my opinion about that. And I'm not gonna hold any, any, you know, I'm not holding back on that. Trucks only six years old. I don't know how we'd fix this, but by, you know, and tolerating this from the manufacture. But anyway, we'll get her fixed."

Unfortunately, their relationship faced challenges, primarily due to Minnelli's homosexuality. While he openly discussed his sexual orientation in New York, he maintained a more discreet approach in Los Angeles to preserve his Hollywood image. Minnelli entered marriages with women including Georgette Magnani and Danica Ridosoljevic. Following his divorce from Garland, Lee Anderson became his last wife until his death in 1986. 8. Lizzie Manelli Lizzie Manelli closely mirrored her mother's life choices, as she too married a man who eventually came out as gay. Lizzie's marriage to musician Peter Allen lasted from 1967 to 1974. Although Peter had always felt a deep connection with men, he struggled with how to communicate this realization to his family and friends. Tragically, after battling AIDS, Peter passed away in 1992, having been in a 15 year relationship with a man. It was only after his separation from Liza Minnelli that he fully embraced his true self. 7. Carrie Fisher, Ryan Lord.",

It's just like driving my mate round, but not honestly that, like, he respects me and like, has care for me as well. Like this man bought me a bagel. He text me and he was like, I'm going to the bagel shop, do you want a bagel? I was like, oh my God, you'd be the best person ever. And he was like, on it. What a legend.

You actually just wanna feel good. You don't need caffeine. You actually need rest. You haven't slept in weeks, months, and your body is tired. You need rest and relaxation. You don't need to work harder. You need new inspiration and enthusiasm to feel motivated every day. I feel like a lot of us don't know the language of our bodies. So we end up translating our needs completely wrong. We hear that our body is craving something and will go, hey, I need sugar, when really your body is saying, no, I'm low on vitamins. And we do the same thing with our spirit and with our mind and our mental health. We're misdiagnosing ourselves. So for those of you that resonate with what I'm saying, listen to your body and pay attention to it. Don't listen to your craving. Listen to your need. Because that's what you actually are searching for. I love you.",

Me, I'm like, no, I just want the chicken I asked for. Like, am I crazy? Is that not fair? And the salad dressing. To give this much is almost criminal. If you're gonna charge $2, fill that thing up. You wanna give lower amounts. Hot prices make the shareholders happy. But at the end of the day, what's more important, shareholders or your daily customers? The best long term strategy for any brand is make your customers happy. A good brand will come back to the people and give them what they want. So look, toy, I love you.

In this video that I found shows that this person is from California. How does Garfield know that? It is so scary. This trend is fully just taken over TikTok at this point. It's like the only thing that's on my for you page at the minute. They're blowing up. I mean, this video has over 900,000 likes. That's a lot of likes. So I'm gonna try it. Chief, Garfield knows where I live, too. This is what he said. I know where you live. I'm ready to get, like, a restraining order or something. I am terrified is what I'd say if. Well, if he actually knew. It's fake. They did. Turns out it's not real. Phil doesn't just magically know where you are. CapCut template makes you put it in yourself. So don't worry about it.

Boston. Boston. Ha, ha, ha. Sweet. Can we just list. Can we hear that list? Silicon Valley. What was the other one? Oxford. Boston. What the fuck is happening in Boston? Oh, have it. Fucking have it. Hell, yeah. Wait, I'm so confused. There was. There's a cult at these colleges? Is that what you're telling me? These cult. These cult bitches are so confusing. Did you have. Was there a leader? Kind of, but he wasn't very charismatic. But that's the whole fucking. That's the one thing you have to be when you lead a cult. That's this nerdy cult she's talking about where they fucking lead, guy. You're like, I don't really Like, his personality, it's not, we're in it for the math, I think. Did he have sex with you idiots or what? No, not you, but other people. You know, that has to be the one thing you talk about when you're a cult. You're like, did you fuck the main guy? Are we fucking the main guy, or are we just doing math? Are we fucking the main guy, or are we doing math? You know, orgs that I was, like, near. Okay, okay, this is what I was looking for. There were two orgies. Where were they? In Boston. Is that the Boston element? Where you do the math at Oxford and Fucking MIT, and then you do the orgies in Boston? Oh, for some, like, AI research. Oh, that was the worst orgy ever. Everyone was naked in flip flops. You know it. Everyone just didn't even know how to finger. You're like, this is the worst fucking orgy ever.",

    "voice_to_text": "I volunteered to smoke barbecue at my son's school for Teacher Appreciation Week, and this is part 3 of my ultimate barbecue feast. This meat ended up taking all night long. I was doing it like I normally do, running around 2:25, 2:50, spritz in every hour or so. Oh, and I forgot to adjust my nozzle here, so use my excessive stream. But, yeah, you know, just your typical night of smoking meat. Around eight PM, the pork butts were ready to wrap, so I transferred them to an aluminum pan with a little bit of apple juice in the bottom just so they could braise. Then I added some pats of butter on top and a little bit more seasoning. Then I just wrapped them in foil and threw them back on. Now, these briskets, these freaking briskets, they stalled out on me, and so I couldn't even wrap them until it was like 1 o'clock in the morning. I was so freaking tired. And let's just say I have regrets. But it's all good. I ended up staying up till about 4:00am, and then I woke my husband up and I said, hey, bro, you know, you gotta take over because I need to get at least two or three hours of sleep. But he said he pulled everything off and sorted the camera about 6:00am, which really isn't that bad. About 16 hours total cook time. We let everything rest till about 9:00am. In the meantime, I chopped up some onions through some pickles, potato salad, coleslaw. Got those all into pans. Then it was time to slice up the meat. At this point, I was so tired, I was, like, delirious. So I was so happy to have my husband there to help me. And, honestly, this brisket came out so. Oh, good. I mean, look how pretty it is. But, yeah. We finished slicing everything, getting it all loaded up in the car, and coolers and cambros. Then it was time to head to the school and feed the teachers. Honestly, this was so much fun, and everybody loved it. We got to know some of the teachers better, and we got to serve them some delicious food. And honestly, I cannot wait to do this again. See you next time.",

Please don't bleach your skin. Like, it's so sad that it's a bleaching pandemic for all the women who want to bleach your skin because of a man and the colorism and to be lighter, to be prettier. Don't bleach your skin. You're gonna look pink, you're gonna look gray, and you're gonna look like a Dalmatian. And guess what? That man will still cheat on you. Love yourself, y'all. Love yourself. It's so crazy that I've gotten so many of these things, so many people telling me, please don't bleach your skin. Like, it's so sad. My fellow people in Africa to tell me not to bleach my skin. I'm already confident enough and myself to love my skin color, but to hear this from, like, numerous people from the west, to the south, to the east. Come on, y'all. Anyways, Africa is amazing.

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

Time lapse. Oh, familiar. Gosh dang. This was a great cheese. The whole thing is coated in this super sweet blueberry sauce and mixed with the creamy butteriness of this goat cheese. It was like I was eating a cheesecake. It was like a blueberry cheesecake or it. It kinda tasted like Chobani. I never got Chobani flip as a kid growing up cause my mom thought it was kind of a waste of money, and she's kinda right cause I would never buy. I think the vanilla is mixed in with the cheese, which really brings out that rich flavor of the goat cheese. This is like the Pinnacle of sweet cheeses. I could eat this whole thing, but I'm not gonna cause I'm out of Lactaid. I'm going to Isonok in like a second here. I'll just save it for when I'm back. Overall, this was a great cheese. Probably the best sweet cheese I've had so far. I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10 bonus round green apple. I recently said in a video that I was colorblind. Some of you guys in the comments were like, oh, so that's why you always look at the. The name instead of the color. And you're right. Most of the Time with this lighting specifically, I can't tell the difference between a green apple and a cherry."

At number two, we have another very famous one with Birkenstock. It's not Birkenstock. It's Birkenstock. Birkenstock. And number three is probably one of my favorite ones because you hear it all the time with Mercedes Benz. It's not Mercedes Benz. It's Mercedes Benz. Mercedes Benz. At number four, another car brand which is butchered pretty bad with Volkswagen, I think is how Americans say it most of the time. In German, we say Volkswagen, which really just means the car of the folk, the people. The car of the people. And then as number five, we have a very famous gummy bear with Haribo. You guys say in English, but it's Haribo. Haribo. As always, make sure you follow me, guys, and leave something in the comment section. I should do next. Thank you.",

The marriage of the state doesn't mean anything. Totally irrelevant, nonsensical. There's no groundswell. Community support. The ecclesiastical authority of your church is supposed to be that groundswell and community support, which helps prevent that from happening. But within a secular framework, they don't have that. And so what ends up happening is these relationships basically get ice. The second woman sees that, hey, this guy over here makes a little bit more money, he's more handsome, and he's into me, they tend to leave their husbands for that guy or for other arbitrary reasons. There's a church would provide massive quantities of shame from the community that they grew up in. Church would provide shame? Is that what you said? Yeah. Like they would shame her into staying in a marriage. They would shame her from stepping out for arbitrary reasons, holding your accountable, saying, listen, how can you have these expectations that your husband makes these grandiose sacrifices for you, including taking a bullet, when you won't even submit to it? So a couple that is married where the wife's not submitting, what advice would you give that man? That chick needs to behave and submit. What do you mean"

You just won't get some like your own. Alright, so give me a suggestion. Somebody that I feel like that would be a good match for you if I could. Bobby. You hook me up with Bobby. Are you for real hooking up with Bobby? You and Bobby together? Once you go Shack, she'll never go back. I don't think Bobby is a good one for you. Would you like me to call Bobby too? Yeah, start on the date. Call her right now. Alright. Hello? Hi Bobby. Hi. I'm sitting here with funny Marco. He told me to ask you on a date. So can I take you to the movies? Sure. Alright. I love you Bobby. I'll call you later. Love you too. Alright, bye. Bye. Okay, who wouldn't take a free movies? No, no, no, no, no. You said that she wasn't gonna date me. That movie is not a date. Okay, look, what camera can I look at and talk to them? That one. Okay, look, is going on a movies considered a date? Yes. She did giggle though. Oh wait, wait. Are you jealous?

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.",

    "video_description": "Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker is facing backlash online after a controversial graduation speech - in which he told women they should aspire to be homemakers.  People online are calling the speech demeaning to working women and also say it is mysogynstic.  A\u00a0petition\u00a0was even started to have him removed from the\u00a0Super Bowl\u00a0champion's roster, which has now reached over 100,000 signatures.  He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend. And, also in the speech he criticised Pride month, a particularly important time for the\u00a0LGBTQ+ rights movement. #lifeandstyle #HarrisonButker #TaylorSwift #NFL #KansasCityChiefs #Chiefs #Butker"

They definitely wouldn't give us bias news, would they? I'm sure it's no coincidence that they were seen together at the White House. But just wait. What are you doing? What are you doing in this picture with a selfie with this motherfucking piece of shit? Oh, but wait, there's more. What do you see wrong with this picture? Hey, let's get a close up. What do you see wrong with this picture? Oh, there's good old Harry who's known for spewing bullshit ass propaganda on this app. On. Here's another one of pro mania being so proud about being at the White House. Right? But what if I told you this gets much deeper than you'd like to think? For example, right here, this article paints it very well. Here's a statistic for you. A third of people ages 18 to 29 prefer to get their news supposedly from TikTok and other social media. So the White House is supposedly working on new ways to get its message out to these audiences. More than 20 people were. There were ring lights and audio equipment taking it all in. And it's supposedly part of a White House strategy to reach younger people where they are, which often is supposedly scrolling on a device with help from influencers. Influencers such as V from under the desk news, who says to be at the People's House having lemonade. Waiting for the president to speak is a very exciting moment. As you see, like it says here, that's V, host of under the Desk News, which provides minute long daily news wraps to 2.7 million TikTok followers. Oh, and there was supposedly a special briefing for V and other content creators ahead of the ceremony. I wonder what was discussed in that special briefing. Honestly, people can't realize that there's two motherfucking sides to the same motherfucking coin. At this point, you're just choosing to remain door minded. Truly a mindless little consumer that chooses to be an NPC. Not caring about who the fuck they're voting into the fucking house. Not giving a fuck about who they're voting for to lead us as the people. So I guess it's time to cancel V from under the desk news and Mr. Pro mania himself, right? Gotta love when people just sell themselves out for a bag, right?",

Many years later, on a certain day, when Mark encountered a friendly large shark again, he discovered that it was the same shark he had saved years ago. Now grown into an adult, this shark showed great friendliness towards Mark, frequently coming to meet him. It displayed extraordinary intelligence and emotion, getting close to Mark and even willingly accepting his feeding. Mark felt the special bond between them and was filled with surprise and joy. As time passed, this shark even began to introduce its family to Mark, and other members of the shark family also showed warmth and respect towards him. The shark even left its teeth to Mark as a memento, symbolizing their special connection and friendship. Mark received many precious gifts from them, which he carefully preserved. Have you ever seen such a clever shark?"

But just thinking about it just makes me angry. Yo, Ray, what are you talking about right now? Why? Why Willow pissing you off? Oh, no, baby, it's not Willow. Willow can never piss me off. Do you see her? She could never piss me off. Is Miss Ma'am right here. Miss Fucking ma'am right here. Because how the fuck. And this is the second time she did this shit, y'all, and i'mma just leave it like that. I could be wrong because I did not follow her when she went to Japan, but I could be wrong, but I don't give enough fucks to do research. So this is the second time she came into somebody's fucking company and got a title shot. And I don't think she wrestled at all before getting into that title fucking shot. You know what I'm saying? And like I said, this is weird. Like, the reserve of the anger is coming in that. Because it's just like, okay, double nothing. I think that's what she said. I think that. Yeah, that's what. Next month, isn't it in may? So we got a couple of weeks, we got dynasty, and then we have fucking double nothing if homegirl does not wrestle. I don't even know. One match is not good enough for me. I need her to wrestle about like four to five matches because the fact that you didn't wrestle the fuck at all and you came and talked and wasted everybody's fucking time with this bomb ass CEO catchphrase. Yo, it's giving. Like she's giving 80s wrestler and 2024 and it's just like I. I don't like that shit. I hardly like anybody in the 80s, so whatever. I'm not different for a different day. But anyways, just for her to really just walk into a W, talk about I got next. Bitch, what the fuck that have you done for me lately for you to say that you got next? I don't give a fuck about your name. I don't give a fuck about how Tony Calm feels about you with Tony Khan doesn't even know what fucking date is half of the fucking time. So let alone should I give a fuck about anything that he like says, but just, just walking into a company, talk about I got Nexus, fucking wow, bro. And. And I said this before, I don't wanna hear nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing when Charlotte comes back and does the same shit, okay? I don't wanna hear a fuck all thing cause you let this bitch get away with it. So you gonna let my bitch get away with it? The fuck out of here. Really about to make my girl Willow a transitional champion. I can't even fucking believe this shit. Like, I Cannot even believe this shit. Willow has been busting her ASS to be a transitional champion to this and fucking same.",

    "voice_to_text": "Oh dude, no one wants this. Everybody's been clowning on this dude because he said that nobody wants a Samurai Assassin's Creed game because everyone has been begging for this for the past like decade. But to be fair, making a samurai Assassin's Creed feels like such a waste of an Assassin's Creed game. The coolest thing about the Assassin's Creed franchise is the fact that its games take us to settings that we can't experience in any other game. No other game allows you to explore Italy during its Renaissance era, America during its revolution, ancient Egypt. Even if Ubisoft was like, hey, we're making Assassins Creed Unity 2, I'd probably be more excited for that than the Japanese Assassin's Creed game. Because this is a setting we never get to explore in games. Meanwhile, why do we need another game where we learn to become a samurai when there's already ghosts of Tsushima, Neos 1 and 2, rise of Ronin? Ten years ago, a Japanese assassin Creed game sounded awesome, especially considering the fact that the franchise was still about stealth back then. Now it's like, oh cool, another setting we've seen done a thousand times already.",

The crew of the 50-foot Alberon Co\u00f1ac sailboat calling for help early Sunday, a few miles from the Strait of Gibraltar  in Moroccan waters, saying orcas damaged the rudder  and the yacht was taking on water. The crew rescued, the boat sank. The same pod of orcas have been toying with boats off the  Atlantic coast of Spain, Portugal, and France since 2020. More than 400 encounters sinking  at least five boats. This particular pod is critically endangered and scientists say returns to the same  area every year looking for bluefin tuna. Marine conservation group  Ocean Care stressing \u201cWe do not believe that the orcas\u2019  behaviour is any form of revenge or a deliberate attack on people.\u201d Experts think the orcas may actually be  teaching each other how to break boat rudders.

You need to get more fiber into your diet. Things like berries, things like broccoli, things like asparagus, things like Brussels sprouts. And I know it sounds super cliche to tell you to eat more fruits and vegetables, but I promise you, that's the reason why you're having digestive issues, and that's the reason why you're constantly bloated, and that's the reason why you're constantly inflamed. If you add more fruits and vegetables into your diet, everything is gonna flow better through your digestive system. So what I recommend is things like strawberries, blueberries, raspberries is another good option. Pretty much all the berries, or even avocados. So make this small switch of just adding more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and I promise you, you gonna digest food a lot better, and you're gonna retain a lot less water, which in return, is gonna make your stomach appear a lot flatter. A lot of the times, you guys think you're not seeing results, but in reality, you just fucking bloated and you retaining water because all you eat is processed shit. You eating too much of that. So let's include more fiber until your diet to fix that.",

You need to include more fruits and vegetables into your diet to really help reduce bloating, inflammation and water retention, which can definitely impact the scale. Your biggest issue is that you eat too much processed foods, you need 85% of your diet to include Whole Foods that are high in fiber. Try to incorporate a serving of fruits and vegetables of your choice into every meal & you will see a noticeable difference in the way you digest food, bloating & water retention. In most cases you think that your not making progress when in reality your food choices is dramatically impacting the scale.

    "view_count": 105439,
    "voice_to_text": "Steady. Look out! Eyes! The sound of instructors feedback is familiar to personnel past and present who've gone through military training in the UK and overseas. Yes, sir, but in the British Army that's all changing. Yeah, it's not quite like Padlands Army anymore. Um, it's very different. The. The instructors actually go through a two part training before they even come here. So they've got the AITC which is a long course where they get all their prerequisite qualifications. They got their DTC which um, allows them to teach competently and confidently in front of the recruits. And that's often reflected on the drill square. There's no longer this, like you say, shouting and screaming all the time, although there will definitely be one authoritative voice. Other people can walk around, um, can tell people quietly to get in step or just give recruits to help. They need in a more, um, more comfortable and more better, better learning environment. So historically, I think recruits may will have been slightly scared of their instructors, um, but that's not what we're trying to portray at all. It's not easy, so joining the army is not an easy process, but that experience should not be something that people don't enjoy. The army's evolving. The climate and culture that we're trying to inculcate in basic training is one of which is investing in the recruit. We're not trying to get rid of people by any shape or form. We're trying to develop People and make them into soldiers. If they're here, they're clearly suitable. The army's deemed that to be suitable to be a soldier. They pass their selection, their aptitude. Our job is then to get them across the line. There's a lot different from when I went through. When I went through, it was just get Belfast information and then from there, doing a test or assessment. It is a lot less pressure on the recruits, which then gives them room to breathe, think. And taking information at a steady pace. So instructors are less scary. But does that mean the course has been softened? At no point are we changing the. The standard. This is all about now, getting the recruit to that standard. Yeah, it's not soft at all. Um, it's very much the same standard. It's very much just the approach in which we unlock a recruit's potential. That's the. That's the thing that's changed. Using technology, being more empathetic, but by no means that it becomes soft. Firm but fair, that's the way I like to put it. Tom Sables, forces news."

The peak call of duty games and X defiant actually have a lot of things in common, one of them being the brains behind the operation, Mark Rubin, who worked for Activision as the executive producer during the Modern Warfare series. But more importantly, he understands better than anyone that skill based matchmaking has played a huge factor in a call of duty struggles. So today the team released a statement confirming there will be no skill based matchmaking in the casual playlist for X Defiance. The statement continues on saying skill based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive, constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and varied, similar to how prime call of duty was. X defiant will find matches in order of these priorities latency avoided, players, party size, region, input device, and then platform. Once in the lobby. Teams will still be balanced though. They also confirmed that ranked will be added in a future season, and those matches will be prioritized based on ranked points.",

Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. Well, you saw that, and it's hard to believe it's true, but it is. That's Kansas City chief kicker Harrison biker dressing college graduates, women in the crowd telling them, you've been fed a lie. That degree you have means nothing. There's only two things that matter in this world. Being an adoring, attentive wife and a mother. Those are the only things that will make you happy. Taking care of your husband and raising those children. And this is the definition of toxic masculinity. This is a terrible, destructive message to women, and once again, unbelievable. That this college invited him to speak to women about to graduate, telling them this college is fed you a lie.

I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Hank the tank was connected to a string of home break ins in which she would reportedly make her way into people's kitchens and enjoy a buffet. The 500 pound black bear was labeled as extremely large by wildlife officials and a nuisance by the media. But as she started to make headlines, people all over started falling in love with her. After all, while she was causing property damage, it wasn't her fault that she was smart enough to find an easy meal. And she probably didn't even know that she was breaking any laws. However, as amusing as her crime streak may have been for third parties, the situation was becoming dangerous. Because she'd lost her fear of humans and become habituated to human food, she was determined to be a risk to public safety. As her break in count climbed, authorities said that they even started to consider the last resort option of euthanasia. But the public, including local residents, didn't want Hank the tank to be harmed and push for more investigation into the alleged crimes. As it turns out, DNA evidence showed that Hank the tank was only responsible for 21 of the break ins. Other bears were culprits for the rest. In light of this new evidence, euthanasia was taken off the Table. But Hank was still so used to human food that she wouldn't thrive being relocated to a fully wild environment. She ended up moving to a 12 acre sanctuary in Colorado called the Wild Animal Sanctuary. She's now living her best life and she even has her own pool.",

I don't want that we've already seen how that's gone women had their rights taken away because of Donald Trump so let's make the right decision even if you don't like Joe Biden let's have a Liberal court going forward so our rights can be protected sound\u00a0good?\u00a0sounds\u00a0good\u00a0to\u00a0me\u00a0amazing"

Remember in the beginning of this when the Kendrick Lamar fans was telling us we don't care about numbers, don't bring up numbers, don't bring up sales, don't bring up streams. We don't care about your record breaking streams and all that. You got this about hip hop and hip hop only. We don't wanna hear nothing about numbers. Now I'm on Facebook having a debate with a few Kendrick Lamar fans and all they throwing in my face is how well Kendrick Lamar's disses have been streaming. I thought this wasn't about numbers. And what's really wild is that Kendrick Lamar has never streamed as well as he's streaming right now. So the question I got for all the KDOT fans is this what is the one common denominator to the songs that Kendrick Lamar has streaming well right now? Don't all say it at once.

She would pick one girl up, take her to see Dune, share a bucket of popcorn with her, take her ice skating, buy her a hot chocolate, tell her how pretty her eyes were on the way home. The next day, she would pick the other girl up, take her to see Dune, the same movie, share a bucket of popcorn with her, take her to the same ice skating rink, buy her hot chocolate, and tell her how pretty her eyes were on their way home.

And this was a major buttload of molten aluminum at over 20 pounds. The liquid metal went down to the Orbeez and then solidified. And as I try to retrieve it out of there, I realized a little bit too late that this stuff was still very, very hot. So I let it cool down a little bit more. And then pulled the structure up out of the Orbeez. This was by far the largest one that I've ever made like this. And I couldn't wait to see what this thing look like. As I extracted it from the barrel, I could see that it was this beautiful, shimmering, coral like structure. It's amazing that the metal, being so hot, will still form around the Orbeez. And those things kind of stay intact. As you can see here, they just kind of fall out of the metal structure. As the metal would flow down through the barrel, it actually branched out in spots, which is really cool. Once I mount this thing to a heavy base, it will be a totally rad sculpture."

And yet I'm trying to maintain two places to live. I have clothes and two places. Have a car and two places. It's very difficult. When I got to Congress, I realized, holy smokes, that comes out of my pocket without reimbursement and you're not allowed to write off any of the expenses. Had a roommate. Every time I rented an apartment, upwards of 100 Congress members actually sleep in their office cause it's expensive. Washington's expensive. All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this. Do you want it to still be the house of the people, or do you want it to be only wealthy people? I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments. I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment. I think it should at least keep up with inflation. It. It should probably go up with the cost of living. Congress works better when you have a broad swath of the American people being able to run and get elected. I really believe that."

    "voice_to_text": "It's a gang. The ATF has been ramping up their efforts to criminalize everyday law abiding gun owners. We had the pistol brace rule, the frames and receivers rule, their crackdown on kitchen table Ffls, rogue dealers, simple clerical errors, going after Gabriel Metcalf in Montana, pointing guns at kids in Oklahoma, harassing old ladies in their hotel rooms, arresting the wrong man here in South Carolina. And of course the recent shooting of the airline executive, during which the ATF so conveniently forgot to wear their body cams and put tape over his ring doorbell like the criminals they are. They also just put out their final rule on requiring basically every gun owner to have an FFL to be able to sell any of their guns for a profit. This is part of ByteDance Safer Communities Act, which essentially makes it so that someone can't even sell off a single gun. Whether it's because they don't want it anymore or want to sell it to a friend, or are looking to sell assets because the economy sucks and they need more money to pay their bills, doesn't matter. Whatever the reason, private sales have always been part of the tradition in history of the Second Amendment, going back even before the Constitution was actually even written. So it's no surprise that the rule, which is supposed to take effect this month, is facing some legal pushback. This lawsuit was filed May 1st by a Kansas judge and the attorney generals Of 21 states",

That made no sense, but you catch my drift. Okay. Only 5% of our ocean has been discovered. And that's why I only go knee deep, because the first time I go out there, I'm gonna get bit by one of these supposedly extinct species. Made a video one time about the Baja dolphin still being alive. There ain't no way it's dead. There ain't no way. Why is 95% of the ocean unexplored? Conditions in the deep sea environment include very high pressures, total darkness, extreme temperatures, and toxic chemicals. Bsbsbs. They got ate by freaking dinosaurs. They can't go down there because there's. There's creatures down there probably bigger than my house. what had happened was they went down there and they never came back because that megalog Donna shark probably ate them.

I don't know if you really heard me correctly. So little girl at school that was getting bullied. And the daddy went through all the proper measures to make sure he didn't have to do what he did. Sent letters, hey, please get your little girl to stop bullying my daughter. Had a meeting with the parents. Please control your little girl. Beat her, but spank her. Do whatever you got to do to stop her from bullying my little girl. So all the day, and none of it worked. A little girl still getting bullied. So they'd like, hey, I got to take medicine to my own hand. I can't beat up a little girl, little seven year old daughter girl. So i'mma beat her daddy ass. So that way she gonna feel it and experience and see, get the visualization of what happens when somebody is picking on somebody or they basically bully him and they say, well, why won't one on one the dude? Like, what she. You getting jumped by responsibilities every day. Life ain't fear. You get what I'm saying? And I agree. I wholeheartedly, hundred percent agree. And do was a big ass do. So I'm pretty sure you probably get him do by himself. But he wanted that daughter to feel it. That Ain't gonna be goddamn bullying my daughter. Hmm? Hell no. And I hundred percent agree. And most people, the people that don't agree is people that don't got daughters, they don't got kids. You get what I'm saying? And it's different with a little girl. Cause my son, he better not come to me talking about he getting bullied. We gotta put your ass in boxing class. We about to get you right. I'm about to beat your ass. You about to get right. You ain't getting bullied by another man. Hell no. But your daughter. Oh, he messed with my princess. You gonna have to feel it. Somebody gonna feel it. So I. She knows. I'm all for him. I'm all with him. You know what I'm saying? And for the ones like, you know, you got to have. Just like he said, you gonna have repercussions for your actions. But he gonna have repercussions for his actions as well. But I'm willing to do it. What if it ain't nothing but a fight? A jumping lynching charge I take for mine. You get what I'm saying? It's better than actually going up smoking somebody, right? It's just a fist fight. But y'all already know. Let me know what y'all think about it. I believe he did the right thing. He took the proper measures. He tried to de escalate the situation the. The right way. But it never got de escalated. So I had to take medicine to My own hand. And beat his ass. Me and my brothers. So then right in front of his daughter so she can see. And I bet she wants to put. I bet she won't touch that little girl no more. I guarantee she won't. Let me know what y'all think, though.

I was actually pretty excited to see her because she always asks me when I'm gonna try and lose weight. And I was really excited to tell her that I have lost 90 pounds. And so of course, the topic came up. She asked me if I was dieting. I said yes, and she said, well, how's that working out for you? And I said, well, actually, I've lost 90 pounds. This woman cannot hear for shit, but she does have perfect eyesight. And with those two eyeballs in her 88 year old head, she looked me up and down and said, well, you don't look like you lost any weight at all, but congratulations. Thanks, grandma. Mind you, this is the same woman that, when I was 7 or 8 years old, told me that she used to really worry that I would never find a man to marry because I was so fat. But she decided that there's bound to be at least one man out there that would realize that having a fat wife is a good thing. Because I could never cheat on him. Man, that has stuck with me. I definitely talked about it in therapy today.",

Jamie Lloyd has brought the story to the modern age with Tom Holland as Romeo, Francesca Amidale Rivers as Juliet. The whole cast was really powerful. Spoilers again. The stage is totally bare. The show uses cameras on stage and backstage throughout. Did it add to the story? No. Was it fun to watch? Yes. You? Parts of the show I found quite scary, grungy, jumpy. But that's Jamie's style. The audience went wild for Francesca and Tom, who's quite snotty by the end of it, his character does a lot of crying. But overall, it was great seeing him back on stage and what an evening we had.",

    "voice_to_text": "Reviewing the seventy five dollar plate from some Mars. So yeah, I went to some Mars Kitchen. He was selling a place on Facebook, if y'all didn't see. And what's on the menu is fried chicken, green beans, um, mashed cheese and gravy, a roll. He had mountain, um. Mountain holler or bottled water. But I got a little bottled water, which why we getting great value water for $75. But it's kind of rip off. But it's okay cause I thought with some more heavy. And then he also had chocolate chip cookies and um, Malcolm Damien cookies. So I caught the chocolate chips. I don't know what Malcolm Damien cookies are, but I got the food. I'm about to try and let it. Yes, I know if it's good or not. Y'all ready? Alright. I'm sorry guys. Hey man, thank you for the food. So we're gonna try the green beans first. They look kind of yummy. Like them. Um, I mean they're not that bad, but for $75 they could have had a little more seasoning though. Some more. Let's try to make sure that doesn't gravy off. This dude look kind of good y'all. Even though he didn't put no gravy. He mixed the gravy in and he really put it on the top like normal people. But it's okay. Okay, try. Okay. The mash is good. Well, let's try the chicken. I don't know why kind of look like this, but damn. I guess you Cook the chicken together here and break it apart before it's okay. Here's the chicken. Are you ready? Um, this kind of cold. A little stale too. But there's chicken. And then try a little roll in a row. But on. Let's try. The cookies are the chocolate chip cookies. But um, I think he said he baked these at home. But I don't know how you bake little cookies like these. But let's try. I'm alone. It tastes like Chip Ahoy. But the minis. So is this the minis? Did he just rip me off with some? You know what it was like? And y'all why he didn't give me the 10 dollar discount? And like, I'm pretty as fuck. He didn't give me no discount. Not the 20 dollar one for sending your man to get it or me for being pretty in person. So some are really F you for real on the hood, bitch, you don't wanna fight. But anyways, let me know down below in the comments if you want me to review some other people's place. Let me know. Bye.",

I told her that if it's a contractor comes to my house, if they're better looking than me, I've already got the job done. Sorry, I was mistaken. Actually, you know, myself. Yeah, I said I could do this on my own. Dude, a realtor. Fat other guys, a realtor. You can have a hot realtor. Really? I kind of think you wanna. no, no, no.

Not really, because what do you buy a house for her for? For one reason. I'm just kidding. Relax. It was a joke. Was a joke. Okay, my second one. Moving on that I told her she's not allowed. As if our kids go to, like, the first day of class and their teachers hot. He's good with kids, and he's hot. Just fit. Being real nice to my children. We're moving school. That's why we move to a new district. All right? Buy a new house. Buy A new. From the ugly realtor? No chance my wife and him were having any parent teacher conferences, all right?

After South Korea proposed last week, $75,000 per baby that a family has, Japan is in desperate need, okay? And they are calling all black men, specifically immigrants, um, to come and impregnate their women so that they can save their dying population. I don't understand, because, you know, black men were once and still is, on the inner side, side of the line, which means their lives. I mean, what. What are you going to guarantee us if we send our men over there to help save you? Could you imagine? Think about this. After everything they put us through, everything, y'all trying to take these men out now you need them to repopulate the earth? The United States is responsible for what's going on over there in Japan. Why should we be held responsible? And get this, they ain't even paying no money to do it. They're just saying, please, please, black men, immigrants, please come have babies without women. Here's the thing. We gonna need the Russian test, because it could be from what happened years ago as to why their population is down. You know what I'm saying? That stuff still in the soil, it's still in the air. You already know what I'm talking about. What's that white man name that thought it Was a genius idea to create the biggest bullet in the world. Oklahoma. Yeah, that's his name. So why is it that, you know, y'all called him this? Y'all called him that? You is late and you did this, and now you ain't calling? You ain't calling, but you calling. But to come save your community. And i'mma go over there and i'mma start me a negotiation firm over there in Asia and stuff. And I'm going to have black men come breed with them. But they're gonna get benefits. They're gonna get lifetime Protection from any type of child support. If they decide to leave and don't wanna stay in these here countries, they're going to be set for life. Which means anything that these kids bring, it is gonna come back directly to the black family. Which means if I send Shek over there to breathe, right? Let's just say, hypothetically, I sent him over there on a contract breeding. Anything that these kids inherit is gonna come back to us the same way they do it with these. You know, we used to be slaves on this land out here. And anything that we work, you know, I'm saying they own and went back to their family, we gonna start sending it back to Africa, back to the black families. That's the type of contract I need. If you need this, burn, because this one ain't dying. We gonna get our kickbacks out of here. Moving on.",

So recently, a portal was installed in Dublin in New York, and it's supposed to act as a live camera between both locations. But it hasn't even been four days since it was installed. And we had a woman get arrested because of the portal for blocking people from seeing the screen. We had a flip off battle between Dublin and New York where people were flipping each other off, which started on Dublin side. A man also decided to do this in front of the portal, surprising everyone on the New York side. And now, out of disrespect, someone decided to show a picture of September 11 on Dublin side again. This all happened in under a week, and they're contemplating on doing something back to Dublin because of this. Many are also wanting the portal to be removed, specifically. Typically after this incident, now people are not happy. And all the problems we had regarding the portal surprisingly seem to be coming from Dublin. These problems, however, were anticipated, and it's the reason why the portal won't be up for much longer. Right now, it's scheduled to be removed in November. And many are glad that it's gonna be gone since it's been causing nothing but problems. And who knows, we might be getting the removal date even earlier if something crazier happens."

So I am actually more bothered by her apology video than I am the original video of her saying let them eat cake. Because she honestly thinks that we now believe that her life is normal, that she doesn't live an elite life when she has 10 million followers. Will close to 10 million followers. According to Google, every month she makes anywhere from $250,000 to $500,000 in a month. Her apartment is around $17,000 a month. She gets invited to the Met Gala by E! To interview the top celebrities she models. She goes on red carpets like the Oscars. Yet she wants us average Americans, many who are struggling, to now feel sorry for her and believe that she is living a normal life like us. Which just proves why many of us do not want to follow any people like this anymore because they are so out of touch, they are so delusional, and they are wildly disrespectful. To try to make struggling Americans actually believe that they give a damn about what we're going through and that they comprehend the struggle that we're actually having. Being able to afford an apartment at $8,000 a month makes you elite, let alone $17,000 a month. And I don't give a shit who this offends. I'm not saying she didn't work hard to get there. I'm not saying that she didn't Sacrifice. I'm not saying that like I am bitter over the fact that she's a millionaire. Good for her. But if I were a millionaire, I wouldn't come on here and be so fucking tone deaf to say that I'm a normal person. This is why I never followed celebrities or big influencers to begin with. Because I know they are so out of touch with reality that they are so full of shit that I can't stand it. Okay, so let's keep blocking all these people. I can confidently say I didn't follow a single one of them in the first place. An apology. Videos like this just prove why I never, ever, ever have gave a shit about celebrities. Because they will never understand what it's like to actually struggle anymore. Ever.",

Or you write a screenplay about high school, which is arguably even more unforgivable. My idea for America, okay? Enforced female celibacy and male homosexuality state mandated at gunpoint.

Live life on your terms - unapologetically. Your life is not a trial run. Follow my account as I share our numbers on how we fund and how much we spend on our dream life, family travel tips with our tiny travelers, and homeschooling shenanigans all over the planet. We will all have meltdowns along the way. But we are making so many memories on this lifetime journey. Happy Mother\u2019s Day weekend from me to you!  #traveltok #travelbucketlist #familythings #cruisetok #worldtravel #homeschool #homeschooling #foryou #foryoupage #fypage #motherslove #mothersoftiktok ",
    "voice_to_text": "I just spent $70,000 for my family of five to take a cruise next year and before you go freaking out on me let's run some numbers and let's talk some details I booked two rooms at $35,000 a piece on the cruise ship and then I'm gonna budget around $10,000 to um fly and to the starting point for the cruise and then let's throw in another $10,000 just for some random shenanigans right so we're $90,000 uh all in for this trip for my family of five our daughters are 6 7 and 9 years old ninety thousand dollars divided by the hundred and sixteen nights that our family is going to be on that cruise ship comes to around seven hundred and seventy five dollars let's divide that by five when you divide that number by five it comes to $155 per person per day to take the trip now let's think of the things I won't be spending money on because I'll be on a cruise ship in 2025 for at least four months I won't be getting one Amazon package or six per day uh I'm also canceling our subscriptions so no more Disney plus no more Netflix we're going to save a lot of money on this trip no more random shopping at target or Walmart or um Barnes and noble where I spent $150 yesterday I will no longer be paying for someone to clean my house I will be paying extra for someone to do our laundry I won't be getting a rental deposit on the first of the month and then looking up flights on where we could go on vacation like I do every other month um because we will be on vacation I won't be spending money on clothes on books on toys on life in general we're each um in our family of five taking one backpack for the four month trip and full disclosure we plan on it being much longer than that um our flights are gonna be one way flights and then we're just gonna see where life takes us from there because I can't imagine what life looks like on the other side of this uh trip it's gonna be awesome this will be our first experience homeschooling our daughters which has always been a goal for us so this is forcing us into it we are homeschooling from a cruise ship all over the world oh I'm also gonna add the cruise ship does have kids club included in the price so um we made sure that was a part of the this puzzle as well taking a world cruise has been on my husband and I's bucket list um for a long time we always thought that we would take a cruise like this um around the entire world whenever our girls graduated high school and we just had this epiphany this year like why the heck are we waiting just not I'm not a waiter if I have a goal I make it happen and so we are making it happen one of things I hear parents say a lot is I can't wait till the kids are old enough to remember it so we can travel together mmm I remember it right now I'm gonna go do it right now if they don't remember it I hope that they remember a little some pieces of it but even if they don't all remember this is my life too these are my memories too and right now I'm interested in my Saturdays being spent in Rio de Janeiro Argentina Bora Bora Australia and not on the soccer field now I know a trip like this isn't for everyone right um there's health reasons that you might not be able to take this trip there's financial reasons you might not be able to take this trip I am coming from a place where our family can't afford this our family is already living a life where we are spending close to that amount every day anyways and so if I'm gonna spend that here in Florida I might as well spend it traveling to around 20 countries um in this four months next year for us is just sampling the world to see where we can go back to my husband and I um have designed a life where we rent Airbnb's um anywhere we want for an extended period of time with our daughters and we um just go sample places live slow um and so this is our way of going and seeing some other um places and destinations throughout the world and us saying hmm could we live here for three four six months yeah let's add it to the list now for those of you who do have your life in place where perhaps this could be an option right you're a small business owner who could run your business from anywhere in the world just have some internet access and take it from cruise ship have the option of homeschooling your children uh think outside the box what life do you want to live and are you living it if not let's figure it out when I household some families um here in Pensacola Beach about uh our plan um they start writing the numbers themselves and going actually that's not bad and here's why um there's two separate families that I've talked to that have talked about going on a Disney cruise I'm not knocking Disney cruises um I'm just running numbers right so one family said they took a family of 10 to like extended family grandparents uh etcetera on a one week Disney cruise and guess how much it was they spent $40,000 for those 10 people to take that seven night cruise um together and what a beautiful amazing experience right what a blessing that they were able to pay for that for their family for their extended family and man what memories but let's run the numbers on that forty thousand dollars divided by seven nights comes over 50 seven hundred dollars per night divide that by 10 to get the daily rate per person comes to five hundred and seventy one dollars so would you spend $40,000 for a family of 10 to go on a Disney cruise for one week or would you spend $90,000 for your family of five to um travel the world for four months there's certainly no right or wrong answer and just understanding that everything is a choice your dream life is possible and it may not cost a million dollars for you to get there are we gonna have some meltdowns on that four month cruise yeah probably from all five of us but are we gonna make a bunch of memories along the way yep and that's what we're gonna retire on on our memories and that's why we're going to not wait and make them today I am gonna be sharing all of our numbers um all of our travels and all of our shenanigans meltdowns included on this account so follow along to be continued"

That's gonna be the case with literally every game. I've been seeing so many people say that this game looks like trash just because it looks similar to Overwatch, and all you're doing is harming the gaming industry. Hey, you know all of those things you hate about Overwatch? Like the crazy expensive monetization, the super long Q times, the fact that they never put out any of the things that they promised they will? Why would any of those things change if Blizzard knows people are gonna keep coming back to this game regardless of how they behave? But if there's a competitor out there who's giving people the things they wish Overwatch were giving them and actively taking players away from Overwatch, lizard will be forced to make their game better. Companies having competition is great for consumers. And having this blind hatred towards a game that hasn't even come out yet simply because you don't want it to detract from the game you like is damaging the game you like."

    "voice_to_text": "this male teacher had his girl students unbraid his hair in class and he also live streamed it now there's a big discussion circulating on the internet on whether or not this was appropriate when I first saw the video I thought it was weird but harmless with the way he explained it he said he couldn't do it before work because he has something to do in school that day where he had to look presentable and on top of that his appointment was right after work so he wouldn't have the time to embrace it by himself at the end of the day when the kids finished their school work blah blah blah mean it seemed like the kids were excited to do it they had their combs and everything looks like the students like him a law he's probably the cool teacher of the school a lot of the comments were on his side saying that this is normal in the black community how we need to stop xualizing little girls I can only speak to my experience and I went to predominantly black schools my whole life this would never fly with the black teachers at my school I mean they did not play about their job they were all extremely educated I mean at least two bachelor's master's doctorate degrees no matter how cool they were they wouldn't do anything that would be deemed inappropriate at school cause they did not wanna throw all their hard work away you could even step too close to the desk or they tell you to back up although I don't think this teacher is this malicious scary guy this is still highly inappropriate and if you didn't want the criticism you shouldn't have been on live during school hours also thought about either one of my daughters came home from school and told me that they're unbraiding their teacher's hair especially if it was a man there would be a big problem either he gonna have to lose his job or she won't be in that class anymore and although I truly believe he didn't mean any harm he should have been way more responsible like don't schedule your hair appointment on the school day don't go on live during school hours don't post your students on the internet unless you're giving them a cut of that check that you're getting from TikTok obviously there's people that would be cool with this but if it's to the point that you gotta go to the internet and ask is causing this huge debate to the point that you got to defend yourself online to be on the safe side you just shouldn't allow it period anyways y'all let me know what y'all think in the comments and was this normal in your schools"

Where they know that the population, the audience, that US, holds the power to everything, that when we say stop, everything will stop with a collective mind or a collective consciousness. How is it that we have come to this point in life? Human beings, we are growing in consciousness. Oh, my gracious. Can you imagine? Like, celebrities are coming out now, apologizing. People are not. They're not coming out and saying, because their pockets are affected. Of course it is human beings. They said, a hungry man is an angry man. No one wants to be hungry. You don't even want to be in that position. But they all see the Congolese children, TRC children that are on been on alive, mothers that are striving so hard. Some are eating sands in Palestine, in Sudan, just to name but a few places that millions are displaced and unalived and hungry and starving, but nobody cares because if they talk is gonna affect their pocket. But we, the population, have come to that consciousness that we actually are the ones feeling of their pockets, even though we're not directly giving them the money, but we are the ones that are making these companies fill up their pockets, so we have the power to unfill those pockets. Oh, my goodness, this is such a good time to be alive. In this universe, collective consciousness is what we can use to do anything we want. One mind, one body, one soul together and our aim will come to fulfilment.",

HP officers were notified of a pursuit coming into the Ventur area from Santa Barbara County just before 9 p m. Saturday. The driver at the wheel is alleged to be Felicity Hughes of Camarillo. She eventually exited the freeway and went towards Auto Drive Mall before she turned down a dead end road onto a private lot. She then made a U turn and hit the gas before striking her patrol vehicle, leaving that cop car undriveable and an officer with minor injuries. She was then taken into custody without further incident. Hughes was charged with evading police and willful disregard and assault with a deadly weapon. She was transported to Todd Road Jail in Santa Paula with a 50 thousand dollar bail set. An on scene photographer whose tag below captured the scene because when news breaks were on scene."

You're unaware there's currently a trend going around on TikTok and gaining a lot of popularity of people that are blocking celebrities on social media. Celebrities such as Oprah, the Rock, Kim Kardashian. The thinking behind this is that these celebrities have ascended into almost a god like tear in society. They're so rich, they're so famous, and they do a lot of weird stuff, and they don't give a shit about us. If we all just go and block them and don't pay any attention to them, then they lose all of their brand deals, all of their ad revenue, and all of their popularity. And this trend literally just started two weeks ago, but has picked up major popularity in the last few days. And Kim Kardashian has already lost 3 million followers on Instagram. And I personally think this is awesome. I mean, these celebrities are so rich and famous, and then they go to these places like the Met Gala, which, by the way, cost $75,000 per ticket, and they dress up in all this weird, demonic shit, just act like they're better than everyone else when they don't realize that we're the reason that they're famous in the first place. So now you let me know, what celebrity should we do next? Should we do Taylor Swift? Should we do Doja Cat? Who should we do?",

In fact, probably more than than most other candidates, um, when you're running for president. But I still would not have voted for you, um, because you're an Indian. We'll get back to that. Um, and Coulter told me flat out to my face that she couldn't vote for me, quote, because you're an Indian. Even though she agrees with me. The most other candidates, I disagree with her, but respect that she had the guts to speak her mind. Republican presidential candidates are completely lights on. No one's home.

    "voice_to_text": "Why is my vibration not always going up? Why does it sometimes go down? Here's why. Remember that some time ago we said expansion and evolution. And growth is the product of inclusion, not exclusion. You are gathering all of the things from lower vibrations you need to look at, to integrate them into the higher vibration. So your general cycle is rising into a high vibration. That gives you the ability to dip into the lower vibration and bring up to the higher vibration issues, beliefs, definitions that you need to resolve, that you need to integrate, that you need to process. And by going on a higher vibration, it gives you the ability to do that, to dip lower, so that you're gathering all of yourself together, including all of your experience of life. And as you do that, it's not that you're going like this and traveling in a straight line. You will start doing this and start averaging a higher vibration. As you dip down, you will not dip down as far as you did before. As you rise up, you will rise higher and higher. And the average of those two, no matter how high you rise and how low you may go, the average of those two will constantly be rising. That is how you do it. So invite the idea of what seem to be the low points. Because it is those low points that allow you to gather things that you don't Wanna leave behind ideas that you need to examine, beliefs and definitions that you need to process in order to truly integrate yourselves as holistic beings and raise your vibration in general, to be able to manifest the life you prefer more and more easily through ecstatic explosions of synchronicity. Because synchronicity is one of the first and primary side effects of beginning to live in the moment, beginning to live in the now, beginning to be your true self. Synchronicity is space, time, physical realities way of showing you that all things exist now, but in linear space time. The only way that you can experience that is by many different things happening coincidentally all at once, one after another, showing you that things are linked, things are connected, that you are manifesting these things. And as you live more in the now, where everything exists, then physical reality, which is a mirror, can reflect back to you through synchronicity more and more and more of all the things that exist with you right here, right now.",

Yesterday was a great day. My Chipotle bowl was full. The sun is out. Let me get out some compliments. I was telling the girls gays and days, they look amazing. Giving them their flowers. I'm walking home at night and this girl had a bomb outfit on. I'm talking dress to the nines. Wherever she was coming from, she tore that down. I was feeling myself walking home, but I had to stop and say, girl, you look good. When I tell you, the look on her face gags me. Curse, clutch, eyes wide. One girl was genuinely scared, which honestly kind of saddens me. I could tell she was scrambling for her words, but the first thing that came up was, oh, I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. One thing about me. I'mma make sure the girls feel comfortable. Had to clear my voice and I said, oh, baby, you look so good. And the gayest voice I could. Right when I did that, my girl unclench her purse, eyes relax until she was so relieved. It's all for a little bit. Afterwards, I said, girl, what you choose a right.

In Japan, bear paws are the favourite food of many wealthy people because they believe that this dish is a symbol of power. When cooking it, the chef will first boil the bear paw with onions and ginger. This process can help to remove its fishy flavor. When the bear paw is cooked, it will be cleaned with water and then carefully remove the hairs on the surface of the paw. When cleaning the hairs, the chef need to be very careful. Not only do they have to be in perfect shape, but also to clean the hairs. If too much force is applied, the shape of the paw will be broken. This needs a lot of patience. Once the nails and fur of the paw are clean, the chef will start to make the broth. The main ingredients used are pig bones and chicken claws, as well as onions, ginger, and other seasonings. While waiting for the broth to simmer, the bear's paw needs to be inspected again to make sure the hairs are cleaned out. Then wrap it in a piece of gauze and then put it into the soup to simmer again. After three hours of simmering, the bear paw has become very soft and sticky. The chef also makes a sauce with more than 10",

    "voice_to_text": "\"So two rocks slapped together in space and magically created life from non life and then evolution took over.\" No. No, no, that's not how anything works. I don't know exactly what this comment is attempting to reference. It was just left on a video from several months ago about why chimpanzees and humans are related but that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually came from one another. So I don't know if this is talking about abiogenesis or evolution or the big bang or what. I've heard similarly factuous things about all of those and so much more because there's a lot of people out there whose whole job it is to be wrong about science professionally. And then they go out and they do debates and they make creationist videos and they try really really hard to convince as many people as possible their mischaracterization of science as one person holding up a Bible and another person holding up On the Origin of Species and \"they both have books and you just have to decide which one to have faith in\" is in any way accurate or reasonable and it just isn't. That simply is not how science works. And aren't you glad? The whole reason you're able to watch my stupid face on your cellphone right now is because science doesn't work that way. So, if you wanna learn more about what science actually says and how it actually works, I have a whole channel over on the play button platform where I make lots and lots of videos about evolution and about the age of the earth and about all sorts of other cool science stuff and I even go out and debunk those pseudoscience videos that try to teach ridiculous nonsense like creationism. And I also host several live call-in shows where people can just call me directly, live on the air, and challenge me about evolution or about religion or about politics or whatever else! So check me out on those shows as well! I'll talk about some of them over here in the comment section. I hope to see you over there because I would really love to teach you science sometime.",

    "voice_to_text": "This man was a menace during the Civil War. Bob Evans, also known as the Hat Man, lived in the foothills of Kentucky during the 1800s. With no wife or kids, he lived alone as a farmer to make ends meet. In the year 1864, many battles took place near his farm and many soldiers would trespass onto his property and destroy his crops while passing through. This angered Bob so much to the point that he decided to take matters into his own hands. One day, a group of soldiers LED by their captain would walk onto the property despite a large no trespassing sign, when all of a sudden a pickaxe flying through the air would strike the captain, taking his life in an instant. The group of men would quickly run back to the entrance of the property, but it was too late. The hat man was already blocking the entrance, telling the men in a sinister tone, can't y'all read the sign? It says no trespassing! The group of men would never be seen again. As the months went by, many soldiers would go missing around the area of the farm. At this point, the Hat Man had become a legend as he did not discriminate. Soldiers from both sides of the war fell victim to the Hat Man. By the time the war was over, it was speculated that around 200 people had perished on the property due to the Hat Man's persistence. The legend Of the Hat Man was just that, a legend until the year 2008, when archaeologists would visit the property. What they discovered not only confirmed that the legend was true, but that what took place was even more horrifying than what they could have even possibly imagined."

Went off on it. He said it was a driver's license restraint, so it looks like on here. So she has a suspended driver's license. Here's a phone number on here for DMV, so we'll give her a ticket for the suspended driver's. Okay. All right. Hope you have a good night. Okay. I can be on any screen on the computer, and it hits on a license plate, it'll pop up. It's a pretty successful system. It's pretty easy to use. It can just. It looks like your driver's license was canceled. Yeah. Privacy is gone, people. They own your ass. It's almost like you riding around here now with police on everybody, police behind everybody. And it ain't about they got to be behind you anymore. Nah, shit is everywhere. They might get it boned in now they got face recognition, so fuck all that. Just your plate recognition is enough. See, watch. You can just ride by Boo boo boo. But it gets you from behind, too. You ride behind them, he can get you. That's the fucked up part. I'm making this video cause I was hit with this. And I was thinking like, how the hell this motherfucker knew? Or, you know, when we. We usually don't want the police behind us, right? This motherfucker was Pointed this way. So I said, let me make a quick left. But he turned around and still came for me. And I'm figuring out, like, is this camera picking up, um, any and everything around me? Then I came to see, and I started doing my research when I got home. Like, bro, they got cameras everywhere. And is doing that, and it getting the entail through them. Right now, you in a world where the police is always following you. So if you out there riding bowl plates and anything like wrong plates on this caution, they know now, bro. See, before they had to make it into law, they was trying to pass in law only to State Patrol can do it. Not all of this was going to play eight to 10 years ago. Think about it. Like I said today, they should not only reads plates and read faces. That's what I'm on. I'm gonna post my next video. They're gonna be meeting face. Y'all know. I'mma put y'all on to the game, cause now you don't have really no freedom. Talking about. They as nosy as they could be. Nosy, bro, that we already knew. They were taking pictures of you speeding and shit like that. Nah, fuck all that. They on your license plate, where you came from, everywhere you been, it's monitored.

But if you move a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right, your observable universe actually moves with you. For someone living in galaxy GNZ 11, a totally different part of the universe would be observable. The true extent of our universe doesn't end with galaxy G N Z 11. But when astronomers use the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to G N Z 11, they find something shocking. It's 32 billion light years away. Three times further than thought possible. So if nothing can travel faster than light, and we measure the distance to this galaxy, how can it be 32 billion light years away? There hasn't been enough time in the history of the universe for light from G and Z 11 to reach us. There must be some mistake here, right?",

    "video_description": "#foodforthought\ud83d\udcad The comments on my TikTok popped off on this one, so let me clarify. I\u2019m referring to the people who\u2019ve abandoned you when you thought you were building a foundation with them. The ones who left you when you set a boundary or when they didn\u2019t get what they wanted from you. Boundaries let people know how to still be there for you. The ones who leave without any effort to understand and hold space for you, were the ones who were benefitting off of you having no boundaries. As for the comments referring to when they left a relationship, it is not abandonment when you try reconciling and choose to leave after a lack of repair. When someone\u2019s incapable or unwilling to meet your needs, and you walk away, that\u2019s not abandonment, that\u2019s protecting your peace. Just because it feels like it is doesn\u2019t necessary make it so. You can love someone and still know that the relationship is no longer good for you. There is so much grief with these decisions. Be gentle with yourself when there\u2019s an ending without the closure you wanted. Ib: @Jay Shetty  \u2026\u2026 \ud83d\udc8c Looking for a therapist?

So everyone's housing, like, Gypsy's mother. Like, well, I feel like I'm, like a time capsule back in 2014. Oh, my god, my eyebrows look so good. Yeah, girl, I have eyebrows now. No shit. Do all makeup artists put their eyeshadow on before the foundation? I always put my foundation on first as, like, a base to everything I do on myself, look at yourself in the phone really quick, so. Because why I do it is because of all of the. And clean it all up, and then it makes your eyes a little bit more snatched and pulled back to. When I do my own makeup, I do my foundation first and then my eyes because I'm lazy. Like, have I been doing it wrong? No one fucks up a wing like you. So good. Thank you. So good. Never do the wing on myself. It always ends up like my foundation. For when I'm not tan, I'll use two face. And for everything else, like, Covergirl, sometimes I'll use. Or for lips. Seen people do, like, the tape trick. Oh, yeah. You ever try that? It works really well. It worked really well until, like, they try to do a wing as, like, a stencil. Yeah. Like, I just like the way It feels literally. Get your little live tutorial masterclass. I haven't been this before yet. Oh, my god. You're very good with that. For never having it done. I promise I've done it a million times. Oh, wow. It looks so good. Anything you want to change or add? I absolutely love it."

I am certain of it. Young LeBron would be the greatest tight end in NFL history. Westbrook could play in the NFL. I'm not sure the position. Josh Hart I think can be a wide receiver just based on his rebounding this playoffs."

    "voice_to_text": "There's a trend going around about blocking celebrities, and I am all for it. I want you to block every damn celebrity. Block Beyonce. Block Drake. Block Kendrick Lamar. Block every celebrity at the Met Gala. Block them all. I think this new trend where we start blocking celebrities on social media. Have been silent and complicit these past few months, is an absolutely genius initiative. But you know what? I think we can do more, and I think we can really hit them where it hurts. Let me explain how. You see, we know that these celebrities only care about their money. So what we're going to do is go after their businesses, like clothing lines or makeup lines, in order to really affect their sales. Let's start with Kim Kardashian, because I honestly cannot stand any person in that family. What we're going to be essentially doing is going to her online stores. Kim's selecting as many products as we can. Skincare, makeup, it doesn't matter. Just select as many products as you can, and then afterwards, we go to her online shopping cart right before purchasing, and then we just leave it there to sit. Abandoning your item to an online shopping cart can really affect that store sales. What it essentially does is that it limits the availability of this product to other customers who are actually interested in purchasing it. Second thing it does is that it can really confuse the store's marketing team into Their insights of customer behavior and patterns. Essentially, they won't really know what is actually popular and unpopular, what is actually in demand and what is not in demand. So let's get out there and start blocking these celebrities and putting as many of their items into shopping carts without actually buying them, because together, we can actually bring these celebrities down."

Step into the shadowed halls of Penhurst State School, where every brick echoes with the anguished cries of its forsaken souls. Built in 190 8, it became a haven of horrors for over 10,000 souls left behind by families. They were trapped in metal cribs and during harsh conditions, staff used drugs and chains as punishment. Some were isolated for so long they lost hope. Repeat biters lost all their teeth to the dentist. Thousands of teeth were removed in a rusty dentist chair that still sits in the tunnels beneath the complex. In 1968, reporter Bill Baldini exposed the institution, which LED to a massive lawsuit and the school was found guilty. The facility closed its doors in 1987 and left the doors to the tortured, sad spirits. Today, caretakers of the property believe that the buildings and underground tunnels are haunted by the angry spirits of patients who suffered and died here. There are reports of slamming doors, footsteps and sounds of vomiting coming from empty rooms. Some witnesses have seen the spirit of a little girl roaming the buildings, perhaps waiting to tell her own story of sorrow and neglect.",

Those southern people who stand on their front porch for the 12 gauge, waiting for a tornado to just come knocking up their door and knocking out their power are different breed, okay? Not me, not rally. I will be right here in this bathtub. Me and my dog will be right here, okay? I don't deal with no tornado activity. Do I look like a stormtrooper? Because I'm not. Okay? As for me and my house, we will be in this bathtub right here. I got a portable charger in case my power goes out. I got snacks, I got non perishables, and I got bottles of Watra, okay? I'm safe, secure, and sanctified. So if you need me, you better need me before I hear thunder, because it's awful calm outside right now. And you know what they say, the calm before the storm. I ain't blowing nowhere. Y'all have a good. And I'll talk to you tomorrow. If I'm alive.",

Little Mabu, real name Matthew Deluca, grew up in a five bedroom, five bath, 3,327 square foot condo in one of the richest areas of New York City. In his free time, he would escape to the Hamptons where he would stay in his parents 6,182 square foot mansion. The combined value of the properties is about $12 million.

You don't have a region where you can collect the sound, you can cultivate a sound. You can collaborate with a sound and present it to the world. And furthermore, you're black, and you're not even in touch with what black people are really sensitive about. You don't stand for. Which is why you brought up the slave shit. Or when I talked about the Pok shit, I was like, yo, why you playing with Pok, bro? You're not. You're not from that. Like I said, I was like, yo, that. That could be problematic for you, bro. Like, don't play with pock like that. Now you playing with the slave shit. That was a lot. Oh, and, oh, by the way, this one over a lot of people.

    "voice_to_text": "The sting of a stinging nettle is actually really good for us. The nettles contain needle like structures that inject us with histamine. This then triggers a response in us to produce our own antihistamines, which in turn strengthens our defence against seasonal allergies. Now it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but nothing ever is. The stings also trigger an awareness to our body, to a particular area. Our bodies will send extra blood to the area that has been stung, which is great for something like a sprained wrist or ankle and you're looking to reduce inflammation. The stinging nettle is our friend and certainly not our foe. When you start your journey of voluntarily stinging yourself, it may well feel unpleasant at first. However, if you stick at it, you'll build up a tolerance and that pain will become pleasure. Allow the nettles to pass on their strength and resilience onto you. The nettles are cool and loud and clear. Are you listening? Follow for knowledge."

    "voice_to_text": "If you're in music, what do you do? If you make your living in some former fashion in the music world, what is it you do? I found that over the years, one of the most encouraging things for me personally, and one of the things, one of the conversations that has propelled my career forward most is. Is this conversation. Because for me, and I think for many of us, the world of music, whether you're a producer, an engineer, a top line or a song or whatever it is you do, it's so ambiguous and kind of ominous that the job looks vastly different for every single one of us. So therefore, for me, sitting with people and hearing from them what they do, and I don't just mean a concise, like, distilled, quick answer, what would go on a business card or the top of a website? I mean with some detail, like, what does your daily life look like? How are you being pay? What services are you providing that you are being paid for that are then keeping you alive? Hearing from people what they do has helped me expand my horizons and. And realize there are more possibilities. Um, I'll give one concise example, and that is for many, many years, I worked in a commercial studio where I charged per hour because that's what the house did, so to speak, and that was fine. There's a time and place for that. But again, Just as a, as a simple snapshot of an example, there came a time where through conversation with someone much like this, just like sitting down, having coffee with someone and hearing about their career, I would have considered them appear we were at a very similar level. But I heard them articulate the way they charged per song and just other, other ways that were different than per hour. And in that moment I was like, oh my goodness. And in an instant I was like, it could be different than this. I didn't realize there were other options. And there's so much more than that. Again, I wanna hear. I, I, I actually think instigating this conversation, my hope is that people will stitch that initial question, answering it with some kind of detail, and I'll try to give a, and answer myself, maybe in a different video, cause I'd like to keep this somewhat brief. Um, but I, I think each of us sharing that not only is it a chance just to maybe be known, enjoy sharing what it is you do, but I think for you, the viewer, I, I hope you're also a poster. Like, I hope you'll join the conversation. But for those of you who view, myself included, I will view each and every one of these. I hope we're encouraged and that we are given new ideas and made to realize that there's more that's possible. Yeah! Let's have some fun! What is it you do? What do you do",

I cannot wait to see how legit it is, because these prom dresses, wedding dresses, are made out of fiber optic material that literally illuminate. If that's real, I'm gonna lose it. There she is. Okay. Comes with these. I don't know if those are, like, remotes. I guess we'll find out. I mean, she looks beautiful. Let me see if I can find out, like, where it turns on. Ah, product manual. Good. This is, like, a whole thing. Have to charge this, and then I have to download the app. Okay. This has to charge for three hours. So here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna charge this overnight. I'm gonna see you in the morning. Okay. It's the next day. Well, evening. I wanted to wait for it to get dark so we could see it. I charge that battery, and I downloaded the app. But a little bit of a tricky moment finding out where the battery pack, like, plugs in. Don't ask me how I did it. I just did. It was hard, but it was, like, up in the skirts. Let's just get her on and go from there. This works and looks amazing. I'm hoping to wear it to a Starfall ball in Orlando next weekend. Okay, we're in. Stunning, per usual. I'm not laced up properly in the back because that is hard to do by yourself. But here she is. It is looking quite bridal. And they do market these as wedding dresses, but obviously not for our purposes. So I put the power pack in, but now I have to refind it. See, I think it's in this, like, heavier skirt somewhere. Yep. Okay, I turned it on. Well, let's get this light out of here, shall we? Okay. Wait. Oh, my god. Oh, oh! Oh, my god. What? You can't see, but I'm crying. What is this? Okay, okay, okay, okay, everybody, everybody, hold on. So this color changing mode is what it does automatically, but I also downloaded the app where I think I can change the color and the modes, but the app is on my phone. Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna need time to figure out the app before I go to the ball so that I can change the modes, and I will show you guys that when I figure it out. But I. This is. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I can't believe this is on my body right now. So our mission is to figure out how to make this look a little bit less bridal and a little bit more, like Starfall Fantasy ball friendly. Like, I love this waistline, so I hate to add a belt, but it definitely needs something, because in the daylight, it's just gonna look like a wedding dress. I can't believe this. And Louis Sonata, they make Other things, too, like fairy wings, purses and all sorts of things. So, I mean, definitely go check them out. Wow.",

    "voice_to_text": "Kendrick fans I want you to give me one example of a situation where someone is genuinely and publicly accused of laying hands on their woman and they are better off not denying it not denying heinous crime like that has always been viewed as a soft admission of guilt until like two days ago for some reason not to mention this is a very public back and forth the entire thing has been you say this but it's really like this no you say this but it's really like this but when drinks like Yo bro I heard you hit your wife what's up with that Kendrick's like I would like to speak about your family now I will now accuse you of one of the few things worse than what you accuse me of so nobody cares about what I was accused of anymore Wop wop wop wop wop i'mma do my stuff you understand if Kendrick never addresses this he absolutely played you all like a fiddle y'all are acting like people are ridiculous for believing Kendrick might have put hands on his woman when Kendrick the man himself will not say that he hasn't put hands on his woman I need you to understand I'm closer to a delusional Kendrick fan than I am to an actual Drake fan like if Kendrick just said nope I didn't do it I'll probably believe him I'm not even saying that I think Kendrick did it as is I'm saying if you look at this objectively him not denying this is a bad look I don't see how it's a hot take to say that someone accuses you of a crime you should probably deny it nothing Drake has a weird proximity to underage women but you guys are doing this thing where you're acting like Drake being guilty makes Kendrick not guilty by default and that's not how that works and what's crazy is these alleged Drake victims are actually coming out and saying that there's nothing fishy between Drake and them but you know who hasn't come out to clear anybody's name Kendrick's wife or even Kendrick himself now bring up the people who are the victims defending Drake not to say he's innocent because I'm not so sure he is but to say at least he has people defending him Kendrick has nobody saying he didn't hit his wife except his fans I'm adding this in post cause y'all keep tagging me in videos of Drake kissing a 17 year old girl on stage I've seen that video I've never said Drake wasn't a p word I literally have a video where I was begging Kendrick to call Drake the p word anyone defending him kissing that girl on stage or texting 14 year olds is objectively wrong is that what you need to hear y'all acting like criticizing Kendrick is by default praising Drake and that is not how anything works y'all pointing out how her brother was supporting you understand victims of that often don't tell their relatives so her brother would have no idea some of y'all are saying oh he doesn't need to respond to this he responded to it in 2014 you mean 10 years ago the things allegedly that woman was not even his wife that's a completely separate event but even if it was the same event you're telling me you got accused of something 10 years ago and 10 years later gets brought up again it's that hard for you to say yeah no that didn't happen the things he doesn't have to put out a diss track to do it he can just say I didn't do it you were on Drake's head for days when he only chose to respond to the daughter allegation were like oh what are you gonna say about this Drake what you don't have the same energy for Kendrick at all who literally hasn't said anything about any claim and people are like oh but if he addressed it it's gonna look like he's heard about it those are bars for like the kidnapping hits for Jay Z being 36 in a karate class not for being accused of a heinous crime if I accuse you of a heinous crime and you say you didn't do it that's not me striking a nerve that's you clearing your name the thing that's so lost on this is don't you think Kendrick should want to clear his name if he didn't do it like shouldn't Kendrick want us to know that he did not lay hands on his woman otherwise it's a prime example of Kendrick misusing his influence he's probably conflicted right now so many people like ah receipts burden approved blah blah blah you understand to get to the burden approved level of the conversation the person actually has to deny the wrongdoing and then the burden of proof is on the accuser and I'm telling you right now chances are we're not gonna get any receipts okay because they are both accusing each other of crimes right so if they prove that they know that these crimes were taking place and they didn't say anything what do you think happens to them like you know that's illegal too right like it's I swear for people saying oh if he hit his girl there would have been a police report that's literally the same argument Drake made when he said if he liked young girls he would be arrested it's a if I'm a liar why aren't my pants on fire type defense like come on guys so many of you have a parasocial relationship with Kendrick Lamar you're like oh what my my K dot he would never heard a fly Kendrick would never lie to me real comments I've seen y'all are trusting Kendrick just because he makes good music and he's been vulnerable while he makes that music okay you understand him admitting to cheating on his wife is not the same as him admitting to hitting his wife like you you understand like why someone would admit one but not the other like cause one could put you in jail please I I did not know Kendrick fans lack this much concept I had no idea",

Actor Stormy Daniels, the woman who received $130,000 from Donald Trump's former lawyer, took the witness stand. She testified about what she says was a sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf outing in 2006. She said Trump invited her to dinner, she went to his hotel. It's then she says that Trump had sex with her. This is the first time that she was in a courtroom in a criminal trial, coming face to face with Donald Trump. Trump appeared upset at times. We expect to hear more from Daniels about that 130,000 dollar payment and about the aftermath.",

A lot of this is just red candy. Already know these are gonna be good. How do you know? I just know. Cause they remind you of the German version. Yeah. Okay, what are we trying first? Those. These ones. Okay, this is what we're gonna try first. We're gonna rate them. Thank you. Good, but underwhelming. Say six out of 10. 7, 6, six and a half. Try these nuts. These? I've actually had them before when we went to New York. I got Swedish candy and I really like them. Should I be expecting with this? It's like soft? Uh huh. These are 9.2 for me. Four. Four? Not like four. We have very different taste buds. We're trying these nuts. We have this White Center. You have a lady in the trap moment. So true. The other candy are you actually, I'm really underwhelmed. But maybe I'm spoiled by the German candy. I feel like German candy superior to all the candies. Maybe cause I'm German. But that's just my opinion. Starts out as a 3, off as a 4 because you like different textures. And then it gets grainy and it turns into three. Very interesting. What do we do next? The one that I like. This one. We gonna try these springs now. Okay. You need Yogurt taste like green apple, so that's a plus five. I feel my cavities already. Right now, these ones are next. Remind me of this German candy called Freddy Faka. They're Lucky's favorite candy, so let's see whether these compare to them at all, because they look kind of similar. I wonder whether the two colors have two different flavors. Mm. Hmm. It's, like, soft and chewy. Hmm. An eight 7 one. These, I've heard are really sour. Yeah. Let's try. Let's try. I think I need that. Something sour to break up all the sweetness. We have a yellow and red side. Let's try the red first. Hmm. To me, they're not that sour. The yellow side is really good. I think it's lemon. This is our last flavor. She's distracting me. I'm sorry. This is our last one. This is very similar to the other red one. I mean, I'll be honest, I'm very underwhelmed. Me, too. These stole the show. These ones were my favorite. But what's your overall rating for this candy? Like, would you repurchase? I wouldn't. Definitely would not repurchase. Those are a little taste test.",

    "voice_to_text": "There needs to be a study on why Serena Williams always looks a goddamn mess. I ain't gonna give her too much cause we know Serena Williams has experienced a lot of colorism and anti blackness throughout her career. But me saying that she looks a goddamn mess is not rooted in colorism and misogyny. While it may not be constructive, it is a valid critique. It's really the wigs that do it for me. The wigs are always dry. They never really compliment her skin tone. Her makeup always looks too damn light for her face. Plastic surgery is unrecognizable. She got these damn fillers in her face, got her looking like phaser parks. Her wardrobe is always ill fitted. She never wears anything that compliments her body. I'm tired of it. Almost positive that she has non black people styling her. The people who are styling her do not know how to style dark skin black women. It's a fact. And then it's like, you're rich, Serena, you got way too much fucking money to be out here looking like this. You gotta represent. You gotta represent for the dark skinned girlies. You've been looking a mess for the last 20 years and I'm fucking tired of it. I want her to take that goddamn blonde hair out of her head. You're not. Beyonce is not giving. Want her to go back to her roots and start wearing natural hairstyles, start wearing braids. Not meant you ain't got To wear the beaded braids, but start wearing more braided and more like natural hairstyles. I think that will compliment you a lot more. Choose to get a black stylist, preferably a black gay male stylist. And stop trying to look like a white woman. It just. I'm sorry.",

It seems like guys can just put the bare minimum and not even really put an effort anymore. They don't really care to. Or they're like, why don't girls just go and make the first move and make the effort? When did it become a thing? Now it's like roll reversal where they expect girls to be making the first moves, yearning for a guy and chasing him. That is, I feel, like, the downfall of why it's so hard to meet someone. Cause men don't put an effort anymore, don't care to put an effort. And a relationship won't work unless the guy likes the girl just a tiny little bit more. He's got. He has to like her just the tiniest bit more for it to work in the long haul. So it would make sense if a guy really wanted to get to know you, that he would go leaps and bounds to get to know you. And when did that shift? Because back in my mom's era, if a guy wanted to take you out on a date, he had to go up to you, he had to get your number, he had to go through lengths to try to talk to you, even if you weren't interested at first. How my parents met, they met at a bar. And my dad asked for my mom to dance. My mom was like, get out of here. She did. She wanted nothing to do with him. If he had just laughed and listened to her, they would have never gone married, they would have never had kids. But he was persistent. He wanted to take her out on a date so badly. He was like, what do I have to do to take you out on a date? She was working late their first date. So he went to her work, picked her up, prepped a dinner, took her to a park, just plan the whole thing. He wrote her poetry. He was yearning how my aunt and my uncle met. My aunt was a dancer on a cruise ship, and he was the photographer. And he was persistent. She overheard him one night saying to his buddy, he was like, I'm gonna marry that girl. He had just met her, and now they're married and they have two kids together. I don't hear anything like that now. Now we're praising eye contact? Now we're praising, if a guy held a door open to us and smiled, that is. That is what we're praising. It feels so backwards. I. And I just wonder how. When it shifted, because I feel like that is the whole downfall, why it's so hard to meet someone now. Cause men just don't care anymore.",

    "voice_to_text": "Welcome to tonight's TikTok. Tonight's TikTok is brought to you by Roma's army. Roma is a young woman on this app who is a men's advocate. Let me start by saying there is nothing wrong with being a men's advocate. Men experience different trials and tribulations, and having a woman look at the world through a man's lens on society is not a bad thing. I've seen three or four of her videos on my FYP, but I want to discuss this one. I am so sick of this trend where women say they'd rather be stuck alone in a forest with a bear than a man. Like, oh, we're being rude and sexist. Okay, my fucking turn. Men, would you rather be stuck in a desert for 60 days with nothing but a dog, or be stuck in that same desert with a woman? You let me know. Thank you. Now, to make things a little more similar to the bear versus man question going around, let's add the stipulation that this is a strange woman. Now, I'll be using personal experience and media to answer this question, and I do realize that not every woman fits into the category that I'm gonna use. This is my personal experience. Society tends to not teach most women the skills necessary to survive in the wild. You can even see in that recent TV show, men versus women. Stuck on an island. The ladies had a doctor, a plumber, and a Survivalist. But they still didn't clean their water properly to survive. They lacked almost all the basic skills in order to survive in the wild. Not that I think most young men are being taught those skills either, but that is a different video. Yet I will still choose the woman. Having someone who can help me with the tasks necessary to survive, based on the things that I Learned growing up, would be an absolute boon, while it would take me more than 60 days to teach a dog to be an asset, even if the dog is trainable. But all this misses the most important part of the equation between the two questions, which is if I was propositioned by said woman, being a married man, I would not be afraid she was going to kill me.

    "voice_to_text": "Jerry Seinfeld blames the extreme left for the demise of comedy on TV the context was an interview where he said that people always need comedy they need it so badly and they don't get it \u201cit used to be\u201d he says \u201cyou would go home at the end of the day most people would go oh cheers is on mash is on Mary Tyler Moore is on all in the family is on you just expected there will be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight well guess what where is it this\u201d he says \u201cis the result of the extreme left and PC  people worrying too much about offending other people\u201d Jerry Seinfeld is 70 years old so here's my question: are we all doomed to get old and out of touch and bitter because without getting into the political aspect of his complaint about the w0ke left or whatever the whole basis of his complaint is that he's unaware of what the cultural landscape looks like now like he tunes into network TV in primetime and doesn't see very many huge sitcoms anymore and so decides oh there's no comedy left where in reality there is an ocean a universe of Youtubers and podcasters and tiktokers making spectacular comedy some of it incredibly offensive if people want comedy in their lives if they want irreverent comedy in their lives they have infinitely more options than they did in his prime just a couple of weeks before that Seinfeld interview Conan O'Brien who is 61 years old went on Hot Ones if you're unaware Hot Ones is a celebrity interview show where during the interview they eat increasingly spicy wings but like so spicy that it shuts down your nervous system and then the point is that the celebrity kind of drops their facade and you get a really good honest interview out of them it is a distinctly YouTube era show it is something that a TV veteran like Connor O'Brien should think of as beneath him or gimmicky but he didn't and the contrast with Jerry's mindset is striking Conan didn't just do this weird YouTube show he did the best episode of it ever it was clear when he showed up that he not only had watched episodes of Hot Ones but had studied it and understood it and gotten a clear sense of what the audience wants out of it what makes a good episode of the show because he understood that his job is the same in 2024 as it would have been in 1994 or in 1954 if he'd been making TV back then that the moment you have disdain for your audience or for the newest generation of your audience you're done but so many entertainers when they get old go the Seinfeld route and I fear this happening to me and if you're about to say oh well he was always lame he's just this guy who had a big sitcom and got rich and out of touch no you have no idea how cutting edge Seinfeld was when it came along it broke every rule it changed the way the culture operates it changed the way people talk it violated every taboo it was a phenomenon in other words this was someone who understood that a show like this only exists because there are people in the world trying to enforce taboos the pearl clutching scolds of the world are the greatest gift a comedian can ever get because they draw the lines you get to step across I know for a fact that he got hate mail back then he got an avalanche of complaints from the left and the right I know this because you can't create on the scale without getting that kind of backlash I've gotten it but for so many of these guys they reach an age and a tipping point where it just hardens into bitterness and they're going on these right wing talk shows and just talking about how you can't make jokes anymore it's like the accumulation of the criticism finally seeps in and kills the humor and I'm so scared of this happening to me because I am extremely old I am on here specifically because a couple of years ago I perceived myself as getting old and separated from my audience and I don't want to become that person but I don't think any of these people wanted to become that person when they were younger the guy that Jerry Seinfeld is now is the type of person he would have mocked when he was in his forties and the thing is he's right in the rest of that quote people do need comedy they always will but comedy comes in waves it's a series of reactions to the last trend Seinfeld the show struck a nerve because it specifically was a reaction to sitcoms from the 80s like The Cosby Show they were all about delivering some moral message and this gave birth to a show where there are no lessons Learned and then the reaction to that was shows like The Big Bang Theory and two and a Half Men that's how it works it's same in the world of animation in the early 90s you had shows like the Simpsons but in the 2000s that had been replaced with the Simpsons whereas today you've got stuff more like the Simpsons it's always changing but it's the change that keeps it fun but it seems like at some point in your life you just get tired of trying to keep up is it inevitable?",

I don't wanna hear no. Oh, it's spreading more germs. I'm like. I feel like I've seen stuff about this. You shouldn't wash chicken because of germs. Then how could you buy something that has feathers, hair and not wash it? You. You not concerned about the feathers? You not concerned about the hair? No. I grew up on a farm and we killed turkeys. It's Christmas. You gotta wash the chicken. But not with soap. You do. You put water on it and stuff. You kind of like, caress it a little bit. Sometimes my thing gets hard when I'm doing that, you know? What did you say? I guess a little burner. And that feels nice, you know? I don't really know what to say to that. I'll be real."

There's something in the skin that looks waxy, and it makes them actually look older because it's giving them an older woman skin look at a younger age. Does that make sense?

    "video_description": "The Tom Brady Roast was sensational. Honestly, I was shocked. Asking football players to read LIVE sounds like a recipe for disaster. But they brought the fucking house down. Everyone took part in the great American tradition of humbling our heroes. No one got sensitive. Everyone played ball. @Kevin Hart was masterful hosting and Nikki and Tony DEMOLISHED \u2022 Also Ben Affleck did something. Not sure what it was. But it was something. Genuinely an awesome night and an honor to be a part of. Go indulge on Netflix now. #roast #tombrady #tombradyroast #andrewschulz ",
    "voice_to_text": "Let's talk about Tom motherfucking Brady. The man in the arena. The Goats. Tom, I know Bill Belichick showed up late, but don't worry, I'm sure he has someone secretly recording this so we can watch the whole thing later. Okay? Bill is secretly film more guys playing for the other team than Diddy. That's your boy, Kev. Tom said that the reason he loves football is cause it allows him to be his most true, authentic version of himself. Hiding behind a mask, throwing things at black people. I'm kidding. He never threw to the black guys. Gronkowski, Edelman, Welker. That's not a receiving core. That's a law firm. And with that divorce coming up, you're gonna fucking need them. Oh, that's why Dana's here. So you can learn how to fuck a Brazilian out of half their purse? Tom, you remind us that no matter how big you get, how successful you are, how much you accomplish in your life, you can always end up a twice divorce supplement salesman in Tampa, Florida. And for that, we all thank you. You are the GOAT. Thank you so much for even doing this, brother."

To help me reach somebody who might need this, would you press the copy link? In Psalms, the Bible, it says that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. But the devil convinces you of the opposite. That might sound pretty generic. Oh, you're wonderful, you're beautiful, all this stuff. Yeah, and you tell it to yourself, and people tell it to you. But you don't understand that god gave his son so that you could draw near to god regardless of what you think of yourself, and you could receive what he thinks of you. See, it's not that you need to think better of yourself. It's that you need to get with god and ask him how he sees you. Because when you understand how god sees you, you will see yourself completely different. The only reason David had the confidence to say that he is fearfully and wonderfully made is because he had years of history with god, and he was fully aware of God's abundant, steadfast love for him. God is calling you to draw near to him and to believe the same truth that David believed. Stop doing what the world is doing. Stop getting so wrapped up in who you are and get wrapped up in who god is."

    "voice_to_text": "No bread, just a butter. How can I buy like, a big thing of butter? Just the Texas Roadhouse butter. Just butter. Just butter that. I just want to buy some butter. Good big popcorn out of it. Like a half, I guess. Yeah. By the way, the Texas Roadhouse manager gave me the butter for free. She recognized me from the Jordan Stallion. Bacon popcorn stitch. Shout out to Jordan too, by the way. Thank you. And said as long as I keep the video clean, it was all mine to make popcorn with. So, like, can we get a little. A little noise? For a corporation actually like, killing it. They mess up things. They drop the ball so often, and they really crushed this one. So for today's popcorn, we're gonna be using bacon grease as well. Because I actually figured out why some people use bacon grease. And it tasted like bacon with their popcorn and other people didn't. It was the top of the pan. The bacon grease that splashed onto the lid got onto the popcorn when it popped. That's why some people were like, oh my god, this popcorn tastes like bacon. And other people were like, this popcorn tastes like popcorn. Alright, let's get this all melted up and mixed together. We're also going to measure today, because once again, far too precious to be wasting a bunch of it. Well, that already smells amazing. Hmm. Can you smell what the gingers Cooking. Oh, moment of truth coming in. Oh, yeah, there we go. Come on, baby. No shimmy, no shake. I don't wanna get yelled at for scratching up my stovetop anymore. And we're just gonna see if shimmy and shake is even necessary or if that's just some myth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Rise for your master. Oh, my god, that smells amazing. There's no business smelling this good already. Look at it. Oh, let's. Moment of truth. Did I measure it right? Oh, I can turn that off. We're at the point. Oh. Ah, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Come on, come on. Ah, you can see the cinnamon and the sugar on it. Look at it. Alright, I would say that did not overflow. I mean, two little pieces to the side. All right, well, I didn't see that coming. Molded to the pan. That's pretty neat. But as you can see from the bottom, we got a really good pop. So I guess you don't need to shimmy and shake the popcorn. Unless it's in that weird old fashioned pan. Got the old fashioned Blockbuster Puke Bowl. Popcorn bowl. Now we're gonna sprinkle some of this Texas Roadhouse butter on top, give it a little bit to melt through. Still got well over half the container. Hmm. Hmm. Is it weird that I can actually hear future me grumbling as my cardiologist shows me this video and says, this. This was the moment right here. This Is when you mess things up. Moment of truth. Oh, Texas Roadhouse Butter. Not only can you pop popcorn with it, but you can just spread it on top, and it is fantastic. I don't know what they're doing with the peanuts. Popcorn. Texas Roadhouse. You need. You need popcorn. Popcorn. You already got the butter. Hmm. Hmm.",

I don't think it matters at all. Of Fantastic Four flops, I think I would go Superman. Superman's at the top, Superman's number one. Cause if dead because Deadpool, and then fantastic because Superman 3. Er, sorry, not just Superman. Superman is the only one where an entire new franchise is reliant on it universe. Yes, like if Deadpool 3 flops, everyone's gonna be like, oh well, it's the MCU. Like, that's what they're doing now, you know what I mean? Mmm hmm. And a fantastic four flops, it does insinuate that Deadpool didn't flop, and that's what multiverse of madness is. Yeah, I think no Way Home. I think Deadpool 3 and Fantastic Four are like, could save a bunch of stuff, but it's not going to like kill something before it even gets started. But let's actually answer his question, cause his question is Fantastic Four and Deadpool. I'm still going Superman. Superman. I still think I'm going Superman as well. Cause if. Cause if Deadpool 3 flops then like, everyone is so unbelievably checked out already before fantastic forecomes. I just don't think it'll matter that much.

But you learn that if you do more than you can, you can't do that, and there will be things that happen. And so all of the things I like about life in general are on the golf course. I'm saying I, I drink out here, I smoke out here, I whistle out here, I look at nature, I, I. All the things that really mean something to me. Golf requires you to, um, experience all those beautiful things, but then every shot requires you to block all of that out and just focus on the task at hand. And you don't have the opportunity of doing it again. You're gonna do it once, and you're gonna live with how that works out. And, um, if you can, um, get that on the golf course, you can translate that everywhere. The fact that you can have three magnificent shots in a row, that has no bearing on your ability to three put, like. Like you can't afford to be high or low. You have to stay focused, and that, that translates all the time.",

However, some people seem to think of them as if they're mulatos, yet the actual picture is much different. On average, Puerto Ricans are of 12% Tyno Amerindian descent, with Tynos being the original inhabitants of the island. Then the next largest component is sub saharan African ancestry, which is around 20% on average in Puerto Rico. Which leaves us with the final ancestral component European Puerto Ricans average 68% European ancestry, which is the largest ancestral component. Though it should be noted that the main source of European ancestry in Puerto Ricans are Spaniards from the Canary Islands, who average around 20% of North African Berberlike ancestry, as Canary Islands are located off the coast of Africa and used to be populated by Berber like guanches. As a result, the mulatto label is more applicable towards Dominicans, who we will discuss in a separate video, as Puerto Ricans are almost three quarters European.",

Amazon has been on an absolutely insane role when it comes to TV shows lately. I got faith in them, but I don't got that much faith. One of the reasons the first Sausage Party did so well is because no one knew how far y'all were gonna take it. I've already walked through that door. I don't need to walk to another. You might have been able to get away with it with a sequel movie, but a TV show? What's the plot gonna be? What, the hot dogs are gonna cheat on their buns with bagels? Honey buns are gonna kamikaze the homeless? the German products are gonna start seizing aisles from other products? I'mma end the video right there.",

You have gears of war. When did you ever think you would see that? You got Indiana Jones, a game that nobody cares about in Forza. And this is all coming from an insider. So most of this is probably true. Take it with a little bit of grain of salt, but man, this is crazy. Xbox is going to become a more stream like. Like, this is crazy. At least we're gonna get the games for affordable prices. You know, they're gonna have sales is more open to developers. So this is actually kind of a good. We're getting more of the beloved Xbox games on PlayStation. I actually like that. I do love that Sony isn't giving in. They aren't giving any of their first party games to Xbox because PlayStation is the king of the gaming world. We all know that we have the better exclusive games.

    "voice_to_text": "meet Aubrey Graham see Aubrey had a problem everyone hated him and it's so much more  people then you can imagine i'mma need y'all to lock in when the weekend was first coming up Drake said sign on my label the weekend said Nah Drake said okay can you help me with some songs though we can said sure why not Drake said can you help me with some more songs and  some more song matter of fact can you just give me half your album the weekend said I don't really have a choice cause I'm a new artist I'm not gonna sign your label Drake said that's okay we're still friends and Drake started dating his  ex girlfriend Bella Hadid Meet asap Rocky Drake took him on his first tour ever but Drake noticed something Asap\u00a0Rocky\u00a0kept\u00a0hanging\u00a0out with this girl named Rihanna and Drake really like that girl named Rihanna fast forward years later ASAP Rocky gets  married to Rihanna they have kids Drake didn't like that very much Drake's are saying mean things about him  and his wife so he gets mad Meet Ricky he thought Drake was a little weird cause the  whole Meek Meal situation and for the fact that Drake  called for a cease and desist on a French Montana song behind the scenes but Rick said we're still friends Rick Roth then features on Metro Boomin's new album does not say anything about Drake but Drake took it some type of way so Drake invites Rick Ross's  ex girlfriend to his concert Rick Ross doesn't like that very much so he gets upset brings us the metro boomin himself who the man who kind of started this whole thing see Metro didn't really like Drake because Drake has always been weird in the industry thought it was a little strange that Drake was still getting awards for an  album that nobody listened to and Metro was not getting any awards for his  album that everyone listened to Drake said i don\u2019t like you Metro says I don\u2019t like you back future didn't have no big problems with Drake but he's very close with Metro boomin and he's been in the industry a long time he knows so I thought I see where Metro's coming from but it wasn't that deep Drake didn't see it that way future you chose your side I don't care if you talking about me or not on the album I don\u2019t like you to pusha pushing really had no problem with Drake like that but I need you to pay attention Drake had a problem with Pusha t because Pusha t had a problem with Drake's mentor Lil Wayne Lil Wayne had a problem with Pusha t because Pusha t had a problem with Lil  Wayne's mentor Birdman Pusha t had a problem with Birdman  because Birdman didn't pay  Pharrell money for a beat and for real and Pusha t go way back to the  days they weren't famous another trend you'll see in all these beefs is Drake inserting himself in a position he  just doesn't need to be in like\u00a0Megan\u00a0thee\u00a0stallion she was having a problem with somebody  named Jay Prince Tory Lanes Drake said oh let me hop in Drake makes a song about her saying some  crazy things it gets wicked and then gets mad at John Moran starts to beef over a girl he then starts beefing with Common Cause  common dated Serena Williams and Drake like Serena Williams he then starts beefing with ASAP did I mention yes I was beefing with yeah it's always been a love hate thing between them but then when the pushy thing happened push it to your side to Kanye's labels and we're close so Kanye chose push it to your side but then Drake says getting close to Kim Kardashian Kanye thought that was weird so he says I don\u2019t like you Drake he's also had beef with Tyga Joe Biden Janaeko Tanasha Charles Gambino I believe a million people but most of all the people have always been  a little annoyed with Drake fun fact Drake as well as Kid Cuddly and Kanye were the first people to make semi nerdy  cool in the rap game those three were in the forefront of rap is changing but everyone tolerated Kanye and Kid Cudi Drake\u00a0took\u00a0things\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0whole\u00a0another\u00a0level let's just be Frank Drake is half white but that's not the problem the problem is too many people Drake puts on a persona blackness if you're not black that's not up for discussion listen closely J Cole is half white but he acts like J Cole accepted Lil Yachty is from the suburbs acts like Lil Yachty accept it so Drake being half white and being from the suburbs really has nothing to do with it the fact that he pretends to be someone he's not that kind of annoys some people fact that many artists claim that he takes their songs xxxtentacion is one of these people this\u00a0is\u00a0why\u00a0Drakes\u00a0whole\u00a0crew\u00a0OVO\u00a0hates\u00a0Drake because they make music too but apparently he takes all the songs and  doesn't let them release any music the Ghost rider claim is the fact that he's  always messaging young trucks it's a random petty stuff he does online now you may be asking yourself is all this been going on for 15 years why would people people still mess with Drake like that well that's because he was making good music the moment he stopped making very good music the bubble that he'd been building for so  many years was ready to pop and then this Kendrick Lamar see Drake Took Kendrick On His First Tour the same one that he took ASAP Rocky on but then Kendrick comes out with a song called control it's a Big Sean song as well and Kendrick is throwing shots at everybody in the industry but it's friendly competition he said I got love for you all everybody he named was cool with it in fact they said if you got named in that candy first that means you're a good rapper everyone except for Drake you see Drake took it the hardest he took it very personal Drake went to Kendrick said Kendrick Kendrick uh huh Drake said how would you say you got love for me but then say you wanna take the rap crown for me I would like an apology Kendra said okay I'm sorry that you took it the hardest in fact I hate you and I've always hated you you know why because you're weird I don't like your morals I never wanted to say anything but it turns out I just found out that I'm a little weird as well so let's talk about it makes it fine we finna see who the craziest Kendrick said don't wanna do that everyone in the industry try to tell Drake you  don't wanna do that Drake did it well that's why we're here now",

    "voice_to_text": "Ladies, this is the number one way to not be unalived by your boyfriend or your husband. I'm a criminal defense attorney, and there is this phenomenon in criminal law where, um, I use very gender terms in this video, so please excuse that. But this is specifically focused on CIS men, boyfriends, and significant of. I can talk about sort of queer aggression and defenses for gay panic defenses in a different video. When you are going to leave your partner, when you ultimately decide, hey, it's time to go, do not do it in person. Do not do it alone. Do not do it in a private setting. There is decades of case law, case after case after case, where the woman decides to leave the man. And that moment that the man realizes she is actually leaving, this is not a threat. This is not, you know, just sort of a fight. That she is actually going to go. That is the moment that. I don't know how to say it on TikTok, but that is the moment when the unaliving occurs. So there's just sort of decades of precedent where this situation has happened for sectionally, an entire section of case law. In my criminal law textbooks in law school, going over cases, it's. They're called the heat of passion crimes. You might be thinking like, oh, but he's different, or, not him, or, but I love him, or, we've been married for ex. Number of Years. I guarantee you every woman who is now the subject of case law and a criminal law textbook thought the same exact thing. Please. I know I make goofy, stupid videos on TikTok, but this is probably like, please take. Please take this advice. I know breaking up with someone over the phone sucks. I've been the recipient of it. Uh, I know that breaking up with someone over text sucks. I know that maybe doing it at a restaurant or in a public place, but if there's any sort of history of aggression or violence in this person's background, or you just sort of have that sinking feeling where you're like, you know, maybe there's like a 1% chance of, like, an extreme reaction. Please, just do it. I'd rather you be a jerk who broke up with someone over the phone who is still alive than someone who is the next person in a legal textbook. That sounds really dramatic. That sounds really extreme. But it's your life, and you only get one of them. So I want y'all drinking cold brew with an ugly fat dog next to you for a very long time. Oh, and PS, by the way, those heat passion crimes that I talked about, definitely look them up, because there's like, there's a whole sort of, like, constellation of, like, ways in which attorneys utilize them. But the really effective on juries, and they have been used for a long time. They've Got a real ugly history going all the way back to, like, race field crimes. Um, and so they've been used for a really long time to get people off on, uh, at their trials, and also to, um, continue to be used today.",

Uh, the first is the KKK, and the second is the university of Arkansas, which, in terms of racism, only feels like a singular step up from the. Here's the thing, San Francisco. The KKK's version is a little bit cheaper, so I decided to try my hand and email the KKK.

I consider dabbling and white supremacy, but have very little money because of Obama. Would you kindly give me a copy of the Klansman, free of charge? And a few weeks later, I got a response. Email me. They said, Dearest Abigail, it is so nice to see young women such as yourself proactively engaging with their heritage. Attached. You will find a full copy of the Klansman, free of charge.

Well, there's, like, more to me as a person. Then be poor. Okay. Then. Then choose poverty. Has anyone ever chosen poverty? No. It's because poverty sucks, and we all know it. That's why what's going on with millennials. But we're all, we don't have money. We grew up thinking that, like, money was gonna be a thing we could have, and none of us have it.

It's people literally on the internet and it's sickening to see them saying that it does not matter that Ryan Garcia was on PEDs. It does not matter if he came in three pounds over because Devin was getting caught with the left and he got knocked down multiple times. Listen, Devin Haney was getting caught with that left. But if Ryan Garcia was indeed on PE these, that loss needs to be taken off of Devin Haney's record and it needs to be taken off ASAP because Devin Haney was already at a disadvantage before the fight even started. Because Ryan Garcia came in three pounds over that when Ryan won the fight, people gave him credit. But if he's on PEDs, we need to take away all credit from him because people literally lose their life inside of the ring. And I don't wanna hear people come on here talking about some of our favorite athletes take PEDs because it's true. I know some of our favorite NFL, NBA players and boxers, baseball players take PEDs, but they cycle on, cycle off. But Ryan Garcia got caught. And I know Devin Haney, he got a suspect too because he running around with the dude from snack, Victor Conte, who was in some major trouble back in the day giving athletes steroids. And all other type of stuff to help them win. So that looks fishy, too. But if Ryan Garcia is proven to have taken PEDs, that lost needs to be taken off of Devin Haney's record. And if I'm Devin Haney, I may not give him a rematch. And if I do give him a rematch, it's gonna be testing galore."

    "voice_to_text": "Gabriel Iglesias, also known as fluffy, is currently getting backlash for the way that he spoke to one of his fans after a show. So basically what happened is fluffy went to go meet some of his fans after his show, and this particular fan had happened to be on TikTok Live. As fluffy is walking up to her, she's trying to let him know how many viewers she has on her live. And fluffy was not having it. He basically told her something along the lines of, I don't care how many viewers you have, just flip the camera around and let's take the picture already. So the woman is trying to flip the camera around, and she's like, oh, I don't know how to flip it around. I don't know how to flip it around. And fluffy was like, how do you know how to go on TikTok Live but don't know how to flip the camera around? He just grabs her phone, turns the phone around, and says hi to the viewers on her TikTok. Because of this situation, they're saying that he's acting like AB Quintanilla and that he's so rude that the fans made him. Why is he acting like that towards one of his fans? And other comments are saying that fluffy is right to act this way. He's tired after his show. And how is the fan not prepared to take the picture? But let me know what you guys think in the Comments below 701. People. Turn around. I don't care. Turn around. Let's take a selfie. I'm not here to do a video. Okay, okay. Let me, uh, turn it around, then. Let's take a picture. I don't know how. No, I don't. I'm on TikTok. I'm live. Do you know how to do it? If she knows how to do a TikTok, she knows how to turn her shit off and then flip it to do a video. Okay, watch out. So since she can't do it, we're just gonna say hi. Yes. Hello to everyone."

For more worksheets, for more problems, for more help, for more questions, click the link and do the things. If you're looking for something like 18% of 50, who knows how to calculate 18% off the top of their head? But what you can also do is these are reversible. Multiplication is reversible. And remember, the word of means multiply. So two times three is the same thing as three times two. So 18% of 50 is the same thing as 50% of eighteen. So 50% of 18 is way easier to figure out because half of 18 is nine. 50% of 18 is nine. 18% of 50 is nine. That's messed up."

I poured some powdered sugar on some wax paper and created a well before combining my gum base with some corn syrup and slowly melting it down. That was all melted. I gave it a good stir and poured it into my little powdered sugar while I created. One of her favorite flavors is green apple, so I made a green apple one and then also experimented with making a cinnamon vanilla gum. Once the mixture was cold enough to handle, I needed it and then stretched it out and made sure to always have it covered in the powdered sugar so it wouldn't stick. Then I rolled out my gum, cut it into equal pieces, and decided to go for a little gumball. Once all the green apple ones were formed, I moved on to my cinnamon vanilla ones and set them aside before tossing them in some more powdered sugar to keep them fresh. I placed them in some wax paper, twisted the sides, and repeated that process with all of them and then they were ready to try. These tasted even better than store bought gum and she was so excited. The cinnamon vanilla ones tasted like a doughnut. I was very pleased about"

The king himself, Elvis Presley, was said to have passed away at 42, though many fans believed he faked his death to escape the Mafia. Adding to the mystery, the popular Tiktoker and Instagram influencer known as Chewy Thompson has recently made weekly visits to Elvis's private upstairs bedroom at Graceland, an area off limits to everyone except Elvis's direct family. The man was escorted by multiple guards. He accessed the room behind a curtain on the stairs, quickly closing the door behind him. Supposedly, his visits were to see Elvis. During the visit, many fans present on the Graceland tour reported hearing multiple voices from upstairs, fueling the statement that Elvis might still be alive and that his grandson had come for a visit. It said that Chewy Thompson had to go make plans with whoever he was meeting, possibly planning an Elvis comeback. But this doesn't explain why he has been up there every week. The only way to know is to ask Chewy Thompson, what do you think?"

We boarded the Discovery Princess at the port of Los Angeles. The embarkation process was chaotic. It was unorganized and stressful. They had us under a makeshift tent, and we were exposed to the cold in the rain. Number two, entertainment. There was absolutely no diversity in the music and entertainment. It was all geared towards an older white audience. The only DJ on board played music from the same playlist, which was geared towards an older white audience. And lastly, number three, there were no black passengers. Out of 35 hundred passengers, we only saw about a hundred black people, and that's being generous. So as a black couple, Princess Cruises is not for us, and we will never sail with them again.",

We will definitely go back there for a destination vacation.  But we will never cruise Princess Cruises again for one simple reason - NO DIVERSITY. And when we say no diversity, we mean the music was not chosen with black people in mind, the entertainment was not only terrible (even for cruise ship entertainment), it was not curated for a black audience.  When we looked around us, we didn\u2019t see many people who looked like us. There were approximately 3,500 passengers onboard, and there were probably about 100 black people (and that\u2019s being generous).  Have you ever sailed on Princess Cruises? If so, what\u2019s your opinion of the diversity onboard (or lack thereof)?  #cruise #princess #discoveryprincess #blacklove #blacktravel #blackcouples #blackcouple #diversityintravel #blackloveblacktravel #princesscruises",

    "voice_to_text": "I love being so confident, even when I'm wrong, that I can gaslight others into believing me. For example, when I was in high school, I went to high school at a community college, and one of these times, I'm getting ready to go to my math class with a bunch of people way older than me. I don't know if this is actually a Japanese character or not. I thought it was a woman silhouette, but I actually don't know what it is. Now, back to the story. I'm walking into this math class with a bunch of college kids that are a few years my senior, and as I'm talking outside to one of them, I said, yeah, it's the epitome of, like, this. An epitome of example. And he goes, what did you say? I said, epitome. Like, thinking, I'm teaching. This guy knew what. I go, epitone. Yeah, it essentially means, like, it is the prime example of something. It is like. It is like the. The epitome of something. And he goes, because you mean epitome. And I said, silly boy, now I know what epitome is. It essentially means the same thing as epitome, but it. They're two different words. And he goes, are you okay? I said, what do you mean, am I okay? He said, it's not pronounced epitome. It's epitome. I saw a lot of things happen in front of my eyes that day. I said, I have Learned a thing. Or two about myself. And it is that I am so confident when I am wrong that I even believe it up until it cannot be proven true. And for the rest of my time at that university, university community college, anytime I saw that person who would from across the room, go, what's up, epic home. You think it would have taught me to be humble, but if anything, it just made me more steadfast in my own beliefs. I still don't know if it's Ari or Ara. I'm always confused. But stay confused with me. It's fun.",

    "voice_to_text": "All right, I'm gonna show you how I played Stink Fist by tool on an acoustic guitar in a very easy way. First of all, I put the capo on Capo 3 just to raise the key for my voice because it's a little. It's a little low for me. And E minor, so I put it in G minor. But you can do the same exact chord shapes in E minor. It's the same thing if you just take the cable off. Anyway, so I started with an E minor shape, followed by a D major shape. So this is ringing horribly. Hold on. It's like. And to add some drama, do a little palm muting. Okay. Then for the chorus, it's not enough. I went to E major. And then you got the. The other part of the course where I did E minor seven deep within the. And that's when you. You keep your ring finger and pinky on the third fret. Just keep them there. Finger deep within the. That's when you do that partial C major shape within the borderline. And then just D. So good. Then I added that little lead into the. Relax and make it kind of. I think one of those. I might have taken my middle finger off and flipped off the camera to do that last part. Then you got the. And then I did the, uh. What became a subtlety. And I did this, um. Beat sus 2 I think you call it. So it's basically just you bar the second fret and you got two fingers on the two strings right in the middle. That's it. Then you just two strings on two fingers on the second fret right in the middle of the fretboard. That's. That's a substitute. So it's kind of like to me. Oh wait, I'm sorry. E minor. How can this mean anything? A, that's the whole thing. And then. Ah, are finer. See, you got dig in. I just kind of. It's more of a F sharp 5 cause it's kind of a weird chord. So I just. It's like a power chord. So I feel something. Then it just ends with the course. So if anyone has any questions, let me know."

Nobody ever talks about it, but I'm plugged into the whole Homer zine rental network. So these celebrities, they gossip. And Chris Stapleton's, like, old driver's ed teacher told me that the Jelly Roll everyone sees, that's not the original Jelly Roll. That's just one of Jelly Roll's helpers. There used to be one Jelly Roll, and he kind of amassed enough fame to where he just kind of contracted out a bunch of other look alikes. And those are the Jelly Rolls that perform for all of us now. And that just, like, brings in a bunch of revenue and fans for, like, the whole Jelly Roll enterprise. So if you go and you meet Jelly Roll, you can kind of see that the tattoos are different on each Jelly Roll. So you know right then and there that that's not Jelly Roll. That's just one of Jelly Rolls helpers. But they'll never tell you that. So when you look him in his eyes and go, are you the real Jelly Roll? He'll just go,",

    "voice_to_text": "The people on TikTok that are doing well make Tik Toks like their fucking lives depend on it. I clock into TikTok like it's a full time fucking job. Okay, okay. I watched her video and I completely agree with her. Doing TikTok full time is not for everybody. If it is for you, I'm gonna tell you in this video exactly how to do it. I'm not trying to sell you a masterclass. This video isn't gonna be multiple parts. I'm gonna tell you everything I can as fast as I can. I'm no guru, but I'm just blessed that my specific flavor of autism happens to be really good at TikTok. Okay, let's start from step one. You just started a TikTok account. Now you gotta figure out how to get 10,000 followers. The key to that is memes and stitches. Do not focus on long form content right away. If you've never been on camera before, it can be very difficult to be funny or entertaining for over a minute. Let's start with achievable goals. You wanna download yourself CapCut? Wanna make memes that the text on the screen takes longer to read than the loop of the video? That ensures you retention. Or if you're really funny, you wanna stitch some videos and say something really funny after an already funny video. I got my first million view video in less than a month doing it that way. Make sure while you're in your short form Phase that you're interacting with your followers. That is very important. The more people feel like you are reachable, the more people will follow you. Rinse and repeat that until you get to 10,000 followers. Some people it'll be very fast, some people will take a few months. But it will work, I promise. Now, this is the hard part. Once you get to 10,000 followers, you're gonna have to pivot into whatever it is that you wanna do. This is where quality becomes key. Easiest way to have quality about a subject that you're making content on is to be passionate about it. If you can't be passionate about something, be timely. If you're one of the first people to post a video about a trending topic, TikTok will give you the views just because your video is there. Remember, there's hundreds of thousands of people out there making the same videos as you. You have to stand out and hear me out. You don't have to listen to a word I said in this video, but I do have more felonies than I do face tattoos, and I really hate it. Working a 9 to 5 job, and I no longer work a 9 to 5 job. And I did that in under a year.",

Number one, if he doesn't wanna be seen in public with you, that is the biggest red flag ever. Like, if you're inviting him out places and he's saying like, no, just come over to my place. Like, just come over, that is the biggest red flag. He does not wanna be seen with you and he's just using you, so leave him. Two, if he doesn't want people knowing that you're, like, seeing each other or that you hooked up or this or that, like, if he's being secretive around you, like, and not telling his friends about you, that is a red flag. A lot of people have their reasons for not sharing things about relationships. I, for one, don't think you should share everything about a relationship. But also, when I like someone, like, it's something that I want to talk about with my close friends. Like, I wanna talk about this guy that I'm seeing. Three, if he has a girl best friend, that's not a problem. Like, I have a lot of guy friends, like, that is not a problem, but keep your goddamn eye out. Seventy percent of the time, the girl best friends are, like, the nicest people ever. But that other 30% of the time, girl, they are praying on Your downfall. One of my exes had a girl best friend who was so nice to my face, and turns out she was trying to get with my boyfriend the entire time we were together. So if your boyfriend knows that his girl best friend has a crush on him, be careful. If a guy that you're talking to is, like, not responding to your messages and, like, leaving you on delivered for, like, a day, the. The honest truth is that he probably doesn't wanna talk to you. Like, my thing is, if I genuinely like someone and someone likes me, like, we usually talk pretty often. But the matter of fact is, you deserve someone who you feel like wants to talk to and wants to spend time with you. So, I don't know, maybe that's kind of red flag if you guys have just been talking for, like, a very short period of time. If he's moving really, really fast and like, wow, this guy really, really likes me, watch out, because you could very well be getting love bombed and you don't even know it because it is the worst feeling ever. So if he's, like, a weekend telling you that he loves you, babe, I'd be scared. And those are just a couple of red flags that I've dealt with, and I don't like.",

Someone use punctuation and attacks anxiety. And yet you have no problem generalizing that an entire generation can be awful. So they're the worst. Number two, do we know you? Have we offended you somehow? Did we do something to you? Fuck Gen X, by the way. Where the hell did he come from? You motherfuckers really trying to look, get under the radar, ain't they? Under the radar? When it comes to the world that large, our entire life history, borders are non existence. I think there is a generation that we're leaving out. See? Fuck Gen X. Ow! Again with that?

I believe you'll be very hungry after seeing it. As is well known, Vietnam, as a country at the top of the food chain, has very high standards for cuisine. This BBQ, which looks very appetizing, can fully replenish the nutrients your body needs. The man's name is Pete, and I don't know where he collected such delicious ingredients. First, he eagerly washed the ingredients in the small river in front of his house. Then immediately prepared the ingredients needed for the BBQ. He mixed chili, onions, and some secret powder thoroughly. Then he placed the little meat sticks on the grill and began slow roasting them. We can see that the color has begun to turn golden. After that, he brushed them with the secret sauce. His friends beside him were getting impatient. Finally, it's ready. Time to plate it. Plating is also an art. It must reach Michelin level standards. From their expressions, it seems like it should be delicious. But who knows if eating it will be toxic. Have any of you ever eaten this thing?

Okay. You know, it is. So, you know, I like to keep a field notebook and a tactical pen on me so that I can jot down ideas and how to optimize my EDC, you know? I mean, it's an EDC for an EDC. You don't. I do, but for me, you know, I'm more of 18 feet of good rope on my carried all times type of guy. That's my speed. 18 feet every day, whenever I need to repel. You too? Yeah, no, I do. But also, you do see a Glock every day with the Glock? Yeah, with the switch to. You know how it is. Hmm. Armor plates for me. Played it up every day. Lightweight offense, defense, you know how it is. No, I tend to keep some space for my telescope. How you do that? You fit that on you? My pockets have pockets. You know, I get it. That's why I got the UAV on standby. Can't carry what you don't see. Now I'm at my tree, do the same thing. EDC, aerial reconnaissance. Makes sense. You Know that EDC life? Me? Sure do. But I tend to carry an entire library of heritage grains and seeds in my lower bags that I could on a whim, like Noah's Ark, rebuild the entire food chain. So self reliant of you. I'm sure you're way ahead though. Sure, and I just had an EDC and up power banks and solar panels. Who identifies a fusion reactor? But you know how it is. Cool. You know, I was dropping my three year old daughter at a birthday party the other day and I said thank god I got my EDC thermite on me in case I need a breach and clear some steel doors over some cupcakes. You get what I'm carrying? Smart saying. Because I felt so safe. Room to the Taco Bell drive through using my jabble and fire and forget death from above. And I armor warhead system. But surely you as well can create this logic. Hmm? And I pray every day that I turn to some kind of Batman Inspector Gadget walking key chain freak so I can fulfill my role as a sacrificial going to use one of society. Because one more thing. Wait, what do you actually have in your pockets right now? Fidget toy? Lip balm? You? A button and an almond.",

    "voice_to_text": "Am I the asshole to ask my friend, who's a single mom, to do a paternity test on her son? Because I have suspicions that my husband is the father? One of my best friends had a kid three years ago. She said it was from a one night stand, and later the guy expressed no interest in being a dad, so she raised her son herself. No one has ever seen this guy, not even me. The issue is this. This kid looks extremely like my husband. Like, to an insane degree. The hair color, eyes, face, everything. He's even been out with my friend and her son, and people have mistaken him to be the dad before. Needless to say, for three years now, I've had my suspicions, but I haven't said anything. My husband is also close to my friend, and the timeline works out. We were all living almost in the same neighborhood. Around this time she got pregnant. Over the past year, it's really eaten at me. See the resemblance growing more and more. It doesn't help that my friend refuses to show me a picture of her son's biological father, no matter how much I asked. It kept spiraling until I had a meltdown and confronted both of them, saying that I will pack up and leave if I don't see a paternity test. Long story short, my friend got a paternity test, but said our friendship is over. The test says that my Husband isn't the father. I feel so ashamed to lose my friend, but I thought my husband would slightly understand since he sees the obvious resemblance between him and this kid. But he has moved out for the time being, and I'm worried that this is the end of our marriage. Am I the asshole for insisting on that test? I honestly felt like I had no other choice. The resemblance was unavoidable, and it was eating at me so much that no amount of therapy could help. I thought my husband would understand my fears most of all given my history with past cheating exes. Did I up, and how badly? Top comment. Let me see, let me see, let me see. I inclined toward you're the asshole, but would ask for more info. The situation is both sad and very confusing. Get that this child look like your husband, but there's one heck of a leap to assume unfaithfulness from him and betrayal from a close friend. My question, I guess, is did you have any reason to suspect him? Specifically, has he previously been unfaithful or given you a solid reason to distrust him? Answer is no. Then you're the asshole, I'm afraid. But it is really sad situation. I recognize that you've lost a friend and now face the difficult challenge of reconciling with your husband. You might need outside support. This is definitely something you should have communicated with to your husband before going off With your friend and your husband demanding a paternity test, we do need a little bit more info as to why she thinks her best friend and her partner would betray her in such a way. What do you guys think?"

Although onions can be harvested at any point, as soon as their neck flops like this, they're definitely ready to harvest. Let's grab a couple for dinner. Freshly, onions are cured whole, so if you cut the tops and roots like this, then you wanna eat these fresh and very soon. That's enough purple for now, so let's grab some green. In this case, garlic scapes. As soon as they loop over themselves, they're ready to harvest. And if you didn't know, garlic scapes are just the flower bulbs of a hardened garlic plant. They taste like garlic, but they're really delicate and they only come once a year. Handful scapes. Unfortunately, my potatoes aren't ready, but these carrots over here definitely are. Woo! I had no idea I was going a monster that big. Make sure you remove all the carrot tops before storing your carrots. That way they stay crunchy and last longer. And if somebody dares me, I'll make a pesto out of these carrot tops. Scrap some herbs like this winter savory. And another one of my favorites, sweet mardrum. This strawberry isn't going anywhere except in my stomach. You gotta say, this early Girl tomato really lives up to its name. These are the first of my greenhouse tomatoes, and I know they're gonna taste good. We still got some room. So let's get some green. Looks like we're almost full. So it's harvest a couple beets.

One in 10 13 year old boys in England say they've been drunk at least twice in their lives. The Bulgaria actually tops this measure. Children in Moldova, Hungary and Romania have similar drinking habits to kids in England.

I was probably seven or eight years old watching this, and I definitely should have. It's pretty terrifying. I think one of my older brother's friends rented it from blockbuster or something, and we all watched it. But there's one moment in particular that really stuck with me in part two, when the Losers Club are all grown up and they have to take on Pennywise again. Stan himself, you know? You know what I mean? Like in the tub, you know what I mean? And at that age, I knew what death was. I knew a person could kill another person. I was aware of these concepts. I wasn't aware that you could do that to yourself. At that point, I was very confused. I was like, did Pennywise get to him? And they just, like, didn't show that for some reason. But no, I.

And not to mention the only reason why I even sold them, had a yard sale to sell them is because they threw a toy behind my baby and missed her head like that much. I was like, I'm done.

I ain't even graduate high school I went to, I got incarcerated, you know, I'm saying, I wanted something different when I came home, so I just stopped picking up books.

And, um,   kinda   read   up   on   her   a   little   bit   more   And   um not only was she a first   only   was   she   a   first in terms of the first woman to ever serve in the Senate,   terms   of   the   first   woman   to   ever   serve   in   the   Senate she was also a last,   was   also   a   last she was the last member of the United States Congress to have   was   the   last   member   of   the   United States   Congress   to   have ever owned slaves in their lifetime.   owned   slaves   in   their   lifetime The first woman to ever serve in the Senate   first   woman   to   ever   serve   in   the   Senate who was handpicked by the governor of Georgia   was   handpicked   by   the   governor   of   Georgia was a woman who was one of the most outspoken   a   woman   who   was   one   of   the   most   outspoken racist you could find at the time   you   could   find   at   the   time in 1898. Uh,   1898   Uh she went so far as to claim that   went   so   far   as   to   claim   that to protect the White women of the south,   protect   the   White   women   of   the   south there needed to be a thousand lynchings a week.   needed   to   be   a   thousand   lynchings   a   week She didn't think there was enough racial lynching in the south   didn't   think   there   was   enough   racial   lynching   in   the   south in the 1890s when African American men   the   1890s   when   African   American   men started looking for political representation   looking   for   political   representation and political rights, particularly to suffrage,   political   rights   particularly   to   suffrage just like she had been for women for a pretty big chunk of her life.   like   she   had   been   for   women   for   a   pretty   big   chunk   of   her   life She said that African Americans were akin to half civilized gorillas   said   that   African   Americans   were   akin   to   half   civilized   gorillas and that any money spent educating them   that   any   money   spent   educating   them would only make them better at crime.   only   make   them   better   at   crime That's why you don't ever hear anything about the first woman   why   you   don't   ever   hear   anything   about   the   first   woman appointed to the US Senate   to   the   US   Senate because the first woman ever appointed to the US Senate is   the   first   woman   ever   appointed   to   the   US   Senate   is almost certainly the worst woman that was ever appointed   certainly   the   worst   woman   that   was   ever   appointed or elected to the United States Senate.   elected   to   the   United States   Senate Um, yeah.   yeah Gotta love history sometimes.   love   history   sometimes",

    "voice_to_text": "Aiella says her son hasn't slept in three days since a man nearly kidnapped him at school. He was touched by somebody else that walked into a field at school at recess, with other adults out there that should have been taking care of my son. That somebody was allegedly this man, Solomon Galligan, a known sex offender. He went through the fencing around Black Forest Hills Elementary on Friday, approaching fifth graders during recess. Some kids began yelling stranger danger! As the man lunged towards Miranda's son. It was these kids who saved my son's wife. Several kids, she says, told adults that were supposed to be supervising recess about the strange man who took off, but says their fears seemingly fell on deaf ears. My son is saying that the TAs were on their phone. This is a big deal. The district says it's launched an investigation. Still, several parents are upset with the district and school for failing to secure the campus. The third graders went out right after this happened. The assailant was able to walk away. And not being more transparent with families about what happened. The people that know is only because our children were there and they witnessed it. And so that's why we know the truth. It is not because the truth was given by the leaders of Cherry Creek. The principal did meet with some families Monday morning and apologized, but many parents say that's not enough, saying it's clear safety is not A priority here. It's three days too late, and you still don't even have a plan. We have kids, lives at stake. This is professional incompetence. We want to get in front of the superintendent. I think that he needs to take accountability for how Cherry Creek school systems are being run. Now, we did make repeated requests for an interview with the school district, but instead we were sent a very short statement that said that they do take safety concerns very seriously, adding, quote, we are committed to being transparent and accountable to our community. Reporting live in Aurora, I'm Kelly Worthman covering Colorado first. Such a frightening situation for those parents and students. Kelly, thank you. Kelly is one of three reporters covering Aurora for you. If you have a story idea for Kelly, Michael Aveda or Tori Mason, you can reach out to them through our website, CBS Colorado dot com.",

And why are some of them sexy? I mean I don't think they are. They're doing bigger animals too. Look at this. Where the hell they get that? Cause I know the type of person that can kill a coyote is not the type of person that's gonna put mittens on a coyote. Actually I take that back. Because if I was a wild animal and someone was running at me with a pair of slacks and a top hat that he's not wearing, I would be more afraid of him than some hunters. What type of people are doing this? Because I don't wanna accidentally hang out with one of them. I mean what if I go take a piss and I come back and he's like hey, remember how you had a normal breathing cat? Well now let me introduce to you new and improved Distinguished Gentleman Cat. And what are you gonna do? Kick him out? No, what if he gets angry and he's got another outfit in his bag? And I cooked chicken breast with a side of ground beef."

    "voice_to_text": "Yes, a new study has corroborated that plants do, in fact, scream audibly when you harvest them. Plants are way more complicated than we give them credit for, in terms of both their interaction and perception of the world and their memory. We know they're capable of differentiating from a wide variety of sounds, including rain, insects eating them, and human speech. Some plants even have sight very similar to our own. And a form of memory. In order to recreate that picture, that is a mimic plant that can actually mimic plastic plants, which they have no physical contact with. They have to be able to see them. As for plants screaming, it's believed that these audible perceptions are on a frequency that plants are better able to receive. So they can tell other plants that there's danger and kind of help their community to survive the incoming threat through changes in gene expression. That might include pulling resources away from their leaves or even creating toxins. Well, many will say that plants don't actually feel pain because they don't have a nervous system like us. Pain is really the perception that your body is being damaged. And being able to receive that information and act. Plants can do that. They also really don't like being touched. So stop hugging trees because it causes them to pull resources away from their leaves and stop growing. So just. Just quit touching them. No touchy.",

They put my little stamps on there, whatever. So we go to the grocery store Friday, we got like 300 dollar worth of food stamps or whatever, and I had still had like 11, some little. So tell me why. I go Sunday to get my Sunday dinner from Walmart. And I go yesterday, which was Monday, to go buy my kids some little snakes at the store. My card declined. Like, wait a minute. I know it's a limb. Some hundred, 900. Whatever was on there is. I know it's on there now. The clan again. So I'm like, okay, babe. I get outside the car, my card is zero dollars, zero cent. So I call my mom, I'm like, my calling. And I'm gonna. She like, okay, good. Get on the app and see what's going on. Whoo! So I get that, download the app on my phone, to the snap benefits app on my phone, and I'm sitting here looking at it. Somebody from fucking Brooklyn, New York, from a mini daily took my fucking stamps. I'm all way in Memphis, Tennessee. How to fuck somebody in Brooklyn. So I'm. I'm trying to brainstorm on who. Who. Who is we need to talk to about suing Walmart, because that's the last place I sleep. My car before they took all My stamps in a. My. I'm just trying to see a. My card number in my, um. PIN number. Supposed to be confidential. Because I think if they use your food stamp card, they supposed to put the PIN number in for them to approve it. Right? So somebody help me understand. Maybe we should start suing these Walmarts and these stores, because I need my food stamps to feed my kids."

And Mike's last fight was an exhibition and those punches looked more like soft kisses. I don't know, I think this is his easiest match yet cause he obviously has more power and skill and like this fight's gonna get ugly quick.

We only use this for kitchen stuff. So my fridge got some Celsius has got some ghosts, got some string cheese. God, I'm a wreck. Are you like a child? In my cabinets, it's basically all ghosts and quest chips. Up here we got, believe it or not, more questions. Pretty sure this one also has more questions up here, though. Okay, this is really weird. I should just take them out of here, but I got flowers and I did not put them up here, but somebody put the flowers up here. And now when you open this, you get, like, a big whiff of these flowers, but they're kind of rotting, so we kind of smell. But I kind of enjoy it, so I just leave them up there. This is my touch up station. I do all my own hair makeup. So this little handy dandy gallon baggie gets me through my days. Um, normally my face will just pretty much stays. Backpack. She's got some fun things in her. Got my drum worksheets in case I wanna practice or think about drums. These things come with me everywhere. Thank you, G Flip. Moving right along here. I have a couch that is so inconvenient. You ready for this? You go to, like, lounge And this shit just like flies. It's fine. I'm not gonna complain. It's a very nice trailer. Got my indoor skydiving gear cause this was in my car, actually. This is really cute. You're gonna like this. So I have this and it has all my customizations of all my projects that I've done on it, right? Check this out. I have a T. Rex on it because that was me on Mass Singer. I was the T. Rex. And then on this arm, I've got No. 3 says number three on Special Forces. Oh, and my secret notes that tells us who's going home tonight on so you can dance. Cannot see those. All right, get out of here. That's my trail. That's all you get to see.",

This was the slowed down version, so next I'll show you the real speed and POV. I opted to use my hand here as I did have some sharks actually biting my camera when I put that between myself and them. And being a shark diver with a lot of experience, I felt comfortable doing so. The hand placement is also very important. If you need to use your hand, make sure to put it on top of the animal and push down, following through as they swim away. I will have some videos coming of what can happen if your hand is underneath of the animal's nose. That can cause them to open their jaw.",

It\u2019s rare for them to bite the camera, but the electricity it gives off may stimulate their ampullae of lorenzini. Being a shark diver with a lot of experience I decided to use my hand to push the shark away to save some scratches on my dome. Sadly, I did leave the trip with a few extra scratches from shark teeth. Its just the name of the game shark diving & always a good reminder of their capabilities.

This creature is a salp, and it may look like a jellyfish, but it actually is not a jellyfish at all. Salps are a type of tuna kit, which are a group of animals known as sea squirts. Which may sound really weird, but they are actually taxonomimically closer related to humans than jellyfish. And salps are actually also related to all animals with backbones. You typically see them in these offshore plagic environments, which is this type of deep blue open ocean. Salps are non selective feeders, eating basically anything that they can trap into their feeding nut, which can be anything ranging from bacteria to larva and even types of phytoplankton. And salps have a very complex lifestyle, growing so fast, they can actually reach maturity in 48 hours, making them one of the fastest growing multicellular animal on earth. Not exactly what you would expect from a creature that looks like this.",

It's a pooping turtle, and I got it for Izzy when she was potty training, and I wanted to get one for Aria, and I saw it comes with two new, new food colors, so I have to try it out. So in the box, you get a toilet, the singing pooping turtle, three different color foods and containers to put them in. Okay, so first, I'm just unpacking the turtle sand, and I think. Think I'm gonna try the green today, since I haven't used this one before. So all you have to do is you pour the sand into this feeder, and then you just pour the sand right into the turtle's mouth. You have to feed him until he's full. I was so bummed I forgot to put his little bib on, but he's already digesting his food, and then you just wait, and he's gonna sing to let you know he has to go to the bathroom. Gotta go, gotta go. Once he's singing, you have to put him on that toilet right away. And I cannot get over that this looks like real poop. It's just way too crazy. The best part is you just pour the sand back into the scooper, and he can eat it again. So you can do this as many times as you want. This will be so much fun to show Aria when it's time to potty train."

Proper naughty sesh around someone's kitchen, have a little birches. The sewer stream plant behind us takes in the waste of a half a million people, and when it can't cope with it, it chucks it straight out here. And in the marine life just beneath, beneath our feet. We're actually finding they're full of drugs. They're full of concept of pill, anti depressants, anti anxiety medication. Every single marine species that we've looked at so far is full of cocaine. Our waters got more coke in it. And Conor McGregor's credit card. Sorry, Richard, can I, can I just ask you to clarify with your experts there, if your expert is still there? Every. Yes, every marine species is full of cocaine. How much coke do we get through as a country? That every different type of marine life they tested had cocaine in it? Yeah, so, Alice, they're just asking about the cocaine that you found. I mean, you're sampling these marine species and you're finding that. That what's in the sewage water ends up in, in. In those. Those, uh, species. Yeah, exactly. The drugs affect this wildlife in the same way they do us. So if you give a fish contraceptive pill, it starts to feminize. Is that why everyone's turning into Sam Smith? If you give crabs antidepressants, it Changes their behaviour. All the crabs just started walking forwards now, just normally. Maybe the old cocaine will let the crab come out of his shell a little bit. Sorry. Ha ha ha ha ha! But I could do with the antidepressants. The old crabs. Yeah, cause I don't get a little bit snappy. Because those drugs were designed to change behavior. So if you give them illegal drugs as well, it has very much the same effect it has on them that it would do on people as well. But the fact that you're finding it in them shows there's quite a high concentration of nasty stuff coming out of that pipe. Yeah, most certainly. And obviously it's all joined together. So these species don't get exposed to just one of these compounds, they get exposed to all of them at the same time. Go down your local chippy for a fish cake and your jaw is gonna be swollen. In my. Now when you go to the fish and chip shop to buy a cod, it's free for a wanna. Ha ha! Fishermen are pissed they can't catch no fish no more. They're like, quick, sharpish, mate, all over and paranoid. No, mate, I ain't grabbing that. Looks dodgy. Nemo's office. Nuts, mate. No wonder Dory don't know what's going on, mate. She's been banging on the old how did I weigh the stuff up? Wait, wait, wait, wait. With their scales. Better pipers come straight out the House as a parliament. Oh, man, that's enough internet for one day. I'm off to rack up a load of fish fingers.",

And as long as you stand within the calorie deficit, you're still gonna lose body fat. So stop taking your big ass to the grocery store, going straight to the process food.

Some of them only get like 2 thousand views, but look, randomly, 3.4 million views. I'm just telling you, hit record and post the freaking content. I would have tried crumbled cookies yesterday whether I recorded it and posted it or not, because that's what I do for. Start recording your life and posting it.

So my mother was to showing me that she opened the banana, that she thinks that these are not real bananas. We got it from the supermarket. But when she opens it and she breaks it in half, it gets very tough and doesn't really break. And if. When it pulls, it's like it's glue. It's very tight and doughy. I've never, ever seen a banana like that. I don't know if it's just our banana or if it's this brand from Costco. From Costco. But at the end of the day, it looks very, very fake. And play Doh. Don't play coy with me, Banana Republic. Give me just a minute. We're gonna get right to the source here. Wait, what do you mean? You're a clothing store. And also an economic model where a country lies too heavily on the sole expert of one commodity. I can spot a conspiracy theory from a mile away. I got him now. No, no, I'm not talking to anybody. I know you're in bed with big play Doh or squishmallow or something like that, because that banana is unnatural. Do you have any connections to Bill Gates? How dare you hang up on me? I am the Pinnacle of investigative journalism. If you didn't know, that's how you used to aggressively hang up on someone. So what is going on in that video? I am Not 100% sure, but we are gonna do some investigating. So I have put together a little experiment because I have a hypothesis. What I think happened is that during transport from, like, central or South America, where bananas are grown, they were exposed to some variation of cold shock, or a temperature that was below the normal 56 to 58 degrees that they're kept at while they're being brought stateside. Those colder temperatures could have converted some of the starches that are naturally found in the banana to what is called a resistant starch. If you didn't know, bananas have a tremendous amount of sugar. But that sugar starts as a starch, one that you cannot easily digest. And then there are enzymes in the banana that, as it ripens, breaks it down into simpler sugar, which is why they get so sweet. You can do this same thing with any starch, like in a potato or bread or pasta. If you cook it and then refrigerate it, you will generate resistant starches. And these tend to be a little more gluey, a little more sticky, and they're also harder for your body to break down. So right now I have several different bananas being exposed to differing degrees of cold shock. And tomorrow we will see if we can replicate that bendy old banana. But what do you think? Is this gonna be a natural process that we can replicate, or these some kind of new alien banana",

Because I feel like, as a guy, your hair is so important and play such a big factor in how you feel about yourself and how you look. By buzzing, you're kind of just forced to focus on yourself and other shit that's way more important. When I buzz my hair, I quite literally stopped giving a fuck completely what people think. Like, I know I didn't look that good, I know it looks kind of stupid, but I got rid of the one thing that makes up for so much of my look. It helps me focus on so much other shit. I feel like as a guy, you don't even realize how much time you spend on your hair. Like, whether you're in a conversation and you're being a little bit self conscious about how it looks, or just in the morning, doing your fucking hair, getting out the shower, drying your hair. Like, buzzing your hair is literally the best fucking decision you can ever make. If you are looking for a sign to do it, this is your fucking sign."

No doubt I'll go right now, huh? You go right now? Yeah. So you gonna crash out over her? Yeah. If you love her so much, kiss her right now. Kiss her again. Again. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. One more time. Alright, now go to the camera and tell them that you crashing out by that cat. I'm crashing out about that cat. I'm crashing out about that cat.",

    "voice_to_text": "This weekend was one of the hardest weekend for me as a parent. My oldest is four. There's something about four where it's like you have a mini teenager. I feel like at twos and three, you're not trying not to listen. Four or five, testing your limits as far as they can go. Saturday was the hardest day, and I knew we had church on Sunday, and I was just not looking forward to going to church. I was just like, I know not gonna go well, like, at this point, I did not wanna take. Oldest anyway, had gone and got Dutch bros. Before we get there. To church on Sunday or getting out of the car, half of his drink left, but we were already running late. And I was like, you can have your drink after we get back out of church. Could it take it into class? Not take no for an answer. At this point. We're all loaded out of the car, in the parking lot, trying to get out. People are walking by, resolve all this before. Before we got out. Put me in the worst mood going into church. Finally dropped both the kids off in class. Didn't even wanna sing. Sitting there praying in my head during worship, being like, god must be doing an awful job, because this kid is not listening to either of us. Went through all these thoughts in my head on why I'm an awful parent. Sat down, somebody taps on my back, turn around, I'm like, great. Last thing I want is to have, like, conversation with people right now. But obviously I turn around, like, I don't know if we've met before. One of the Sunday school teachers, sometimes on Sunday with your son. She goes, and I just wanna say, before she finished that sentence, after everything that had just gone on this weekend, I was like, oh, great. Like, what is she gonna tell me? And she goes, your son is the kindest, funniest kid. I love going to class and seeing him on Sunday. I said, thank you, and I turned around, but I started tearing up. I couldn't have been anything but god. Just wasn't a coincidence that she had said that in that very moment. Feeling like you're doing a bad job, or you're failing as a parent. Doing a better job as a mom than you think."

It affected me in such a primitive way. Yeah. How do you realistically become an ape? We went to ape school for six weeks with our movement coach, who basically took us through movement work and vocal work. That was everything. And then when you get together, then the energy was just so crazy. That built these connections between us as actors that I think totally show up in the film. Who's your best memory? Oh, with none of you. Oh. You know what comes to mind? Hmm? Oh, dear. Oh, no. Oh, no. You know, that night. Oh, it's terrified right now. I'm terrified. No, you can't. I can't say that. Anyway, basically, I have great memories of us on night shoots just becoming more and more silly. It was fun to have that physicality. It was so cool. There's something really powerful about seeing your own experience reflected in a great ape. It's almost like it's easier for us to understand our place in the universe through them.

First thing I wanna talk about is actually the bun. Uh, this is only nine ingredients. Very fresh. It's not very thick. This has a way less ingredients in the bun than all the other fast food places that we've been to. Meat itself is 80 20 USDA ground chuck. There's no freezers in here, so it's very fresh, and there's no fillers or preservatives. One of the things you wanna be careful on is how much condiments you add to the burger. For example, this barbecue sauce, 400 milligrams of sodium and 10 grams of sugar. First ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. The very small amount of condiments that you wanna add on this. I give five guys a higher rating because it's the only national hamburger place that has no preservatives or chemicals in it. And also the freshness of the actual burger.",

This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap and people worrying so much about offending other people. When you write a script and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups, here's our thought about this joke. Well, that's the end of your comedy. They move the gates, like in the scheme culture, the gates are moving. Your job is to be agile and clever enough that wherever they put the gates, I'm gonna make the gate.",

Now, I'll admit I do own some things that are black, because there is the rare occasion that something will look better in black, but that is very rare. For example, something like my bed frame. This just makes more sense to be in black. And I think it contrast my white bed sheets pretty well, because if literally everything was white, it would be pretty overwhelming. But that doesn't apply in this case, because as you can see, I decided to purchase some white item frames. I mean, picture frames. This isn't Minecraft. And along with some nice photos of a concrete wall, I'm hoping these will breathe a little bit more life in my. And for where I'm putting them, it's right here on this wall. Now, I know this is where I put these in my last apartment, but honestly, I really did like the way it looked. And fortunately for me, the layout of my new bedroom is very similar to my last, so I have no problem putting these right back where they belong.",

You're just gonna eat their porridge and traumatize them like you've done before? So go ahead and live with the bears. But I'm just saying the bears would rather Have us. Because we would hook them up with AC. We would hook them up with electricity and roads and we would hook them up with a proper society."

Breaking down what\u2019s in this lawsuit and what Mr. Jason Deford is saying about it. #popculturenews #entertainmentnews #celebritylawsuit / @Jelly Roll ",
    "voice_to_text": "Did y'all hear that Jelly Roll is being sued by Jelly No Space Roll? And let me just explain how stunned I am by what Jelly Roll's response was. The man who is sweeping country music awards right now is being taken to court by a wedding band based in Pennsylvania called Jelly Roll. Band member Kurt said the solo singer Jelly Roll is infringing on the group's trademark. He is seeking an injunction and wants Jelly Roll to stop going by Jelly Roll. The band started using the name in the 80s, before Jason Bradley Deford was born. They trademarked the name in 2010 and renewed again in 2019. Jelly Roll, the singer, has talked about how his mom gave him this nickname as a child, but he started using it around 2010 for music distribution purposes. They indicate in the lawsuit the prior to Jelly Roll Singer success, if you Google them, you could. Now that he has risen to fame, you have to work much harder to find them. So they sent a cease and desist letter to Jelly Roll, whose team was like, let's discuss this. And basically his team said, listen, are you actually competition here? What? The way that that is so ferocious and accurate all at the same time. I cannot. So Jelly No Space Roll is saying that Jelly Space Roll is getting ready to go on a national tour, which just happened to go through Philadelphia. Whoo! A territory war is Even marketing it with the name Jelly Roll. They say the Jelly Rolls unapologetic infringement is causing confusion because we made mistake them. What? His lawsuit is honestly very dramatic, and I love it. In conclusion, the band feels like Jelly Roll is creating unfair competition, and they would like him to find a new name again. I would just argue no one is confused here. Literally no one. But now we wait for a response. Stay tuned."

    "voice_to_text": "Trash, also known as garbage how to play. The object of this two player card game is to be the first player to complete your hand of 10 cards. Pick a dealer who shuffles a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, then deals 10 cards to each player. The cards are kept face down and arranged in a 2 by 5 grid. Players do not look at these cards. The remaining cards are placed face down, forming a stock. Aces are one, twos through tens are their face value, jacks are wilds, and Queens and kings are unplayable. The non dealer goes first, then turns alternate. On your turn, draw the top card from the stock. Then if the card can be played, it is placed on its corresponding spot on the grid, with the top left being ace and continuing across each row to the bottom right, which is 10. Replace the face down card in the spot with the correct face up value, reveal the face down card and you can play that newly revealed card. If able, you continue this process until you get a duplicate rank or king or queen. Then that card is placed face up next to the stock in the discard pile and your turn ends. Moving forward, both players may now choose to either draw the top card of the stock or discard pile. If the stock runs out of cards, shuffle all but the top card of the discard into A new stock. You may replace a face up Jack with the correct card value, then move that Jack to another location. Once all the cards in a player's grid are filled, the round ends and all the cards are gathered, shuffled, and dealt again. Except this time the winner of the previous round has one less card to fill, so that they will only need ace through nine. The winner place first in this round, and the process of each winner decreasing the number of cards needed to win each round repeats until one player has one card left, the ace. Then once that player plays an ace or Jack, they win the game. Thanks for watching if you liked it!",

Someone just dropped a camera into a hole beneath Antarctica to make an incredible discovery. Basically, they dropped the camera down so deep that's technically 2.7 million year old ice that you're looking at. But Omg lol. So crazy. Government is officially denying that cloud seeding took place as two years worth of rain leaves Dubai underwater. Basically, if you haven't heard about this, Dubai has been getting so much rain for the past couple of days that they are flooding like crazy. Worrying reason why the deepest hole in the world was sealed off. I don't know, maybe so somebody doesn't fall in it. They're saying that the temperatures down at the bottom of this hole were so hot that they had to seal it off. Right? Literally don't know how to pronounce this word, but Pepsico just officially recalled their sugar free Shiba Pee Pees Ginger Ale for containing full sugar. The literal reason for this recall is because this is a zero sugar product that has actual full sugar in it. So good job, Pepsi. Scientists just had an official conversation with a humpback whale, which they hope to help mankind communicate with aliens. But what did he say? Tsunami alert has officially been issued after a volcano erupt in Indonesia with thousands told to evacuate, which is wild. This volcano is called the Ruang Volcano and it's had at Least five large interruptions in the last 24 hours alone give you these daily roundups every day. So make sure you add me and come back to me tomorrow."

The constant threat of World War 3. The end of the world two times. Once in 2000. Shout out, Y2K! And once in 2012. Shout out in the mines. Thank you. And a Partridge in a pear tree.

Even the most strenuous cardio session that can last 45 mins to 1 hour is going to only burn anywhere from 500 to 600 calories. Which is not a lot considering the fact that the average American consumes 3500 calories per day. What would be more efficient & easier to do is to just remove that 500 calories from your diet! No 2, what would be more effective for fat loss is to primarily focus on progressive overload strength training. The more you increase your muscle mass the more calories you burn at rest, you\u2019re basically increasing your basal metabolic rate. This is important because increasing your metabolic rate will allow your body to be able to withstand more food & make it easier for you to adhere to your calorie deficit! Bottom line , I want you to do cardio to improve your cardiovascular health & endurance, not to \u201cBurn Body Fat\u201d. Now if you need help with eating in calorie deficit & progressive overload strength training to finally get rid of the mid-section and love handles\u2026. Comment below or DM me the words \u201cFat Loss\u201d & I\u2019ll reach out to you to see if I would be good fit to help you! \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffe #fitness #cardio #fatlosscoach #devinfitness #gohardgofar #builtowin #unlockyournextlevel #health #fatloss ",

Now before y'all clowns come for me in the comment section, I'm not saying to not do cardio at all. Yes, do cardio. I do cardio, my clients do cardio. But I don't want you to do cardio with the primary focus being fat loss. You have to understand that even the most strenuous amount of cardio is only gonna burn anywhere between 5 to 600 calories during that session. So it'll be much easier for you to remove 5 to 600 calories out of your diet instead of trying to burn it on a treadmill. And that's not a lot of calories considering the fact that the average American assumes 35 calories per day. If you literally eat three Krispy Kreme doughnuts that crush your whole hour cardio session. Now what you wanna do instead is prioritize being in a calorie deficit and also progressive overload. Strength training. The reason why strength training is important because the more muscle you gain, the more that builds your metabolism, the more energy aka calories you expend at rest, which is literally your basal metabolic rate. Clowns and trolls in the comments. I'm not saying to not do cardio, but do cardio for the primary focus being cardiovascular health and also improving your endurance, not for fat Loss because that shit is not efficient. Now, if you really wanna lose body fat and you really wanna change your body composition, then comment the word fat loss below and i'mma reach out to you and see if I can help.",

Xbox announced that they will be doing a Xbox game showcasing on June 9th, and following that, they're gonna be having a redacted direct. This was the photo that they provided of this redacted game. It was very easy to find out that this was actually meant for call of duty, because that logo was found in the files of call of duty and even on the floor in the pre game lobby called Cerberus. And this is tied directly to the next call of duty title that was gonna be called Black Ops go for. But it's looking like from this artwork, it's actually gonna be called Black Ops 5, so they're gonna keep the names going. Good news is there this reveal is actually gonna be a deep dive, showcasing not only just the trailer and the reveal, but the actual gameplay footage, some of the characters, the storyline, cinematic trailers. Just to give you an example, they did the same thing last year with Starfield Direct, and it was 45 minutes long. So that means we're gonna get 45 minutes or around that area. Brand new reveal for call of Duty Black Ops 5. What are your thoughts and opinions on this? Do you think this is a little too early for them to start revealing it? But once you get more information, I got you guys covered, so don't Forget to follow to stay up to date on all those call of duty news and updates!",

One would put their knuckles face down on the desk like so, and the other one would try to slide a quarter as hard and as fast as they can at their knuckles. And just like the name of the game states, the goal is to make the other person's knuckles bloody and quit. What psycho made up this game? I had the utter audacity to be in the fifth, sixth grade playing with the upperclassmen, like the ninth graders, tenth graders, eighth graders, dudes that were kind of built like men. These kids hands were strong from playing football and. And masturbating. I wasn't doing that yet. And here's the crazier part. We enjoyed it. There were some kids that would sharpen the edge of their quarters to make it sharper. To rip your knuckles to shreds. Why did we play so many violent games in the 90s, man? Hell, this right here wasn't even the only bloody knuckles game. There was another one that I'll do a part two on. Yeah, our generation might be tougher than a generation younger than us, but let me tell you something. This is why we need therapy. We were playing these violent games for fun."

This has been my dream ingredient for awhile now and I was finally able to source one from @Forest Meadow Ranch \ud83d\udc99  Emu eggs have a beautiful bluish green color with a rough texture. They are huge compared to regular chicken eggs. I was absolutely terrified when I was opening the emu egg. I used the back of a kitchen knife to gently tap the egg until it started to crack. Then I removed the top and the membrane. Today was my lucky day because the whole egg came out of the shell without breaking the yolk \ud83e\udd79 I had my pan already buttered so I wouldn\u2019t have to move the egg again. Fried eggs are my favorite so I made a fried emu egg! I like my eggs sunny side up. Once the emu egg was almost cooked the yolk has a bubble that burst and it started to leak so I had to scramble to find a plate and get it off the pan \ud83d\ude02 I added chives on top and then made butter fried croissant pieces to dip in the yolk. The egg whites of the emu eggs are also delicious. I made little breakfast sandwiches with the croissant pieces, the emu yolk, and some caviar!

But Kris Jenner has been on audio tapes. But this what they got Kim for. Hold on, y'all watch this. Closing in on Kim Kardashian. The FBI investigation, initially a tremor threatening her carefully constructed image, has morphed into a full blown earthquake threatening to engulf her entire empire. Leaked information paints a picture of a woman who allegedly used a seductive facade to mask a ruthless ambition. Wielding stolen documents and secrets like weapons. Kim Kardashian has found herself at the center of a sensational scandal. With federal authorities uncovering a shocking plot allegedly orchestrated by the reality TV star. The Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI has disclosed disturbing details accusing Kardashian of a scheme involving drugging high profile men in order. Yes, you heard that right. Kim Kardashian is caught in a plot of drugging high professional men. Okay. For documents and other blackmail. But it keeps going. Dashing. Of a scheme involving drugging high profile men in order to pilfer crucial documents for personal enrichment and blackmail purposes. The saga unfolded when federal agents executed a dramatic raid on the residence of Music Mobile Diddy, revealing a cache of incriminating video footage. This footage purportedly captures Kardashian engaged in activities that have sent shockwaves through the entertainment and legal worlds alike. In a turn of events that has both Stunned and captivated the public, the FBI claims that Kardashian, known for her glamorous image and celebrity status, was not only involved in the theft of vital information, but also used it as leverage to further her own interests. The gravity of these allegations has sent ripples through Hollywood, where Kardashian has long been a prominent figure. The revelation of these purported misdeeds has not only tarnished Kardashians once impeccable public persona, but has also raised questions about the lengths to which some may go in pursuit of power and wealth. The answer, it's a fucking. It's a wrap. It's a wrap. Like, everybody's going, watch how quick they take down. This before they even took down Trump, who has 67 pending felons. That's another conversation. But this. I know y'all been waiting for the Kardashians like there's a shoe. Kris Jenner is caught on audio tape. That woman is diabolical on the tapes. If the. If. I'm not even gonna throw it out there cause it's a ledge. But from the Scranton transcripts. Y'all grab your popcorn, keep watching this with me. Follow.",

Oh, my. Lot of fun. Good quick time lapse. Very strong funk level. Almost seems like I was chewing on metal that had rusted and had spoiled milk on it. I know that sounds gross, but it wasn't terrible texture wise. It was soft and buttery, and the cheese, from what I did taste, had a nice little sweet, milky flavor. We just try to get some of that cheese. Oh, I might lie. This is a super funky cheese. It almost tastes like it has been pickled, like it's super salty. I don't think it's the worst thing in the world, but it's a bit overwhelming. I don't think I would eat it again, so I think I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 10 bonus round. I can definitely still taste it. That cheese was, um, cherry."

This is literally the same guy playing twins. It doesn't feedback for the loud, confident one, but it does for the awkward, quiet one. I just want to say, if you're too loud, yes. If you're too close to the PA, yes. If you're not funny, no. The microphone does not care if your punchline landed okay. I spy amazing alumni. Haha. Mike's don't care if you lost your notes, if you're about to be bad at karaoke. This thing working at all? These people get in my room if you drink water. Weird.

To get this lodged in there. I mean, I'm seeing some glitter right here on. On the skin. Maybe this was, like a crafting party. Yeah. Just keep pulling, DOC. Just keep it coming. Wow. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, just keep pulling. Don't stop pulling. We'll try to get this all out in one fell swoop. Okay, great, great, great. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. I can feel the tension lessening. So that means the end is coming. Yeah, this definitely is probably the end. It's definitely, definitely. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Oh, wow. This has got to be the end of it. I mean, it's not even really physically possible for them to be much know that. And, you know, our ear canals are not that big, but you'd be surprised what some patients can fit in there. Yeah, patient. I came from a rave. Ah, okay, that totally makes sense. Yeah. And she said that she did not remember how or what is in the ear. And, you know, I don't know if I'd want to remember how many, either. Looks like some kind of excretion. Is that right, DOC? Um, it's either that or. You see that color right there? Yeah, that could be an infection, excretion, or it could just be neon body paint. Yes. Neon body paint looks great until you sit in a car. Yeah. You try to get that out of the seats? No. Oh, ma'am. Okay. You're doing great, DOC. Keep pulling. Yeah, that looks fantastic. Okay, let's go. Almost hypnotizing about it, even though it's just medical. Would you call abnormality? Anomaly, phenomenon? Phenomenon. So you've seen more than one of these? Yes, I have, actually. You know, I. They have me come and do these because they know I've done so many. It's like clockwork. Now we can just get in, get out, get it done with. But it's still each time, it. It doesn't shock me. It's the most incredible specialty. How did you end up specializing in this? Um, well, I wanted to be in plastics. Oh, yeah. You know, I. I just got obsessed with doing my own surgeries on myself. Oh, wow. Yeah. So I like the delicate work of this, just like in plastics, but, you know, you don't get obsessed with it. Yeah, it's almost like, um. What's the word for selling? Like knitting? There's a fancy word for selling. Needle point, crocheting? Cross stitch? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep pulling. Oh, wow. Okay. Perhaps the most amazing one yet. I know I've pulled out, you know, being a patient. Come back from Mardi Gras. Oh, yeah. Beats. That's a Mardi Gras beat stuck in their ear. Yeah, those things are crazy. And they get thrown from the balcony, so. Talk about a Hole in one. Hole in one. And what. What did this pay that patient have to do to earn those beats",

Our babies are eight months old now, and I think they just look like completely different babies. However, there are a few things that we do that we can use to tell them apart. Cameron here, the oldest, he's got the biggest, roundest face. He's also just kind of the biggest. Dominic has got the spikiest hair and kind of still the wispiest hair. And then Bobo, he's the littlest and has kind of the narrowest face and still a little bit of a flathead. And then it's so funny. Their personalities could not be more different. If you set them down to play, Cameron will be the one wanting to roll to his tummy and put, like, anything and everything he can get into his mouth. Dominic is also a roller. He's just got some crazy energy in there. He will roll from one end of the mat to the other end of the mat. And then he's always the one when they're in their cribs, like, he's the one up giggling, trying to get his brother's attention through the crib slots. He's just got such a funny, sneaky energy to him. And then Bobo. This is perfect. Whenever you set him down, he really wants to do happy baby. He wants to do yoga all day long. He's such a little squirm On the floor. So I'm pretty convinced they look just like mama. Smile, boys. Such a vibe. Look at them.",

I just can't take that chance. So I gotta take them all out. There is no doubt I gotta take them out. I remember this one time that I took a shower with all of men. That was the worst, for real. All of them rusted and almost every piercing that I had got infected. Haha. I'm lying. I'm lying for real. I take a shower with all of men with no problem. And no, they're not gonna rust. Why would they rust? For real? It's surgical. Still, put like this, if you take a shower with your piercings and they start rusting, you need to change them things out because you got some cheap jewelry. But to answer your question, I take a shower with all my piercings in, no problem.",

You know I would never seriously marry a man like you. Haha. I've been seeing Jaden on the side. He's taking me on a trip for Valentine's Day. Is this some kind of sick joke? No, you're a really sweet guy and all, but I was just using you for free food and money and rides. It wasn't like I actually liked you. I'm sure you'll be able to find a girl that's more on your level. Jaden is taller than you, bigger, better looking, richer, more successful. Why would I ever pick you over him? Duh. It's a no brainer. Guys, I need your help to get back at my ex. What happened? This one cheated on you as well? We don't need to get into the details. Are y'all in or out? Aight, what do you need us to do? Josh? Her uncle is homeless. Pull up on him and feed him 10 Popeyes biscuits. No, Bev. Miles, I need you to run into her daughter's class when she's in school and flip the light switch on and off as fast as you can. She's got Epilepsy? The fuck? Her son is in the first grade, and his favorite animal is a squirrel. I want one of y'all to catch a squirrel, wait for her son to get out of school, and when he sees you outside, spike the squirrel on the ground. Deleted on impact. Bro, don't you think this is a little too much now? That's not enough. We are just getting started. Her grandma is a Christian. Go outside her house in the middle of the night and play trumpets. He's gonna think it's the rapture. Then when she walks up to the window, say, you are not chosen. After that, I want you all to break into her house, open up every pack of ramen, take out the seasoning, fill it back up. She doesn't deserve flavor. And I want y'all to pull up to an orphanage and play Dear Mama by Tupac on the loudspeakers. Not because it relates to her. I just find it funny. Her grandpa is a Vietnam veteran. He goes shopping at Walmart. I want y'all to run up behind him and pop a balloon in his ear. Make him remember.",

In a bowl filled with 700 grams of chicken wings, add enough Coke to cover them, close the lid and let them soak for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, add 2 tablespoons of ketchup, 2 tablespoons of mustard, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 pinch of black pepper, 1 tablespoon of honey and mix until combined. Now in a skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. When the butter has fully melted, leave us a comment with the name of the city from which you're watching this. I'd like to give you a shout out and thank you for sharing this recipe. Add one drizzle of olive oil, 2 garlic cloves and mix. Next add all the chicken wings that were soaking. If you've made it here, that means you're enjoying our recipe. So click the share button and share this video with all your friends. It won't cost you anything, but for us it will make all the difference. And fry them on both sides until golden brown. When that happens, add 200 milliliters of coke, the sauce we prepared earlier. Mix well, cover the skillet and cook for 15 minutes. This is the right cooking point. That recipe is ready. You may now serve and enjoy it.",

With lots of herbs and overnight brine is definitely the way to go with this one. You wanna dredge the chicken pieces in buttermilk and hot sauce, spices and seasoned flour. A double dredge is necessary for that extra extra crispy skin. Insert your meter probe and deep fry in oil. Set to 3:50 until the internal temperature is 1 67 and it's nice and golden brown. No, I wasn't eating this without hot sauce. It was seriously perfect. So so good."

Then you're gonna take one bowl to secure the top and do the same at the bottom. What did your teacher say about your hair? They like it. They like it. Did it come off? No. Okay, so you're gonna do the same to the bottom, and then we're gonna add our second layer of Protection. Now, this one, you're gonna line up with your original scrunchie that's holding the ponytail and add one more bubble to secure the top. After that, you're gonna just add a scrunchie to make it look cute. Um, also make sure you don't put the ponytails too tight. And this is what I did. She came back home the same way she left.

    "voice_to_text": "Watch how I ruin your entire life over a calculator. Throughout the entire year, there was a crime wave of people having things stolen out of their locked lockers. Not everyone, but enough that everyone knew someone had happened to. The school's only defense about this was that it was our fault for sharing locker combos with our friends. They also charged us every time we had to get the combination changed on a locker, like after a theft, for instance, because it was assumed to be our fault. Well, I had my graphing calculator taken out of my locker. I also never gave out my combination to anyone, mostly because my friends were jackasses and we pulled crap on each other all the time. So I was out $150 for the calculator and another $150 to change the combination, getting a locksmith to change out the lock. This is 2003 money, so it's a bit more than now. To anyone who has ever had to buy a TI86 in 2003 or 2004, you'll know how much the things cost. Well, my dad was drinking buddies with one of the county detectives. I'll call him Detective Buddy. And our Uncle Buddy, he went in to talk to the school about these string of thefts going on so he could get the security camera for the day. My calculator went missing and got completely brushed off as it was a non existent problem. And he must have given out his locker. Combination the principal told him he would need a warrant to get the camera footage. Then when he got the warrant, the school fought the warrant in court, citing student privacy. Cue the pro revenge. Detective Buddy shows up at our house with a laptop and a laptop bag. He's like, throw this in your locker and tell everyone you know about your brand new laptop. Okay, sure, Uncle Buddy. Three days later, I show up at my locker between classes and the laptop is gone. The bag 2 nowhere to be seen, as is a 24 ounce bottle of Coke and possibly some pens. I take my phone out and text him that the laptop got taken. Stand by for the crap show. Oh, and you reported the theft to the police, FYI. He replies back, okay. I reply, confused. I got about the rest of my day, and I don't hear anything back. The following morning, Detective Buddy comes to the school with three uniformed officers and pull a student, Dave, out of class, as well as his mom, who works in the front office. The principal is",

Very soft and chewy, but it's firm enough where it's, like, elastic. Kept expanding every time I chewed. Like, expand it. Really hard thing to, like, compress and swallow. Simply very tame. Flavor wise, it was creamy, but it was just very mildly salty. Every time I bend it, it was full of, like, these bungee pockets. A little a salty liquid because I chewed so many times, that liquid built up until, like, a savory beverage. Overall, it's like, mozzarella is a pretty average, non problematic cheese, other than the fact that was choked on it. So I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10. Bonus round grape.",

What more could you really ask for? If you thought vanilla people decorate other rooms for cruises, just wait until you see a swinger cruise. We put up so many different memes this year. Our door looked absolutely amazing at the end. Could you really be swingers if we didn't have pineapples hanging somewhere in our room? Also, every year, we have groups that come with us, and we give out little goodie bags. This year we gave out an actual bag. We did a T-shirt which said, let's get naughty. We also had a naughty girl banto that Bella sewed. And then a magnet you could hang on your door. And if you didn't know, name necklaces are super huge in the swinging lifestyle.

The flip side also contains waltz, but they're further apart. Although it's not a poisonous fungus, most books list it as inedible. There's not a lot of research on this fungus, but what I can tell you is that folklore states if you find this fungus growing on your gate or door of your house, then a witch has cast a spell on you and your family. Now, don't be alarmed. If you do find this fungus growing on your gate, it's not necessarily gonna be a bad spell. There's plenty of good witches out there, too."

All you're going to do is grab your CABE out of the fridge and then immediately throw it in your dishwasher for around 30 minutes. Then we're gonna grab our macaroni and add it to our pot just like that, and let it cook for another 10 minutes. Once our cabeza is done in the dishwasher, just pull it out and give it one final rinse in the sink to get all of the Sam and Ella off of it. And pat it down with your towel. Growing up in Mexico, I would eat this delicious recipe every single day. And then you're just gonna whack your dumb piece with the cast iron pan to get all the noodles off of it. And it should look something just like that once you're done. Guys, I recommend using your sink so it's not a huge mess. Let me know if you like.",

Could I stay inside the house for a whole week for 100 k? I could stay inside the house for an entire week for free. And not could I, would I? Yes, I would absolutely stay inside my house for an entire week for free. It would be my pleasure to do so. Like, I love how this is framed as a competition. I would volunteer as tribute. Hell, I might pay you for the opportunity to stay in my house for a whole week, not having to interact with other people in the peace and quiet of my own home. Any financial incentive would really just be icing on the cake. And the craziest part, where there were some people under this saying oh my gosh no, I could never. It would be so weird to be so quiet. I would get so lonely. I can't even tell you how much joy this would bring me. The thought of it is calming. Just thinking about having an entire week just like to myself is such a relaxing thought. Silly, silly question. Yes, I would happily stay in my house for an entire week away from the general public.",

Marine archaeologist Kira and her team were on an unexpected discovery during their deep sea journey into the uncharted territories of the ocean floor. They were exploring a seemingly inconspicuous area when suddenly the hook of their robotic diver latched onto a corroded container, marking the beginning of a change. The container lay quietly on the seabed, its ordinary appearance marred by the traces of time. However, Kira's intuition strongly suggested that beneath its mundane exterior might lie a significant secret. Under her command, the team maneuvered the mechanical arm to slowly open the container. As the door of the container creaked open, control room on the ship fell into a stunned silence. The team watched tensely through the grainy monitor screens, their heart beats nearly stopping. At that moment, the content displayed on the screens was beyond their imagination. Unbelievable. Members exchanged glances, their eyes filled with confusion and astonishment, unable to believe what they were seeing. For the continuation of the story, reply with submerged container in the comment section.",

Well, for starters, the person already knows how they feel about you. So by not asking, you're only keeping yourself in the dark. They already know the question. To where do you see this going? How do you feel about me? I like you. Do you like me? They know the answer. By not asking, you're only keeping yourself in the dark. Number one. Number two. A lot of us fear. Well, we could scare them away. If I tell somebody that I like them, I might scare them away. Why would you be with someone who was scared when you said, I like you? Why would you wanna be with somebody who ran away from you when you said, I enjoy spending time with you? Or when you said, where do you see this going on? That hardly ever happens. People don't change their mind about you because you told them how you feel or you asked how they felt. However they feel is staying the same whether or not you ask. It's not changing. Because if somebody asks you, how do you feel about me? You're not changing your mind about them because they asked. You already have your mind made up. But you know what? Let's just hypothetically say you tell someone how you feel about them, or you ask Someone. Where do you see this going? Or you tell someone that you're interested in something serious with them, and it does scare them away. Good. That's a bullet dodge. You don't wanna be with that person. And third of all, the sooner that you ask someone, where do you see this going? How do you feel about me? You like me? The sooner you ask somebody, the sooner you can get the fuck out of there. If you're not aligned, the sooner you open yourself up to finding someone who does respect, appreciate, and adore you, which is what you deserve. So it's a win win. You ask someone, how do you feel about me? Or where do you see this going? They're either going to free you to go find someone you deserve, or they're going to give you the answer you were looking for. Okay. Right. Person for you is not gonna be scared because you like them. Just let that sink in."

    "voice_to_text": "I mentioned in my morning routine video a particular prayer that I use I found very helpful and many of you said you would love to hear that prayer. Here it is. Dear Lord, I admit that I am afraid, and I know that you are not the author of fear. From this moment on, I let go of terrorizing myself with my thoughts. Today I will not condone nor indulge my own worrying or obsessive negativity. Today I believe in your hand upon my shoulders, leading and guiding me for all situations and controlling all outcomes. I realise I am not alone and I have a companion who knows who I am and what I need. Divine aid is mine. Now I take a deep breath and surrender my fears into the arms of the Divine Mother. Nothing and no one can interfere with the miracles I now claim for myself and for this situation. All anxiety, dread and panic dissolves now and I relax my body and let go. My shoulders drop, my forehead and jaw relax and all tension is released into the white light of your divine love. My heart is beginning to soften as I release being right about my fears. I am an innocent child of god who believes in the miracles which defy all the laws of this world. I surrender now under the laws of god. I will not project my thoughts into the future. I will not keep repeating my past. My faith is in you, god. I know that you are more powerful than any person, condition or situation. I am washed clean in the living waters. It is easy for me to breathe in and breathe out, for the Holy Spirit now enters my body and clears my mind of all thoughts which do not bring peace, clarity and calm. Thank you, God, for the answer to all my problems. Thank you for walking with me today. I love you and I trust you in all things and in all ways. Amen. Let me know if that prayer is useful to you. I do it everyday and I very thankful to the person that sent it to me."

Despite the abundance of bacteria and potential health risks associated with excessive consumption, its distinctive flavor continues to entice adventurous eaters to prepare it. A thorough massage is essential to diminish odors, followed by meticulous hand needing to clean the breathing holes. Peeling off the black outer skin, which harbors waste deposits, is a laborious and time consuming process, resulting in a clean, white appearance. Additionally, removing the outer hair is crucial to prevent discomfort while eating. After preparation, marination with lemon helps to neutralize its taste. Before cooking, placing it in a pot with local red fruit lens a vibrant color and stewing in coconut milk for two hours enhances its flavor. Chili and garlic can be added for additional taste, simmering until the broth thickens. Once cooked, slicing open the red exterior reveals a tantalizing texture. Serve sliced thinly alongside Vietnamese vegetables and dipping sauce for a delectable dining experience. Despite initial hesitations, those who dare to try it often find it surprisingly delicious.",

And if you follow me, you know that my husband and I go out for fart walks most nights after dinner. So about 60 minutes after we've eaten, we put on our running shoes, and off we go. Now, why do we do this? While we eat a lot of fiber, so we have gas. Everybody does. And, yeah, you fart when you walk, so that's why we. I named it that. But the main reason that we do the fart walks is because, uh, by walking for as little as two minutes, we should walk for about 10, 15, 20, but not really quickly. It's more of a moderate walk. Um, we are helping reduce our chances of developing type 2 diabetes, so this is absolutely true. Walking after dinner can actually give you many gut health benefits. It helped with bloating in gas. And in this study, they actually purposely infused people with gas and saw that it got dispersed after they just had mild physical activity. If you suffer from acid reflux, taking a walk right after you eat can decrease the risk of having symptoms. And if you suffer from constipation, physical activity has been shown in many trials to stimulate bowel movements. And this is because as you're moving and you're more active, this promotes emptying of the stomach and the movement of gas and stool. So try walking for About 10 to 15 minutes after dinner. And see if that helps your symptoms. I'm trying to do that every day. I'm a board certified gastroenterologist, so hit that follow button for more tips like this."

    "voice_to_text": "Here's how we turned our Florida room into our dream playroom. When we first bought our house, I had a vision that this room could be turned into something fun. It was such a blast space. It was so uninviting, and no one ever wanted to spend any time out here. Looking at this room, you would think that it would be quite simple to just add some windows and exterior door, just close the room in from the outside and paint. But, boy, could we be more wrong? The entire room pretty much had to get gutted and rebuilt from the ground up. Luckily, we had a family member that does the sign of work, so he knew exactly what to do. And it all started when we had to take out the original windows, which exposed a lot of water damage and rotting wood. So he had to completely cut the walls and build a temporary structure to hold the roof up while he replaced the wood piece by piece. Once he was done with that, we thought it was smooth sailing from here on out. But it wasn't. The real trouble started when we had to tear down the interior siding, which exposed live termites and beer cans, which was pretty interesting to find in the walls. And all the work that has been done to this house makes perfect sense now. But we got the termites all taken care of. All the wood is replaced. We Got the windows in and he installed this beautiful tongue and groove. Meanwhile, the inside of my house looks like this for a few months as we took the French doors and the windows out to make everything connected. But at least I had one cute corner for Christmas. We have Learned so much patience with this project. A project that I thought would take maybe a month took nearly a year. So glad we were so patient and did things the right way and took care of the major things that it could have been worse for us in the future. Now my kids have a beautiful playroom and at least one carpeted place where they can freely play since the rest of our house is tile. Cannot wait to get everything set up, so stay tuned for part two."

And I'm like, you know, back and forth, back and forth, up and touch your toes and, like, squat and touch your toes. Right on, on, on one, on one of the. Touch your toes. I. There. There must have been a little. I farted the forbidden flatulence. And. And. And the. The worst part is, is That I have my headphones so loud that I don't know what it sounded like. I have no idea, like, on the Richter scale or what the, the, whatever scale that measure sounds. I don't know what velocity it was. It was, it was pooted. I don't know what it sounded like. I had my things full blast. I'm in the zone, so I, like, I would not even look around because I, like, I was trying to think of, like, what it felt like. Was it like a, or, or was it like a, or was it like a. Either way, just the possibilities in my head. I don't think I could ever return. I didn't even look at anyone when I left that room. I, I, I, cause it happened, I felt it, I, I don't know what it said. And that's what's killing me even more. If, like, it happened and I heard it, I could, like, rationalize, be like, oh, maybe that wasn't even that bad. Like, they didn't even hear it. It, it could have been the loudest thing you've ever heard in your life. I don't know. I don't. I can never go back. I will never. I can't. I can't. I"

A double dredge is necessary for that extra extra crispy skin. Insert your meter probe and deep fry in oil. Set to 3:50 until the internal temperature is 1 67 and it's nice and golden brown. No, I wasn't eating this without hot sauce. It was seriously perfect. So so good."

I know we move fast, but for that reason, he wanted me to meet his family for Thanksgiving. Last year, at the Thanksgiving dinner is where I met his cousin. I feel like his cousin's intentions were not to be with me. It was just to get close to me, to get to know me, because his cousin is not here to do so. I guess I could have thought that something was going on when he started asking me to stay the night. He does live about an hour away from me, so I thought you just being nice and not wanting me to drive home late. And no, we were not sneaking around hanging out. My husband does know that we were spending time together to get to know each other and for me to get to know his family. It just so happened that New Year's Eve, I got a little messed up, and we end up going back to his cousin place, and you know what happened? I don't feel bad, because it's just like, if this is what's meant to be, this is just what's meant to be. I do feel like I owe my husband the truth to let him know what's going on so he doesn't, you know, get suspicious. My husband's cousin did tell me that he Won't tell the family anything, so I won't feel any type of way when I'm around them. So we can just basically like, play it cool until everything comes out. I do plan to tell my husband today on the video call, but I'm not sure if he's gonna be ready to tell his family, cause I do know that it could be kind of embarrassing. I do feel like my husband does need to take responsibility for his part in this, because if he would have never asked me to go spend Thanksgiving with his family, this would have never happened. And I know people are going to judge me in the comments, but think about it. I have two men, and you have no me. I do feel like my husband's going to want to divorce me, so I've already prepared for that. And I feel like me and his cousin are gonna spend the rest of our lives together because we do have a connection. He hasn't said anything about us being a family, but he does want to be there to raise our child. I am ready for my husband, you know, to make his decision, but I do feel kind of bad because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. My husband does a lot for me, and he's my best friend. And I know he's going to feel betrayed, but I hope he knows that these were not my intentions. Wish me luck in The comments, as always, and I'll be back with an update."

On the spectrum of getting giant. That one girl's hot. Terry especially hard today because he's the reason my wife and I are broken eyes. And she's up and I'm broken. You have a good heart. Why is there a cat under the table? Finally, a pussy that wants to be around me and our pet cat. What are you wearing? You look like Little Red Riding Hood. Let's talk about some fondues and fond. Don't rat dick. Can't bit my ankle. Cat dick. Fucking cord sucks worse than the Kardashians and NBA All Star weekend because the girl from J Date ghosted me a Red Lobster using her gift. This heart shaped box reminds me that I want Terry to Kurt Cobain himself. That guy painted. Oh, he painted one wall. Oh, fuck! I meant to remove the one that had caramel. Oh, god, we're about to make a bigger chocolate mess than when that stripper's water broke on my lap at Club Escalate. Yes, I know what today is. No, not Valentine's Day. It's Black History Month, you fucking race! Stop shouting the N word! Okay, hate you too, hasty cock. Sounds like one of my preferences on porn. Oh, these look like precious as. Oh, tastes like it, too. You'd agree if you were casting the Golden Bachelor. If I were to see old people fuck, I just start looking in the windows of the nursing home again. Last time I saw something this dark and full of liquor, Patrick Mahomes's dad was at a DUI checkpoint. No, love's not real, right? Fuck you. Oh, this looks like fondue. Dude, I'm getting two girls, one cup PTSD. That Tyler Perry movie. That's actually better. To help me enjoy the fondue today, I have this giant fruit and an apple. You get that outfit? You look like Marvin Gaye. His dad and me might have something in common. Taking the fruit now to see if it's bussing or not. Hmm. Dad, how are we gonna clean this up? The neighbor's dog. We get it. Cupid's heart bone or Valentine's dicks.",

Why do I do this? So many shampoos and soaps are full of phalates, parabens, fragrances. These are hormone disrupting chemicals. I don't wanna smell like a shampoo or a fake chemical scent in a soap. I just wanna smell like a human. Don't smell. I promise you guys, if you have a bad odor, it's probably because of something going on with your gut, what you're eating. Fix those things and you'll be healthier and you will smell less bad. This will really blow your mind. You can just get the dirt off your skin by using water. Now, I know that some of you may use lotions or other oil based things or makeups. In that case, there are natural ways to get these off your skin. Like apple cider vinegar. If you really need to, there are companies that make good tallow based soaps and even some tallow based shampoos. Look for the smallest number of ingredients. No phalates, no parabens, no other garbage in there for sure."

If a man wants to take you on a walk or go for coffee on the first date, say no thanks and move on. If you're a woman and you're not yet 20, or you're in your early 20s, right now, you are setting the dating standard. Do you think the guy that spends $4 on you for the first date, for a coffee or for a cookie is gonna be an overflowing fountain of effort enthusiasm for you moving forward? A friend of mine was all excited because this guy took her to crumble cookie. She's the super sweet 19 year old girl and she was so excited and I didn't wanna like crush her heart about it, but I was like, yeah, that's nice, but I'm literally not impressed. He bought you a four dollar cookie? Jesse, she's young, blah blah, blah. They're young, they're only nineteen. I do not care. I remember once in my early 20s, this guy, for our first date, he was like, we're gonna go for a walk and then we're gonna go get coffee. And I remember thinking, well, that's cute. Like he wants to be outside and you know, we won't have drinks and whatever, look back on the now and I'm like, barf, that's such a low effort cop out. Well, you wanna go for a walk and then get coffee and Then get a meal. Dude can't even spend $5 on you. And what do women commonly do to get ready for a first date? Especially new outfit, nails done, hair done, maybe buy some new makeup or perfume or jewelry. Just see, it's not about the money on the first few dates. It is on every date moving forward. It is. When I was in my mid twenties, I think I was 25, a guy wanted to take me to the dog park for our first date because we both had dogs. I said, I'm not going to the dog park on our first date. And so he said, okay, well, what do you wanna do? And in my head, I'm like, I'm already planning, and we haven't even gone on the first date. So I said, you think about it and get back to me. And he never got back to me. Whether he didn't like me enough, or he thought that taking me out to eat was this too much money is too much effort, or he didn't have the money to take me out to dinner. Either way, not for me.",

And the conversation flowed really easily the entire time. Like, there was no awkwardness at all, and he was, like, really cute. So after we finished drinks at the first place, he wanted to show me another place he liked, so we hopped around a little bit. It was so fun and definitely got a little tipsy, but the vibe was definitely there. Um, I really hope he doesn't see this, but overall it was a really good day and we got along and I thought he's cute. So I think we're going on another date later this week. He's definitely still a stranger, but I can, like, I feel comfortable around him, which is nice. I don't wanna say too much cause I don't wanna scare him off, but I'm happy I went and I'm happy I put myself out there and I really needed it to go good, cause I was, like, losing hope for a second.

    "voice_to_text": "Lemon Pepper Chicken Skewers in the Air Fryer. This recipe literally changed my life. A simple and easy to make meal that's guaranteed to please. They come out crispy and juicy every single time. Now let me show you how easy this is. First, season your chicken thigh pieces with salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, lemon zest and olive oil. Give it a good mix until every piece is well coated, like so. Then you wanna skewer your meat. You wanna make sure you pack it in real nice and tight, just like that. Now mix together unsalted butter, salt, pepper, sugar, paprika, lemon zest and lemon juice. Mix until fully incorporated and set aside. Add the chicken skewers to your air fryer tray or basket and air fry for 12 minutes at 400. Flip and air fry until golden brown and crispy. Now brush on a thick layer of that lemon pepper butter. And I like mine extra wet. Full recipe at King Cooks com. Go make some."

Well, that's just wasteful. So here's the trick. You hand them something and you pay attention to the way they take it. They grab it. Not a good lover. If they receive it. They're probably gonna be a really good lover. By the way, I got all kind of ways to fix sexual dysfunction. If you check my profile and go to EFT expert. Com, you can download it for free.

And you don't think sharks can breathe underwater? No, they can, but they have to get air. I'm not that. You're looking at me like I'm dumb, dog. If they're born in water, they can breathe in water. I agree, but they have to come up Here. They don't have to. If you can breathe, that's like saying, we can breathe, we were born above the surface. Yes, you can breathe. Breathe above the surface. Yes. Who? Yes. Can they breathe underwater? Yes, but they have to get air. Whales, dolphin seals, eels and sea seals. Eels. Drills and D. Lions. I told you. Breathe underwater. I told you. They have to come up for air because they get tired and so they never. So they never sleep. That's what I was asking. They have to get that. Where do they sleep? Where do they rest? Yes. They go on the ice. They go on the. I catch a boat. Catch a boat. Hey, got one more. That's exactly right. Seals. That's where they jump. Boat. What? You ever seen a seal on a dock?

It's this younger, new Generation Z crazy. That is not enough for. But let me just break something down to y'all real simple. If a woman is a social construct, and we're emulating women, what would that make us? Social construction workers. Ha ha. To be truthful. And if biological women stop having sex, if biological women stop having babies, it won't be no more black, white, LGBT, fat, funny looking, nothing else. I know y'all ain't gonna like the way I put it to you in a box, but when you found the last stop me because I have relationships with trans men. That he identifies men with their biologically women. They think that often. You just pandering for the women. No, I know what a woman is. Woman is Mother Earth. We all came through the birth canal of a woman. All female impersonators, transgender, sex change, whatever. You did not learn how to be a female or act like a female. Watching somebody like you in a suit and tie. That's fact. You learn from the woman that raised you. Whether be your mother, your auntie, your stepmother, whomever. But then when I get so Comfortable in my gay or my transgender or whatever I decide to become. Whatever's in seal to me. I'm better than you. No, I'm not better than you. You still my sister. Wow. But I'm better than you. Now. That is the problem. We keep trying to dismiss women. You cannot dismiss a woman. You're right. Or compete. Mama Monroe said, children, take your seats. Classes and session. Bravo, cause she hit the nail on the head with this one. I think the biggest issue with trying to achieve Equality is the privilege and entitlement that comes along with it. We have our ice cream sundae, but I want the whipped cream, a little bit of sprinkles, a cherry on top to go along with it. And this goes for every group across the board. So I'm talking to everybody. It's in our human nature, animal nature, to wanna be competitive, to be on top, to be power hungry. The only way we're gonna work towards Equality is if we drop the privilege, we drop the entitlement, drop this hunger for power and trying to one up one another. Is that gonna happen in a perfect world? Honestly, probably not. It's been prevalent since the beginning of time. Love you guys, and I will see you in the next one.",

He is already unquestionably the greatest 200m runner of this era. He's going for a double at the world championships, which hasn't been done since Usain Bolt in 2015. And in a couple of days, Noah is going to be taking dead aim at Usain bolt's 200m world record of 19.19 seconds. And I'm here to tell you right now, that motherfucker is about to get it. He about to get that shit. There's not been another athlete in history who goes out there shooting energy bombs at his competition after dusting them on the track. He's also way deeper into anime than I ever will be. This man reads manga. I've been waiting for Demon Slayer to finish up. I already read the Mega, but so much better with Watches so much cooler. He's already got 1/2 of the double. And after this World Championships, he could submit himself as one of the greatest track and field athletes we've ever seen."

Guys, look at the size of this fish. Look at the size of that fish. It's like \uffe1700. Okay, I'm not removing it from the water. You can't remove these fish from the water. I tried safely removing the hook, but the sawfish overpowered me. This fish was at least 17ft long, making it the longest fish I've ever caught. By far the most dangerous animal I've ever encountered. A simple mistake could be fatal. I cut the line as close to the hook as possible and released a sawfish without risking serious injury.",

The original Proud Family series that aired from 2001 to 2005 portrayed Michael Collins as a feminine. They didn't come out and say he was openly gay, it was kind of just implied until the reboot of the series The Proud Family Louder and prouder, which came out in 2022. As the show progresses, Michael begins to explore his sexuality and eventually comes out as gay in the final episode, making him the first openly gay character in a Disney cartoon. It's so important that they verbalize this because even if you do get the gist, the character is LGBTQ.

Once you went outside, you kept your little butt outside. You came in the house even once. Even once. You was running in and out. You couldn't come in to use the bathroom to get a drink of water, get nothing to eat. We was full vegans during the summer. From 7 a m. To 7 p m, we was outside eating honeysuckles and. And blackberries, foraging for lunch. Because if we came inside, we have to go to bed. It'd be 2 o'clock getting here and go to bed since you want to run it out. We saw my AC. I don't believe our parents had money to feed us during the summer. We had to go to school. He was on free reduced lunch. So they get mad if you came in the house, because they didn't want us to eat nothing, because then they had to cook. So, no, the sink was not an option. No, outside was your only option. We lucky we didn't have streams and legs. That's what don't Go Chasing Waterfalls is about. It's about not going in the house. You got to see some bruises and legs that you was used to because you come in the house. You going to bed, and going to bed while your friends is outside playing was Cruel and unusual punishment. They come to your window and laugh because you was in the house at 02:17 cause you was thirsty. I wish I would have been thirsty in 1993. I wish I would have been thirsty one time, 1987, trying to be thirsty. Oh, I got some thirsty for you. Get your butter. The man",

    "voice_to_text": "Apparently it's a bad idea to wear a butt plug to an MRI. My name is Courtney Peter Can and I'm a personal injury attorney here in upstate New York. It's the personal injury case that is sweeping the nation. The commotion stems from a post by Twitter user at bradius 0 alleging that a lawsuit had been filed against a sex toy company after a person purchased a butt plug that was advertised as being 100% silicone and then more said butt plug to an MRI appointment. The tweet reads much to client dismay, Butt Plug in fact has metallic core. Butt Plug is accelerated at the speed of sound into clients chest cavity. The Twitter user was also kind enough to provide a copy of the imaging. And what kind of person would I be if I didn't share it with you? It's an interesting case for sure. I don't believe that this is a product liability case because there's nothing actually wrong with the product itself. Instead, I would say that it's more a negligence case in the sense that the sex toy company marketed this product as 100% silicone, when in fact it was metal at its core. Now, while this case has that wow factor that we attorneys refer to, it might be a tough case. Now, when bringing this case, they're going to have to prove that the sex toy company had a duty to the purchase. Part of that analysis is foreseeability. So the Question then becomes whether or not it was reasonably foreseeable for the sex toy company to anticipate that a purchaser of the butt plug would then wear it to an MRI, where it would be rocketed into his chest cavity. But could this sex toy company foresee this happening? Hmm. Jerry? Still out on that? I'm only kidding. This case has not gone to trial. But if it does, I could see this being a problem.",

It was right after I had a Newborn, and I had just quit my job, so we were down on income. We tried everything those days. I was filled with anxiety, stress, shame, scared. I'm not kidding you. That paying off the debt literally changed my life. And since then, I have made it my mission teach other women how they can do it, too. Because I'm nothing special. We definitely weren't rich. We did it by figuring out ways that we could drastically cut our expenses. Yeah, it sucked for a short period of time. And I figured out ways to make money at home without putting my kids in daycare. These are things that anybody can do. And if you want to learn exactly what we did to make this happen, then let me know. I'll get you all the information that I can.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so last night for dinner, I made this delicious chicken and broccoli pasta bake. Plenty of flavor and it doesn't take too long to make. It's perfect for the fam. Let me show you guys how to get down on this one. So I got a few chicken breasts that I had sliced in half, just a thin amount. It also allows them to get like closer in size so that they cook more evenly. I coated them with some avocado oil, hit them with some of that kimmy's. Yes. That much seasoning? Like a good amount of it? Yes, that much. And then some all purpose seasoning and then some smoked paprika to finish these things off. After I season them up, I gave them a quick rub down just to make sure that the seasoning was evenly distributed all over the chicken. Once it gets all seasoned up, it should look just like this. If you want to add more seasoning, go ahead. I added some avocado oil into a large skillet over medium high heat and I dropped these chicken breasts down. I seared these on each side for a few minutes. You just wanna make sure they get nice and brown just like this. Give them a good flip and just let them sit for the other couple minutes. I basted them with a couple tablespoons of butter and after about 6 minutes total from both sides, I just took them off and put them On a sheet tray on the side. If they not reached 165 degree temp, just put them in the oven and let them finish cooking. And that same skillet added 2 more tablespoons of butter, some onions, some garlic. Saute that up before I added some flour to it. This is all purpose flour, because we're gonna make a little roux just to make sure that everything comes together when I bake it in the oven. Mix that up, cook the flour out, then I'm gonna deglaze with some chicken broth. I know it's a non stick, but yes, I said deglaze. Then you wanna go ahead and add some heavy cream to it so we can work on this cream sauce. At this point, we're working with medium, low to low heat. And then you wanna go ahead and turn out down to low. Add in your cheese. I use some mozzarella, pepper Jack, and some Parmesan cheese. Boil some water, salt it heavily, and then add some rigatoni pasta into it. Cook that until just slightly before al dente. Add some spinach to the cream sauce. And then we're gonna go in some more seasoning. The cooked pasta. Some broccoli that I had cooked down, chop up that chicken into some bite size pieces so that we can add that to the pasta as well. I know it seemed like that was a lot that was happening at once, but go ahead and give this a good mix. Just to make sure everything's well incorporated, add some more cheese if you want to get that nice little cheese pull. And then prepare your baking dish. No oil or anything needed. Just put the pasta right in there. Sliced up the remaining chicken breast at an angle, and then I placed them on top of the pasta, coated it with some more that mozzarella cheese, and got that into the oven at three seventy five, and I baked it until everything was just melted golden brown. Maybe about 15 to 20 minutes. Everyone's oven is different, so yours might take 25 minutes, but just keep checking on it. Once it was done, I let it cool for about 10 minutes, and then look at that cheese pull, y'all. This was a lot of food. I'm talking like 10 to 12 servings for you and its whole family. It's plenty of flavor in here. And look, it has veggies, so I guess we could call it healthy. Even though has all this cream and cheese, the flavor is definitely there, but make sure that you season it to your liking. Try this one out and let me know when you guys do. This has quickly become a family favorite in my house. My family had it like 10 times, and you already know it's a wrap. Let's go.",

The first name is Lykester Bryce Stovel. He's a lawyer that came out and claimed that he had an affair with Gloria James back in 1984. And in true lawyer fashion, he actually sued LeBron for around 4 million dollars. He also pressed for a paternity test back in 2007. LeBron eventually obliged and it came back negative. After what seemed like an eternity of harassment, he eventually got disbarred and it serves him right. The second guy is Anthony Mcclellan and the resemblance is staggering, even down to the physique. Apparently a 6 7 Hooper just like LeBron and Gloria brought his name up saying that he might be the guy. Anthony apparently resurfaced in 2002, but because of a criminal history that started all the way back in the nineties, he got caught up in that same year and went back to jail. And turns out LeBron took another paternity test and negative. We can speculate all day, but this just goes to show that you never really know what someone is going through. And I know for a fact his kids will always know who he is.",
