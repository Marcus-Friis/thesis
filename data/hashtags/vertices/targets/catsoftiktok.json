We have our outside orange boy Garfield who guards the building but this morning he let this little lady come up to me!!!!! We have lots of cats who come to my porch for food and water but they all run away when they see me. Ive been stalking this grey baby for a couple days trying to gain its trust with food and cold water in this heat, and the moment she saw me come outside this morning to feed Garfield- she came running RIGHT UP TO ME!! Im almost 100% certain they are siblings from the same litter.. She was meowing, rubbing against my leg and Garfield was a little dramatic towards her but she is in serious need of help, missing half her tail and has serious scrapes on her legs and face. I'll be looking for someone to help her but I'm over the moon that she feels safe with me for now. If ANYONE can help we are in Monroe GA 30655. Also i gave her a flea treatment to help feel better soon \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude3b #fy #fyp #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp #foryoupage #foryou #catneedshelp #monroegeorgia #strayrescue #pethelp #veterinarian #catrescue #trapneuterreturn #pleasehelp ",

They're all right surrounding her. Shh! Go away. And that. Unless that's what they like doing. I don't know, but feel like I was watching something that shouldn't look at her.

In the wild, cats will eat several small meals throughout the day and sometimes skip meals if their bodies need to rest and replenish. Eight to 12 hour fasting periods with access to water and or bone broth can promote cell renewal and overall health in our cats. Today's tip is, while you never want to fast your cat for too long, short fasting periods can be beneficial. Yeah! So pick up that all day buffet while you're at work and allow your kitties the health benefits of intermittent fasting. I'm Jay. I'm Adrian, and we're the two crazy cat ladies.",

They would use nouns that had similar link as the cat's name, as well as sound as the distraction sort of words. And what they found is that cats were more likely to respond to their name. But was interesting though, in the cat cafe. So situation where there was four or more cats, those cats would not respond to the nouns as well, but they would respond to their name or the other cats that they cohabitated with. Which makes sense because if they're all living together and if people are just giving them treats or giving them attention, if someone's saying a cat's name and if that other cat walks over and they get rewarded, they're going to think that that is a positive reinforcement. So they know their name and their friend's name. They know their name and their friend's name if they live in a group setting like that. But if they're at home, specifically their name",

I'm gonna give you another tutorial as my public service of how you can wrap your very clingy friend. Right? Party people? Are we having fun? And take your baby wrap. It does not matter what brand. You can literally get one off Amazon. But there's gonna be a tag. Clip that under your boobies and take it around back. And you're gonna pull tight, okay? Tight. You take these little guys over your shoulders, take all this nonsense through that belly band. Or here, you're going to twist, go around back. You can tie there. Or for extra Protection, you can twist back there, come back up front. I do that. Now we are prepared for the baby. Alright? So we scoop the button one side, other side over. And then lastly, you find that cheeky little belly band, bring that guy up to. Just to make sure that she's very secure. Very secure. And boom! You have your clingy little friend close to you so that maybe you can get some shit done.",

She went on a tinder date last night, and something horrible happened to her. So she met her day at a trendy new restaurant here in Austin. It's full of fucking douchebags, and. But she said the date was going okay at the beginning until she got up to use the restroom, and a drunk man at the table next to her reached up her skirt and told her she was pretty. Now, something about me is she is not a timid girl. So she said she smacked him in his face and said, you look like the target demographic for Dude Wipes. Eww. You could see why I love her. But her issue was when she got back to the table, obviously upset, and she told her date that she wanted to ask if they could move tables so she didn't have to be next to these drunk men. And her date said to her, oh, don't overreact. They're just drunk. The food came, they ate, and on their way out, she told him, hey, I'm gonna head home. And she said he used his most boyish tone and said, oh, come on, I just spent $200. But may have said, no, I am not interested in hanging out anymore, and there's not going to be a second date. And when he asked why, she said, well, besides you Talking about your Tesla for 35 minutes. You stood by while a man grabbed me and then said I was the one that was overreacting. One of my non negotiables for a partner is that they're a protector. And she said this man yelled in her face on the sidewalk, then go fuck a bear. This is why we're choosing the tree now. Maeve had no fucking idea what he was talking about. Turns out men's response to the man versus bear is, would you rather talk about your feelings with a woman or a tree? You stupid fucking Tesla douchebags that need to wipe their ass. Go fucking talk to a tree. They. We want you to."

For penifer, beneficent Penelope Panini, her father, is a primary human, and me, her mother. I'm just a poor old spare. Primary humans are showered with love and affection. There is no limit to cuddle times, and the amount of trust they're given is unfathomable. But spares? Spares survive on scraps. A mistaken blink of the eyes, or walking over the spare only to cuddle with the primary, or a pay as you go treat for pets transaction. For cats, primary humans are adored, and spare humans are to be tolerated. If you've been a spare to your cats and need professional help in accepting your new status, help is finally here!

There I am, just a week old. And then there's my husband, who was my uncle at the time. He's 37. He's my uncle because he was married to my Auntie Jenny. This is a very younger version of my husband, the very young picture of us. This was not long after I told him I was in love with him. And he did leave my Auntie Jenny for me. This is us fresh in our relationship. There's a picture of me and my stepson Hugo, who is also my first cousin. And this is around the time when we had our second affair behind my husband's back. It's not many pictures of us, to be honest, cause we've hated each other for a long, long time. He's trying to get his claws into my inheritance, which is not his. And I've made sure my husband has cut him and his horrible siblings out of the will. Here is the most recent picture of me and my husband. I did pick him up from his care home to take him out for the day, but unfortunately he did smell like a dirty hamster cage, so I did have to keep the visit brief. He's quite handsome. He does look a bit like Bruce Willis, doesn't He",

I suggest everybody go see it. It has her new tortured poets department, the handful of those songs in the new show, which means there's a new segment and new lights and new, like, dancing and new everything to the show. So lovely. I suggest everybody get out there and see it. Is absolutely unbelievable. You're now up to five concerts. Kansas City, Argentina, Australia, Singapore, and now Paris. How does Paris compare to. Dude, that was. I mean, I don't know if they're just getting better or if I just keep forgetting how they are. I watch videos. It looked way more electric for some reason in Paris. It was electric in there. Well, you got caught pulling an Ed Kelsey move here. Taking a video with your flash on. What are you doing, Trav? You're supposed to be better than this. I was doing what? He, he, he, he, he. Oh, you know the settings on the camera. If it's dark, it's going to automatically put the flash on. I don't understand. What? So I was just trying to get some good, you know, some good video, some good memories. I don't give a damn. Probably got great video. That flash makes a big difference. Yeah, it's the best. 1,000 feet. Shout out to Paris for showing up. And showing out at all the concerts, it looked absolutely amazing. For the first three shows. And that last show was every bit of electric and just energy all. All night, man. It was fun. Zumapel Electric. I think that's it, dude.",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Well, it's actually really not, but I'm gonna tell you anyway. So, I was supposed to go to an event. I didn't end up going, um, because I had an audition. So I stayed home, and I, uh, was taking my dog for a walk. An unexpected walk. I really just wanted a chocolate bar from the grocery store, so I was like, okay, let's just walk over to the grocery store and get it. Um, which they ended up not having. They do not have the Tony's chocolate at Ralph's on LA Brea. Anyway, so I was walking down the street, and I see this little group of people gathered, and I, like, catch a glimpse of this kitten, and I'm like, oh, my god, is that a kitten? And they were like, yeah, it is. And I was like, oh, my god. I'm gonna take it. I'm gonna take it. And, um, because if I see an animal on the street, like, there's. You take the animal, you know? And so I ran the dog home, and I came back to the spot, and this kitten was, like, under. It had run under a car. And so I was like, baby. And all of a sudden, I hear this, like, desperate. Like, it was like this, like, sad. Like, help me, Cry. So she comes out, he comes out crawling out from under the car. Filthy. I'm gonna attach a photo. Filthy. Filthy. So I bring them home. I give him three baths with Dawn. The fleas are just like exposing themselves. There were so many fleas. There were probably like 25. It's not flea season, I guess, so there were like 20, 25, 30 fleas on them. We got them all. We got all the fleas off. And now I have him and I don't really. I'm so tempted to keep him, but like, I literally already have two cats and a dog. Like, I. I don't like I am becoming my grandmother, but I am an animal person. Like, I am such an animal person to my core. And this cat is like immediately bonded with my other cats and my dog. So I don't know what to do. But his temporary name is Milo. And he is an unbelievable kitten. Like, he's unreal. Alright, here's the photo of him. Like, look at him. This is what he looked like. He was literally white or. No, he was literally orange and like gray. Like, he was so filthy. And look at his eyes. So sad. But we got him. Now he's safe. And I don't know where he came from cause he's clearly not a stray, but he had been out on those streets, so. Yeah. Animals, man. I love animals. Like. Like, come on.",

Really grateful that he's still here. This pet food container almost killed my cat, and it's a number one seller. It's really easy for a cat to open, potentially a dog as well. Jump inside, and then it latches on top, closing them inside. He had opened it several times in the past, but I never thought this would happen. You can see the amount of moisture, the claw marks, the hair. I don't know how long he was stuck in here, how long he was running out of air and trapped in here. But what I do know is that he would have died if he was in here and my pet sitter did not find him. When I looked up cats getting stuck in container, I found articles of cats dying from getting trapped in the same container. Please share this video so that if anyone has this food container, they know to get rid of it immediately. I'm absolutely horrified about what happened to him, but I'm so glad he's here, and I hope that this video can help save other pets, too."

Like off bat, humans are not delicious. And we need to get that out of the way. Like right now, for as many people go in the ocean, there are not nearly enough shark attacks to convince me that humans are delicious. Matter of fact, most of the shark attacks don't even eat the person, they just bite me. Be like, there's only two animals that will really even consider us food. Crocodiles literally will eat anything that fit in their mouth. And polar bears. But, you know, I feel like that's just cause, you know, they angry cause it's cold as fuck, but mittens doesn't wanna fucking eat you. Yeah, if you trapped in the house with mittens and you die and mittens can't get out the house, mittens might, might nibble on your face a little bit because they evil or nothing. It's just him taking advantage of the situation you did. If you died right now with a full wallet, you think you gonna get buried with that full wallet? Cause you not. You got roommates. You got food in there. If you die tonight, your roommates gonna eat your food. You're not gonna throw it out. You'll see one of them old western. One of them old western or something, when they have to do In the street. Motherfucker get shot even dead, yet it already stole his shoes and everything. Butt ass naked in the street. Lisa. Cat had the decency to wait till you was all the way dead, man. You didn't even need them shoes, dog. You add shoes. You know how disrespectful it is to steal somebody shoes while you wearing shoes? Disrespect? Matter of fact, in every movie I seen to win, when somebody die on the. On the screen, the first thing somebody do is check they walk. Mittens is way more respectful than your family member. Mittens ate a little bit of your finger. You know, talking about a little bit of your finger, maybe your eyeball or some motherfucker you left with a couch in all the hidden jewelry. That's why I hope you'll be leaving this shit that they cats because they like, man. My cat might eat like some fingernails, maybe nibble on my butt for a little bit. But fuck my family, cause they gonna take all this shit. Fuck my family. Maybe your cat would eat you. Maybe your dog would eat you after you die. But I bet. I bet they wouldn't let the neighbor's dog get some. No, that's you. They gonna eat you. I'mma tell you like this. If you. If you die in front of me, you better not be a size eleven and a/2. Mittens deserves your respect.",

But they know that I'm not. He knows that I'm not a dog. But cats don't do that. Cats think that humans are just really big incompetent cats. They go on to say that cats think that humans are also cats. They just think that we're really incompetent. Like when we go to work and come back, they assume we've been off hunting all day and we didn't bring anything back cause we're just bad at hunting. We're bad at being a cat. And first of all, I don't know how they could possibly know that cause it's not like the cats have told them that's what they think their owners are off doing. And also, I've seen those little cat cam videos on here, where people put like a GoPro of some sort on the cat's collar and then it records their adventures for the day. Those cats are just hanging out with other cats, those cats are just going for little walks. They're not hunting all of the time. But I have still taken all this information to hard enough that I think, well when I get my cat, I'm just gonna keep treats in the car or like wet food so when I come home I can feed them and they'll think that I'm really competent. They'll think that I'm a good hunter. Why do I care about the opinion that fictional cat holds of me? I've got a whole plan, and I'll do it to. My center console will just be full of cat treats and little mouse toys that I can spray with catnip. So that when I come home, they'll think that I did a really good job that day. I just want them to think I'm good at being a cat."

Why skateboard Blue Tavius Devon and icy Le Flair Hawkins okay, not a dog, but this is Keanu Maserati Mayweather y'all. This took me out. My neighbor's cats are at my house so much I gave them names from when they're at my house. Meet Frost Alabasta Jones and Tampaca Sparkles Carmery Louise. Just call her cat. I present to you Sir Leviticus Bartholomew von Strahim, esquire, first of his name in ward of the food bowl. This threat taught me that Bartholomew is a popular name amongst pets. Jersey Raekwon Margielo Augusto Allison the hat is so cute! Omarion DeAndre Debarcus Branch Orion for short. Guinness Cosmo Burrito Mimosa Bellini, Tostado Mojita Hennessy Platano meet the fabulous put in the shade Myers Cold Cecilia, Marie Magdalena, and Ollivander Saint Laurent's. My Dog's name is king because he's always dating office. This is Lola Bean being a also known as Beanie or Big Bean. Brick Gucci Mane Le Flair Carmelo Snipes Petty I can contribute. Here's Frederico Suabacito Dorico Loco Despacito El Chico Davars Jorgasin Rico for short. Chocolate latte Chapman Pepa Le Pew aka Pepper Air or Papita. He said my daughter, period. This whole post deserves a moment. Jatavius Cantrell. Look at the matching sweaters. I mean. Meet Raven Rontenique Smith Rontenique Spaniel Day Louis look like he's been through a lot of things. Is he okay? Cara Zorelle Knowles Savage Laquante Baker baby, we welcome all the bunnies! This is Winter Penelope Shatire Miller, aka the original gangster Winter P. This is Whiskey Frost, aptly named after brown liquor for his brown fur and whiskey colored eyes. I had to include this comment because ain't that the truth. Your pet literally needs a government name so they know when they're acting up. It's the law. I mean facts. Hendrix Quiverius. He's so cute! Toodles! Tyrone Coco Howard. Yeah! Fashion of it is Simone Nicole Falcons. We call her Nova for short. Bella, Don Ray, Ashantiqua Snow with you. Tiara Gucci, Marianne Bethel. A lot of y'all were like how is she pronouncing these names, baby? Sometimes it takes me five to six tries. Dutchess Elizabeth the second. And I did all I could to raise her, but SIS has zero cooth and carry on like she was raised by wild horses. This is Sir Wrangler Michael Thomas Pierre Johnson, Mr. Gucci, Lucifer Antoine and don't forget the Mr. Yes ma'am point Dexter Dexter aka Sexy Dexy Alexander Hamilton Edwards Harris. This is Jonathan Jamarcus Joy star Malcolm X little twin curious Rico Twinkie for short. Y'all already know barkeavius. My fudgie own fudgie Shafter Campbell. This is Braxton P. Hart in the brig and the last one, jacquetavia, is Aquino bit in Harris if you have an outrageous pet name. Stitch this video because we want to see them all."

She was taken either from our yard or just outside of it near Cactus Dr and Oasis Ave in Twentynine Palms, California. I know she was taken by a human and not a coyote because she wears a non-breakaway harness with two claps that have her tags and tracker on it. The harness was found thrown in some bushes next to our fence with both clasps open, perfectly in tact. There are no signs of a struggle. I was home the whole time with the back door and windows open the and I didn\u2019t hear anything.  She\u2019s was abandoned as a kitten and lived outside for her first 2ish years of life so she knows how to handle the outside world. She knows how to find her way back home and she has never not come home. She is LOUD under normal circumstances, so I know if she had a chance she would have thrown a fit. Because of that I also know she\u2019s not just trapped in someone\u2019s garage or shed or something like that. She has some upper respiratory problems and doesn\u2019t have the best lungs so she needs medication. Stress only exacerbates her condition.  I have done everything someone can do when their pet is lost (multiple times). Called shelters/vets, filed a police report, posted on numerous FB pages, missing pet websites, even gone door to door to ask my neighbors if they saw/heard anything or if they have cameras. So now I am turning to TikTok. I know the craziest things can happen through social media so I\u2019m hoping this can be one of those situations. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since she left and I have to force myself to eat. I am sick all the time because of it and am completely heartbroken. As much as I need her, I know she needs me too. She\u2019s been through so much in her little life, I just want to bring her home. I don\u2019t know what else to do. Please help me find my baby \ud83d\udc99 #lostpets\u00a0#missingpets\u00a0#lostcat\u00a0#stolen\u00a0#cat",

    "voice_to_text": "improved access to veterinary care saved my cat's life let's talk about it today is May 10th which means that it's Access to Veterinary Care Awareness Day and so sharing my own story I hope that it allows my veterinary professional friends who really think about how we can play a role in bridging the gap between owners and access to veterinary care I have a community acquired cat where I found him in an abandoned apartment he wasn't chipped, he wasn't neutered, so I kept him, but then he started having horrible vomiting and diarrhea and as someone who had just barely scraped enough to pay for him to have food and water and everything that he needed in my apartment I didn't have the several hundred dollars to take him to the vet to work up what was going on with him so I actually saved up to take him to the Humane Society, and pay for their surrendering fee, because I wanted him to get the care that he needed, The Humane Society actually told me that they couldn't take him, even though I was willing to pay the surrendering fee so I had to take him to the municipal shelter in the area and I knew the statistics the cats that went into that and came out of it alive. I cried, I took him to the shelter and I walked up to the front door and I was like I'm here to surrender my cat that I clearly loved, and was crying about, and there was a rescue there who was doing diversion on purpose, for those who don't know what that means, they were talking to people who were looking to surrender their pets they were asking \"why\"  is it a health issue so that we can help out with and I explained to them like it's because I don't know if he's sick I can't afford it if it is something serious and so they're like, well how about we pay for you to go to the nearby vet clinic it's a walk in clinic, you have to wait all day and we'll pay for him to be neutered [at another date] and if you think that you can keep him otherwise like let's let's keep him out of the shelter it was wild; so I went from the shelter where I had been emotionally preparing to surrender my cat to this veterinary clinic where they saw him, they did a full work up on this rescue's dime, and he was otherwise healthy, was probably just dietary discretion because we had just found him, who knows what he had been eating for a week in that apartment and because of them I got to keep him and I still have him. people wanna talk about access to veterinary care like it's this horrific situation, of a poor person getting an animal that they can't take care of, but sometimes in situations like me, where I was able to take care of him otherwise and it was just that upfront cost that I didn't have the funds for, cause I didn't plan on having a cat ultimately then thanks to Banfield (which again I'm not sponsored by them) I was able to get him on a wellness plan and he has received top notch veterinary care ever since I found him and if it wasn't for that rescue intervening at the shelter you would have probably been euthanized, this list is from VetBilling, and it's kind of a good, comprehensive starting point, for what veterinary professionals can do to learn more and take action including learning about the importance of access to veterinary care adopting a spectrum of care approach to treatment rather than asuming gold standard is best or achieveable by everyone, you can offer a variety of payment plans types include sliding scale options like a EmanciPet does; VetBilling, VetBilling  other companies exist like that, you can embrace cultural sensitivity and DEI initiatives because it actually does improve profitablity, you can provide telemedicine services which have all of my friends that have companies, and veterinary clinics do that as well, and you can create an in-house angel fund or affiliate with third party charitable fund too I'm so grateful for the rescue that actually was committed to increasing access to care by helping me get my cat the care he needs, because if it wasn't for them I probably wouldn't have him, and he probably wouldn't be here \u2764\ufe0f"

    "voice_to_text": "You got cats? Let me put you on something real quick. So I legit have a full fledged actual business with my cats. And what I do, I rent my cats out. I lease them out per day, whether it be to restaurants to of course a restaurant will be in the evening hours. But restaurants, hotels, motels, homeowners houses, people that have a place of business, whether it be a garage or something, people have rodent problems. I mean, they just do. And what are cats? Cats are natural born hunters. Their self taught. You ain't got to teach them this. So I charge anywhere from up to $220 per day for each cat. I got 10 cats. That's over $1,000 a day that I have cats spread out in different locations. And I don't even have to do nothing but just drive. Oh, where's your problem at? In the attic. Okay, put two cats up in the attic, just let them have at it. I'll be back in 24 hours to get my cats. And for every mouse, lizard, any kind of rodent that my cat catches, that's next $25 that I up charge. Because I got proof to show them that my cats do the job and they do it quietly and they're sneaky and they're good at what they do. And like I said, you ain't even got to train them. And I mean, this is as legit as it gets. And it's a humane way. To do it, you don't have to put glue traps down, because, hey, then they just sit on there and they. They suffer. Put a cat in there. A cat needs to eat. I mean, it's part of the. It's part of nature. It's part of nature. Doggy dog, baby. So if you got cats, especially. I know somebody. Some people, I ain't like this, but some of y'all people, you know, y'all got some cats, maybe a cat problem. Start leasing them cats out. You can be a millionaire in a couple months, dude. Free advice I'm giving out, man. Go get you some.",

Like, truly nowhere left to go. That's a harrowing thought. UN is calling this nothing short of a humanitarian nightmare. And they are so right. While activism is not the main focus of my platform, it still means a lot to me. And I can't change how little I've spoken about a cause in the past. All I can do is change how much I'm gonna talk about it in the future. I've connected with Erin Hatter. She's doing a great job over on her front. And I have some organizations and I'm gonna plug at the end of this, as well as giraffe wallow. That's my sister. I mean, there are so many inspiring people on this app who are inspiring me and so many other creators to be better about how often we're posting about Palestine right now. I wanna call to action. All of my followers keep donating, reposting, sharing. I'm doing so and will continue to do so as best I can. It's also important to stay updated. I have some update accounts, and I'm gonna link it. It's gonna be a long description, so if you've been looking for links, now is the time. I try to post credible information and sources on Instagram Stories every day when I can. Okay, and here is my list of Organizations and charities that I would recommend donating to. First of all, I'm reading off my list. Sorry. Uh, the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, UNICEF, Doctors without borders, uh, World Central Kitchen, helping to get food to people in Gaza. Um, WHL. And lastly, head count if you are not registered to vote. If you're an American and you're not registered to vote, please do that head count. Rock the vote. So many different companies. Make it easy and make it simple. If you've never previously voted in an election, now is the election to do it in. If you, like me, do not feel represented by your government that is funding a genocide. Please, probably now is the year to vote. Stay informed. Keep talking about Palestine. Call your representatives. Thanks, guys.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is the first cat to ever publish a physics paper, and he's regarded as the greatest feline physicist of all time. His name is Chester, and he lived with a human roommate named Jack Hetherington, who was also a physicist at Michigan State University. In 1975, Jack wrote a paper about his research results, and he wanted to publish it to a scientific journal. When he had a colleague review his work, they pointed out that he had used the pronoun we instead of I and suggested that the journal would reject it as a single author submission because it was written on a typewriter. The entire paper would have had to have been retyped to fix this, so Jack decided it would just be easier to bring on a second author instead, and naturally his cat Chester was his first choice. To make it less obvious to the review board that his second author was a cat, he gave Chester the pen name FDC Willard, short for Fearless Domesticus Chester Willard, which is the scientific name for a house cat, plus Chester, plus the name of Chester's dad. The paper was accepted, and after it was published, Jack sent some signed copies to some friends, including FDC Willard's paw print. At this point, FDC Willard's cover was blown, but the physics community only embraced their new cat colleague. He went on to publish another paper as the only author, and he's highly respected for his lasting contributions to The field all of his work can be found on Google Scholar.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I've just seen a video about people who are indoor cat owners um their cat distribution system is just sometimes them going and stealing somebody's outdoor cat and I have a few thoughts about this because the comment section was not pretty so I had a cat growing up and she was an outdoor cat she was part stray I think um someone's cat that my dad knew got pregnant just out there in the wild and we adopted one of the kittens now bless her heart she I think she she grew up the first few months of her life in a house with lots of children lots of animals I think she had developed some kind of like social anxiety around people and noise and stuff like that so she loved us me and my parents but she was really really really um nervous around other people and I think I'm definitely growing up some of my friends didn't get that because um like one of my best friends from school had like Burmese cats so they were incredibly friendly and then people would come to my house and my cat would either run away or like try and if someone's coming close to her she doesn't like it she would like hiss and you know kind of bite if they if they were invading her personal space um so yeah she loved being outside she would run around the garden she chill in the garden she was just so happy being outside and she'd come in and out we got the cat flat you know like she loved it like even a couple times we went on holiday we took her with us in the little cat carrier and you know despite the fact this is a new place she would just chilling like she loved the outside she loved the garden like we it it to us it was a no brainer and like my dad grew up with cats he is of the opinion as am I that keeping a cat indoors is cruel and it causes distress because they are meant they're meant to be free they're meant to roam and run around I think people are under the impression that cats are domesticated animals and they aren't they're semi domesticated at best roughly 10,000 years ago I think when we first see um cats show up in the archaeological record like being buried around humans they essentially just kind of walked up to us and entered into like a symbiotic relationship because we were where the vermin was and so they kind of came to eat the rats and the mice and they were like okay this is cool like we'll chill together like we didn't do to them what we did to dogs like frankly what we did to dogs is horrible think about the wolves that they came from and look what we did to them like look at pugs what we did to pugs dogs are so so so dependent on us and cats just aren't like that and I think what indoor cat owners forget sometimes is that the way that they feel about indoor about indoor cats being the best thing outdoor cats owners believe that too and they are equally as wedded to that lifestyle as you are and frankly I like I look at some of these catios that people create and I'm like that's just a prison that looks like an open air prison you know when prisoners go outside to walk and they have their 15 minutes outside and then they have to go back into their cell like that's what it looks like to me as someone who had an outdoor cat and when I have cats in the future like they'll be outdoor cats that's what collars and bells are for in my opinion like I mean my cat was never gonna be catching any birds she was like we got her so that she could catch mice cause my one of you know our old neighbor was a hoarder and we would just have loads of mice she did Jack shit she was awful and just the entitlement of all of these indoor cat owners in the comments of this video being like yeah I don't care if you know your cat is microchip if your cat has got a collar or a bell or whatever if I see them outside on the street I'm gonna take them home with me and I'm gonna give them a better home it's like who gives you the right to do that so how would you like it if I broke into your house and kidnapped your cat because I believe personally that keeping cats indoors cause them to have behavioral issues go through mental stress and it's like keeping a keeping a person in in prison how would you like it if I did that like that that doesn't seem to be that same acknowledgement that we raise our pets in different ways because we believe that is what's best for them unless you're adopting a cat that has slightly older and has like never been an outdoor cat it's just safer to keep them indoors cause you know they don't they don't have to be outside like that I'm fully on board and I would like if I adopt a cat like that I would 100% keep them in indoor cats if they haven't grown up a certain way like it's cruel to force them to do the other way it's like same same thing with an outdoor cat if an outdoor cat has been an outdoor cat and you're gonna adopt them you have to keep them an outdoor cat it's cruel otherwise my point is both an indoor cat lifestyle and an outdoor cat lifestyle are potentially risking some kind of thing an outdoor cat could get run over an indoor cat could live a life that is full of issues behavioural mental because they're not getting what they need both carry risks it's just down to what you as a pet owner feels is the right and I would hope you take your whatever pet you want to adopt into consideration I you know if you're if you wanna have an indoor cat go and adopt a cat that is an indoor cat and has to be an indoor cat because of you know their bad experiences don't take an outdoor cat and force it to be an indoor cat yeah we just we need to respect each other's choices and we need to make sure that we are doing the very best for the animal that we have and if you have an you know if I have an outdoor cat that it ends up they don't wanna be outside or like they seem to have loads of issues whenever they're out and about you would adjust accordingly you know and same thing with an indoor cat like if an indoor cat is expressing wanting to go outside get them a harness get them a lead take them around if you got a garden take them around the garden and and make sure that they're getting to know their little territory and establish their territory and then they might grow from there and they gotta make sure you're doing the best for your pet and not for you"

No food for our pets is a guarentee of health and no food is a guarantee of illness and anyone implying this is the case does not have a good enough graps of nutrition to be giving advice. A mix of wet and dry is a good option for cats. It does promote hydration but it is also useful to get them used to different food textures, so if you need to change their diet you can do so reasonably easily. Cats are not big drinkers, this is true but it doesn\u2019t follow, and there is no evidence, that feeding only dry food leaves them \u2018chronically dehydrated\u2019 When it comes to urinary and kidney health, the quality and mineral content of the diet, wet or dry, is what makes the most difference.  But even then, healthy cats should be able to manage just fine if your budget only extends to the more cost effective options (and look for the lower cost diets produced by science based brands, their knowledge & quality extends to all their lines!) I despise scaremongering and accusatory videos on nutrition. They do nothing but worry pet owners and, very often, they also undermine the trust and relationship people have with their vet. If you ever see anything online that makes you question how you care for your pet, please reach out to the staff at your local clinic. They will be more than happy to help you and guide you on what will work best for you and your animals. #cathealth #catfood #felinenutrition #askyourvet #catthevet And thanks as always to @FIGS for my lovely #gifted scrub top!",

No. If you feed your cat a 100% wet food diet will that stop them getting urinary problems? No. Will it stop them getting urinary blockages? No. Will it prevent them from getting kidney failure? No. If you want to feed your cat a 100% wet food diet, as a recently viral video on here has been advocating, then that is absolutely fine but it is not a guarantee of health or welfare for your cat. Ut's true that our cats aren't naturally big drinkers but as long as we provide water freely available and in a way that they want so moving, wide, flat filled to the brim, I've discussed it in other videos, that is absolutely fine, they will drink. If you feed your cat dry food that does not automatically mean that they're going to get urinary problems or kidney failure or obesity or diabetes. No food is a one way ticket to health and no food is a one way ticket to illness. And any person claiming that that is the case, does not know enough about nutrition to be giving advice.",

    "voice_to_text": "There isn't a woman on planet earth that doesn't want to be LED by their man. This goes across the board 100% of the time. Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough"

It retails for $100 in the US. And here's the official box art. One customization in this that I really like is that you can switch out the eye color for the cat. Here's a picture of what it looks like with the two different eye colors. It looks like the ears are also movable, as well as its little footies and the little white tip on the tail. I believe you're able to move it back and forth. The build is actually a really good size, too. And I love how they styled it here with two other cat. And when building animals or creatures out of Lego, often times the face can look a little weird. It can be really difficult to capture these kind of characteristics out of Lego literal bricks. But I think they did a really good job here. And actually, this cat's mouth is open, whereas in this picture, it's closed. That's something else on the cat that I didn't realize we could pose. Last year, we got a Hocus Pocus Lego set, and I feel like this set would look really good out on display during Halloween. Or if you have, like, a Hayami Azaki display, Kiki's delivery service, or if you just like cats. Now, obviously, I understand the appeal of having Your pets represented in Lego. Even though I don't have a cat, I feel like this is something I really want. Let me know all of your thoughts on this. And make sure you send this video to a cat lover in your life.

    "voice_to_text": "Have you ever been invited to a party where you didn't know anyone? Here's a question you can ask to meet new people easy. Welcome back. This is episode 14 in my series on how to break the habit of small talk and build more meaningful relationships. I was recently invited to a birthday party of about 50 people where I only knew the host. So I walked up to her and I asked, who are the three people that I should meet tonight and why? Equipped with that information, I walked up to these individuals one by one, introduced myself, and told them that the host suggested we should meet. And because the hosts had given me information about them, it was very easy for me to lead the conversation and become friendly with them. The general idea here is to use your existing contacts as a conduit to meet new people. By the way, I've given a whole TED talk on this topic, so follow along if you want to become a better conversationalist. Thanks for tuning in. Peace out. Stay tuned for tomorrow's episode."

Her nephew needs a foot surgery. Her mother is very, very sick, and she has been begging for people to hear her and to see her and to donate and to find ways to help make them safe.

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. This is not my usual content, but I just wanted to come on here to say, um, if you have cats, um, in general, but more specifically male cats, um, switch them over to wet food, like, as soon as you can, or incorporate wet food into their diet. Um, I just lost my cat to urinary blockage, and, like, the biggest leading cause that is just not enough water intake. And wet food is the best way to fix that. And, um, he was an entirely healthy cat until, like, 20 days ago. And we went through the procedure to unblock him, and he reblocked again, and now we were able to save him this time. And, no, I don't have my cat anymore. And I still owe more than I owe on my car. And it's just, um. Just if I would have known. If I would have known, I would have paid the. The extra, however much it is, to switch him earlier. And, um, I know you, like, as a pet parent, you see a lot of content about, like, all these things you can do to improve your cats lives and your animals lives, but if there's, like, anything you take from today, please, please. I'm so sorry.",

Ripping open anything plastic that she can get her fucking greasy little paws on. Sneaky jumping on my fucking stove. Where were you raised, bitch? Where they do that at? Is there obedience school?

When I arrived at the shelter, first of all, I came for a different cat all together. Don't let her hear me say that shit. Um. But I chose her because she was sweet and lovable. And for the first 3, 4 weeks she was chilling like we had no issues. Soon as that little personality started to come out. Oh, bitch, you tricked me into bringing you home with me. You're a scam artist. This is not what the fuck I signed up for. I wanted love and companionship. I needed something to love. You won't let me love you. Because you make me want to throw you in a blender. It is absurd. And I'm. I swear to god, I'm trying my best, but this bitch makes it really fucking difficult. Not to mention I scoop your shit.

They like to have picnics with their family. More barbecue here and there, play some card games, a little balloon. That might get a little heated, but, you know, my point is, Arabs are not scary.

She may look cute, but she is the most annoying cat you'll ever come across in your life. I'm still trying to work out whether it's worth it. Should we just throw you back in the plant pot where we found you? Because she doesn't let us sleep. She sleeps all day, and then at literally like 3:00am, 4:00am, she's outside our bedroom door crying. Just meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. It's the most annoying thing. And, like, I literally sleep with ear plug. We both sleep with ear plugs now. I'd. I'd do now. Yeah. You can still hear it through the earplugs. You open the door, you let her in, thinking, okay, she just wants to be with us. Cause sometimes she just gets cozy and comfy, gets in the bed, like, curls up and sleeps next to you. Now, 80% of the time, she doesn't cut up next to you. She comes in the room, trots in like, she's been crying. You let her in, she trots in, jumps on your face, jumps on your face, jumps up on the headboard and starts scratching on the headboard, swinging from the curtains, just making the most noise possible. Or even just like, the smallest sounds when you're trying to sleep, you know, when you. When you wake up, and then just, like, little things agitate you. Whatever. Yeah. Oh, my God. Like, I just. Mmm. It's just the most annoying thing. It was so annoying and I don't know what to do about it, cause I just don't feel like we should be experiencing this with a cat. Like, yeah, if we had a baby, fair enough. But we have a cat. Why haven't I slept in 3 months? I don't know what to do. Like, I don't know, but the bags under my eyes are getting ridiculous. Long story short, if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this, please let me know. I'm just asleep. I love you, but you're making my life worth it. Look at her face. You can't believe it. Can't believe it's talking bad about me. Oh, she's falling asleep. Yes, she can fall asleep and then it's an Oreo. Any advice, please let us know."

Well, for starters, the person already knows how they feel about you. So by not asking, you're only keeping yourself in the dark. They already know the question. To where do you see this going? How do you feel about me? I like you. Do you like me? They know the answer. By not asking, you're only keeping yourself in the dark. Number one. Number two. A lot of us fear. Well, we could scare them away. If I tell somebody that I like them, I might scare them away. Why would you be with someone who was scared when you said, I like you? Why would you wanna be with somebody who ran away from you when you said, I enjoy spending time with you? Or when you said, where do you see this going on? That hardly ever happens. People don't change their mind about you because you told them how you feel or you asked how they felt. However they feel is staying the same whether or not you ask. It's not changing. Because if somebody asks you, how do you feel about me? You're not changing your mind about them because they asked. You already have your mind made up. But you know what? Let's just hypothetically say you tell someone how you feel about them, or you ask Someone. Where do you see this going? Or you tell someone that you're interested in something serious with them, and it does scare them away. Good. That's a bullet dodge. You don't wanna be with that person. And third of all, the sooner that you ask someone, where do you see this going? How do you feel about me? You like me? The sooner you ask somebody, the sooner you can get the fuck out of there. If you're not aligned, the sooner you open yourself up to finding someone who does respect, appreciate, and adore you, which is what you deserve. So it's a win win. You ask someone, how do you feel about me? Or where do you see this going? They're either going to free you to go find someone you deserve, or they're going to give you the answer you were looking for. Okay. Right. Person for you is not gonna be scared because you like them. Just let that sink in."

    "voice_to_text": "Will your cat forget you? The answer might shock you. Cat memories are divided into short term and long term. Their short term memory last about 16 hours. They might not remember specific events, but they do remember essential survival info, like which cabinet hides the treats or which bowl has food. They've got it all mapped out. And when it comes to long term memories, cats can remember skills for opening doors, windows, and even cabinets, keeping these memories for 10 years or more. But here's come the interesting part. When it comes to people, cats are picky about what they remember. Thanks to their self domestication, they only hold on to memories of people and things that are useful to them. If you feed them, give them a home, and care for them with love, they associate you with all the good in their world, creating a bond that lasts a lifetime. There was a cat raised by an elderly person from kittenhood when the owner fell ill and had to give the cat away. Even after two years apart, the cat still recognized their voice. The cat may think you just stepped out for a while, but you never truly leave their memory. So do you think your furry friend remembers all the good times you've shared? They do, more than you might realize. Share this with a cat lover and follow us for more heartwarming cat tales!",

    "voice_to_text": "You should not sleep with your pets. I know they're adorable, I know we love our little fur babies, but it's not the best idea. Here are a few reasons pets can actually disturb your sleep because they just move, right? So one more person or one more being in your bed moving is just enough to disturb your sleep throughout the night. The other thing that I find with patients is that they end up curling into weird positions like fetal position or just all over the place just so that their dog can have the majority of the bed. Hurting your neck or your shoulder or your lower back just so that your dog can take up most of the bed is probably not the best idea for your long term health. Dogs and cats and other types of pets are not the cleanest thing in the world. Pet dander and even the things that they come into contact with outdoors like other types of allergens and pollens, they are an allergy risk. They can negatively impact your breathing at night. They can get on your pillows. Regardless of how clean you try to keep the room, adding another pet into that area just makes air quality a lot worse and could be negatively affecting the way that you sleep. Do you guys find that you're not sleeping well? Try to create your dog for the night or at least kick him out of the bedroom just for A couple nights and see if it makes a difference"
