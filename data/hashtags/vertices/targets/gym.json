If you don't stretch, you're now gonna lose your range of motion and lose every sort of mobility within your body. But you're being told not to stretch. Form rolling is a way of massaging your body. So, I mean, unless you wanna pay \u00a380 for someone to massage you when formal can do the same job, by all means, don't form roll. Band work as well. Another way of increasing your range of motion and your mobility within your body. And last but not least, gym work. You see, all the top athletes who had such a long career, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, they all went to the gym. But, hey, by all means, don't do those. Wow.",

I come on here and I make a video and I will say, hey, you know, you know, you shouldn't slept with Pookie Ray Ray. But this is. This is the bullshit in our community. If this is what this goes out for all the ladies here, if this is what, what aesthetically you're attracted to get you six kids, I don't know how many baby daddies really don't care at this point. If this is what it cost to get you, you might need go talk to an ugly guy. At least he'll be there for you. You need to talk to what you're not attracted to. Cause if what you've been attracted to get you these results is you. Is you picking bad as you listen to the lies and to the bullshit. Yeah, we lie just to get in your pants. But you're not gonna find a man. You're not going to. I don't give a damn what these women say on here. They can say, Queen this. You're not gonna find a man that's making six figures, gonna come and save you with six kids. He's not gonna do it. If any man come in your life and you got six kids, you might wanna be. You might wanna look at him though, because not less. He's, you know, not less. He's just 70, 80 years. Old, he's not gonna do it. I just hope you get your shit together. And I really feel sorry for these kids. These kids gonna suffer because of the fucked up decisions that you made when you let. When you let 5 minutes of fun cost you 6 kids. At what point? I don't want to hear the shit about you was young and dumb and this and that though. Hey, we give you two. You know what? We give you the first two, but after that, that shit's on you. Get your stuff together, young lady, and I'll be praying for them kids. Cause I don't give a damn about your situation. Cause these kids gonna suffer. They gonna suffer an education system. They gonna suffer an angle, get a good night's sleep. Cause you bounce around a house, a house, all y'all in the same fucking bed. They're not gonna be able to function mentally. You destroying your kids mentally. You don't even know it. It's deep flow. Speaking facts."

    "voice_to_text": "Come in a gym half naked. Y'all do unnecessary stuff in the gym. For time I ever went to the gym, this lady came up to me and she was like, why do you have on makeup at the gym? And I will never forget that. Why the fuck do you bitches care so much what someone wears to the gym? If the girl next to me has her whole booty out and her titties out, I don't care. I'm there to work out. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with me. If that's how she feels confident, if she has to wear that in order to go to the gym and feel confident, why do I care? And people like you make the gym so undesirable because you always have something to say. Who cares what people wear to the gym? If you say you wear your leggings and your little sweat band and your shirt, keep it pushing, no one cares. And then you say they did it for attention, they got your attention, so it worked. Correct. I just don't understand why we just all collectively don't learn to and let people do whatever the hell they want. If the girl next to me wanted to come in high heels and a mini dress to the gym to work out, I would not care. If the guy next to me wanted to come in booty shorts and a crop top, I would not care. If they wanted to come in sweatpants and, I don't know, a hoodie, I would not care. I don't care what other people wear to the gym. I don't worry about anybody else in the gym but myself. So I'm just so confused, because if you were actually focused on your workout, you were actually focused on you, you wouldn't be worried about what everybody else is doing. And I don't understand that. Learn to just. Shh, Shh. Learn to do that. That is just that simple. And it really pisses me off because who are you to police what people wear to the gym? If a girl wanna go with her titties out her ass out, whatever it is, fuck is it to you? Get on a treadmill, do your workout, go home and it's simple as that. Cause at the end of the day, no one gives a fuck. But you're pressed, you're bothered cause you came to TikTok to make a video. No one cares. Girl, go to get a business loan and open up your own gym. And then put the requirements on what people are not allowed to wear. If it bothers you that much, that's it.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. Okay, I know I just saw you this afternoon, but. Okay, let me get this straight. We're in the year of our Lord 2024, and people are still posting cuck fantasies in the gym community because it's motivational. Actually went to Bros page and I saw that he recently went through a breakup. So let me give you some advice. If you don't wanna become an absolute reject, degenerate loser, if you don't wanna be that guy who's thinking about his girlfriend getting clapped by other men while in the gym, maybe stop posting stuff like this. I know you think it's helping. I know you think, oh, like, I'm trying to get back at her and look good so she can, like, see me and be jealous. But you're destroying yourself. She doesn't care. The fact that you are. Think like the. Bro, think about this for just one second. You're thinking about another man sleeping with the woman that you loved at one point, I assume in order to hit an extra rep of 1 85. Bro, do you not see the psychological problems that could arise from that? Do you not see how that can be really detrimental to your mental health? Like, we need to start waking up. Guys, being a cook in order to put on one extra pound of muscle a year really isn't worth it. Especially when there's other forms of motivation.",

    "voice_to_text": "where are my gym girls who started off chubby um we're right here we're right here currently on our second attempt at losing weight and the issue is the first time I lost a lot of weight I have I lost a lot of weight I've been in the gym since 2015 and a lot of people don't like to believe that cause I am a bigger girl um they think if I've been in the gym for about 10 years my body should look a lot different which, fair but I did lose a lot of weight the issue is I did it in a way that it's not sustainable because I followed what these small girls did no hate to them it's not their issue that they were raised skinny and I was raised fat I've always been fat I come from a big family but with that comes a lot of mental rewiring that has to come in regards to food binge eating habits relationship with food etcetera etcetera um that a lot of these skinny girls don't have to deal with um so yeah I lost a lot of weight I lost a lot of weight I was physically aesthetically in the best shape of my life issue is I was also extremely unhealthy because I was severely under eating getting no type of nutritional value I was wearing my body out working out multiple times a day to lose weight getting no sleep um and at the end of the day the mental relationship with food was still there so when it came down to it I reverted back to my old food behaviors and gained all the weight back and then some so currently we are trying to lose weight in a more sustainable way in a more healthy way while also providing our bodies with nutritional value our micros and our macros and moving our bodies and getting strong as heck in the gym progressive overload which we are currently doing great at um but yeah us bigger gym girlies are here and yeah we are looking at the slim waist and fat wagons and we are loving them but also recognizing that what someone who started off small and built muscle did to get there is not something I could do it's not again no hate not their fault that they were raised skinny and I was raised fat we just gotta work a little differently so as bigger girls need to start looking at other bigger girls who got to where we wanna get to and start idolizing that so we are right here"

He said to be a footballer starting from a very young age. Um, even got to the point where he was being paid a salary to play football. Anyway, one night he's walking to the shop to get some groceries and he's set upon by a blood thirsty funky. Um. In the process of the struggle of him trying to get away, he ends up losing his eyesight in one eye. Um, depression spiraling out of control. But he manages to put himself back. Now he's got his uh. PT licence. What he does is he trains um, children, underprivileged children, children who suffer from mental health problems. Brings them back up. Um. Gives them that strength in the belief that I can do it. If you can give him a little like give him a little support, bit of a follow, it would mean the world to him."

No hate, no shade to this creator. She has a lot of great points. Like not comparing yourself to people on the internet, especially when they are years ahead of you and their fitness journey. But I wanna talk about how you get to eating that much food and maintaining it. And it's not the way you think. These people you see on the internet that are eating crazy amounts of foods, like 3,000 calories a day, have been doing this for years. And I don't mean like one to two, I mean like five to 10 years. The longer you lift and feel yourself properly, the more muscle mass your body gets. The more muscle mass your body has, the higher your basal metabolic rate is, which is the rate at which you burn calories at rest. So that means you need more fuel. So yes, after years and years and years of consistent weight training and fueling your body properly, you can imagine that it is possible for a woman to need that much fuel to maintain her body. Not to mention these people are eating Whole Foods. They are eating crap. They're fueling their bodies with nutrient dense foods. I have a lot of female clients that are currently eating around 24 25 calories A day and they're lifting four to five times a week. They're not doing any cardio or any extra condition. With all this being said, that is why weight training is one of the best options for losing fat and keeping it off in a sustainable way. Not to mention all of the other health benefits that come from weight training. You also can't compare walking to weight training and expect the same results.",

    "video_description": "#stitch with @Sarah Lauren Not trying to be rude in any way towards this young lady, I just think we need to be realistic and stop calling sweat suits \u201cweight loss secrets\u201d.  Sweat is the body\u2019s natural A/C. It helps dilate blood vessels for easier transfer of blood cells throughout the body and also regulates the body\u2019s temperature. While sweating is also wonderful for reducing water weight, thats ALL THAT IS BEING REDUCED\u2026WATER. This young lady does state that water weight is lost. But we can\u2019t call this a \u201cweight loss\u201d secret when there is no true weight being lost. You MAY see a difference of about 5lbs, but unless your body fat percentage is low enough, you won\u2019t see a life changing difference. And unless you\u2019re a few days out from a body building show, or trying to reduce your water retention for a particular event such as a photoshoot or a ufc fight, this isn\u2019t going to be as effective as you would think. You can achieve this same technique by wearing something as simple as a few more layers. Maybe even a SWEAT shirt and a pair of SWEAT pants. You could even go as far as a simple trash bag underneath a hoodie if you want to reduce your water weight/water retention at a fraction of the cost. This is not a weight loss secret. This is a water weight hack, and this is not sustainable for long term weight loss.  #weightloss#weightlosscheck#gymtok#gym#foryou"

    "voice_to_text": "the mechanical tension is back alright so Samson and Sam are talking about mechanical tension and how that works with hypertrophy and how much weight should I go up I'm here to tell you the five big things you need to build muscle and these guys are very advanced so they're talking about little details that don't mean a lot for new people who are just starting training but I'm here to tell you the five big things you need to have in your training in order to build muscle number one and this is the biggest thing that you can do is train consistently even if you're doing a crappy program you don't know what you're doing if you're doing it consistently and over time you're able to lift more weight you're going to build muscle to make it super simple we go to the gym to intentionally stress our muscles out so that they think life is harder than it actually is and then we will grow from that because our body is really good at adapting to whatever we do if you sit on the couch all day and do nothing you're gonna lose muscle because you're tricking your body into thinking you don't need it if you go to the gym consistently and you're consistently stressing those muscle fibers out to the point where your muscles are basically saying hey I don't know what's going on outside the body right now but we need to get bigger you will get bigger and stronger the next biggest factor on the five is recovery so are you getting adequate sleep and is the sleep quality if you're having a hard time sleeping you need to figure out a way whether that's through supplementing magnesium or something like that in order to increase your sleep quality if you're spending a lot of time on your phone scrolling which I'm guilty of quite a bit you need to try to eliminate that and get good sleep when we sleep that's when our body is doing all of its repair work it's recovering it's building new tissue so consistency overtime and sleep those two factors right there will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you when it comes to building muscle the next thing which is also a very important factor is nutrition so in order to put on tissue or to gain weight or to put on muscle we need to be eating more calories and we're burning to have an excess amount of building blocks to work with but the biggest of those building blocks is protein so how many grams of protein should you be getting in I have other videos uh explaining this much more in depth but super easy way is take your ideal body weight so let's say you're 1:50 you're trying to get up to 1:00 70 you need to eat about 170 grams of protein per day consistently in order to know that your body has excess protein to divert to the muscles that are needing to get bigger so we go to the gym we have leg day we push those muscles pretty intensely now all of a sudden they're going alright we need more protein to build new tissue if you don't have enough protein in your system you can't divert any of it to build new tissue so you can work out consistently you can have great recovery if you're not supplying the amount of building blocks you need to then put on new muscle you're not going to get to that point of actually seeing the results you want so those are three big the three biggest factors are consistency recovery nutrition particularly protein intake the next thing is how intense are you lifting so once we have those first three in order now we need to start looking at intensity and this is where mechanical tension comes into place so our muscles don't grow based on how many sets or reps or how much weight we're lifting all they know is mechanical tension so when I'm doing a bicep curl the first couple reps are easy my body is recruiting the minimal amount of muscle fibers it needs to complete the action but what happens you keep going under that set and all of a sudden the last few reps start slowing down you're trying as hard as you can to get the weight up those last two or three reps of your set where we are coming close to failure are when our muscles are freaking out they don't know what's going on so the brain goes okay I gotta have to recruit every single fiber and that's when you get the what are called high threshold motor units sometimes it called fast twitch muscle fibers the muscles that only come into play or the the fibers that only come into play when all it's all hands on deck so they actually put enough intensity into the lift where the last couple reps really hard to finish you'll know when you're getting close to failure because you're trying as hard as you can but the weight won't move as fast as the first couple reps so if you're trying to optimize your training as you get your consistency your recovery and your nutrition in line now it's starting to to start looking at intensity so there's a couple things when it comes to intensity one is coming close to failure that is gonna whether or not you're going full range of motion or not if you're getting close to failure you're doing checking a big box the next thing when it comes to lifting intensity is how much range of motion am I going through so if I'm doing a bicep curl but I'm only doing the top half I'm still going close to failure yeah that's good but I wanna train my muscle at its fully lengthened position if I can get that muscle to actually have tension on it when it's stretched that is what's going to provide an even better um environment for hypertrophy so take a squat for instance if you're doing a barbell back squat and you're only going down halfway you're not really going to full depth even if the weights really heavy you're not getting as much out of that exercise as you could not only for hypertrophy for but for functional training so I have a lot of really older clients that are 80 90 years old their big one of their biggest complaints is they can't get up out of a low chair so they're in a deeper spot when they're sitting in a low chair and they just can't they don't have the strength that that lower end range of motion to get up so if you're training you wanna pick a weight where you can go full range of motion and try to get the muscle you're working for like on a on a on a chest press you don't wanna just finish here and press what we wanna do is take that muscle through its full range of motion and feel as if there's tension on it in that lengthened position that way we're able to not only train with intensity we're going to failure but we're going full range of motion so a lot of studies have shown that working the muscles that you're training in their lengthened position is going to be the most ideal way to promote hypertrophy so that deep stretch so not only intensity of the lift but putting it through its full range of motion so if you're finding that yeah I've gotten really strong with these movements but then you look at your technique and yeah I'm I'm I'm pushing 100 pound dumbbells but I'm not going all the way down you might need to recalibrate maybe go to the 70s or 60 pounds even and get that muscle through a huge stretch at the bottom now this always goes to always try to do this without any pain so if you're feeling pain in a certain joint or muscle while you're doing this maybe not the best you might have to consider lightening your weights that you're currently doing and you will get more out of it your muscles don't know how much weight you're lifting all they know is mechanical tension which is what salmon and Samson are talking about your muscles do not know how much weight you're lifting all they know is how difficult it feels to lift so if you try to make the lightest weight possible feel as difficult as possible by going through a big stretch full range of motion you're gonna get more out of this at \u00a360 and you'll get out of \u00a380 going half range of motion so to recap consistency you have to train consistently and progressively overload over time you need great recovery you need to sleep well and rest on your rest days and actually be able to recover in time for your next workout if you're walking into leg day sore from your last leg day your recovery is not in line nutrition you need to be eating the amount of protein you need to get to that goal you need to have excess protein in your system in order to divert to the muscles that need it now we get to intensity am I training to failure or close to failure if you're not you're not sending those signals to your brain so your muscles are going when you're training to intensity basically when you get to those last couple reps your peck is yelling to your brain like I don't know what the hell is going on outside the body right now but we need to get bigger so your brain goes okay well how much protein do I have available to send to that area if you have enough it can divert it and when you're resting and recovering it's building it's getting bigger and you should see that in your progressive overload if your muscles are getting bigger then you should be able to lift more weight or do more repetitions at the same way then very last thing is making sure your technique and your full range of motion is in there so on a bicep curl I'm not doing little quarter or three quarter reps in fact the lengthened position of those exercises are the most important when we're trying to optimize so taking the bicep all the way to its fully lengthened position is gonna have a lot of tension when it's stretched hence you won't have to do as much weight if you're going full range of motion but you still wanna progressively overload that overtime so let's say you're lifting hundred pound dumbbells like this you try to do a full range of motion with 100 pounds you're not gonna be able to get it up cause that muscle is not used to having tension on it in that lengthened position so lighten the weights if you're not going full range of motion and you will eventually be able to progressively overload that movement so eventually you will be able to get the hundred pound dumbbells all the way through a full range of motion so I hope that helps if you want any more information on building muscle or anything",

    "voice_to_text": "And everybody not supposed to be skinny. You can tell when you got that bobblehead. Okay, so this is absolutely no hate to this creator, but as someone who's on a weight loss journey, it is getting so draining to constantly hear from people who have never lived life as a fat person, never had to deal with the treatment of being a fat person in society, trying tell you that you're gonna look weird, skinny, you shouldn't look skinny, that you should just stop. And the crazy thing is that people always tell you that if you're fat, it's cause you're lazy. It's cause you have no discipline, no self control. But then I've noticed the second you do have self control, you start being more discipline, being consistent, eating right, working out, and then as a result, you lose weight. People still be like to you, are you ill? Is everything okay? Are you taking stuff? That you look weird? Are you meant to be getting this skinny? And all of that. But I've actually come to the realization that people only seem to say that to someone who was once fat, who's now lost weight, simply because they only ever saw you as a fat person. Like, in their mind, they can't actually fathom or believe that you've lost weight, that you're this person, that you have this type of routine, that you changed this much. Some people only ever see you as. But they've only ever Known you as. So if you've only ever been fat your whole life and you lose weight, it is typical for people to ask questions like, oh, is everything okay? Are you ill? Like, you're losing so much weight. News flash, to lose weight, you just have to be in a deficit. You can work out if you want, but really and truly eat right, you're gonna lose weight. It's really not rocket science. So this whole, you know, fake, caring attitude a lot of people seem to have isn't real because they don't actually care. But to be honest, I will always ask the same question I've been asking all this time. Why do people who have never been fat care so much? Someone has lost weight. Why aren't you just focusing on yourself? Like, I. I don't understand. If you're trying to, like, come from a good place, there's a way to do it. Because this whole, you can tell, you know, bobblehead, this, that, they look weird. Losing weight is gonna change you, right? Like, especially if you lose a lot, you might end up with loose skin. Yeah, your head might be big, whatever. But regardless, the person that wanted to lose weight still won because that's what they wanted. So I'm not understanding it, but I feel like this conversation could have definitely gone in a better way. But I'm reading some comments, and people are literally listing different celebrities or influences that they feel Like, shouldn't have lost weight. But I just don't get it, because if they didn't lose weight, you'd be bullying them to lose weight. Now that they've lost weight, you're bullying them that they shouldn't have lost weight. People need to 1 pick a struggle to choose which one it is. Because you can't tell people they should lose weight and then get mad at them for losing weight. Can we start turning this on, please?",

Of course, right back in the day, Eddie was a really talented bodybuilder, but what he is more talented at is literally being a con artist, a scam artist. For anyone that's looked into how much money he's made out of this whole thing, he's made ridiculous amount. And for anyone that hasn't figured it out, this is basically what happened, right? He started off, he did really well in bodybuilding. He ate loads of carbs, obviously. He abused lots of steroids and insulin and a huge number of compounds. He then stopped all that, used the physique kid gained from that and saying more and more outrageous things online, making outrageous claims to gain a follow, and then has just milked people out of as much money as possible, just giving stupid nutrition tips and diet plans.",

So yes,   and   5   5   So   yes it might take longer to achieve that same joint range of motion   might   take   longer   to   achieve   that   same   joint   range   of   motion and you might need to use slightly lighter Loads.   you   might   need   to   use   slightly   lighter   Loads I still think training to that full range of motion,   still   think   training   to   that   full   range   of   motion at least a comfortable full range of motion is your best option,   least   a   comfortable   full   range   of   motion   is   your   best   option not only from a high perchery standpoint,   only   from   a   high   perchery   standpoint but just from an overall health standpoint.   just   from   an   overall   health   standpoint Like you should be strong through a full range of motion.   you   should   be   strong   through   a   full   range   of   motion",

When they all ditch him, he's just gonna become the next Luke Bennett. Why? Only known for getting bullied. Only known for being in his lives like a double. Or even worse, he's gonna be like a cow.

How are you guys spending $500 for a coach to give you a breakdown macros of something like this? This is atrocious. $500, for reference. Let me just put it out there. If you want me to be your coach, I'm literally in your pocket. If you're getting, like, the top tier, right? It's $350 a month. I'm literally in your pocket. You can text me, and I'm gonna get back to you at least within the day, okay? There's not gonna be a delay on that. And you wanna know what you get with that? Something like this. This is just an example. I break down everything to the best of my abilities with the information that my client is giving me, because you also have to do your part, right? And everything is broken down. And if you change any of these numbers, any of these. I had literally program this entire thing with formulas so that you can get the best thing that you can get, so that everything updates automatically. If one time you're like, hey, I'm getting annoyed of X, Y, and Z. Okay, let's get rid of it and scrap it. Let's go to the database that we have. I will add this in and add that in, and boom, everything updates. And I'm charging 3:50 a month, and I'm breaking everything down. Holy. Oh, my god, this is insane. At least sign up for my coaching. At least I'm not gonna rip you off. 3:50 a month, and people are telling me I should charge more",

There's no reason as to why anyone should drink. Alcohol gives you zero benefits. It messes up with your sleep, it messes up with muscle protein synthesis. So if you're tryna build muscle, kick that right out the door. Hell, you're. You're not. Not only that, but it damages like your organs bro. It's not good for your brain, is not good for nothing. If you're gonna go out to have fun and your first idea is to drink while doing it, you, my friend, have a problem because there's no benefit to drinking. People my age. I'm 24. I just turned 24. I've never once touched alcohol. It is not a good thing for you to drink because there are zero benefits to it. But oh, you can have fun with something that doesn't give you benefit, my guy. If that's the case, you can literally go ahead and do all the drugs in the world. The zero benefit that doesn't. That doesn't justify the reason why you should be going and doing it. Now, you can drink in moderation, but either way, in the times where you're drinking in moderation, there is zero benefit and is doing more harm than good. If you can't have fun without alcohol, then you have a problem and you should address it. That's it.",

Can somebody tell me or show me what it look like if I, um, hit myself in the thigh with one of those before I went for a heavy lift? Hey, uh, yeah, listen, uh, don't do that. I mean, just. Just slap yourself in the junk like other normal humans to get your heart rate jacked up. But if you do decide to inject yourself with a lovely epinephrine pen to get your heart rate going, one of three things are gonna happen. A, your heart's gonna explode and you're just gonna die in a massive attempt to get a really small PR. B, your blood pressure is gonna Jack up so high you might have a lovely brain exploding stroke. Or C, you're gonna pass out after trying to do that lovely back squat. And then you're gonna wake up to me cracking your chest open cause you're probably wouldn't a cardiac arrest. So don't be stupid. Why can't you just run through fire? Let me show you. Alright, let's start with you standing in this room that's completely on fire, mentally prepping to run through the wall of flames. Well, you'd immediately be dead because of smoke and heat rising, overtaking you immediately and dying just standing there. But let's say you did manage to survive that part. Fires clearly hot and radiates a ton of heat. So while you were running towards The wall of life resetting flames. You would most likely quickly regret your decision while receiving your second and third degree burns and inhaling a fiery hot death. And if by some Grace of god, you did manage to make it through the flames, unfortunately most of your clothing probably contain polyester and they would immediately melt on your skin and you would die. The easiest thing to do if your house is on fire is to stay low, stay away from the fire, and most importantly, not pretend you're a freaking flame resistant superhero, because you're not, and you're gonna die.",

    "voice_to_text": "So immediately after posting that video last night, I've been getting a shitload of questions asked me. Joe, I didn't know you golfed. And Joe, how in the world did you just drive that ball 320 yards over that net, damn near penetrating the Earth's crust? What is the secret? And to that I answer it's pretty simple. Number one, I played baseball from the age of 5 to 18 and Learned how to generate some serious power. No.2. I hung up the cleats right after high school after blowing out my shoulder. Then I put on 50 pounds of muscle and picked up the clubs. And also over the last month or so, I've been binge watching golf YouTube videos. But I truly believe if I never started lifting and never built myself some double D milkers and just picked up golf, I would never be able to drive the ball that far. And to build muscle, we all know your nutrition has to be in chef, specifically protein, though. It's gonna repair those muscles after your workout. I like to shoot for 1.2 grams per pound of body weight, which is kind of a lot. You only need about a gram, but that's where this bad boy comes in, is 25 grams of protein per scoop. And right now the rise load of protein is on sale for 60% off in the TikTok shop, so go copy now!"

That's awesome that your gym allows you to film your workouts, but human decency has to come into play. It's not their job to make sure that you feel comfortable filming. It's your job to make sure that the people around you are cool with being in your videos. You could clearly tell that he was not okay with being in your video, and instead of just changing the angle or letting him finish his sets and then you could have filmed whatever you wanted, you ignored him. You put them on the internet anyway, and then you mock them. You need to do better. People go to the gym because they're dealing with depression. They wanna get away with date the daily BS that they're already dealing with. Or they just wanna go to the gym and work out so they can get better. The last thing they wanna deal with is stuff like this. As a fitness community member, as a gym community member, you need to do better. A lot of things have to change. Be part of the change and not the reason why things need to change.",

    "voice_to_text": "So it's been three months since I made that video. I posted it on February 8th, and today is May 8th. Though might be the 9th for you guys  when you're seeing this Cause I'm recording this very late at like 11 pm Because I procrastinated Regardless, for me as of recording this video  it has been three months to the day. And in that time that video has gotten really popular. It's almost at a million views right now. A lot of views. A lot of comments. And there are two types of comments that I've received the most on that video. The first  is \"Why is CaseOh written on the board?\" Uh... cause it's fvcking funny! DUH! CaseOh? He's not a femboy, so why is he written as an example on the board? MAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I am a comedy genius. Also because I knew you would leave a comment about it, cause I'm also a content genius. I'm just a genius all around I don't know if you figured out by now. Anyways the second most common type of comment is \"Why is CaseOh standing in front of the board?\" A lot of fat comments. A lot of comments of people calling me fat. Uh mostly by h\u014dm\u014dph\u014dbic people who had crosses in their bios. I wonder if there's an overlap? Anyways when I record that video I was about 210 lbs. I don't know exactly because I wasn't recording measurements at the time, but I know I was about 210 pounds  when I filmed the video. In that time, as a three months later, I have just weighed in  at 166 pounds. A couple minutes ago, I just stepped on a scale, and it read 166.0 pounds. I have lost 44 pounds  in the past three months. And yeah, I don't know I just thought that was cool. I want to talk about it  because I'm proud of myself and also because I'm a raging narcissist. Uh... yeah! I don't know just want to talk about it. Obviously I still have more to go I have more progress to make. I'm still overweight I still have the fupa It's not as easy to see uh with the shirt on. I'm not gonna lift my shirt to show you the fupa, because if you're not conventionally attractive showing any amount of skin will get you a community guidelines violation because TikTok is a hell place  RUN BY HELL PEOPLE! This is turning into a yap sesh. Yeah I don't know I just want to show my progress. Also, I didn't do it because of the comments. I feel like I should mention that. I've been wanting to lose weight for a while now, obviously. It just so happened to coincide. Uh... yeah, the video was really popular video I made, around the time I started losing weight, and a lot of people were commenting on my weight. So it was a good benchmark to show  how far I have come. I don't care if people call me fat in the comments. I think you should be allowed to call people fat on the internet, and I also think you should be allowed to reply to them with due decorum, and call them a fvckwit dumb enough to receive government disability checks, and also your god is fake. Check my latest video if- and you'll figure out what I'm talking about. Anyways Yeah that's it. I've turned this into a three minute yap session. This video is dogsh\ud83d\udca9t. Goodbye.",

I need that in my fucking life, because my dieting department sucks. But let's talk about that workout they're doing specifically, because the way I do with my trainer, we do them standing, and, you know, we're essentially doing the exact same thing. I have never thought to do them seated, either straight backed or slight incline, it looked like. And she's doing them with 10 or 15 pounds with her fucking shoulders up. It looked, you know, rolled back in her in a pinned. Holy fuck. I'm impressed because I'm a little bitch and I do them standing at 7 and a half pounds. By the time I get to 15, I think I wanna throw myself off a fucking bridge. So for her to do them seated. Damn.",

    "voice_to_text": "Boys, what the fuck has happened to the fitness scene? Because it's slowly. Well, not slowly, it's quickly becoming dead. So let me give you a real explanation of what's actually happened to the fitness industry. It's simple. The fitness industry is now the fitness entertainment industry. It's not what it used to be. Now it's about if you're entertaining, how many followers you got, how much count you got. If you're gonna bring the sponsors customers. That's what it's all about. Everybody hating on all these influencers that may have mid physiques or not that good physiques. By the end of the day, they're more entertaining than you, they've got more followers than you, and quite frankly, they probably got more clout than you. So Gymshark, Myprotein, Bulk, they're gonna give them sponsors because that's gonna bring them customers. The fitness industry, I wouldn't say it's dead, but it's moved a little bit. The fitness you still alive. Look at people like Larry Wheels, C Bomb, Trentons, Shizi. They're still in the fitness industry, training hard, working on their physique and lifting iron. But the differences, maybe they don't focus primarily on their entertainment side of things. They focus mainly on their physique and how much weight they're lifting. And that's the difference between it. Yes. Okay, they make content and they focus mainly on training, but they do make a bit of content on the side, but that the content isn't their primary focus. Whereas the fitness entertainment Industry. These guys primarily focus on their content. This is why they get followers. And this is why people hate, cause they're jealous. If you want those followers, be entertaining. Get some clout, get some followers and then you'll get the sponsors. Or if you just care about your physique, train hard, get your head down and work hard. Simple as that.",

Dave Trains did not say that you're boring or your content is boring. He said that your content is attracting the wrong audience for fitness related content. This is why the fitness industry is slowly dying. This is exactly what Joe Davis said. The fitness industry is slowly dying because the content just isn't it anymore. We've got like these sort of people doing some dancing. It's you know, become like first Trap Central where we're just tryna create content just for views, not for helping people and motivating people with their fitness goals. I can't lie, I used to be so scared and calling people out on this stuff, but I don't care anymore. Fitness related content needs to be honest, uh, it needs to be raw. It needs to show, you know, how we can motivate people instead of first trapping people. Like how is that motivating in any single way other than to get 13 year old girls on, on your, on your socials and stalking you in a gym? Like, what? No one said you're boring, bro. You. You keep that between you and yourself. Like, just keep your integrity, your fitness influencer. Make more fitness related content. Cause this guy's content is decent when it's fitness related. Not when he's like dancing and shit with his. With His powers and his flat. Flat. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I'm a hater. Maybe I'm jealous, but I don't care anymore. Like, I just. I think people should be more honest and more brutal with the kind of fitness content creation, uh, side of TikTok now. And it's given the rest of us, uh, qualified personnel like PTS coaches, um, physio, whatever, rehab specialists. I don't care what bracket you fall under. It's giving us all a bad name because people associate us with that sort of content now on TikTok, and it's just not how it should be going forward. Right, that's enough of me rambling on.",

But yeah, because that's definitely the reason why, Eddie, you were feeling like shit all the time and it was your diet. Uh, don't get me started. For those who don't know, Eddie was on stage at some of the top bodybuilding shows in the world. So this brother was pinning up his banging gear on a regular basis. Probably put in his liver, his heart and everything else at risk of failing and sleep apnea and all these other things, like prime fucking side effects of steroid use. Like, I have no issue of anyone who does steroids. If you do them, it's each your own. Do what you wanna do. Just do it safely and know what you're doing and do your research. But then don't come on social media, acclaim a big following and then preach to eat the diet that you think everyone in the world should be eating, cause it's the most healthiest and safe diet out there. When in reality you came off heavy performance enhancing drug cycles. But you won't say that, so there we go.",

This is why I think it's important that everyone should know at least the basics of how to cook. Cause there's actually no need for your food to look like that. Seasonings are almost calorie free. And cooking techniques like how to actually make your egg just nice, how to make your steak nicer. There's no. There's no need for anyone to be eating like this. There's literally no need. If you want better recipes and stuff that you actually enjoy and be able to stick with to actually make it through your diet, and just follow me and I'll be dropping recipes regularly.

    "voice_to_text": "If you finish this set, I'll give you the Krabby Patty secret formula. So, yeah, outside of personal training, I'm also an actor. And as you can see, I specialize in voice acting or impressions. I stopped doing them for a little while because it really annoys me when in real life people will come up to me and jam a phone in my face and be like, hey, funny guy, say the funny thing. But then on the rare occasion that I'll do an impression, it goes down really well engagement wise. So I think I'll do a few now. And yeah, I'm gonna take some requests in the comments, but please just be respectful and don't how me to do it like people do in real life. So there's obviously the plankton voice, you know, I'll give you the Krabby Patty secret formula. You've probably seen those videos online where they take like, Plankton's lines and they put them over Dragon Ball Z footage, cause he sounds similar to Perfect Cell. So because they're in the same vocal range, it's like, I can do perfect sir as well. You just have to turn the dial a little bit, give it a bit more of an accent. And now. Fine, Goku, I'll fight your brat. And if we're gonna stay with Dragon Ball Z and the Android Saga, Android 16 is one of my favourites to do as well. you've got the more robotic stuff from the actual Series like Gohan let it go, but my favourite is obviously Team 4 stars, which is more you are way out of your league, little duck. I've come to care for this planet. It's birds, it's people, it's birds. So you can see the stuff that's more of a deeper register comes more naturally to me, but I like to go for more high pitched stuff sometimes. Like again, to stick with Dragon Ball Z, you've got Frieza, which is more ha ha ha! Hello monkeys! Your threats are as empty as your title. All hail Vegeta, Prince of no one! That one usually catches people off guard, but the one that, like, really freaks people out is my robot voice. You have selected Microsoft Sam as your computer voice. That one is really funny to drop on my clients just out of nowhere. Just be like, you have 2 sets left. Workout dot EXE has now commenced. I am not a real personal trainer. All of my content comes from Jet QDT. You can see that one's difficult to do because it requires you to inhale while you're speaking and it. It's just. Yeah, you can't do it for a long period of time. It has to be in short bursts. I'm glad I'm the only one in the gym so I can just vocally stem free of judgement. But yeah, if you've got any impressions requests, leave them in the comments.",

Um, I feel like what possibly could have been added to this topic, um, would be perceived level of effort. Um, especially. Especially understanding that we have a maximum level that we can achieve. Um, but the simple fact, I mean, we have. I mean, Calcium ions are required, um, to signal to contract a muscle. So, I mean, every time you contract a muscle, there's gonna be Calcium ions that have to, of course, accumulate, um, and they're. They're transferred from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm. All right? Um, for the most part, I mean, this is gonna. Excitation, contraction, coupling describes transportation of Calcium biops. But there's gonna be a failure of that process, which we have excitation, contraction, coupling failure, um, where we have an overload of Calcium ions in the side of plasm. So, yes, this is where we will see muscle damage. Um, some muscle damage would end up being also a fatigue mechanism. So coming back to understanding, um, the maximum level of, um, effort that we can achieve or perceived effort that we can achieve. All right. Um, fatigue is going to increase our perceived level of effort. Okay, that's one. And then also over Here we have modient recruitment that also plays a role in um, perceived level of effort. And understanding we have a maximum level that's achievable if I have numerous fatigue mechanisms or if I just simply have fatigue over here that's accumulated. Well, this is going to bring down motivator recruitment, okay, simple as that. Alright, so not really gonna get too deep into, you know, all the fatigue mechanisms and everything. I mean, for the most part, like I said, he was pretty much on track. Um, but yeah. Understanding, hey, how, well, how does fatigue hinder hypertrophy? Well, I would want to be able to maximize motor unit recruitment, but I would gain, I would also want to limit fatigue. Cause again we have this maximum level of perceived effort that's perceived effort that's achievable. Okay, um, so I can't have fatigue way up here and expect modium recruitment to. So I mean, like I said, like imagine having muscle damage, um, that will increase perceived effort levels. If I come into the gym the next day or days prior where hey, this, I mean, this is gonna increase perceived effort levels, I'm not gonna be able to live the same um, same thing with metabolic stress or if we got um, cardiovac or cardio respiratory, um, issues with incest. I mean, it's a lot of things, but again, just under simply understand fatigue. Yes, for of course hinder apertrophy. Cause, hey, that is going to increase our Um, perceived level of effort. And we of course have a maximum level that we can of course achieve.",

It is not in the place of you as a man to then start getting defensive and then start telling them why they're wrong. That's part of the fucking problem. I do agree that it has gone too far. You said that these women are being emotional and objective at the same time, but that's not coherent. That's not always the case. You could be rational, emotional, and objective at the same time in certain cases, but it's not always the case. So the hypothetical goes like this. An average man versus an average bear. And your average man wouldn't even look at you compared to your average bear. If he feels or she feels threatened by your existence, he or she might attack you compared to your average man, who wouldn't even care about your existence in the jungle or in the forest or in the mountains. But of course, women like to take things out of context. They like to assume the worst. Oh, but what about a great piste? Or what about a murderer? That's like me saying all African Americans are criminal because of the amount of crimes they commit each year. Or all mothers are abusive because of their statistics. Or all sharks are dangerous because of the amount of shark attacks that we get each year. Hey, but to each their own. I'm not gonna knock You down because of your choices. But if you wanna act dumb and act stupid, hey, then go ahead. Have fun."

    "voice_to_text": "I'm actually very surprised that foam rolling isn't more popular just on a regular basis with everyone like at home all the time because the way the body works is that foam rolling becomes a non like damaging thing you can do that will always help you out in every part of your body because the fascial lines connect all of our muscles together the fasical lines are pretty much what build the kinetic chain for us so think of it this way right here's my muscle fibers they're lined up they're interlocked right like this right let's say this is my hamstring and I'm rolling the back of my leg well when you stretch the muscle to loosen it up you pull this way you create these little micro abrasions or this little slight damaging that's what happens when you like lift weights right you damage the muscle to rebuild but as you pull a cold muscle like a rubber band it needs warmth to be able to become more elastic and more stretching which is why static stretching doesn't necessarily apply as much as dynamic stretching when you're doing something like warming up for an athletic event so with a foam roll instead of pulling my cold muscle apart this way right what I do is I roll over the lines of the muscle along the fasical lines and that tight sheet which is the fascia that's connecting around the muscle starts to loosen up and I start to roll through and break it up like I'm needing it somewhat so now I'm spacing out and loosening up the muscle this way without having to pull it apart and causing any more discomfort foam rolling doesn't feel great but it is better for you from a positional standpoint of what it does to the muscle because it doesn't cause any tears you won't foam roll too far you know what I mean but I will say seriously foam rolling quad specifically for a lot of people with knee pain sometimes the fascia is just tight somebody said that in a comment I made before about like being knee dominant or quad dominant rolling the quads all sides insides middle sides hamstrings all around the glute is the perfect way before I even like go to start movement warm UPS or anything I always foam roll first and it's something you can do at home more foam rolling"

For those who've been watching this journey with Joyce Wolves, respond back to this content creator. I'll make it straightforward and fast. She's responding to an original video that he's made, she's made a while back ago, by saying, if you don't like me recording in the gym, that's not my problem. That's your problem. If you don't like it, go home. First off, there's rules in the gym, and if you don't get the green light, or people from people or the gym stuff, then you shouldn't be recording. You should be making your own gym at the home. When you wanna record the journey that you've been making, you've been getting the support for a while. You have, but the other people are telling you, just take the feedback, take the criticism, that's it. Just walk away. But no, instead you're telling him, it's because you're black, it's because you're a woman. Nah, he records and responds to people, whether they're women, men, whatever ethnicity. You just need to learn to do better and take the feedback. That's simple and that's straightforward. That's it.",
