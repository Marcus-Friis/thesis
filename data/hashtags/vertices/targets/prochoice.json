    "voice_to_text": "My abortion was one of the greatest acts of compassion I had ever committed. In Proverbs, Chapter 12, verse 10, it says this. It says, whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast. You even care for your animals. The righteous person will even show concern for their animals. Compassion for their animals, right? Love and care and concern and provision and Protection for their animals. It says this, though. But the mercy of the wicked is cruel. And that's what you see right here with lucky is that very thing. The mercy of the wicked is cruel. It was such a compassionate act on my part. To take the life of my own child in my womb. It was the most compassionate thing I ever did. The mercy of the wicked is cruelty. And so you couldn't say it better than Solomon",

    "voice_to_text": "I don't even know how to explain what just happened in Mississippi. Take a look at this headline. A 13 year old victim is forced to give birth over confusion about the state's abortion ban. She was just 12 years old when it happened, and yet, because of Mississippi's archaic abortion laws, her mom didn't know whether she would qualify for the exemption. And even if she did qualify, it's unlikely that any physician would have performed one anyway, given the high penalties for doctors who violate the state's abortion ban. And so now, at 13 years old, this little girl in seventh grade has an eight month old child. This right here is the direct result, the direct result of what Donald Trump did to the Supreme Court."

    "voice_to_text": "That unwillingness to think about things and dig deeper honestly is the biggest reason why I have such a hard time talking to pro-life people about anything.  They look at everything emotionally,  not logically.  Nobody's going around trying to mrd3r babies. Duh.  25% of pregnancies result in miscarriage anyway.  Why is that? Do they think about that?  I would expect people who care about life to think about that deeply,  jeez! One in four.  That's a lot. And that's not talking about abortion,  that is just miscarriage.  This is when, you know, the kid doesn't make it.  Why does this happen?  Do they think about it?  Do they care about it?  Not that I've noticed.  If they did, they'd be looking at things like, \"Oh.  All of the crap that we put into the environment (all the plastics, all the pollutants,  all of this) it results in men having lower sperm counts,  it results in women being unable to get pregnant,  it results in birth defects,  it results in miscarriages.  All of this terrible pollution that we have,  that is a really big problem,  but we're just going to keep on voting for politicians who want to screw up our environment even worse.\" And I don't get that.  It's so completely inconsistent.  You either care about life or you don't, is how I see it,  right? They obviously don't care.  So (they need to) shut up about people that,  you know, can't carry a pregnancy the whole way through.  Shut up about the fact that their bodies are not,  you know, necessarily ejecting these failed pregnancies and that they need an actual medical procedure to help them out.  They just have this whole emotional thought of 'oh everybody's trying to mrd3r babies! \ud83d\ude2d' No.  That is far, far,  FAR from the truth.  But they don't see it, and they won't do anything about it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f So yeah,  I just don't get it. Never have. ",

Then he goes on to say that Isabelle, his wife, has no regrets about giving up her dream of having a career. Isabel's dream of having a career might not have come true, but if you ask her today if she has any regrets on her decision, she would laugh out loud. Now, his wife is truly happy with that decision. I absolutely support her. I think being a wife and mother are beautiful things. I think addressing women specifically and saying, this is your purpose is really unfortunate, to put it mildly. You know, she is happy and healthy. They have a great marriage, great family. Then I'm all for it. For them. I fear that may not be the case, but I. I pray that I'm wrong. Also, by the way, this is his company, MD Keller, for which he is a co founder, and the college where he gave this commencement speech. It is listed as an organization that his company fully endorses. Now, there is something he said that I actually agree with. It has to do with men being absent from their homes. But I'm sure we have different thoughts on why that is. Here's that clip. Absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other Countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the. He also spends quite a bit of time arguing for traditional Latin Masses. And I understand he's talking at a Catholic church. Seems a little odd to me. Why is he arguing so hard for this, like at a college graduation? It just seems kind of out of place. I don't know. Just like, a little odd. Last clip about cost of living is extremely important that you actually think about the places you are moving to. Who is the bishop? What kind of parishes are there? Do they offer the TLM and have priests who embrace their priestly vocation? Cost of living must not be the only arbiter of your choice. That's pretty rich coming from a multi millionaire. It doesn't have to worry about the cost of living all that much. Anyways, just wanna share some clips with y'all.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Some people will say, oh, you know, if you unplug a coma patient, that's not murder because the consciousness isn't there anymore. And I'm like, that's not the analogy.

Couldn't possibly be used against us. Because this Bill has absolutely nothing to do with supporting moms, despite the fact that they call it the Moms Act, and has everything to do with stopping people from ending their pregnancy. So what's more, this Bill itself is going to make sure people are not getting the best possible cared resources. They're only going to get those that are in line with the anti that word propaganda. The Bill specifically forbids any entity that performs, induces, refers, or councils in favor of that thing from being listed in the database. Which would, in fact, eliminate swathes of OBGYN services and health clinics across the nation. Rather, they want to collect your information and send you to places like crisis pregnancy centers. You know, like ones that will see you, give you an ultrasound, tell you everything's a okay, and it turns out you have an ectopic pregnancy and you almost on the life Yet that actually happened. Because they don't want you going to comprehensive medical clinics that can offer actual care. No, they want you going to places like crisis pregnancy centers where they don't actually have medical licenses, and they will just scare you into staying pregnant."

People have died in countries where abortion is restricted. Savita Halipanavar, a 31 year old woman living in Ireland whose baby had zero chance of surviving, died in 2,012 because she was denied an abortion due to the country's strict laws at the time. Her death received worldwide attention. That repealed the Eighth Amendment that made abortions illegal unless the pregnancy was life threatening. Then in America, states with limited access to abortion had maternal death rates that were 62% higher than states with unrestricted access. And we're still not seeing any change. But unfortunately, 40 Days of life founder and president Sean Carney didn't stop there, even though most of us wish he did. You know, my body, my choice. You can't really go streaking in most parts of our country and tell the cops, my body, my choice. We have to wear a seatbelt, you know, for crying out loud. I don't know how he went from point A to point purple, but just to summarize what my body, my choice means, since it seems to be a hard concept for some people to grasp, it means you should decide what you want to do with your body. So, yes, if you want to streak, you made the decision that will probably and rightfully land you in jail if you don't. Want to wear a seatbelt, for crying out loud? Then yes, it's your decision to possibly suffer injuries that could have been avoided. But at the end of the day, it was your choice. I hope that clears some things up. No one benefits from abortion except for bad, irresponsible men. Actually, I think the women who are experiencing medical emergencies. Or those who simply do not want children are benefiting from abortions. The only true irresponsible factors in this case are the lawmakers who pass such strict abortion bans. That place hundreds, if not thousands of burden people at risk every day."

    "voice_to_text": "I'm in Texas and so we're gonna go to an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center here we go oh my gosh we are here wait till you see this sign you can see it from all the way over there an enormous sign this says free pregnancy test that is always the red flag \ud83d\udea9 and of course it's located directly across the street from a college campus welcome to the Downtown Pregnancy Help Center in Houston Texas help I mean \u201chelp\u201d if by help you mean lying and manipulating sure sure fine\ud83d\udc4d they just say free pregnancy testing of course let's see what they offer shall we? immediately when you go on their website you see the usual our services are free and confidential an enormous red flag right up there: abortion pill reversal (I will have another video just about that) and for a refresher, these anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers they exist to talk you out of abortion but you'll never actually see that on the website. as they say here \u201cbe empowered to make your best decision\u201d actually it's the decision they want. and they say the law gives you the right to be fully informed about the decision of what you're gonna do with your pregnancy. I couldn't agree more, but what they do is not actually right. they talk about options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. this feels very legit right? this must be like a real medical clinic right? wrong. they talk about how abortion is \u201cno small matter\u201d \u201csome women deeply regret going through with their abortion\u201d when the reality actually shows that five years after most people have an abortion, 95% of them are absolutely pleased that they did and do not regret it but that's just facts they don't like \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they say they're gonna provide the usual pregnancy testing ultrasound in a non-judgemental way and remember\u2026 nowhere on their website do they say that they're motivated by religion or they want to actively get you to not have an abortion but let's talk about the website behind the website\u2026 which is this: So this is not the patient-facing website. this is the website you can find when they talk about who they really are, how to get involved in donations and very blatantly their mission \u201cempowering women to choose life\u201d they say that they have helped 6,000 clients and had 1,318 gospel presentations \ud83d\udc40 I didn't know you needed a gospel presentation when you came in for a pregnancy test. um that's so interesting and religion if that's your thing is totally fine but nowhere outside this building or on their website today at all have any sort of disclaimer that this is a Christian organization that they're gonna find like present the gospel to you when you think you're just coming in to pee on a stick. they also claim that they are committed to offering \u201caccurate information\u201d about abortion procedures and risks yet they absolutely don't. they are known to spread misinformation you saw about abortion pill reversal.  okay so one more time if you're confused: the Downtown Pregnancy Help Center aka free pregnancy testing not a real clinic and friends don't let friends go here for medical care advice counseling anything like that \ud83d\udc4f",

    "video_description": "A 25-year-old Massachusetts mother of three allegedly left her sick 3-year-old son home alone with his two older siblings so she could go out drinking on a Saturday night and sleep over at her boyfriend\u2019s house, only to return home the morning after and find the toddler dead. Worse yet, she ignored the overnight desperation texts her 8-year-old son sent about his brother, prosecutors allege. #massachusetts #25yearold #mom #3yearold #todler #died ",
    "voice_to_text": "This is such a difficult story. That three year old was already having serious health problems when he was left alone with his siblings in this Chelsea apartment building. A growing memorial outside the Spencer Street Apartments where three year old JL Guardado Prodensio was found dead Sunday morning. His mother is now charged in his death. Jennifer Perdencio emotional in court today as prosecutors alleged that she left the toddler in the care of his seven and eight year old siblings even though she knew he was sick, suffering from a seizure disorder and was vomiting blood. The defendant went out that night to a bar in Revere where she drank alcohol for a number of hours and then she slept at a friend's home, a boyfriend's home in Somerville. The prosecutor says Perdencio had taken her son for medical treatment twice in the past week but still left him overnight even as his brother sounded the alarm. At some point during the night, the eight year old brother of the alleged victim sent a text to the defendant, their mother, expressing concern for the well being of his brother, the three year old, and actually attaching a video. But the 25 year old did not return home until 10 the next morning to find her youngest son had died. Prodancio's defense attorney says his client is severely distraught over the loss of her child and is cooperating with police. Neighbors at the apartment building are stunned by the Tragedy. I remember the little boy because he was so cute. Very sad because he's only 3 years old now. Perdancio is being held on $100,000 bail. She is due back in court for a probable cause hearing on May 2nd. We are live in Chelsea tonight. I marry Slatna. WCB New Center fire."

So I don't know what that would be. If someone gets an abortion, what should be the punishment for that? And who should be punished? The doctor, the woman, or what? I don't know, but we're talking about what I believe. I don't know what the punishment should be for what you guys believe. Right? I don't know. Like, you believe abortion should be illegal, correct? I do. Right. So then what's the punishment for violating the law and not respect? You're going in a deeper thing here, though. I think people on the left get worried when they hear people say, you know, eight weeks is a life. Are women gonna be arrested? Our doctors gonna be arrested for doing abortions? On a deeper thing, though, we're not at that point. We're not at that point. Right. And in some states, we are. They have heartbeat bills. Right. Like, there's red states where we can't get abortions. Even cases. We're talking. This is a generic thing of pro life or not is what we're at right now. You're going in a deeper, deeper thing here, and I'm not at that point. If I have a child at 36 weeks, I can go and have an abortion. That's what he's saying, and I'm trying to understand, but you guys are putting. He's saying at 36 weeks. No, he's pro life. That's not what he's saying. 36 weeks, I can go and have an abortion. That's what he's saying, right? Do you agree with me on that? So do you agree with",
