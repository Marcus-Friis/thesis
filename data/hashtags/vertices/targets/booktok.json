    "voice_to_text": "Oh, it's because they didn't have a fan fiction phase. They did not have a fan fiction phase. Or even worse, they did have fan fictions that got really popular. And they assumed because they were popular as fan fictions, that means that one to one, as a published work, they would be seen and critiqued just as good. Which, if El James and I think the book is called after, are any examples. That's not true. The rules of writing fanfiction are very different than the rules of writing independent stories. But also, fanfiction is a space where you can anonymously, unless you make yourself known on other platforms or give yourself a face, you can flex your creative muscles. You can write really dark, messed up stuff. You can write really cute stuff. You can gauge people's reactions and be peered reviewed. And peer review is very important when you are going to publish something that is meant to be read by your peers. And to be able to do that in a space where you have complete anonymity, to fail and try again is so critically important to creative writing. Because, let's be honest, in a lot of English classes, you're not being graded on your creativity. You're being graded on your ability to follow a format, your technical process, and how well you're able to articulate your points. In creative writing classes, you are stifled by the amount of other students in your class as well. As your teacher, my creative writing room was incredibly stifled. We only had 12 kids. We all came from very different walks of life, and our teacher was super homophobic and limited what we could write about. I didn't really start growing and learning as a writer until I got on Fanfiction Net. I had been writing stories since I was, like, 8 years old, but when I was 15, I published my first work, and that's where I really started to progress in my writing capability. People told me things. People reminded me of things. People said, hey, if you were this, it might flow better. Editing was something I really didn't understand, and thankfully, there were people in my comments being like, hey, you spelled this wrong. That sort of feedback made me, you know, edit things. It made me rethink format. It made me rethink scenario. Through reading fanfiction, I would find authors who wrote beautifully, and I mimicked that style of writing. I took pieces of different artisans and made my own style, and I use that to write my own published books. Even with my own published books, because of this new area of peer review that I'm in, I have drastically changed my writing. From my first book, branches to my new book, Give Fangs a chance, there was a very noticeable jump in quality, not just on my writing skills, but also the art books I made for each book. A lot of The authors that are publishing these trite trophy fanfiction, feely novels are a product of never doing thorough peer review. I was writing fan fiction for 10 years before I then actually published my first book. And I can tell you in no uncertain terms, that drastically helped me.",

Okay, if you're new here, I'm going through my bookshelf one book at a time, reading the ones I haven't read yet and deciding what gets to stay and what's gotta go. I just finished the Lady Trent series. If you're interested in my thoughts on that, go to the video right before this. Next up on my shelf is shine and bright by Jessica Jung. This is a duology. If you don't know the author, Jessica was actually in the K pop group Girls Generation. I actually saw them live at one point when I lived in New York, and they were phenomenal. These books chronicle a young girl story as she, like, gets into the K pop industry and kind of, like, all the awfulness that happens in the K pop industry as you become a star. I feel like every time I read a book about K pop, it really diminishes my love of K pop, because it just seems like such a toxic environment. Maybe that's not true for every K pop company, but it certainly is in these books. And I think if you follow K pop at all, you've heard stories. Anyway, I really like these, but I do think I'm gonna unhaul them. I just. I don't think I'll ever read them again, and I think it'd be better to get them into the hands of someone who would like to read them. I will say They were both good, but also kind of traumatic. Next up on my shelf is the last words we said. I read this a while ago and I don't remember a whole lot about it, but I do know it involves Danny going missing and Ray being the only one in her community that still thinks he's alive. Deals quite a bit with mental health. And if I remember right, the story bounces back and forth in time quite a bit to like tell their story before he went missing and then after he went missing. According to my Goodreads. I thought this was alright, so I'm just gonna unhaul it so someone else can check it out. And that brings us to the next book on my shelf, which I have not read, which is leech. So I bought this a year ago because of a recommendation from thoughts on tombs when I was at Booknet Fest last year and I was told I would like this because I like the Loch Tomb series so much. And I believe this is stand alone, which is great cause I need a series break. So this is the next book I'll be reading. Have you read this? I literally know nothing about this except that the cover looks kind of scary. Oh god is this book gonna scare me? I'm kind of a wimp. How are your shelf control projects going? Have you managed to get rid of any books let Me know",

    "voice_to_text": "I am reading from your comment that you don't think I can garnish this video and I absolutely can you will be able to see my face my username my comment in the upper right left hand corner of his video that I'm about to upload showing that he is indeed speaking to me he calls into question my social justice activism he calls me a villain he compares me to someone who would have a cancer cure and withhold it from the patients he tells me if I had the information to stop millions from suffering I would withhold it he calls me a used car salesman he calls me a few other names in this video and this video is what sent his followers after me in drove I was bullied I was harassed I received comments I received mass reportings I received unaliving messages my Instagram was also indulated with the same kind of stuff I finally decided just to upload the video because you're not the first woman from his page that's come asking for proof as you can see from the last comment that I responded to apparently my word is not as good as his I will also include a screenshot of the comment Andrew left on my video explaining Sarah J Mass that he claims I didn't make he clearly acknowledged that I made the video so enjoy 6 minutes and 58 seconds of a video that basically LED to one of the worst weeks of my life on social media enjoy I've always thought this but when someone's talking about social justice saying something like it's not my job to educate you or I won't do free labour explaining it to you has got to be one of the most insane things someone can say you mean to tell me you earnestly believe that you have knowledge that could help alleviate the suffering of millions of people across the globe and all you need to do is share that knowledge and convince people of it but rather than gleefully and patiently explain it to absolutely anyone who will listen instead you are intentionally choosing to gate keep that knowledge behind this smug condescension so that you can look cool on the internet explain to me how you are the good guy in this situation imagine someone came up to you and said hey I've got the cure for cancer and you said oh can you tell me more about it and they said no if you don't already know you're an idiot like do you think that person is the good guy or the villain in this story when you tell me it's not my job to educate you I draw one of two emferences one that you don't actually know what you're talking about therefore I shouldn't listen to you at all or two that you don't actually care about the people suffering you only care about being right or more importantly being more right than the person that you are talking to you have to understand you are a salesperson and what you are selling is the most important product of our time social justice imagine someone came up to you to sell you a car and they said if everyone buys this car we can end climate change forever and you said oh can you tell me more about it and they smeared at you and told you to Google it would that make you more or less likely to buy that car oh but Andrew you don't understand I'm so exhausted from having to constantly repeat yourself yeah constantly repeating yourself is your reward for knowing more than someone else congratulations teachers may complain to each other about how they have to constantly teach the same things to their students every year but they don't complain to the students because that would be crazy oh but Andrew you don't understand some people are disingenuous they don't actually care about the issues they're just trying to exhaust me who cares if you earnestly believe that your knowledge can help people why wouldn't you want to share it with absolutely everyone even people you believed were being disingenuous oh Andrew are you telling me that people of colour have to moderate their tone when they're talking to white people yes I understand that you are frustrated at having to had moderated your tone for your entire life when you were talking to white people I get that but when you're selling the car it's not the time to vent that frustration first started posing about a court of thorns and roses some people not many but some left comments to say hey Andrew Sarah J Moss is a Zionist and by talking about these books you are indirectly harming Palestinian civilians and I said oh can you tell me more and they said no they said Google it well I don't wanna cause harm to people so I did I googled it and what I found in my initial Google search was a lot of people saying Sarah J Moss was a Zionist but not a lot of actual statements from Sarah J Moss I was expecting uh the rantings of a mad woman a JK Rowling esque heeltern what I found instead were two eight year old articles in which Sarah J Moss talks about how she had a good time on her trip to Israel as a teenager and talked about how she's proud of her heritage as a person of Jewish descent and proud of her family neither of those things seem to me to show that she was a Zionist they seemed innocuous because again no one explained the nuance to me everyone refused because people refused to explain it to me what I saw were that these people may have been well meaning but that their anger was misplaced they had been misinformed by other people on the internet and their anger would be better directed elsewhere and so when people started also talking about the post regarding Brianna Taylor I was already leery of their claims there there's a Latin phrase it's falsus and unus falsus and omnibus now if one of your claims had already been proven to not really be supported by the evidence that you've presented why should I take your other claims at face value and so when I read the post regarding Brianna Taylor I read it through the lens of someone who believed that people complaining about it were well meaning but there again their their statements about it were a little misguided made a video about it got tens of thousands of views and one person actually explained the nuance behind Sarah J Maasa's statements about Israel in a way that wasn't absolutely dripping with condescension one person nobody has explained to me why Sarah J Moss's post about Brianna Taylor is offensive now a lot of people said oh Andrew lots of people of colour are saying that it's offensive and you should just believe them no no now you being a person of colour means you have a unique perspective and it means I should listen to you and I should view you as an authority on matters of race relations but it doesn't mean I have to take everything you say at face value and fall into lock step with everything you say just because you say it you all you have to understand I grew up evangelical in the Midwest the only other time someone has said just believe me I'm an authority was when Pastor Tim was telling me I should hate gay people because the Bible tells me to now he's clearly more of an authority on the Bible than I am a man went to seminary school and vote should I just believe him because he's an authority or should I ask him for additional evidence for what he's saying the crazy thing I do believe you I am willing to just believe you because you say it but I also have 1.1 million followers if you want me to spread my message on this platform how do I convince people who aren't willing to just believe you unless you provide additional explanation I am willing to wade through reems and reems of condescension and personal attacks statements about my race and gender and a negative light to get to the information that you are actually trying to convey but I've already bought the car explain to me how someone who hasn't bought the car should be willing to do that"

It's a dark Mafia romance with a military twist and a revenge trope. It's also a fake engagement and extremely spicy. She sent me all of them. Stop. No, Julia, you did not. This is so sweet. She says that the series has a five books in total and that the fifth one is coming out in August, so you can actually go put it on pre order. You haven't gotten this? You definitely can. And if you want the paperbacks as well, you can go order all the for box. The paperbacks all match. No. This is how serious should look. That is perfection. Thank you, Juliet.

No, we're not eating mandric root. I don't care what Delicious Dungeon says. But why not? Because this shit is extremely poisonous. Okay, but, like, how poisonous can we have a little, like, super poisonous? Like, there's a reason why if you supposedly rip a mandrake fruit out of the ground, it will scream and kill you. Poisonous. Oh, okay, yeah, maybe not. Why just Delicious Dungeon use it, then? All the time? Because Delicious Dungeon is a fantasy show. Of course they're going to say they're eating mandric root. It's long been considered a magical herb, or even a beast, depending on who you ask. Okay, I guess there's a difference between reality and fiction. But why is it in your tea cabinet, then? One that wasn't a tea cabinet. That's my magical herb cabinet. Which usually has a lot of poisonous things, but, like, magic root is a lot more uses than just eating and digesting it. Literally, it said if you smoke around your house, it's for Protection. If you have a manic root in your house at all, demons can't enter it. If you put it next to sober, it grows more sober. If you put it underneath your bed with milk, you have a health spell. If you hang it over your bed, then you have A sleep spell that prevents, like, nightmares. Literally. There's so many uses of mandric root, and the only one that you can't do, funny enough, is eat it. Which is the only thing that Delicious Dungeon says to do with it. Well, okay, I guess it really is powerful. But what would happen if you did eat it? Really? Okay, I suppose if you were to eat it, you would have hallucinogenic, like, nightmare fuel that would make hell itself feel like a walk in the park. And then proceed to fall asleep into a dream, like slumber that you would never wake up from. Yeah, let's not eat that. But at least we know where the nightmares go. When you sleep with it over your bed, they just come back to unalive you later on.",

Revealed today by The Hollywood Reporter. We got revealed of a new streaming service from a company named fable. It says here that users will be able to watch AI generated series, create their own content, complete with the ability to control dialogue, characters and shot types, among other controls. This is sadly the very future on where we're headed for movies and TV shows. A future where you come home after a long day, you turn on your TV, and you tell your streaming service, I'd like a superhero movie where Batman and Superman fall in love and fight Spider Man. Make it. And right now, the streaming service is only able to do animated shows. No live action stuff. And it probably doesn't even look all that great. But this is always the least impressive. It'll look tomorrow. It's gonna get better. And two, three, five years from now, it's going to rival our regular movies and TV shows. The other part that sucks about this, the older generation like me, where this is new, we don't like this. We hate this idea. But the little kids are the babies being born right now, about to go the Four Seasons, Orlando. They're excited for this AI future and they're going to accept it. How are you guys feeling about this?"

There's something called Book Talk where all the ladies are talking about this shit. She started reading these books. Now, one of the books she like. Dude, shades of gray. Don't you remember those days? Dude, this makes 50 shades of gray look like Doctor Seuss. Dude, really? Can I give you, like, one of her books? And by the way, now she's, like, got a stack of these fucking things. One of these books. So in this book, a lady is a thief, and she steals the identity of a shark expert. She fucks him, steals his identity. So the scene I read, she's on the boat with a shark researcher, and he's fucking her, and he's, like, just fucking the shit out of her, and she loves it. And then, you know, he does. He, like, he's like, I know you fucking stole my identity. He kisses her, bites her lip. Bites her fucking lip, draws blood, takes her to the side of the boat with her bleeding mouth, shoves her head into the water while he's fucking her. So the blood starts drawing sharks to, like, bite her. While he's fucking her and like. Like, it's crazy, dude. It's like. It's the craziest porn I've ever read, man. And like, this is like a whole genre now. I've been a really into this. What? Yes. How popular is this? Very pop. They all like. They're all like, let's pull up some of these. Cut these titles. Stumbled across it. Let me text Aaron. I'll get the name of the fucking shark book. Hold on, hold on. Christ, dude. What is the genre of porn called again? I, it's. I don't. It's called. Well, she says it's something about book. What's. Let me just ask her. What's the name of the shark book? Did you one handed text? Are you one. Does it hurt? Jesus. That's the name of the book. Does it hurt? How many copies? Let's find out how many copies of does it hurt? Have been sold. Did they give out that information? They have to, right? I don't know. New York Times bestseller list. I don't know. I mean, this is in the genre of the, um. I think we've talked about it. Like the Bigfoot porn. Like, there's a whole series of Bigfoot, like, where Bigfoot is just like. Hmm. Like stealing. Like women who've been camping. Drag. Oh, yeah. Bigfoot. Foreigners come to Bigfoot. Yeah, there's a come for. Come for Bigfoot. Yeah, there's a whole group of those books."

    "voice_to_text": "May ummm May this close nearly put me into a reading slump let's get into it I read nine books in the month of may let's wrap it up so the first book I read this month was asked for Andrea by Noelle. W Ihli we are following three girls that have been \ud83d\udc80 by a serial \ud83d\udd2a  and we're watching them come together to get justice um I really did enjoy this this felt very original nothing that I've read before my only criticism would be that I wish the girls had come together sooner I had to wait until like the 70% Mark for all three of the girls to finally meet up and without going into too much detail the wife of the douchebag in this book I literally CANT with her like I cannot stand her The Family Experiment by John Marrs I have said this before I'm gonna say it now and I'm gonna keep saying it this man is the king of speculative fiction in this book we are following a plethora of couples who are on a reality TV show and they have basically raised a child or a virtual child from scratch and the prize at the end of the show is they either get to keep their virtual child or they can risk it all and basically have a real baby in the real world now obviously this is not gonna be a John Mars book without major major drama and secrets and that is exactly what he delivered if I have to give this book one criticism it would be the excessive amount of characters in this book it did take me a hot minute to be like who's who and what's your story but eventually I did get the hang of it and have an amazing time the trap by Catherine Ryan Howard in this book we are following a woman named Lucy who in the dead of night is trying to get a lift from a serial \ud83d\udd2a who she believes took her sister Nikki I mean what is there not to love the book started off so strong and then literally went nowhere and I will give this book props on the twist It was very different and unique but having to go through all that FAFF beforehand to get to that twist it just wasn't worth it for me so unfortunately this was yeah it was a major flop home is where the bodies are by Geneva Rose um I'm just gonna put out there this book was rude AF um there's no reason why I should be guessing the twist of a book within the first 20 to 25 pages okay at this point it felt like Geneva wrote the twist for us and wanted us to continue going through the pages like oh my god I wonder who did it  are you being so for real? like look at this gorgeous cover I was so excited to read this but the pages within was absolutely  meh um if you wasn't able to guess the twist\u2026  yeah  missing  Woman by Kellye Garrett so you and your boo have decided to go out on a romantic getaway and on the last day of the getaway you wake up in the morning walk down and see that there is a woman unalived in the foyer um and your man's nowhere to be seen either I beg your finest pardon that's exactly what happens to Bree in this book I really really enjoyed this I did um enjoy Bree's character I really enjoyed the social commentary on just how hard it is for us women to survive in today's society and the social media commentary as well on just how like internet sluice can mess up investigations felt very accurate what I didn't like was that the book was very slow pace some of the metaphors that were used in a book was borderline cringe for my old ass and I'm a bit unsure about how I feel about the ending but overall it was a good solid thriller the one that got away with Shmada by Trish Lundy we are following Lauren who has just started a new school and the boy that she's dating him and his brother in the town are basically known as shmurderers who got away with a \ud83d\udc80 their ex girlfriends and for some reason Lauren decides that she wants to become a sleuth and find out what really happened and okay this book was okay if you really enjoy YA thrillers this is definitely for you it definitely read like a YA book um I semi guess the twist in the book um the first 45% I was absolutely bored snooze fest um I did not care for any of their characters and the ending was so abrupt and lackluster I\u2026 yeah  The Colour Purple by Alice Walker if you have seen the movie I would still highly highly highly recommend that you read the book because I'm always a believer that the book is better than the movie from the beginning all the way to the end of this book this had me by the ropes the main character Sally will forever have my heart I just could not get enough there was so many things in this book that I could resonate with and I just can't wait to read it again so I can annotate it and I'm calling it now that I definitely feel like this is gonna be a part of my top 10 of 2024  darling girls by Sally Hepworth this is my first by this author and it's definitely not gonna be my last I really did enjoy this one um I would not say it's a thriller I probably say it's more of like a suspensful domestic like family domestic kind of book um I enjoyed the free POV from the women in this and getting a better understanding of what it's like to be fostered honestly that it this pictures had me so engrossed um the negatives and this is more of a personal issue you know how I feel about my slow burns I do not like slow burn books but I do understand why it was needed for this one and there was just portions of this book that did feel a bit scattered but overall I cannot wait to read more from this author and then finally I read you know what you did by K.T Nguyen we are following Annie Shaw who has a perfect life right up until her war refugee mum passes away and it ends up unlocking her compulsive OCD and then everything just goes from zero to 100 one of the women that she works with ends up disappearing and the police think that Annie has something to do with it and then the next minute Annie is waking up in a hotel room naked with a lifeless body next to her there was a lot going on in this book I really did enjoy it um I felt very much like claustrophobic and itchy vibes this is definitely more character driven than plot um Annie's backstory and just understanding more about how generational trauma exists was very very interesting to read but unfortunately it was just so long it was longer than it needed to be and the ending was so over the top that it just felt like it gone from literary fiction to popcorn thriller and I was just a bit confused by that but overall it was a very good solid thriller  and thank you so much to Penguin Random House for sending me a gifted copy of this book",

    "voice_to_text": "What do we actually know about Shakespeare? He was a businessman, a producer, and an actor. He evaded taxes twice. He had restraining orders taken out against him by multiple business associates. He hoarded grain during a famine and he hiked up the price of it for his neighbors and he was fine for that. He allegedly wrote 38 plays all by himself while having a full time job as an actor. Although every other playwright at the time collaborated with others, he never left the country. Although his plays are about Italy and Denmark and Egypt, and they use details that weren't available in guidebooks at the time. He didn't play an instrument, although Shakespearean plays have more than 3,000 specific references to music. He didn't attend university and maybe not even grammar school, and he's usually thought of a self taught. But he died without owning a single book to his name. He wasn't buried in Poet's Corner, although far less notable writers were. And at the time of his death, he was not lauded by any other playwrights or poets. What do we not have any record of about Shakespeare? That he actually wrote the plays. On the other hand, what do we know about Amelia Basano? She was Italian. Her family were the court musicians to Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth the first. They were recorder players for the court. She was Jewish, as was the rest of her family, and they had to hide their faith. When she was seven years old, she was given to the Countess of Kent as a ward and was given a classical and legal education. When the countess wound up getting married when Emilio was 12, she was living with her brother, Peregrin Barty, who was a baron and who happened to be the ambassador to Denmark at the time. He did do a diplomatic mission then, and either would have gone with him or would have heard all about it. At age 13, she became the mistress to the Lord Chamberlain of England. He was 56 years old. He was responsible for all theater in England at the time. Every single play crossed his desk to be censored, and he would decide what played where and what was allowed to play and what wasn't allowed to play. And absolutely, at the time, Amelia would have met all the people that were in the theater world because the Lord Chamberlain worked with him. After 10 years, this is mistress. She got pregnant and she was kicked out of his house. She was made to marry her wastral of a cousin, who wound up basically going through all of her money. So she now had a kid and a family to support, and she needed money to do it in her 40s. In 1611, she became the first published female poet in all of England, which is a huge accomplishment in her own right. But people don't just show up and Get their work published when they're 40 years old. If they haven't been writing before. Unless, of course, she was writing before, and she was doing it under someone else's name."

    "voice_to_text": "You know, for club whose barrier to entry is just having a library card and a little bit of free time, Book Talk has got to be one of the least hospitable places on the entire internet. It's the I eel waste of online communities. Now, obviously, I don't mean all of you, which is a disclaimer I have to add, since some of you have the media literacy of a smoked walnut. But I do mean a very loud, very vocal some of you. And I'm not just talking about just towards me. A couple days ago, I made a video in which I made a series of jokes about how you all read very quickly and I read very slowly. I called you all the reincarnation of Dewey Decimal. I didn't think anybody would watch that video and come to the conclusion that I actually believed you were lying about how many books you've read. It fell flat. That's fine. I make jokes on the internet almost every single day. Not all of them are going to be winners. But we can't have an enemies to lovers romance if you don't tag me in the videos you make hating on me. I wonder why you neglected to do that. I think I know. It's because you're mean people and you wanna turn book talk into the Mean Girls table of the internet. I came to this conclusion several months ago when I started to see people's reactions to The Fay Ball. Remember that? There's a bunch of people in costume having fun, and you all treated it like it was the worst thing to happen to books since the burning of the library of Alexandria. What kind of a person sees other people having fun and thinks to themselves, I hate that, and I need to tell the world exactly how much I. I hate that! Imagine if you saved that energy for actual atrocities, not imagined ones. Imagine what the world would look like. When I first started to see these videos, I thought you all were joking. I thought you were doing an amarantha impression. Turns out you're just amarantha. Add that to the long list of things that booktok hates seemingly just because they're fun. Cosplay liking a series that's become too popular. Liking a character not liking a character. Liking a character but not enough leaving thirsty comments and videos about a romanticy series. There are books about impossibly beautiful immortal Fae. They're not James Joyce fan theories. I made a video in which I theorized that Rhysand was actually the bad guy this entire time. Some people treated it like he was a real person and I was confessing to have framed him for a crime. Now look, it's not my community, you can do whatever you want with it. I just wanted book recommendations. I didn't realize I was getting them from Sauron himself. But I think if you set both the Kindle and your phone down for 15 minutes and engaged in a little self reflection. You will come to learn, as I have, that you are not Alan Galatinius. You are Matron Blackbeek, viciously bullying and putting down anyone who steps outside your arbitrary bubble of approval. Having fun is easy when you're a good person. And once other people start to learn that about you, I wonder how long you'll have a community."

I am born and bred a city boy I can appreciate nature \u2728from a distance\u2728 I don't know what I'm supposed to be wearing I don't own a pair of welly boots so will I be okay on that front second one now I'm not gonna tell you why it's because I got holiday booked that's the reason why but I am on this new diet  which is where I basically don't eat carbs and I don't eat sugar and we try and do it for two weeks and I'm 3/4 away through it and I'm somewhat successful and I don't think I'm gonna be able to maintain it whilst I\u2019m there Because I've heard of this thing called Shepherd's ice cream now I have a deep addiction to ice cream to the point I actually had to throw out the ice cream in my freezer because I couldn't live in a household with such a substance whilst trying to maintain a dedicated diet so that's my second concern and I also get food vouchers I think from the TikTok team which again like I'm gonna eat it up  and then my third concern is it sounds too good to be true like genuinely we're gonna go to a festival all about books in the town and the first book town essentially in the UK and we're gonna be there with my with fellow readers and with my book talk fellow mutuals and with authors and just sit and read all day and make content for free what's the catch?  if there isn't a catch Then I don't know I don't think I deserve it but I'm not gonna tell the people that invite me that  I am very very grateful I cannot wait It\u2019s genuinely one of the things I'm most excited about from the videos I've seen in my friends are already there it looks incredible and I will update you guys regularly on what I go up to because I think it's gonna be the most fun weekend ever"

As a college student that is nearing the end of the semester. I can't guarantee when the shmivaway will be announced, but I'll make sure to keep everybody updated on my account for when it's going to be announced. The winner will be receiving a book off of their wish list and a couple of goodies that I've picked out myself that I want to give away. So I'm think I'm gonna keep that a surprise. Maybe towards the end I'll release what else is going to be given away. Yeah. So that is what I'm gonna be doing. I hope you guys are able to participate. It's us only.

First off, if you haven't seen this YouTube video by Preston Jacobs, I think this is the most correct and zero accounting of what happened. But people have all sorts of theories, and I think they're mostly wrong. A lot of people have this idea of, oh, the any of game of Thrones actually was his real ending, and he realized everyone hated it, so now he had to, like, scrap and start over. This is dead wrong, dude. Anyone who's read the books know that David and Dan stopped adapting the books after season 4. Unless you think that all the characters that George introduced in the last two books that are book only, he just implemented for no reason, realize that the the book in the show endings cannot be the same. It's not possible. So, no, he never started over. He hasn't been riding The Winds of winter and A dream of spring at the same time. I'm sorry. The only reason he hasn't finished winds of winter is because literally, he hasn't been riding it. He finished A dance with Dragons. He had a compromise and cut out like a few hundred pages out of the end of that. But that he was gonna carry over to wins a winner. It means every Time he did an interview that few years after Dance With Dragon, saying, oh, I have a few hundred pages done on wins the winner. It's like, yeah, you always had that done. You haven't written anything new. Then, as you know, he started work on fire and blood, and then that came out in 2017. So at this point, you could argue he hadn't written anything on the winter winner. 2019, he said, the next summer, I will have it in hand. I have no idea why he thought he could do that. Obviously he didn't even get close. COVID hit. This is when we know he actually wrote. This is when he wrote the most, when he was in self isolation. No house the Dragon, no shows, no nothing but the book. After that happened, he went back with HBO, House the Dragon, all these shows, and he's busier than ever. So honestly, unless another pandemic happens, I don't know if we'll ever get win the winner."

So I thought I'd share some of the things that I do to help me keep turning out a video every single day. One thing that I do to come up with ideas is Google. I have googled bookish questions and got a massive list of questions that I can answer in my own videos and sometimes those questions inspire me to think about other things. I also maintain a Google Sheet on my phone so that when I get a sudden idea for a video, I can just add it to the spreadsheet, save it, and look at it later. Another thing that I do is I bookmark videos that I find that either have a sound I wanna use or a question that I wanna answer so that I can look back on them later when I need ideas. Overall, I just try to get inspired by what other people are doing and still make things original. What do you do when you have content creation block?",

Many dyslexics experience similar challenges during school that can echo into adulthood, often shaping their paths in unexpected ways.

    "voice_to_text": "If you're masking your dyslexia at work for fear of being treated differently by your colleagues, listen up. What I'm about to say may sound very familiar. Did you struggle with reading at school? Did the mere thought of reading allowed make your heart race with the fear of making a public mistake? Perhaps you counted paragraphs ahead, trying to practice the right one in advance, yet still found yourself stumbling. Ironically, without the pressure of an audience, you would have struggled far less. Did you dread timed tests? No matter how well you prepared, the ticking clock would send you into a panic, preventing you from performing to your true potential. And all too often, your teacher might have labeled you as careless or lazy. Do you recall understanding concepts and formulas yet still receiving poor marks? It was as if your ability to recall facts on demand simply vanished. At the worst times, it seemed like your brain would just freeze. When it came to writing, you can find yourself to simple words you could spell, even though your ideas were complex. You noticed you made far more mistakes than usual. When copying from the board and accurately transcribing dictations seem nearly impossible, you were aware that these skills did not fairly represent your true abilities. Your coping mechanisms often go unnoticed, but they are constantly in use today. We refer to this as masking. The conscious or unconscious suppression or modification of your natural behaviours, responses and Characteristics to conform to societal norms. We dyslexics do it so well that we almost don't notice it ourselves. Many of us with dyslexia share a common schooling experience that profoundly shapes our adult perspectives. The repeated trauma of being told we weren't trying hard enough despite our extra efforts has driven many of us to extremes. This includes a fierce determination to excel at work, a burning desire to succeed, or preoccupation with our shortcomings rather than our strengths. It's therefore no surprise that between 20% and 40% of successful entrepreneurs are dyslexic and 40% to sixty percent of offenders are too. Indeed, we stand at a critical dyslexic fork in the road. This isn't the whole story of dyslexia, but if these experiences resonate with you, you might be among the 17% of people globally who are dyslexic. The good news recognising your neurodiversity is the first step towards identifying your strengths, establishing boundaries and seeking the accommodations you need to thrive. Don't let dyslexia limit you. Celebrate it. Leverage your unique abilities and take control of your future. You have the intelligence, skill and strength to shape your destiny. Ready to reclaim your power? Start now by seeking support, whether through professional guidance or a community that understands. Remember, you're not alone. Follow for more insights like share or tag someone who would appreciate this message. Let's learn from each other and nurture a healthy relationship with our inner dyslexic. Your journey towards a more balance life Starts right here, right now.",

Because the amount of books that somebody else is reading in their leisure time is there business. And me personally, I don't mind other people's business. Now, you also said that speed readers can't possibly be having the same experience as non speed readers. And I just find it funny how you would want to come on my post and talk about me, because I'm somebody who reads very fast. Right? I didn't take offense to it. I'm just kidding. But we can't talk about that. But i'mma reverse it back to you and ask you and everybody else who feels like people who read fast are experiencing the book the same way. If I read Johnny had five apples yesterday in five seconds, and you read Johnny had five apples yesterday in two days, did we not both come to the same conclusion? That Johnny had five fucking apples yesterday? Yes or no? Exactly. Same fucking thing. The speed of which someone reads does not dictate the experience of the book. We are reading the exact same thing. You don't need to read slow to be able to enjoy something. And this is not a race. Who cares if somebody reads a book in a day or in fucking 10 days? That's their business. And quite frankly, I'mma hold your hand when I say this. We don't mind other people's business over here. You have a wonderful night."

Well,   can   you   tell   us   Well the voice,   voice the audiobook narrators sometimes don't make that very obvious,   audiobook   narrators   sometimes   don't   make   that   very   obvious do they? I say Shaolin. Um,   they   I   say   Shaolin   Um so, so here's the thing though.   here's   the   thing   though Let's point it out that, um,   point   it   out   that   um you, so here's,   so   here's this is my, my personal philosophies. Um,   is   my   my   personal   philosophies   Um I believe that a book is not finished until it's read, right?   believe   that   a   book   is   not   finished   until   it's   read   right Until it's read.   it's   read So I give you most of a script and you add the special effects,   I   give   you   most   of   a   script   and   you   add   the   special   effects the visuals. You're the director.   visuals   You're   the   director I'm the screenwriter, right?   the   screenwriter   right That's what I love about books.   what   I   love   about   books It's a little more participatory than a lot of other forms of media.   a   little   more   participatory   than   a   lot   of   other   forms   of   media So I say that people have line item veto to my books   I   say   that   people   have   line   item   veto   to   my   books when they read them.   they   read   them You get to decide how the characters are pronounced   get   to   decide   how   the   characters   are   pronounced in your incarnation of the book.   your   incarnation   of   the   book You can even say this character doesn't look like that.   can   even   say   this   character   doesn't   look   like   that This character never said that thing. Um,   character   never   said   that   thing   Um like basically I am handing you something that you direct in your head   I   am   handing   you   something   that   you   direct   in   your   head and it becomes yours. I say some of the character names wrong   it   becomes   yours   I   say   some   of   the   character   names   wrong according to how they would say them in world, right?   to   how   they   would   say   them   in   world   right I'm American. I say Kelsey, right?   American   I   say   Kelsey   right I'm not gonna say Kelce. It just doesn't roll off the tongue,   not   gonna   say   Kelce   It   just   doesn't   roll   off   the   tongue but that's more like how they would say his name in world.   that's   more   like   how   they   would   say   his   name   in   world And so I will point that out.   so   I   will   point   that   out The Right way is the right way that you want it to be.   Right   way   is   the   right   way   that   you   want   it   to   be I can be wrong for your version of it.   can   be   wrong   for   your   version   of   it Um, so that's,   so   that's but I do say shall on.

But I disagree with the notion that it was because his memories were not fully returned to him. Now, don't get me wrong, a fully realized Jason Grace, the son of Jupiter, the predator of New Rome, would have been next level. Peak heroes of Olympus, Peak Trials of Apollo, but it would not have necessarily fixed his character. Because for Percy Jackson, resolving his amnesia was 100% necessary, absolutely non negotiable for his character and the story. Which is why he had to remember Annabeth whether Hera let him or or not. Because he had to know he had a life before this, a life worth returning to otherwise. Fatal flaws. Loyalty. He would not have turned on the Romans. Jason, however, he never felt at home at Camp Jupiter. We know this from a young age. The time he was a child, he had duty and expectations and responsibilities thrust upon him. He needed to be free, unburdened by all of that, to properly explore and embrace camp half blood and be the bridge that Hera needed him to be.",

    "voice_to_text": "as a music teacher and someone who's been involved in the production education and audition side of children's musical theater I\u00a0have\u00a0some\u00a0opinions\u00a0about\u00a0Kim\u00a0Kardashian's\u00a0kid\u00a0performing\u00a0Simba\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0Hollywood\u00a0Bowl before I say anything else I wanna be clear I do not blame northwest this child had nothing to do with this decision and she may have been dragged through this process all the way through we all know that this is her parents fault and it is the casting director's fault Nepo babies and stunt casting is nothing new in the entertainment industry but I think as far as musical theater goes especially for children we're talking about a different animal certain things need to be held to a higher standard for a few reasons her parents and that casting director threw her to the wolves without any training at all and they knew that they knew that this child had no vocal training no stage training no musical theater training and they made the decision to put her on stage anyway as far as the casting director goes I have to say how dare they make this decision whether it was a stunt cast or not that decision affected every other singer in that performance as well you're talking about ensemble casting everyone has to be on point which is why the audition process is so important in musical theater it's not that we don't want people that already have name recognition on the stage but when you put someone on stage that doesn't know what they're doing can't keep a steady beat can't sing in tune that affects the entire ensemble I wouldn't necessarily have so much of an issue with that if this ensemble were entirely adults we're talking about something that had more than one child in the cast if you have the lead singer going up there and singing garbage it is gonna throw off every single other kid on stage we see Nepo babies less in musical theater because it takes a certain level of training to do what you need to do on stage to be successful it's really hard to skirt by because there are certain vocal qualities that you have to meet there are certain techniques that you have to use on stage that are pretty standard across the board regardless of what show you're talking about or what vocal style you use popular music it's something that you can maybe get away with because you have a unique sound or my problem with Kim Kardashian and the producers of the show is that they never gave that child a chance to get to that level I know that there were dozens of kids that auditioned to perform that number and perform Simba it's not necessarily that the right kid gets that role every single time because there's always gonna be some level of subjectivity but there has to be a level of credibility to the audition process in musical theater in order for a child to be ultimately successful in musical theater they have to start training as early as possible on stage presence dancing singing voice technique and when you throw a child into an audition and they see that the kid that didn't even audition that didn't even sing the number got the role it kills all incentive for them to ever try that process again those children leave believing that there's no point in trying anymore and I have a huge problem with that it's going to affect the kids didn't get that part it's also going to affect northwest he is going to grow up believing that she doesn't have to put in that level of work to be successful at musical theater and I feel sorry for her when she gets to be a few years older and she may decide she wants to pursue the stage on Broadway she may not have the chops for it and I don't think at that point she's gonna get the parts that she wants and she's gonna be very confused about why that's not happening for her yes they're stunt casting but stunt casting usually happens with adults even a stunt cast happens when that person is already famous for performing and being on stage whether or not they're a singer or not that kind of plays into it and it's obvious that this child has never had any stage training at all I'm pissed at her parents I'm pissed at Kim Kardashian and everyone else involved in that camp for not even taking a second thought to think that maybe that child wanted to be in music lessons maybe she wanted a vocal coach maybe she wanted to be better than that performance but they didn't take one second to think about the fact that that could even be a possibility they have all the money in the world and they don't wanna pay one red cent to hire somebody to see where their baby can go they took the shortcut that child will suffer in the end because of it she gonna suffer in life is she not gonna be able to do whatever she wants to do because she has access to money and power of course not that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that child has an elevated sense of what she's able to do on a Broadway stage and it's different than acting in film it's different in acting on TV if you're an echo baby it's different than being an adult stunt casting this kid has had every bad decision thrusted upon them to get to this point but above all I feel embarrassed for that casting director for that show because as somebody who should prioritize a good performance and the experience of the rest of their cast and those children involved they should be ashamed of themselves",

    "voice_to_text": "Medieval stasis is a rather strange trope in the fantasy genre. If you think about it, it doesn't make too much sense that a civilization would have a late medieval to Renaissance level of technology for thousands of years. You have all of these universities, and none of them have produced any meaningful technological innovations, mundane or magical, in thousands of years. Also, in that time, fashion trends have not changed. However, I think there is a way to make medieval stasis make sense in your story. A common artistic convention in medieval art and literature is anachronism. Arthurian legend is said at the end of the Western Roman Empire, yet late medieval art of Merlin or Arthur has people dressing like this, you know, like people from the late Middle Ages. In Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the Knight's Tale is about knights and chivalry, despite being set in Bronze Age Greece. And in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, the characters are described wearing doublets, which is not a garment that existed in classical Rome. And a literary conceit common in the modern fantasy genre is the found text. Stories like the Lord of the rings and the song of ice and fire are supposed to be texts from that universe translated into modern English. If you combine these two concepts, then medieval stasis makes perfect sense. The reason you can go back in time thousands of years and technology has not changed is because of unreliable narration in universe. Author does Not know what culture and technology were like thousands of years ago. So she's just describing details based on how they are in her time period, whereas in your story's real timeline, things looked a little different.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hello, I'm the Virgo Library and the book I'm currently reading is called Love Lockdown by Beth Wicklowe's. Wickles. I wanna say Wicklowe's. I might be entirely wrong, but she is the author of The Kissing Booth on Netflix. Slay. As I'm currently reading this, this story is a the first week of lockdown happening, and people are now trapped within an apartment complex. And they don't understand the parameters of what a lockdown is, what social distancing rules they have to abide by. And they're all trapped in one apartment complex for a week. Now, the premise of it, I like it. It's stunning. I'm 50 50 on this because it's a lockdown covid story, but as several romance stories, I'm not sure how those two. On what my standpoint is about using those two as like a romance story. I'm hoping it sways my mind, cause so far I'm 50 50 on whether I'm gonna like it or not. But it's like multiple different couples, couples who are just starting to get together, couples who might break up, couples who might wanna get married, a one night stand at a bridal hen party. So there's chaos in several flat layers here. Which I find interesting in it is because in this kind of storytelling about this, having several different people trapped in the same place. I mean, I lived in a house with four of my friends. If any of us discovered love, love within each other, our Friendships would be in a completely different level right now. But we're not cause everyone stayed good. But I'm. I'm not decided where I stand on this book just yet. So far, it's multiple different couples, POVs, and that type of storytelling I love call. It intertwines every single different couple if they are friends with other couples in the building or they're in different relationships. It's all. It's all quirky and it's all fun. And that part I like. It's just the lockdown vibe I'm not too familiar with. But we'll see. I still have high hopes, but, um, if I finish this, this will be my 7th book of the month. And I'm glad to get out of a reading slump. Thank you for listening.",

I'm sorry, but it has to be said, these older women who are in their 40s, 50s, even 60s, wanna be seen so bad and want attention that they are in competition with these younger girls. These women wasted their years, wasted their youth, and are doing any and everything to be seen. And they're not teaching the young girls. So instead of teaching the young girls to do better, you're trying to compete with her. You are in denial that you're getting older.

He emerged from the bathing room, sling off his tunic and shirt, and I propped myself on my elbows to watch as he paused at the edge of the bed. My attention went right to the strong, clever fingers that unfastened his pants. Tamlin let out a low snarl of approval, and I bit my bottom lip as he removed his pants along with his undergarments, revealing the proud, thick length of him. My mouth went dry, and I dragged my gaze up his muscle torso, over the pains of his chest, and then. Come here, he growled so roughly the words were barely discernible. I pushed back the blankets, revealing my already naked body, and he hissed. His features turned ravenous, while I crawled across the bed and rose up on my knees. I took his face in my hands, the golden skin framed on either side by fingers of ivory and of swirling black, and I kissed him. He held my Gaze through the kiss even as I pushed myself closer, biting back a small noise when he brushed up against my stomach. His callous hands grazed my hips, my waist, and then held me there as he lowered his head, seizing the kiss. A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me. All right, we're gonna do. We're gonna finish that later."

    "voice_to_text": "Ugh. I never D N F a book ever. Like, even if the first book sucks in a series, I push through. Kind of like an acotar, but for reference, acotar I finish in like three and a half days or less. The entire series. I've been taking over three weeks to finish the first book and throne of glass. Although a lot of you are saying you should have read Assassin's Blade first, I'm going by the order on author's website, which she says read it third. I have read like three books in one day, but this is taking me weeks. I am literally in chapter 38 and it is just now getting interesting. And I feel like if a book takes that long to get interesting, there is way too much fluff. I'm not meaning, like, fluff. Like, Bam, let's get to the spice already. Even if there's no spice, that's fine. I'm okay with that. Slow burn just irks me. Whether it's like, slow burn for, like, romance or like, slow to, like, getting to the main event of war, you know? In her case, Champion Day 38 chapters in and it's finally getting interesting. Is the second book better? Cause if every book is this slow, how is this your Roman Empire? Is. I'm just trying to push through because all of you guys keep saying this is your Roman Empire and it's better than Acotar, and I just. You guys are making me have Trust issues with this first book. Only that, but 70% of the characters are fishy as hell. Princess Nahimena. How do you say her name is fishy cow. Kale. How do you say his name? The guy that guards her, that has the hots for her. Secretly fishy. I love the main character so far. I'm not gonna even try to pronounce her name. I think it's Selena. Dorian. The prince, he seems fine. Like, fine. And I don't know, something my guts tell me, like, watch out for knocks, and king can fuck right off.",

    "voice_to_text": "Does the Epistle of Jude say Jesus is god? Hey everybody, I'm Dan Mcclellan. I'm a scholar of the Bible and religion. Fit for this video is Daredevil. And in verse 5 of the one chapter in the Epistle of Jude, the author refers to either the Lord or Jesus saving Israel out of Egypt. And there are some textual questions here about which reading is most likely original. A lot of scholars think Lord is original, but as a reference to, I don't know, the god of Israel. Some people think Lord is original, but it was a reference to Jesus, because Jesus is referred to as our Lord elsewhere in the Epistle of Jude. Some people think that Jesus was original, but that it was changed. I personally think Lord was probably original, but it is probably a reference to Jesus. However, it is not identifying Jesus as god, at least not in the Trinitarian sense. I think this author is probably referring back to the traditional identification of Jesus as the angel of the Lord, who is the one who is doing an awful lot of the saving in the story of the exodus. For instance, in Exodus 3, when Moses first encounters god, it's actually, according to verse 2 anyway, the angel of the Lord, who then says, I am the god of Israel. And in Exodus 23 we have an explanation of how the angel of the Lord can be doing all this and be Claiming to be God. God says, I'm sending an angel to guard you on the way. Don't disobey him. Don't tick him off. He will not forgive your sins, because my name is in him. So the idea there would be that the divine name represents a communicable vehicle. For divine agency, authority and presence. And so, by possessing the divine name, by having it in dwelling, the angel they can identify as god. They can do what god does. And so that angel of the Lord was identified pretty quickly in Christianity with Jesus. And so I think Judas probably saying here, Jesus, as the angel of the Lord. Was the one who was involved in bringing up the people of Israel out of Egypt.",

If you are married to one of the cast members on Bridgerton, and Shonda Rhimes goes, hey, this is your husband's season, this is your wife's season, are you getting the divorce now or later? Are you getting the divorce now or later? Because the chemistry is off the charts. Off the charts. Me personally, I'm getting the divorce because I don't believe in, um, standing in the way of God's given right to the pursuit of happiness. I don't believe in standing in the way of true love. Like, the divorce is yours if you want it. The divorce is yours. Cause personally, I'm rooting for you and I'm rooting for her. I'm rooting for y'all up first and foremost. You have never looked at me the way you looking at her. You have never been as feral as you are about this lady, about me. So why would I stand in the way of love? I'm. I'm convinced that Shonda Rhimes is a matchmaker. I'm convinced that she really create these shows as a friend because she's running a matchmaking service. I know Tony Goldwyn be thinking about Carrie Washington when he on top of his wife. There's no way he not. Because I think about them when I want to get in the moon. Shonda, can you cast me in your next season of Bridgerton? Because I need to. I need to find my Soulmate like you can cast me as the distant American cousin of Lady Dan Berry. Call me Shonda. We can make this work because I'm ready. I'm ready to hear a monologue about me that'll make my pennies drop. I'm ready to get fingered in a carriage.",

    "voice_to_text": "Convincing you to read my favorite book of 2023. Only is this my favorite book of last year. It's actually one of my favorite thrillers I've ever read, which is saying a lot because I read mostly thrillers. Thriller is set in a small town, and the main character, Katie, goes back to her small town 20 years after her sister has disappeared. While she's there, she's getting re acclimated with her hometown, her family and friends. And then another girl goes missing. This is a small town. This is obviously not something that happens very often. And they can't decide whether this is a new perpetrator or if the same maniac has been out on the loose for the last 20 years. Book is Gritty Lake by Jail Hide, which if you guys have followed me for any length of time, you know that jail hide is not only a friend, but she is my favorite author. I have fallen in love with her library of books, and the second book is better than the first. So the good news is if you want to binge a series, first book is out, the second book out is out, and the third one is coming out this summer. Her writing is funny and witty and literally candy for my brain. I read her books faster than any author I've ever experienced. I cannot explain how good her writing it. The best part of all this is, of course, the writing. Is amazing. There's so many twists and turns. Found family, which I love, short chapters which always get me. But you are supporting an indie author who is doing this all self published and on her own, and you are literally a piece of the pie. Of making her dreams come true and supporting her family. If I convince you, follow. Let me know in the comments and you have to follow. I will see you in the next. If I convince you to read it, let me know in the comments, and you have to follow. I'll see you in the next one.",

It is the fact that I am five books deep into the From Blood and ash and flesh and fire series, and JLA decided to drop the pronunciation guide on us. And I've come to the conclusion that there are two possibilities right now, and it is that either I, a 32 year old person who just likes to read, or potentially an author who has written many books and is beloved by many people, is literate. It has to be one of us, because I'm looking at this pronunciation guide and I was just like, I'm just gonna skim it, see if I got a couple wrong. I got almost all of them wrong, and I'm convinced it's not my fault. Hope you like my really nice editing. Um, but just a reminder, I'm still a millennial, and I don't know what I'm doing here. Um, let's just start with the easy one. IOS. IOS. I would be okay with either of those. Ah, us. Ah, us. Ah, us. You're telling me that's a word? That's a name. Us. US. Can't even do it. And then there's a couple normal ones, but then this one, Delano, that is like, a popular name, I feel like. Delano. Nope. JLA said it's Delano, which. That one's not too bad. Delano. That one's not terrible, but still, it's just not correct in My mind. And then here we're looking at Elawana. Elawana. Elawana. That one seems right. Nope. Elana. Elana. Way up there. Okay, and then this one infuriates me. Ione. I think it's ion. That sounds right. I, O, N. E. Has the E at the end, makes the O sound. A long O. Our girl said. No, it's ion. Did you know that there's a word that is ion that is spelled with just I O N, ion? Because that's correct. This is ion. Then we're gonna look at Kira. Kira. You know, there's a bunch of different ways to spell Kira. I grew up with a Kira. I know other Kira's. Kira. Kara. I also grew up with some Kara's. C A R A, K A R A. You know, make it a little bit fantasy. K A H R A H. Kara. Nope, that's Kira, but apparently it's Kara. And then this one is the most infuriating of all. These two. Okay, these two. Now, they're very similar names, and they do explain it in the books. I won't say it on here because it's kind of a spoiler. There's a similarity, but if you were looking at these two, you would. Malik and Malik. Malik. Malik. That's the only way that makes sense. Malik. Malik. No, Malik. Malik. In what world are these switched? This world, apparently. Okay, well, that's all I have for you today. Um, let me know if you want a part two of This. There's a ton of names in here that I clearly didn't read correctly. So. Audiobook girlies, you guys are superior. You guys know this from the start, but maybe you didn't know how to spell them, and maybe they look wrong to you. Let me know your thoughts."

So it's come to my attention that all of these biographies about me have shown up on Amazon, I think, today, which is really an exciting day for me, because I'm not just releasing one book. This is the real book, my book that I wrote. I'm releasing, like, nine books all at the same time. I'm very, very excited to read A punk feminist queen in the spotlight. That title alone just. It really says it all. It's how I introduce myself at party. So I'm really glad that AI got it right. Yes, these books are clearly AI, and I am gonna order every fucking one of them because I really am hoping that there's some weird stuff in there where it's like, like, give birth to Lana Del Rey or, like, we're cousins or I'm her aunt or something. And then, like, Lana's like, I'm just gonna vape and write a new song. And I'm like, you can do it, Lana. And she's like, I'm not gonna write right now. I'm gonna get in my car and drive 100 miles an hour. And I'm like, no, Lana, no! And I steal her keys, and I throw him in the field. And they were both crawling to get the keys. But that's find out what it's gonna be. It's gonna be like a punk starwart who rises above and sings her way out of the garbage bag of mail. So excited to read them, but please don't buy Them? Please buy the real book. And also, what is up with these pictures? These don't even look like me. Is this supposed to be like a combination of, like, me and Miranda July is a merged thing? Like, what is this even supposed to be? I love it, but again, don't buy them. Cause I'm gonna buy them all and I'll tell you all about them.",

    "voice_to_text": "I have a question for everyone. In your opinion, what is marvel's version of the Trinity? For those you that don't know, the Trinity is a concept created by DC Comics which represents three most important characters Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Not only are these the three most important characters for the publisher itself, but they're also the three most important heroes within their respected universe. They are the three characters who have consistently had a month to month comic representing them since their inception. And they represent different aspects of the DC Universe. For example, Alien Man, god, hope, justice, truth. Science based superpowers, no superpowers, magic based superpowers. So what is marvel's version of the Trinity? For me, I have two answers. First, in regards to the publisher itself, it would be Wolverine, Spider Man, and the Hulk. Arguably three the most important and popular characters that Marvel has had, as well as the universes and aspects of Marvel that they represent. Wolverine himself, as well as the X Men, Spider Man in the entirety of the Spider Verse, and The Incredible Hulk and everything that stems out of him. And these are arguably the three most successful and popular comic books from Marvel. However, within the Marvel Universe, I would give it to Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man. Similar to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, thematically they work as a Trinity. God, man, machine kind of magic based powers, super soldier, tech base. Even their Philosophies and the fact that like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, their colleagues, friends, teammates, they are seen as examples and something to look up to for the other heroes of the Marvel Universe. Similar to how Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are looked up to by other heroes in the DC Universe. So for me publishing I gave it to Wolverine, Spider Man and the Hulk. In universe I give it to Thor, Captain America and Iron Man. So I want to know from all of you, who do you think is marvel's version of the Trinity? Please comment. Stitch Duet. I wanna know!",

You can be a female in the sport and find the drivers attractive, but actually still care about the racing and F1 as a whole. But the fact that influencers are getting invited by teams that are doing the opposite of what females in the sport have been trying to push for the last couple of years is just insane to me. When you have an influencer go to an event and you have 90% of the content they post from the Grand Prix about how drivers are hot or they're only there for the drivers and not the racing, that blows my mind. Not a single piece of content I have seen from this one person has involved the car or racing or anything like that. I don't need a full depth analysis on the race from her or any of these people, but something more and not just about how they want someone that's hot or how they're only there for the hot drivers would be great. And don't get me wrong, I understand influencers are beneficial and they help reach a new target audience for Grand Prix and everything. But when your content doesn't focus on the racing or what Formula 1 actually is and only revolves around the hot F1 drivers, and you're invited by a team, that's doesn't make much sense. Also if you Get invited by a team. Please know how to spell the driver's names.",

If you recommend a different way, then maybe I should do it a different way. And then, as of right now, I'm gonna start with this one, I think. Love you. Sleep good tonight.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think we have a chance to wrap up my adventures of Twilight with one hell of a bang this coming Saturday at four PM Central Standard Time I will be watching both Breaking Dawn films back to back while raising funds for Turning Page Bookstore a BIPOC owned indie bookstore in Charleston South Carolina and Little Free Library my wife had a suggestion to make it kinda special specifically that I cosplay as Edward Cullen during the stream well I'm sorry to say that is a bit much for me so that will not be happening\u2026 unless.  This this is Taylor Vaughan Taylor is a delight she's genuinely kind person who's been wonderfully supportive of everything that I've done and to cap things off, she is a fantastic author whose novel The Stone Project was in my top five last year. Taylor just opened up pre orders for a second novel Villages Vestige and Vexes and she has a goal of 110 pre orders before the release in September she's doing quite well she's already reached 24 pre orders but I am an impatient man-child and I wanna see her blow past that goal now damn it\u2026 so here's the deal If Villages Vestige and Vexes hits 110 pre orders by Friday night at midnight, I will fully cosplay as Edward Cullen during this last stream Outfit. Hair. I will even give my oldest daughter cart blanch to use makeup and glitter to her heart's content and I will record at least one separate video in said cosplay to preserve this horrible horrible idea for all time so it's up to you if you find the idea of watching my wife and best friend howl with laughter at me sparkling my way through the down bad dance (that is a hypothetical no promises calm down Cate) all you have to do is pre order a book written by a truly fantastic author and person. Your move, Booktok. I DARE you to sparkle me up.",

Like, I literally cannot tell you the last time I watched a movie or TV show that AI finished. B wasn't reality TV, cause that's a whole other subject. Or three. Like, I walked away being like, oh, that was amazing. I lied. It was The Last of us. But that was the last time I watched a show that was so good everything else hate. Can't even do it anymore.

The effect of these books was astronomical and horrible it made parents disbelieve their own children because hey this fictional child in this fictional diary had these struggles their kid could too little did they know Beatrice Sparks was lying about the whole thing and trying to stoke their fears to sell more books if Beatrice Sparks has no haters I'm as d3ad as she is",

For hardback books, I like that they're sturdier. I like that I'm not worried about bending the cover as much or breaking the spine as easily. I dislike how much space they take up and I hate dealing with their dust jackets. The dust jackets drive me nuts. They bend super easily, they're in the way. And paperback books- I enjoy that they're more compact, they don't have dust jackets, but it's a lot easier to bend or break their spines just on accident and for the covers to get bent and scuffed up. I like to try to keep my books in fairly good condition as much as possible. It isn't always possible, but it's a lot harder for paperbacks. So, what about you? Hardback or paperback?",

    "voice_to_text": "Is this your Lamborghini? It is. And what do you do for living out in Scottsdale to be able to afford a Lamborghini? So I played in the National Football League for 3 years, lost all my money, and decided that I was gonna be a business owner. So you went broke after playing the NFL? I did. My NFL money was gone in 2,011. So how long have you been a business owner for? 2,010. Throughout your career as an entrepreneur, what's been the most amount of money that you've ever made in a single year? I'll do 20 million bucks this year. That'll be the most. 20 million dollar million. You lost everything? Tomorrow, could you make it all back? Hundred percent. That's why you see so many people lose it and build something 10 x bigger. Like, once you have the skill set and the mindset is like, you could drop me in any state in America, if I didn't know anybody, I'd make a lot of money very, very quickly. What's your most controversial opinion about life? I'm unapologetic about my desire for money. Unapologetic about was it all worth it? I mean, to live the life that I have now, I would do everything that I had to do to get here a million times over. Do you come from money? I do not come from money. My dad and my mom, the best people I know, in my opinion, is like, it would be a slap In my dad's face. It would be a slap in my grandparents face who had to fight wars for this country for me not to go out and succeed as big as I possibly could. What separates middle class from wealthy people today? Just our perspective on what's a lot of money, right? If you ask anybody that's middle class or poor, like if you had one wish, what would it be? Be like I wanna be a millionaire. Wealthy people that have a lot of money, they would all tell you that a million dollars isn't shit. Now, among yourself and the most highly successful people that you study and know, what is that one trait that they all have in common? Desire. Think and grow rich. Everybody tells you to read that book. I missed the this a couple times until probably I read it 4, 5 times. Like, you have to have a fucking burning desire or you're not gonna go through all the stuff that you have to go through to reach the Pinnacle of success.",

Sprayed edge is always the first thing to get rubbed off, to get damaged. I will actually go out of my way to get a not sprayed edge if I have the option.

It probably cost over a million dollars to bring the boat there for the weekend, but you guys are gonna be shocked who actually owns it. So this is faith. It's a 316 foot boat that rents out for $1.5 million each week. The bedrooms have panoramic views. The interior is amazing with a gym, a pool, and a sauna. But my favorite part is probably the front of the boat, which has a heli pad in a garage for your helicopter when you aren't using it. And then when you store that helicopter away, it actually turns into a basketball court too. But the business behind a yacht like this is even more fascinating. Faith is that boat right there with the dot on it. That's a prime spot in Port Hercules and Monaco, and it probably cost the owner of $100,000 to park there this week. And when you use the general rule of thumb that an owner should expect to spend around 10% of the boat's value annually on operating cost, that includes fuel, crew, salaries, maintenance, insurance, stockage fees, and everything else. He probably spent over $1 million to bring the boat to Monaco this week. So whoever."

Current Count Jason at 3 66 damn, you cussed 366 times. Half is at 2,135 2 thousand. This is ridiculous. I would be curious to know what words are being included in these swears. 2000 is just a random number. There's no way! Thank you so much, Elaine! This is incredible. I'm glad somebody was keeping count. I guess you just care more about charity than I do, Trav. The Swear Jar is officially tally through October 11th. That's 33 episodes. On a per episode basis, Travis is averaging to get this 68.87 swears. There's no way! So aggressive. What are we counting? Are we counting damn as a swear? Cause me swearing 60 times per episode, that's ridiculous. Needless to say, I think Elaine is now the official transcriber of the Kelsey swear jar. You started it, you gotta finish it. I don't know if you wanted this title, but I think as the official transcriber of the Kelsey swear jar, I think Elaine should be able to help in deciding where this charity money goes to. She should have a say in what we end up doing, right? Yes! Shout out Elaine for really putting in a ton of work. Honestly, I feel honored that what I don't always feel proud about, I can now feel proud about. So Thank you.",

This boy is 12 years old. I've been in his life all his life. Except for the times that when his mama kept him away. You know, this boy have the nerve to say he don't like me and don't wanna come to my house. And that he missed the times with his family. Speaking of his mama family and not his daddy side of family, like we don't exist, right? So he say he. This is taking up time. He said the two days that he spent over here feel like a whole week. And then he's not even looking forward to the 30 days he had to spend over here. For some, he said he don't wanna come over here at all. Like I'm a bad person. Like I've traumatized him and did anything wrong to this little boy. We have done so much stuff, so much fun things. Spend time together, play basketball together, go amusement parks, go swimming, take riding in toys like this. He had the nerve to choose his mama. Look at the camera, gay. Choose his mama over me. Like I'm around here. Treat him wrong. What kid don't wanna be around a daddy? Please tell me. And as a daddy, is hurt because I know his Mama got something to do with it too. But still, he's old enough to make his own decisions. And he chooses mama over his daddy, his flesh and blood, somebody that can teach him how to be a man. But he wanna be up on a woman all day. Look at the camera, gay. Tell people how you don't love your daddy and how you rather be with your mama and time over here is boring and you don't want to spend time with your daddy. Tell people how you don't want to spend time with your daddy. And you, he act like I. I haven't been picking him up all these years. Like what? What is the problem? Like this not your first time at my house. But yeah, he hurt my feelings, world. He really hurt my feelings. And you can't take that back, gay. I'm gonna give you what you want. And I'm erase myself out of your life. I'm give you what you want. Gay, that is so messed up on so many levels. You know, I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. My dad was in my life. I would never tell my dad because I know that were hurt my daddy's feelings. I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. Ever.",

    "voice_to_text": "my semi controversial take is that literary fiction is a genre I will try and make this as simple as possible but actually this is complicated as fuck so the generally accepted definition  of literary fiction is the absence of genre or book that doesn't fit into any other genre but has literary merit and I think that literary merit is exactly why it's a genre so let's unpack that  I consider the concept of genre through practical lens rather than an analytical one and that is as a classification for readers or booksellers or publishers or anyone to categorise a book practically speaking if it could theoretically have its own section in a bookshop I would consider it to be a genre and there I just wanna point out that general fiction is a genre and it is different from literary what sets them apart is that literary fiction has literary merit and obviously literary merit is very subjective but I argue that literary fiction is written with the intention of having literary merit while general fiction's intended purpose is predominantly to entertain but what is considered literary merit a lot of the time this will be deep insights into the human condition or how we understand society or pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve with language and I would argue that these are tropes and yes these books are intended to challenge but the way in which they challenge is often trophy there are very few things that have never been done before when I pick up a book of one of these days I'm not surprised if there's no punctuation what does make this a bit more complicated is that literary can often be blended with other genres in a way that most other genres don't do quite so much say Jonathan Strange & Mister norrell for example I call it fantasy it's got magicians it's got but it was longlisted for the Man Booker prise back when it was still called that it is officially classified with literary fiction but at the same time you can have romance fantasy you can have historical crime all genres can be combined with other genres except for general fiction which I think is the true absence of genre if you put general fiction into a historical setting it becomes historical if you put a major romance plot into a general fiction it is a romance the second somebody considers something in a general fiction about literary merit the genre shifts now I'm sure that there are many academics who would disagree with this but I think practically from a consumer standpoint it's a genre  so next time somebody is snobby about genre fiction show them this  see what they say",

The main character tries to steal an art piece, but then falls for the person he was trying to rob. It's gay. I cannot even begin to describe how good this book was. Like, it's. They even show the problems within the queer community. And you do see, like, two girls on the cover, but there are people in the background, too, so I don't think it looks very queer, but you can decide that for yourself.

What we are about to speed date so many books. And what's really nice is the first 10 episodes are free. After that, tokens are super affordable, so once we find her, the one will be able to just binge it till the end. Join us and get on Kindle Bella because it's on the Kindle app, which we all are using. All you do is click Kindle Bella and you can start browsing through all the different genres, all different books. And did I mention the first 10 episodes are free? So let's get out there.

I feel like they're fine to be friends with in social and casual settings but if you were looking for a really great supportive friend  that you can lean on these type of friends are not it",

    "voice_to_text": "There isn't a woman on planet earth that doesn't want to be LED by their man. This goes across the board 100% of the time. Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough",

I'm not a part of the cosplay world. Turns out it wasn't Keegan's mask. Everybody in the comments let me know it wasn't that person, and that's fine. Now I have people under my comments demanding that I apologize to this person. Do you realize how fucking stupid you sound? You want me to apologize for what? For asking a question. That's like me going up to my boyfriend and being like, babe, is the sky blue right now? And he's like, no, actually the sky is gray. Apologize for asking if the sky is blue.

These are super simple and quick to make, so I started off by shredding some cheddar cheese, combining that in my stand mixer with some salt and butter. Then mix mix it all until it's pretty much combined before adding in some flour and some really cold water. Once that all comes together, I into a disc and spread it on some plastic wrap before popping it in the fridge for about an hour and a half. After it's chilled I pull it back out. Usually I cut it in half so it's easier to handle for using my rolling pin to get it as thin as I can, and then slice in whatever shape I want. Usually it's tiny rectangles or squares. Place those on a Parchment line baking tray before using the end of a chopstick to put a small hole in the middle so they resemble Cheez its. After I've done that with all of them, I pop them in the oven for about 10 minutes, let them cool, and then place them in my glass jar. That's how I usually store them, but my kids had all of these in one sitting.",

    "voice_to_text": "Eloise is one of those  hauex who be riding  with Susan B Anthony.  if you are not  to date with Bridgerton. Eloise is supposed to be  this strong feminist character. This season made me realize  that she is a feminist by default. I personally don't think that  she cares too much about  the patriarchal system but more about how  it affects her specifically. Because we see that she  is enjoying every aspect  of being a rich socialite the outfits,the balls, the promenades, like that is her jam, she loves being there it's not mandatory that she go. She grew up in a family  that has no worries and she was born right  in the sweet spot where she didn't have pressure  the way that  Anthony and Daphne did  I think the real reason why  she's upset with Penelope  being Whistledown is because she's jealous. Penelope is living the life  that she has been  saying she wants. This season is making  me realize that Eloise  always saw Penelope  as an accessory. I don't even think  she can fathom  the idea of Penelope  making a match. Penelope has always  been there to make  Eloise feel better because let's be real here there's nothing that Whistledown can say that could threaten  the standing of the Bridgertons they are way too rich  and impactful and  Eloise knows that. That\u2019s why she be running  around here like a fool because she is infallible. She knows her standing  and she knows that everyone  wants to be her and you know what she likes it. I can't believe how much I like Cressida this season  because unlike Penelope Cressida is Eloises equal. Eloise is fighting for her  life to regain that dominance that she had in her former friendship and Cressida ain't having it. I'm glad because she needs  someone who she views as an equal let her know about herself. Because she's so concerned  with maintaining her own status quo she can't even realize  when other people are trying to make sure that they keep it Cressida is trying to secure  a bag for the two of them has she she trying to block her blessing it's weird. Finally I feel like Eloise  is so gung ho on making sure  that she doesn't marry that, I don't know agricultural vegan guy, because she feels like Penelope  will never have any options and I think that she's gonna  be so upset with  Penelope and Colin getting engaged not because she's  Lady Whistledown but because she doesn't  think that Penelope deserves Colin in her head Penelope  is not of the same stature  or the same make as people like Cressida and herself. Because we all know if Eloise  was Lady Whistledown, which I know she wish she was she wouldn't tell a soul, and if Penelope was out here  talking about I will tell your betrothed  if you don't you would drag that  woman through the MUD. She is swifty in that way she's gonna use feminism  against her I got this girl's number."

    "voice_to_text": "If you saw my last video, you know that I found the cutest bookstore and flower shop today, okay? And in that, I got the greatest, most exciting find, probably of not my life, but it's pretty high up there. First and foremost, I got a really cute shirt, so I'm gonna try fancy transition. Okay, ready? Is this shirt not the cutest thing ever? Okay. Book club baddie. I have not one, but two book clubs that I started. Okay? I have one here on TikTok that you can go to my linktree, and if you scroll down, it's through fable. But that's one of my book clubs that there's, like, 300 of us hanging out there, so always a plug. Go join that one. But then I also have a very small one with my just, like, really close friends, so I feel like this was a very fitting shirt to have. And just because it's a bookish shirt, I needed it. But that's not the greatest thing that I found. I found an indie copy of Things We Never Got Over, like Miss Lucy score. If you open this up and you see the publishing right there, it's. That's what she said. Publishing. This is not Bloom. This is an indie copy. And I just happened to stumble upon this today. Am I over the moon? Yes. Did I love this book? Yes. Was it one of those books that just, like, got me and hooked me? Into small town romance? Yes. Is it my favorite of the series? Also, yes. So the fact now that I have the traditionally published and the indie version of this makes my whole life. And if anyone wants to know the difference really fast, I will show you. So this one is, like, glossy. This one is matte. This is the traditionally published. This is the indie published. The spines are different. This one is obviously through Bloom. And then the backs are also different. And again, this is the indie, and this is the traditionally published, and they're about the same length. But for research purposes, I feel like this is just a perfect time for me to go back and reread things we never got over. And now I can compare them side by side with the indie and the traditional one and see if Miss Lucy score, you know, made any big changes. If they're basically the same now that I have both. So between this and this and just the vibes of this place, I think I found one of my new favorite bookstores. So a PSA if you are close to the Tulsa area, this is in Broken Arrow. It's in Main Street. So it's just, again, right outside of Tulsa. Broken Arrow, Main Street. And this is the cutest flower shop ever. Again, it is books and blooms. It is so cute. Vibes are immaculate. And if you love romance especially, they have a huge romance Selection. And you may stumble upon fun books like this. Indie copies, fun good things. Maybe even a few signed copies. Who knows? They do fun author events, too. I'm so happy that I stumbled upon this place today because I. I couldn't ask for something better on a Saturday."

We'll see how it goes. I've never seen it. Okay, there's more like this, I realized. Oh, the fake dating trope. Love that kind of genius. Listen, I'm digging the tea, but I'm getting a little fucking bored. I think I'm three episodes in. I don't know. I'll update, but I'm kind of bored. Think they're supposed to be tension, but I don't feel it right now. My husband agrees. They just walked away from each other. That's it. Oh, my god. Okay. Oh, someone's jealous. Poor guy has problems. And trauma, obviously. Oh, now it's my son. Fucking Jesus. The fuck is going on? What happened? Oh, my god. Okay, what? What? Something was up. For the first time, if you don't know, then you probably shouldn't be watching the show. And I said what I said. But what she gonna do now? You do. I hope it was not true. How could I? How could I? Oh, my god. She crossed the boundary. But so did he. I don't know whose side I'm on. You took my future for me. The one thing I wanted more than anything. You knew. You knew that becoming a mother one day, to have a family of my own one day. You knew that was all I ever wanted. I Was prepared to die on that dueling field rather than marry you and take your dream away. I would have died for you. He was the one who insisted on this. Do you know why I even felt pity? You most certainly do not. Give you not know the meaning of the word. You do not lie to the one you love. You do not trick the one you love. Oh, my god. I figured it out. Bridgerton is like old school Gossip Girl. That's what it is. I don't care. I knew it was her. Oh, shit. Pop off. Okay. Hell, yeah. That in season 1. I'm gonna watch season 2. I'm not fully convinced yet. Season 2 better be pretty badass. That's all I'm gonna say.",

    "voice_to_text": "Read a novel. How similar is the first draft to the last draft? What a good question. How similar is the first draft to the last draft? They tend to be very similar, except for all the important things. Writing a novel, for me, tends to be almost like the process of throwing Mudder to wall and seeing what shapes it make, and then going, you know, that really looks like a face over there, and throwing some more MUD. And then the second draft is the process of going in and making it look like you knew what you were doing the whole time. I tend. When I originally started writing novels, I would. I would write my novels on the computer, and I never really felt I had any difference between drafts. I just had a first draft that got better and often got bigger. So part of the fun for me now is I go out when I start a new novel, and I buy some fountain pens and I buy some big old notebooks. I write novels by hand. And this means two important things. 1. Nobody can send me email while I'm writing or pop up messages, and I cannot suddenly decide to look up a word while I'm writing. And. And find myself four hours later in the middle of some eBay auction. The Google search LED me to. If I'm sitting there, you know, I, I, it's me in a notebook. I'm just Gonna have to go and look it up in a dictionary. And there's the fact that once I finished it, I then get to sit down and start typing. And I know the shape of the thing, and I know how it ended. And I can decide what to throw out. And I can look at it. And then that draft is what goes to my editor. In the case of A Nancy boys, I wrote maybe an additional four scenes after it came back from my editor. Most mostly because there were characters she really liked. That she didn't feel got enough for one of a better word screen time. So, um, I wrote some more scenes about them. Maeve Livingston got three extra scenes cause my editor liked her.",

What I'm excited about is that we aged the characters up a little bit. You know, I started writing this book over 10 years ago when I was in my early 30s, and it hits harder and closer to home with them aged up. So I'm just really glad that you guys did that. I know there was a little bit of criticism about that, but I was personally so. Really? We changed the name of the restaurant. It was bibs in the book, and it's root in the movie. It worked better with the script, but also bibs worked in the book. But it's kind of funny sounding. Spend so much time between the book and the script. Yeah. That you forget the line between the two. Yeah. You know, I had a list of scenes and quotes that I were hoping would be in there, and they're all in there. I think that they nailed it.

Noella Void, who was crowned Miss USA in 2023 on Monday, announced that she would be resigning her title in order to protect her mental health. She posted this announcement on social media, but eaglelied internet sluice noticed something strange. It appears to be an acrostic with the first letter of every sentence spelling out the secret message I am silence. That is, until the final three sentences, which begin with the letters H, I, and P. Fans are still speculating on what those final letters could mean, with some suggestand initials. Only two days after Void's resignation, Uma Sophia Servastia, who was named Miss Teen USA in November 2023, handed in her crown as well. In a statement, Servastia, 17, said she was resigning because, quote, my personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization. She did not elaborate further. The dual resignations triggered a wave of still growing intrigue on social media. Some guess Voit may have created the secret message because she is under a non disclosure agreement and is not permitted to speak publicly. Others say this is all just a coincidence. Do you think the beauty pageants were trying to send a message? Let us know in the comments."

Trust me, it was massive. But outside of the bookish community, I guarantee you could go up to someone on the street and they wouldn't know what Fourth Wing was. Right, but then you think back to Twilight, you think back to Hunger Games, you think back to 50 shades of grey. Everyone knew what those books were even before the movie adaptations. Obviously the movie adaptations just skyrocketed it into another level, but we haven't seen anything like that for a while. Not that I can think of at least. I'm just thinking of all the really popular books from the past couple years. Even something like lessons in chemistry, which is like, everyone knows. If you're not a reader, I don't think you would know what it was like. Nothing is on the level of Twilight. Everyone knew what Twilight was. Everyone knew what everyone was reading 50 shades of grey, even if you weren't a reader. My nan was reading it and she normally reads Danielle Steele, so something was off. I'm also holding a coffee because I thought I'd look pretentious. I don't know. Is there a reason for it, do you think? Is there like, cause social media, you see so many books anyway that not one gets really popular? I don't know. I literally think About it all the time. And I annoy people with this question. I just brought it to my mum and we're actually having a nice discussion about it. Do you think we'll ever get a giant book that will just break everywhere? Let's talk, let's talk."

You turn the page to the next thing you have to read, and the bookmark marks the spot where you are going to read next time. Is that up for debate? The people in the comments were saying that they finish what they're gonna read, and then the bookmark goes in the book, and then the next time they open the book, they turn the page and start reading.

Or better yet, motorcycles better learn to watch out for me. Cause I'm gonna start speed bumps, I'm gonna start hitting them and I'm just gonna keep going. Try using your directional once in a while.

So, boom, you just opened up audible, you found the book that you wanna read, but the price of the book is a little bit steeper than you planned on paying. What you're gonna do is exit out of audible, open Kindle, search for the book on Kindle, and add it to your Kindle library. Um, and then go back to audible and watch how crazy the price drop is. And I brought receipts. This is the price when I first opened the audible app. And this is the price after I added the book to my Kindle library. Okay, we went from 30% off to 77% off. Happy reading"

It's definitely a grower and not a shower. So now let's get it ready. You're gonna Wanna remove its gonads, it's reproductive organs, cause we only need the shaft. Simply fillet like you would any other fish and then toss this away or use it as bait. Now, I only wanna use the neck for this recipe. So I chopped it off. And the mouth was freaking me out, so I cut that away, made perfect little slices about a half an inch thick. Perfect for my recipe. And now it's time to plate them up. I threw down some sushi sauce and a nice little swirl. And then I gently laid them down. On top of that, to each one, I added a little scoop of sweet fish roux and a little bit of sprouts for color and flavor. And look how beautiful this is. Would you try it?"

Currently I'm in the middle of nine books. I have the day off today because one thing I always do is I take the day off after a trip to recuperate, get my life together. It's currently 6:00am because I'm still in Scottish time, so let's see how many I can knock out throughout the course of the day. It is 8:00am and I have finished book one, Thistlefoot, and let me tell you, it was excellent. This beautiful story of siblings who inherit this house with legs that interweaves a lot of Russian Jewish folklore into it. Very Neil Gaiman ask. Little long, but a Beautiful Story. Would highly recommend. Okay, it's 11:15 and I finished book two. Ended up finishing The Ex Evangelicals Book two. I had about 50 pages left for a month or so. It's just a read that's hard to process. I wouldn't recommend it for everybody, but if you grew up evangelical, have laughed, have questions, it's a good read. Now I'm gonna go over to my favorite bookstore book club in the East Village and finish martyr. Okay, it's 12:45 and I just finished book 3. Ah, I made a separate video that I posted yesterday about it because I had to process this. This book is beautiful. Watch That video. To hear more about it, please read it. It is 3:30 and I have finished book number four. It's a decent three star thriller romance. I was reading it for a book club. At book club in the East Village. And actually, I didn't finish it in time for the book club, but I finished it just now. Only had like 100 ish pages left. It was fine. You're looking for something, turn your brain off and don't think. Read this. Okay, it's 9:45 and I finished book 5 on the subway. I went to work out and have dinner with a friend. This one was O Caledonia. I picked this up in Scotland. Of a set in the Scottish Highlands. It claims it's the best least known novel of the 20th century. I'm not sure that we read the same book. And with that, I'm gonna call it a day. I finished five books in one day. I think that's a win total. I better read around 500 ish pages, which I've done that before. And my rankings for the day would be number one, martyr, and number two, Thistlefoot. Would recommend those just about to anybody. The ex evangelicals and when stars collide, if you're looking for that thing, read them. And oh, Caledonia. I don't know that I would recommend it at all. What's the most you finished in a day?",

When I asked for your help in finding a husband, I did not realise that also meant you might try to deny me one as well. It is my business because I care about you. You cannot marry that man. He will leave you. And he is too particular. And he is. He is just not right for you. Ben. He did not propose. In fact, he rejected me because of you. Because the scene you caused let him to believe you had feelings for me. An idea so preposterous I do not know what to do besides laugh. Now, will you please let us ride home in silence and leave me alone? I cannot. Please. I cannot. Because what if I did have feelings for you? What? I have spent so long trying to feel less, trying to be the kind of man society expects me to be. And for a moment I thought I had succeeded. But these past few weeks have been full of confounding feelings. Feelings like a total inability to stop thinking about you. About that kiss. Feelings like dreaming of you when I'm asleep. And, in fact, preferring sleep because that is where I might find You. A feeling that is like torture, but one which I cannot, will not, do not want to give up. Please don't say things you do not mean. I do mean it. It is everything I have wanted to say to you for weeks. Call me our friends. Yes, baby. Forgive me. Um. I do not know what I was thinking. I'd very much like to be more than friends. So much more."

A lot of times y'all overlook with black men, say about y'all that's good for white men that say mediocre shit about you. The simple fact that all y'all black women are around this bitch parade and celebrating because a black, a white man said that black women are for grown UPS. When there's literally black men out here that are single, that are craving, that are thirsting for black women to treat them right, to create families, to unify with them. And y'all over appreciate the mediocre shit that comes from other cultures, but when black men do the same shit now is bare minimum. Don't you understand that that's a problem? Like, that's a really big fucking problem. The fact that a black man has to cross off 25 things on your list, but a white man can get on the news and say that black women are for grown UPS, and he can get some cooch, he can have your babies. Like, I don't understand, bro. I don't understand the logic. And then y'all always try to make it seem like black man just so against black women is not the case. Bro, just look at the case in point. Y'all make us go through hoops and loops for y'all, and y'all let these other motherfuckers walk scot free straight into the building. Like, I Don't get it, bro. That shit stupid.",

I'm going to use as coded of language as I can in this video because every time I previously try to make a video on the subject matter, it's either gotten flagged for a view or taken down, or just completely suppressed by the algorithm. I do not support isn't real. I don't believe isn't real is a real place. I believe it's an American colony made up by the United States of America so they can kill brown people and steal their land under the guise of it technically being a different country, but it's actually just the United States and sheep's clothing. Because that's all the United States of America has ever done since its inception is kill brown people and steal their land. I do not support isn't real in any fathomable way, shape, or form beyond its capacity to crumble. I am very pro watermelon people, and I have been ever since I first Learned about what this conflict even was. Back when I was in high school, I used to run a Taylor Swift Stan account on Twitter and one of my mutuals named nayama ended up going to prison for several months because she refused to join the IDF. She said she did not want to murder children. I repeat, it is illegal to not want to murder children and Isn't real. So if you're defending it, that's what you're defending. In conclusion, fuck isn't real. Fuck The United States of America's government. Fuck Amy. And if you get down with genocide, fuck you, too. You're a disgusting, vile, reprehensible human being, and I hope you die and rot in hell, you piece of shit! Harm yourself.",

    "voice_to_text": "Here's some books that I will never read. I do wanna say that this is not me hating on these books. I'm just not interested in reading them. But I also like to say, never say never. But I just can't see myself picking these books up and reading them. I might give them a chance, but it's gonna take a lot of convincing for me to read these books. Okay, first on the list is Zodiac Academy. This series is very popular. There's just so many things that's keeping me from picking it up. First of all, there's just so many books, and a lot of people say it doesn't get better till like book five or something, or book four, I don't know. And some people say, doesn't get better at all. So a lot of people say the writing sucks, the characters are boring. But the thing that really steers me away from it is that it's a bully romance. You know, I don't really care for it.  Like, I don't hate it. Like, I could probably read it. I'm just not super hyped. Like, I don't go out of my way to, like, look for Bully Romance, you know what I mean? but next book is gonna be Creedence. Um, I think this book is also very controversial. They either really like this book or they hate it. You know what I mean? Like, i\u2019m just also not very into uncles and brothers, so do not keep It in the family. Keep it away. Keep it over there. Okay, next book I actually have a copy of, and it's gonna be ice breaker. I also have wildfire. Now, you may be asking, why the fuck do you have the books then? Look at the covers. I picked these up not knowing what it's about. Do not judge me, I'm just not very interested in reading a book with little to no plot but spice so. I like spies in books, but not too much, you know what I mean? I like it, but I also like tension. I like build up. I like character development, all that jazz. Just can't read a book when they're together already in chapter two. I almost don't want them to do anything till, like, the end of the book. I just love me a slow burn type of romance, so I haven't really seen anyone talk about wildfire, so that one's a maybe. Okay, the next book is gonna be Ice Planet Barbarians. I almost feel like it doesn't need an explanation. Alien romance? It's not that crazy. But you know what? I have thought about reading it just because I'm curious \ud83d\ude1d I'm a little bit curious, but I will not be going out of my way to read it, you know what I mean? Like, I might listen to the audiobook, maybe. It just sounds very interesting, doesn't it? Also, there's so many books in the series about alien romance. Like what? What's that about? Alright, this next book slash series do not come for me. But it's the summer i turned pretty series. I know, I know. I love jenny han I read to all the boys I loved before in high school and I loved it. before the movies came out. I read the book first. The book was better anyways. Reason I don't wanna read the summer i turned pretty  is because feel like I wouldn't really enjoy it as much. On top of that, the books came out a million years ago and there's a show, so everyone's already spoiled it for me. And i\u2019m just not very interested in reading a book when I know what's gonna happen, so I'd rather watch the show. I also wanna mention A Million Kisses in your lifetime. The title alone just gives me the ick. I don't know why. I also feel like I'm just not gonna like it. On top of that, I've also heard mixed reviews about it, so. But yeah, those are the books that I'll probably never read. But who knows, maybe. But probably not.\n",

    "voice_to_text": "Booktok Hot takes there's a possibility that this will flop, but that's okay because I'm just happy to be here. Starting off on a possibly controversial note. Just because a book is considered a classic doesn't mean it's a good book. Today and let me explain. Moving on. No. 2 book talk is not the issue when it comes to drama. People are a community of people who like to read. Books as a whole are not at fault for the sexualization of others. The individuals who are leaving comments and making video sexualizing others are. Most of us on Book Talk are just minding our business and reading about immortal fairies, dragons, and mama tails so that we can try to forget the fact that we can't afford to buy a house and will probably never be able to retire. No.3 this isn't even a hot take because I think we all collectively agree that stickers on books, especially the fake ones, should be illegal. If anyone knows who the person was who suggested to publishers that they perform such a hate crime, please let me know because I like to pay them a visit. No. 4 romance books are just as valid as high fantasy, SCI fi, etcetera. This one is really just directed at the toxic fantasy bros who think if you don't spend your time reading 20+ book series, you weren't actually a reader. To them, I say, uh, shut the fuck up. As we All know I'm not a romance, but that doesn't mean I won't fight for their rights. Going off of that, romance books are also for men. Debut books should not get special treatment when it comes to reviews. And this one I do actually want to explain. Regardless if it's the first book an author has put out or the 30th, if there are areas that a reader believes needed improvement, they are allowed to express that, because at the end of the day, they spent their money on it. And when you purchase something, there's an expectation when it comes to quality that's attached to that. Also, I'm sure that there are other people like myself, who are usually unaware when it comes to what is and isn't a debut. For example, one dark window. I had no fucking clue that that was a debut. Was I impressed when I was informed that it was? Yeah, but did it change my review of the book? No. Someone who is currently writing a book, the last thing I want is for people to go easy on me because it's a debut. If I write something and there are areas that need to be worked on, I want to know so that I can improve for the next one. And lastly, and probably most importantly, because we really need to discuss this, uh, Cassian's anatomy is alarmingly large and would kill somebody. If I were Nesta, I would be fascinated for A good 13 seconds, and then I'd scream and run for the fucking hills. Listen, I love a challenge, but that one, that. That's not it. There are limits, these sort of things. And he passed it so long ago. I mean, he's going 80 in a 25 mile per hour zone. And while speeding can be fun, sometimes at a certain point you're just being insane and begging to crash. Or at least asking for a speeding ticket, which nobody wants."

I was promised a private suite, but thanks for asking. Please, everyone, take your seats. In today's Oz, a real sorcerer who possesses true magic has become all too rare. Absolutely remarkable. That was. You made all that happen. How did you do it? I don't know. I've never known. You come with me. Of course not. You. You. You're the one the wizard has been waiting for. Glinda. You. I know. It's my granny's. I'd give it away, but I don't hate anyone that much. Hey, you should join us tonight. And don't tell me you have nothing to wear, because you could wear this. She doesn't give a twink when anyone thinks something is not the same. Of course she does. She just pretends not to. The wonderful Wizard of Oz summons you to the Emerald City. Come with me. What? To meet the wizard. Why? Couldn't possibly. This is your moment. I'm come. I am a monster greater than terrible. Something bad is happening in us. The best way to bring folks together is to give them a real good. You have no real power. That's why I need you. Don't let Her! Get away this wicked witch! Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. It's the wizard who should be afraid of me."

    "voice_to_text": "hey bookish friends Rachal the writer here with another author chat today we're talking about the recap chapter this is that chapter that a lot of authors include kind of at the beginning of their book uh that is it's in a series right so in the second or third book where they just kind of do this recap through the character's perspective of what happened in the previous book um but they do it in a way where it's like the character's remembering what happened and reference it a lot and I wanna know your thoughts about that cause I'm personally not a huge fan of the full recap chapter and and I'm of two minds of this the first is that I typically if I have the series of books then I have just read I've just read the book prior to that and I don't need the recap um and in the case of books where you're waiting for the release of the next book when that next book comes out I typically reread the book before it or the books before it before I read that one so it's fresh in my mind I don't find a recap chapter helpful in that case because I'm not gonna remember because I read so much stuff in fact I recently read a reread a series and I remembered so much from like the first three books but by the time I got to the end of the series that I have read three times I didn't remember anything from that last book don't know why cause I've read all of those books at least three times but for my brain a recap chapter just really doesn't do it for me um it's kind of the same thing where like if I'm given the option on a streaming service to skip the recap of previously on whatever show I was watching I will skip it because I was just watching it my dude I know what happened um so for me like it doesn't make sense to have a full like beginning of the book kind of dedicated to recapping what happened in the previous book I do think it is helpful to provide some sort of like transition between the two books so some time has passed um and allowing the characters to reflect on it bits and pieces but reflecting on the entirety of the whole previous book feels unnecessary but if you can do it in a way where it's just like you know the character kind of like oh after I finished this I did this you know um or it had been like three weeks since we got back from all that ridiculousness like that works because it's like ah you know and that also will help somebody who's picking up the book not realizing it's the next book in the series I mean like oh there's something that happened before this I need to go find that book um so that's my thought on recap chapters I don't like them I I sprinkle the recap of my story like for the second book that's coming up in the Bound Prophecy series I promise it's coming haha got a little sidetracked with this book and uh another book I'm writing but anyway uh I am kind of sprinkling bits and pieces to kind of transition into the next storyline but I'm not dedicating the whole beginning chapter to like so we did this and we did that and we did that and now we're here um and that's just my take on it I'm not like bashing anybody who chooses to do that I'm just saying for me personally I'm not a fan of the recap chapter but let's chat about it in the comments below tell me what you think let's have a nice little conversation discourse about it and yeah happy writing and we'll see you later"

But I've read all the books, and here's what I need from the show. One. I need the ending from the book to not be the ending in the show. Spoiler alert. But in the book, Penelope is outed as lady whistle down in front of the entire time and ultimately just gives up. Lady Whistle Down, Lady Whistle Down dies, and she helps Colin instead publish his travel novels. And he was insecure the whole time about Lady Whistle Down. Like, the thing he was most insecure, the thing that he hated the most about Lady Whistle Down was that she was a better writer than him. I'm not even kidding you. So from the end of season 3, I need that to not be the ending. Thank you. What else do I need? At the beginning of Benedict's book. Benedict's book is a Cinderella retelling, right? It's Insta love. He sees Sophie as is immediately smitten. I need him to see Sophie at the end of this, um, season. I know he's like. He's off on his adventures. I'm very happy for him. I need him to see Sophie and fall in love. I need that moment, okay? And I would love it if it was somehow connected to the woman that he's currently, like, messing around with. Wouldn't That be hilarious. Now, here's another spoiler. I need a. Just a. A peek. Just a peek at Michael. So if you don't know, here's another spoiler for you. Francesca marries John Sterling and they're together for a while before John dies. And Francesca then falls in love with. In her story, when he was wicked, she falls in love with his cousin Michael. I just need a peek at Michael. I just need. I just need him to see Francesca. I just. You know what I mean? Because there's this longing and yearning in Francesca's story, which is my favorite, by the way, that just needs to exist. So I need. I need a glimpse at Michael, please. And then obviously, I just need Colin and Penelope just, like, get it on. But here's what I do think is going to happen with Colin and Penelope now that they've like, he's like. Anyway, spoiler alert, he proposed. I think he's soon going to find out she's lady whistle down. And that's gonna be the foil that, like, drives the episodes moving forward. Cause he's not gonna. He's gonna be so pissed, it's gonna like, affect. They're either they're going to be married or, like, their process of getting married. Oh, it's gonna be so good. 10 out of 10. Those first four episodes were 10 out of ten."

Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me.

People online are calling the speech demeaning to working women and also say it is mysogynstic.  A\u00a0petition\u00a0was even started to have him removed from the\u00a0Super Bowl\u00a0champion's roster, which has now reached over 100,000 signatures.  He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend. And, also in the speech he criticised Pride month, a particularly important time for the\u00a0LGBTQ+ rights movement. #lifeandstyle #HarrisonButker #TaylorSwift #NFL #KansasCityChiefs #Chiefs #Butker"

I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Early in 1965, the British composer Donald Swan decided to set some of the poems from the Lord of the rings to music, wrote to Tolkien's publishers about his idea, and he soon met the professor at his daughter Priscilla Tolkien's house, since she was the only one who had a piano there. They sat around the piano and Swan played some of the music for Tolkien. First song he played was called The Road Goes Ever On, which in the books was written by Bilbo in his first song by him. At the end of The Hobbit, when Bilbo returns to the shire and sees his home again for the first time, he sings it again in the Lord of the rings, and Frodo sings some verses from it too. And in the film we hear Gandalf sing some of the verses. So Swans music and talking verses were collected into this book. The Road Goes ever wrong, probably the most beautifully produced Tolkien book from his own lifetime, with Tolkien providing the necessary Tangwa scripts and Swan the music.",

So, as any book girly would do, I put all of the books that I wanted in my cart because I was prepared for this shit. Tell me why all of the books that I had in there are marked down for the exact same price that they were originally. All Amazon did was Mark up the original price to some bullshit, and then they marked it back down to the original price, and they thought we wouldn't notice. But you see, that's where they fucked up, because I'm in my Amazon cart every single day. The reason I'm so salty is because I could have got all these books for Mother's Day, but I told my husband to wait because Amazon was gonna have a huge sale. What? Fucking sell, Amazon? Like they really thought they could just pull a fast one on us, you guys? Like, what the fuck? So myself and my wallet will disrespectfully not be participating in this bullshit scam of a sale that Amazon tried to pull on us, because fuck you, Amazon! Fuck you, Amazon! Fuck you, Amazon!

Stan Ross. No. 9. Stan Ross. Okay, let's hit the Costner train. Okay, so we're gonna go Billy Chapel first. Give me Billy Chapel first. Billy Chapels No. 10. See, I'm scared about this list, Dog.

I need you to take a step. Alright? Give me. Give me Jake Taylor. He's number six. I had a feeling right here. I want to go check Steadman. Do it. I feel. It feels crazy to have angels in the outfield. Not on here. Like his Mel Clarke of 5. I think Chet is better than him. Chet Steadman? No. It's hard to fuck. What About the scout. Dude, the fucking Brendan Fraser move. Steve Nebraska. Oh, yeah. Fuck, he plays for the Yankees. Shit, I think it's him. What about, like, trouble with the curve? I think that she. Go.

I love being his wife. I am just not an NFL wife. That shouldn't be what my entire life succumbs to. I choose to follow my husband to whatever state football brings him to. I'm packing the bags, I'm calling the move. I'm not calling movers. I have social anxiety, but I am willing to go wherever he's going. I am a cleat chaser in that aspect, and I've been chasing his cleats the past 10 years now. Along the way, I have made it a priority to make sure that I'm following my own dreams as well. My life didn't start when I married my husband. It started when I was born. And I've been working my ass off every second since I was in kindergarten trying to whip up my career.

Being a Marine Corps veteran, super easy to spot what makes the grass grow? They don't know the answer to that fucking question, they're a fucking liar. And if someone claims that they were a Navy SEAL, I have watched enough Don Shipley to know what questions to ask them. People saying that they were a Navy SEAL or a Marine are the two most common Stolen Valor claims I hear. I had an older fat white dude come in one day and claim that he was the Navy SEAL that killed Ben Laden. Now a simple Google search will tell you that's not fucking true. He also told me that he didn't know what a drager was, so he wasn't a Navy SEAL ever to begin with. Another prime example is I had a gentleman come in and tell me that he was the lead general for the Marine Corps back in the early eighties. He didn't say comment on, he said lead general. And once again, a simple Google search told me that that was not true. What's the craziest stolen valor story that you've heard? Leave it in the comments and don't forget to follow!",

    "voice_to_text": "I am an absolutely feral book reader, which means I read 37 books in April and I'm gonna rapid fire tell you which ones I think are worth reading or not. Did I love it? Would I recommend it? Yes or no? Let's go first up. I read the whole Shatter me series. I love this, dystopian young adult. I know the reading style is quite poetic so it's not for everyone, but these are just so good. I love them. The Caraval series. I read this so I could read once upon a Broken Heart first because this is the prequel series. I'd say it was like a 3.75 series. I did really enjoy it. It just wasn't like my favourite read ever. But very magical and very enchanting. Very fun to read. Then of course, once upon a Broken Heart. Four and a 1/2 Star series. This is so good. Worth it. I would recommend reading Caraval first. It just made it so much more enjoyable. I did read the third one, but on Kindle cause paperback version is not out yet. Speaking of Kindle, I read the entire Zodiac Academy and some of the novellas. I just love this series so much. 5 star series! Individual books, ratings vary. But like overall 5 stars. 5 fucking stars. If you want a big fantasy adult series that has some spice in it, read the Zodiac Academy. I know it's a bully romance, It's intense. It's not for everyone. If you want a happily ever after fantasy, You know, princess whimsical happy vibes. Yeah, don't read the Zodiac Academy. If you like intense, morally grey men. Maybe even just - they're so far past morally grey to be honest, but a whole magical world where Fae are ruthless. Read The Zodiac Academy, another one of my favourite series ever. Lightlark and nightbane, both 5 stars. Please read these. The last 80 pages of both of these books are absolutely unhinged in the best way possible. One of my favorites. 5 stars. The Shepherd King duology. My first Gothic Fantasy reads. This one was four and a 1/2 stars. This one was 5 stars. 5 stars together. So fun. Such a unique magic system. If you like fantasy books, read these. This is great. What lies beyond the veil and what hunts inside the shadows Two stars. I (personally) would not read again. Did not finish the series. The Red Queen. I feel like it's an iconic fantasy book. Like everyone has read this. A 3.75. I really enjoyed the book. I read it in one sitting. It's just not my favourite ever. The story has sort of been done so many different ways in fantasy books. The concept isn't anything that I've not read before, but I still very much enjoyed it. I read The Crowns of Nyaxia on Kindle because it's on Kindle Unlimited. I would say 3.5 stars. I like the first one, didn't really enjoy the second one. Kinda lost me there. I LOVE the author's Writing style, so I'm still gonna read her other books. Characters for this just didn't do it for me. I think I was expecting more from how hyped it was, but the novella In between the two. Six scorched Roses, 4.5 stars my favourite novella I have ever read. I love this so much. These characters were so much more interesting and I think it's worth reading like book one to be able to just read the novella. You can read the novella alone, but the novella, honestly. Mmm. So good. Powerful novella. I honestly did not think that I was going to enjoy this as much as I did, but Lauren Roberts has just me in a chokehold. Like her writing style, the way she writes. I'm just so drawn in. Wondering if powerless was maybe gonna be like a one off, but after reading this I was like, no, I know what it is. She just knows how to write exactly what I want. And then finally I read the first book in the bargainer series. Love the premise of this. They really had me in like the first 2/3, but like the ending I just wasn't really a fan of so it brought it down for me. Made me not want to continue reading. I probably will go back and read it. There were a few things with the books and the characters that weren't my favourites. Yeah, I don't know. It wouldn\u2019t be on my top List of recommendations, but I wouldn't advise against reading it. I think I need to read more of the series to give a fair judgement. That's every book that I read in April. Again. Absolutely unhinged, I know.\n",

Um, number one, epilogues that are not at least a year or more in time. Listen, epilogue can literally make or break your book in my personal opinion. I don't give a fuck about what happened three days later. No, when I get to the epilogue, I need to see damn near five years later. Seven years later. Give me some time. So we're a whole bunch of shit didn't happen. I need to see marriage, kids, divorce, somebody that went to jail, somebody is dead. I don't. Something three days later. Hell, I know what y'all doing. Y'all still in the living room where I left y'all on the last page of the book? Yeah. I don't give a fuck about your epilogue if it's not at least a year in time after that last page in the book. Romance novels with too many damn tropes. And I solely blame TikTok for this because I feel like authors now really have an insight to readers minds. And we sit and talk about our favorite tropes every fucking day on here. And they have taken that shit too hard. Cause what the fuck is a second chance? Enemies of lovers, instant love, fake dating, bully romance. I know you was confused writing this, so how the fuck you think I Feel reading it. Exactly. Stop doing that shit. And the last one. Detailed descriptions of the main characters, house. Or any characters, honestly. Um, I don't give a fuck about what their dressers look like, and 9 times out of 10, y'all gonna give us a clean cream. And bright. You just fucking described it. Insane asylum. Is she crazy?

Which I feel like is honestly a very stupid question cause it's very easy to understand why people don't like the self inserts in Velma as opposed to Regular Show and smiling friends. First off, in Smiling Friends and Regular Show all the characters are original characters, so even if they are just the creators, it comes off as more authentic because it's a new character. And like, Regular Show is a show about two slackers, and JG Quintel has probably been a slacker once in his life and just said why not put myself in the show? It'll make it way easier to write. Whereas with Mindy Kaling she just took a character that already existed and just made it her. And I think most people would have been cool with the new interpretation of Velma. But if you're just gonna take a character and make it you, why did it even have to be Velma in the first place? Like why not just make it Mindy Killings mysteries or something at that point? Also, I don't wanna see anyone complaining about this show on my feed ever again. Cause y'all say y'all hate this show, but this show is always in the top 10 so somebody must Be watching it later.",

    "voice_to_text": "anti Zionist Jewish author Sim Kern here and I'm so excited to see how many influencers have started adopting families from Gaza to help Erin Hattamer on TikTok particularly is doing great work pairing up larger influencers with families in need but I'm also seeing creators with followings 10 times larger than mine struggling to raise a fraction of what we raised over here which is over $100,000 for three different families over the last two and a half weeks so if it's not too presumptuous I think I can help and whether you have a hundred followers or a million I think these tips are gonna help you maximize your fundraising the first mistake I'm seeing is making stand alone fundraising content it just doesn't do well people are overwhelmed by the scale of the suffering and when they see from the first second of a video that you've got a sad face on and you're using a sad voice and you're in front of a gofundme donation page they're just not they're gonna swipe on by because they're overwhelmed I'm looking at pass the hat creators pages and I'm seeing the numbers of their regular content doing 10 times the numbers of their fundraising content give your best content to the people of Gaza by sticking a little fundraising ask to the end of your normal content whatever you do best funny skits fashion beauty blogging political analysis make the your best content you can and stick the fundraising ask at the end that brings me to the second mistake which is making the fundraising ask too long it is so much more effective to keep it short and again stick it on daily make it just a part of every single content that you make rather than having one long video where you're telling like the whole saga of this family it's not needed you are an influencer your followers are going to donate to this family because it's important to you they trust you that you've chosen a good cause just highlight one or two details about the family that connect with you that made you feel a personal connection to them and put that out there but stick it to the end of every single video and keep that fundraising ask part a minute or less if possible the third mistake creators are making is you're not doing a giveaway giveaways are so effective I made a whole video on the evolutionary psychology that underpins my fundraising approach but if that's  too long; didn't watch  just in a nutshell our brains are hard wired to love a giveaway to love a little bit of gambling offer to reward your followers with the donation by giving away one item I'm giving away one signed author copy of my book a week that's it if I were to be donating my profits from this book I only make a buck or two off each book that I sell depending on the format so I would have to sell tens of thousands of copies of books to raise the amount of money I've raised every week from giving away one book per week and don't overthink it you don't have to offer lots of stuff again just one book do you have merch offer one piece of your merch in a giveaway like something connected to whatever your channel is that little incentive might be the thing that pushes people over the edge to giving more and with a giveaway rather than selling something to generate profit you encourage people to donate as much as they are able I put a low minimum six bucks to enter right but most people donate more around 10 20 dollars and then there's some people who will donate 500 or 1 thousand dollars it's not hard to manage I set up a separate email account for it I have people send me screenshots of their donation receipts and once a week I use a random number generator to pick the winner then I get my butt down to the post office and send them off their gift one reason I think people are hesitant to do this is it seems like self promotion and maybe it is a little bit but it's very effective cause your followers want what you have to offer there's a ton of followers I follow where I'd love to get their merch but I'm not gonna just buy it for myself cause I'm on a budget but if I can donate to a good cause feel good about myself and maybe win something  somehow that's like so much more fun and I'm so much more likely to do it and finally and most importantly it is our job to keep hope alive this doesn't mean we can't be real and authentic about our emotions two days ago I made a video sobbing my eyes out about what's happening in Rafa but we have to keep heart and we have to keep going and lead the way as influencers when Okcar Schindler risked his life to save 1,300 Jews from the not sees he had no guarantees that they were going to be able to get out there were over 26,000 Europeans who sheltered Jews during the Holocaust of the 1940s and they didn't have any guarantee that the people living in their attic or basement that they were feeding daily that they were risking their lives and their families lives by sheltering they had no guarantee that the not see regime would ever fall they had no guarantee these people would ever be able to get out and we influencers are not having to risk our lives to help people of Gaza we're just having to make content consistently for them in the wrecked cyberpunk dystopia of this holocaust the pathway out of genus side involves tricking TikTok algorithms and making engaging content starting fake arguments in the comments of fundraiser videos so that we can generate more traction and we can do this I believe in us we can keep hope alive no matter what the it\u2019s really arm y does no matter what horrors come in the coming days and months we are not gonna stop trying to help these families speaking of which I'm helping these sweet kiddos this week and if you learned something useful from this video or appreciated it I'm asking you to donate to their fundraiser and you can enter to win a signed copy hardcover copy of my book Baby Heba here is just five days younger than my baby which makes me feel incredibly connected to her and her dad has been handwriting over 1,000 thank you notes individualized to everyone who's donated to this fundraiser that is not an automated response to help them and enter this week's giveaway go to the first link in my bio donate at least $6 but as much as you are able and send a screenshot of your receipt to T4Gaza at Gmail dot com and to every creator out there who is trying to fundraise for these families in Gaza whether you're able to raise tens of thousand or tens of dollars you are amazing you are my mishpocha  I love you"

We both understand. Pierce, buddy, I will defend you. Don't you worry. If I ever talk to Pierce Brown one day and he's going, listen, Dune is better. Pierce, you don't even understand your books.

You should be proud of all that you have achieved to this point in your young lives.

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world. But I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Holemaker. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. The gentlemen here today, part of what plagues our society is this lie that has been told to you that men are not necessary in the home or in our communities. As Men, we set the tone of the culture, and when that is absent, disorder, dysfunction and chaos set in. This absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the US, and a correlation could be made in their drastically lower violence rates as well. Be unapologetic in your masculinity, fighting against the cultural emasculation of men. Do hard things. Never settle for what is easy. You might have a talent that you don't necessarily enjoy, but if it glorifies god, maybe you should lean into that over something that you might think suits you better. I speak from experience as an introvert who now finds myself as an amateur public speaker and an entrepreneur. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity, and inclusion. I'm certain the reporters at the AP could not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places in people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him right here in a little town in Kansas."

There's a couple lines of dialogue in the book that my editor said to just get rid of cause it doesn't sound like anything anyone would ever say but those are actually the only lines that were taken from actual conversations that I've had in real life so they stayed And lastly I knew while I was writing this what my next story was going to be and I thought about putting a little Easter egg in there um if you don't know the story that I'm working on now is about a child who goes to a sleepover and disappears in the middle of the night but I was going to have Seth who's your main point of view character watching the news and one thing that they report on is a child who went missing in a nearby town in the end I decided that I didn't want to open myself up to plotholes and fact checking type stuff right off the bed as I'm just trying to get a few stories out there so I got rid of it yeah that is five things you might not have known about my novel Shrapnel and Avalanches stitch this and tell me some cool stuff about your book.",

That those degrees ain't shit, and they need to just wife up and push babies out. This man is a professional football player. He can afford to have his wife stay at home and not work. Going to a college class and telling them that, really, it was diabolical what was done to you. You've been bamboozled. You shouldn't have gotten this degree. Like, does the college and understand that if you're telling people they shouldn't enroll and they should just wife up, that they're all lose money. And the reason we are seeing birth rates decline is because most people can't afford to fucking live, let alone live on one income. Because most people aren't married to professional football players."

    "voice_to_text": "these are the books that I read as a child that radicalised me or if not radicalised me then at least definitely shaped my political worldview um and shaped my beliefs as an adult this video idea came to me in a dream um but I figured it would be a fun thing to do and also to discuss how books are political no matter what the book even children's books are political most of these are probably not gonna be surprising but I wanted to talk about them anyway perhaps the least shocking title on this list we have The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins I read this book when I was 12 I wanna say um maybe 13 and the I think it's pretty self explanatory as to how it can shape political views the concept of children participating in a death game is not a new concept uh most famously and perhaps first I'm not sure it was done in Battle Royale which is a Japanese movie but something that Suzanne Collins I think did here is one brought it to the western world cause a lot of people in the west um were not exposed to Battle Royale but also there is an element of celebrity and glamour to it that um I think these those other death games are kind of lacking the fact that Katniss and Peeta and all the other tributes are considered as celebrities and are given this opulence and wealth when they are being put into a death game is really like cognitive dissonance and I know that Suzanne Collins said that she was inspired to write the book after flicking between um like celebrity gossip footage and footage of um people dying in the Iraq war so I think this one's pretty self explanatory next another non shocker I think I have the Percy Jackson series I'm also including the heroes of Olympus series when I talk about this but the Percy Jackson series really is about a young kid fighting up against oppression against the status quo and how that status quo does not work for anyone [except the elites] um and how he wants to change it and adapt and benefit everyone I remember reading uh the fifth book I think when I was like 10 or 11 or whenever it came out and I remember thinking to myself oh my God I wish I could be a hero like this I wish I could fight and I remember thinking okay I guess the closest thing would be um joining the army and that sounded less fun to me than and less uh enticing than the just cause I wonder I wonder why that is I think I read holes for the first time in third grade I definitely saw the movie around that time definite as well and it taught me about um false imprisonments and the injustices of the correctional system you know this is a forced labour camp that should be illegal and yet it is it's legal in this world and in our world as well it also you know has whole discussions about race inequality with uh the kissing Kate Barlow backstory just brought a lot of themes to my consciousness in elementary school that I was not aware of um and every time I think back about it I'm like yeah damn that book was metal as fuck for a children's book I don't think this one's technically a children's novel but I did read it as a kid and that is Batman oh it's shiny Batman a death in the family this is the famous Batman comic where um everyone could vote on whether or not like people in the public in the 80s could vote on whether or not Jason Todd was going to live or die and they chose for him to die this is probably one of the first times I ever saw a main character die in media that I was consuming but also what's so fascinating about Jason Todd's story is the fact that all of the adults in his life consistently failed him um and so the death in the family and then the subsequent Red Hood saga where Jason comes back and he's a vigilante was very interesting to me and it you know taught me to kind of take everything adults told me with a grain of salt and to maybe think critically about it and then last one as much as I really do dislike admitting this um because it is the year 2024 and I do not think we should be promoting this book whatsoever but I did read it as a child and I do think that the H*rry P*tter series did um lead to a lot of my political ideas especially since the general plot of it is that uh it is someone uprising over a dictatorship it has now radicalized me in a different way because JK R*wling went so far off the fucking deep end in her TERF rhetoric that now I'm radically here to defend trans people and to condemn her so I guess it still radicalized me in another way um but I would be lying if I did not talk about its impact on me as a child and how the idea of um a dictatorship military being overthrown by school age kids was very interesting to me I think it's important to remember that pretty much everything we consume is political even if you don't think it is and that's why I wanna talk about these books that are predominantly for children again the Batman comic I think actually it was technically for adults and I was just reading it uh but these are things that are primarily for children and they have such strong political themes and they still shaped who I am twenty five years later and I think it's very interesting and and relevant to talk about and I would love to know what books you read as a kid that also radicalized you and shaped your political ideologies",

Make them interesting and different, but still relatable and icable. Every piece of classic literature hi, it's me, the bland every man whose only purpose is to tell you this story. I have no action personality. Here's the story of the time I encountered the worst people I ever met in my life. But first 10 pages of description about the place in which I met them. Modern writing advice yes, your protagonist should have flaws, but ultimately we should root for them and like them from the beginning. Charles Dickens here is the worst, ugliest, rudest, meanest, nastiest bitch you've ever met in your life. Modern writing advice make sure your POV character goes through a significant arc. Make sure they are changed by the narrative. Make sure they learn a lesson. Narrators of every book of the 19th century the lesson I Learned is these people fucking suck. Sayonara, you freaks! Modern writing advice it's all about the character overcoming obstacles and learning. They learn their lesson so they can fix their mistakes and make good choices in the future. It's a character art. It's called growth. Readers love it. Everyone from ancient times through the 19th century. Would you like to watch a guy fuck up 20 times in a row?",

What about him? I bet he has some games that he plays, even where he scans the crowd looking for people. I bet he makes up, like, entire background stories for the people he sees in the crowd. And then what happens when, like, he spots, like, the girl he used to love, but, like, they tragically had to split up because she went away to college or something? Or, like, what happens when he sees this really cute girl in the crowd and he's like, oh, my goodness. But then he sees this guy walking to a scene. This guy sits down beside her, and they start talking. He's like, oh, my god, she's got a boyfriend. And then it turns out that guy Was, like, just her brother or something.

    "voice_to_text": "If you know literally anybody that lives anywhere across the entire East Coast, you might wanna watch this video, because experts are now warning that there's a giant invasive spider that's coming. Scientists are now warning that there's a giant invasive juro spider with 6 foot webs that could be poised to take over US cities. So fun. Thank you. If you don't know what a Zorro spider is, they're basically a species of orb weaving spiders, which is a group known for creating highly symmetrical circular webs. Cute. Also saying that your host spiders can build unique webs that could be more than 6 feet long and appear golden when they reflect sunlight. Okay, just to make this a little bit better for you, whenever the eggs hatch in spring, the baby spiders create parachute like webs that enable them to fly up to 100 miles away from where they were born. Doro spiders are actually supposed to be in Asia, but they were recently found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Then by the way, experts are believing that these invasive individuals were accidentally brought to the US inside a shipping container. So as of right now, these spiders have been spotted in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. And they've also been spotted in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. So good luck. I give you these news roundups every day, so make sure you add me and come back to me tomorrow.",

Our children cannot read! Our children cannot read, let alone writing a paragraph, let alone comprehension. They cannot read. They do not know how to sound words out. They were not taught that. And if you're wondering, well, then why do my. Why does my kids just keep getting passed on to the next grade? Because that's what they're doing now. They're not holding the children back. They're moving them on. They're graduating them. Knowing that your child is illiterate, our next change makers, our next law makers, our next voters cannot read. I beg of you, take the tablets and the cell phones away. Practice letter recognition and sounds and reading with your child, please. And i'mma keep it a stack with you. They've been new. They've been new to babies. Couldn't read and didn't care. You know, when they started caring, after the pandemic, them test scores plummeted. First of all, like, test scores for reading were, like, pretty stagnant for the last, like, decade. But after the pandemic, they plummeted, and now they were, oh, we gotta do something about it. Columbia University, I'm looking at you. You fully backed balanced reading. Fully backed it. Teachers College was 100% pushing out balanced reading. That's why the kids don't know how to sound things out. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, please go do some research. Now they're trying to push science of reading. That's the way. And if you're like, what? Science of reading? That's what we was doing. And by we, I'm talking about millennials and older. The one. The little, ah, book, eh? You know, when we were sounding words out, that's. Yeah. Now they're trying to bring that back. And if you're like, wait, they stopped doing that? Yes, for years they stopped doing it. I'mma say this last thing and i'mma be done. If you have the opportunity and the privilege, right, because like, taking off from work is a privilege, you need to start. And by you, I'm talking to parents and guardians. Start going to these PTSA meetings and these district meetings. They are passing so many policies and they're banging on the fact that parents and families are not going to show up. You need to know what them, what those policies are and how they're affecting your children, particularly black and brown children. They know families can't or won't show up. You need to be more involved with your students schooling. Their life quite literally depends on it. Alright, I'm done.",

    "voice_to_text": "Current discussion of the 4B movement has me thinking a lot about how we center men in fiction. To that end, I wanna talk about sexual violence against women in second world fantasy. Usually when I see sexual violence used against women in these contexts, it serves one or two purposes, sometimes both at the same time. The first is to clue the reader in that the man who perpetrated that assault or that attempted assault is bad. It's a moral event horizon. Once a character crosses that moral event horizon, they're irredeemably evil. Or, and related. It gives the good guys, so the good male character, an opportunity to rescue the woman from sexual violence. These are extremely common tropes. I see them all the time. Quite literally, they use sexual violence against women as a way to characterize men, positively or negatively. This centers men in what are often women stories in which sometimes the sole or primary point of view character is a woman. Which is an interesting choice. Do we think perhaps if we realize that we are using sexual violence in order to characterize a male character or set up a plot event for that male character, perhaps we could reach for something else, some other trope that does not rely on the victimization of a woman? Just food for thought."

But why? Why are all our colleges across the country all investing all their money in Israeli assets? And it's not just a little bit, it's a lot. It's a total of half a trillion dollars. Half a trillion with the T. And many of these big schools, like these Ivy League schools, they have tens of billions of dollars invested. Look at the chart above. Why are all our school policies, in all our schools money, all invested in one single foreign country? I mean, how much detailed power do they have over this?

And I just think, oh, I get to the end of my chapter here. Bookmark goes in. Next one, right? We start in the next chapter, but if the next chapter, so like this finishes, my bookmark goes there. Close, but goes down after. Do whatever I'm doing. I pick a book up and I think, oh, yeah, finish that chapter now. I will turn The page and start my book. Apparently people don't do this. I will turn the page and put their bookmark in. This is blowing my mind. What do you do? Do you put your bookmark in where you stopped reading? Or do you put your book bookmark in where you intend to pick up your reading when you open the book again? Because I cannot get my head around this, and it's blowing my mind.",

And a lot of you probably already know this, but I'm just going to share anyway, background info. I remember when I was looking up how much money that the United States sends to Israel every year, a list came up that showed, like, every country that we send money to, and Egypt was, like, really high on the list. And I was wondering, like, why do we send so much money to Egypt? And I never really looked further into it, but look at this. So this section is just talking about the treaty that was signed between Israel and Egypt that President Carter helped with. And then this paragraph here. For Egypt, one of the benefits of the treaty was a warmer relation with the United States. To a degree, at least. The United States bought the peace treaty by promising both Israel and Egypt enormous aid packages. By September, US aid totaled 4.3 billion. Cashing in on his new friendship with the United States, he submitted several military shopping lists that called for expenditures of many billions of dollars. And on the page before this, um, it says, Carter was praised by both Middle Eastern leaders, but particularly by President Sadat. I think that's how you say his name. Um, who is the Egyptian president who said that without the American president's efforts, There would have been no treaty. So whenever you're looking at the total amount of money that we have ever sent to Israel, make sure you add in some of Egypt's as well, because, I mean.",

Every time I rented an apartment, upwards of 100 Congress members actually sleep in their office cause it's expensive. Washington's expensive. All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this. Do you want it to still be the house of the people, or do you want it to be only wealthy people? I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments. I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment. I think it should at least keep up with inflation. It.

And this goes beyond simply just thinking you're pretty. Like, loving yourself is more than just thinking, oh, I'm cute and my body is tea. Of course you should find yourself attractive. That's amazing. It's so much deeper than that. Loving yourself is about how you show up for yourself every single day. It's about how you advocate for yourself in uncomfortable situations. It's about the type of people you choose to date. It's about the type of friends you keep. It's about the habits you have. It's about what you choose to tolerate in your life. It's about how you let other people treat you. Finding yourself attractive is only a very small portion of loving yourself. That's why there's so many people who are beautiful, but they hate themselves. Because it's more than just thinking that you're pretty. I really want women specifically to experience what it's like to love yourself beyond your physical appearance, because it's going to change the quality of your life.",

I'm not saying that this doesn't take a huge toll on your mental health, but what I am saying is it takes 2 fucking seconds to repost a video and I'm only seeing the same mutuals. Like a select small group of us reposting, commenting, liking and sharing like out of the whole book talk community. It's more than a little concerning that the book talk community will rally about like under a fucking bikers book talk video sooner than they will talk or repost of it. Rafa about what's going on on the ground right now in Rafa. I'm not saying you have to post videos talking about it. I don't think I'm the most educated person on the topic. I don't think I'm the voice that you need to listen to on this topic. So I've been uplifting all their voices. I've been reposting like crazy, commenting, liking, sharing as much as I can. Whenever I'm on TikTok, I do not scroll from one of those videos. I watch it all the way through so that they get the view count. It's not a lot. It's not a lot to ask of you while you sit in the comfort of your home while you're not being bombed. Take the energy that you guys put into the wrong things very, very often and put it behind Something that matters",

By park author, and, you know, you don't really do that, why in the fuck would you go find the most blackediest black book to read? Is slavery in there? All type of oppression and shit going on in that book, and then you take your happy ass good reads and give it a one star talking about it's not relatable. Well, shit, Sarah, what the fuck did you think? I don't like that. And I'm using this as an example, because giving one star reviews to BIPOC authors because their books aren't relatable is mind blowing to me. You not liking a book is totally okay, but you saying it's not relatable, what the fuck did you think? But what gets me is, is when y'all say, oh, well, I just. I just can't relate to it, like, the way that they're talking in the book. You ain't got a problem saying period poo every fucking day. So what's the problem? Make it make sense.",

That's the best we ever seen here. Go. Look at the entrance. Yeah, the entrance wasn't caused at all, but we gotta keep an eye on it. It's sucking over so much to breathe. This would actually be a dangerous one to get down in front of. So we're gonna let that settle down for a minute, make a big whirlpool at the other side. Hey, look at that whirlpool. Not gonna last long. But look at the debris it's dragging over in the drainage ditch. Just give it a few minutes, and it's gonna stop lasting like that. Water's already completely off the road. Wow. You're not. At least look at this. I'm gonna catch it with my hand. That's awesome. You're never shutting that one off. It looks like it's already starting to settle down a little bit. I think it's safe. We can go to the other side and inspect where it's going in. Yeah, that's already settling down. That was the best unclogging ever at the Thirsty Tree. So you gotta understand, from the end of the pipe, All the way over to the start, that water is pushing against it. That was being held there probably with hundreds of pounds of force, maybe even more. Couldn't even budget, but look at what we did downstream. Look at that. It's flooding as far as the eye can see. Awesome. Let's try to do some improvement at the start. Yeah. No longer dangerous at the beginning. The suction has been broken. There's nothing. There's nothing. Even here at the beginning. There's a lot of leaves coming into your nest, but absolutely nothing to burn pipe. There's just so many leaves. When there's this much pressure going on."

So hard box stack a lot nicer on the shelf, they don't fall over, they're obviously much more rigid and don't get damaged as easy. Paper box. I find they'll. They'll fall over on the shelf no matter how you try and stack them. On there, however, you can get a nice bend while reading, which you don't get with a hardcover. So I find hardcover a lot less comfortable to read. Uh, so personally, I'm a paper cover kind of guy. Which do you prefer?",

    "voice_to_text": "Oh, I am speechless. But it won't because I gotta review this and convince you to read this. Wait, we need a silent scream. This follows daneera and Oren. Daneera is a princess, but also the Maiden of death. Long ago, their home was abandoned by the gods. But death himself saved the city, giving everyone 100 years of immortality. But we have this girl, the Maiden of death, and she's the only one who's able to unalive people, and that's her job. One day she's getting married off and she accidentally marries the wrong person. She's tricked into this or in. And he is a slave to this burlesque show. And we spend this whole book trying to find the bad guy and the missing people and how to get out of these bargains. It's got Moulin Rouge esque vibes, but make it super fantasy. It is a true slow burn. A true slow burn. I was giggle. This also has one of the sexiest first kisses I have read in a very long time. You know, this is a stand alone in an interconnected series, and it's done so well. The pacing is so good. The spice is so good. It's a book with spice. I love the magic and the friendships and the romance and the character. And I'm going to tell you this with confidence because I listen to the audiobook. This is the best audiobook performance I have ever listened to. It's narrated by Jackie Pryor and Teddy Hamilton in duet style. And they've added music. It's not like a graphic audio, it's just added music. If you want a good audiobook performance, you will pay attention to this book and how they did that. This is the standard. This is the standard. It is by far Jackie and Teddy's best performances.",

They always have, like, walnuts and cheese in them. And salads. Middle Eastern, Israeli, Palestinian salad, whatever you wanna call it. We all eat the same thing. This beautiful Greek salad, mushrooms, cauliflower, and then literally, like, you just make your own salad. Oh, there's some zaatar and olive oil over here. Then we have hot dishes. So there's eggs, scrambled eggs, shakshuka. Look at these beautiful quiche over here. These are actually really good. I don't know what that is, but I think I'm gonna get it. Eggplant. Is that like eggplant? Parmesan, mushroom, barakas, lindses. Look at that mushroom with chili sauce. And roasted potatoes. Then all the fish, tuna, herring, salmon. Oh, my god, look at this smoked mackerel. Their tuna salads are elite. They are so good with all the pickled vegetables, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, peppers, tomatoes. And one of my favorite things to eat in Israel, because it's just better than everywhere else I've ever had is cheese. This is labneh, cottage cheese. No idea what kind of cheese hold this is. Maybe Brie. And then olives. You guys know I don't eat olives. But that's okay. I'm not gonna yuck your yum. Sometimes I do, and I'm sorry for that. And they do have some sweet. There's some Pancakes and waffles and broccoli. Interesting. But that's over here, granola, yogurt. Lots of different kinds of yogurt. Oh, look at that. Holiday dates. And just dry fruit and nuts. How beautiful. And more cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Gorgonzola. Is that what that is? And over here we have fruit as well. Then some pastries, croissants. Look at all these beautiful cakes. And then just gonna take you back here for a minute. If you can see the bread and that toaster over there. Wow.",

A lot of people skip prologues, which isn't even a thing I ever thought of as an option. I- if it's there, I read it. I've never thought critically about them until joining BookTok, but what do you think about them? As for epilogues, I haven't seen quite as much controversy with them. For me, my current story, The Shield, has both a prologue and an epilogue. The prologue as it currently stands, and I'm not sure I'm keeping it, is to show a glimpse into the past that is almost impossible to show in any other way. Maybe I could do some sort of flashback or something, but I didn't really like those as a reader. And then the epilogue is to set up a potential book two. But what do you think about prologues and epilogues?",

    "voice_to_text": "where do you begin your book this is a really good question and what I generally like to tell my writers is start your book as close to the end as you possibly can what do I mean by that I mean don't get bogged down in backstory narratives by nature are ultimately vehicles of conflict and change and transition so when you're starting your story you should start as close to that transition as possible while still showing us enough of their life before it so that we understand the change that's happening in Joseph Campbell's Heroes journey this is called the Ordinary World and it's Bilbo's birthday party at the Shire before anything starts or it's Lizzie Bennett and her sisters getting ready for a ball before she meets Mr Darcy it's there to show us what normal life is like before the story comes on in and turns everything upside down on its head the trick with the ordinary world is you wanna put in just the right amount of it you wanna show the readers enough to give them a sense of here's who the characters are what their lives are like but not so much that they get bored before you throw in the hook that call to adventure or that catalyst in a very specific case like the original commenter's book which contains more than one timeline it might mean getting a little wibbly wobbly and creative with how you present this stuff remember that books do not have to be told chronologically if that doesn't serve the story choose one storyline to be your main storyline which in this case sounds like it would be the storyline when your characters are adults and use that secondary storyline of when they're younger to kind of weave it in and provide context when necessary you can do this with flashback scenes kind of alternating back and forth with then and now or you could honestly just allude to things that happened in the past and use that main storyline as the strong beat that readers follow throughout there's a million ways to do this and honestly I work with a lot of writers who just start writing figure out what they wanna do and edit it later so biggest piece of advice for first time writers just start writing just get it out there just do it um you can always fix it in editing and in the meantime you're learning you're building your skills as you go you got this",

Like, truly nowhere left to go. That's a harrowing thought. UN is calling this nothing short of a humanitarian nightmare. And they are so right. While activism is not the main focus of my platform, it still means a lot to me. And I can't change how little I've spoken about a cause in the past. All I can do is change how much I'm gonna talk about it in the future. I've connected with Erin Hatter. She's doing a great job over on her front. And I have some organizations and I'm gonna plug at the end of this, as well as giraffe wallow. That's my sister. I mean, there are so many inspiring people on this app who are inspiring me and so many other creators to be better about how often we're posting about Palestine right now. I wanna call to action. All of my followers keep donating, reposting, sharing. I'm doing so and will continue to do so as best I can. It's also important to stay updated. I have some update accounts, and I'm gonna link it. It's gonna be a long description, so if you've been looking for links, now is the time. I try to post credible information and sources on Instagram Stories every day when I can. Okay, and here is my list of Organizations and charities that I would recommend donating to. First of all, I'm reading off my list. Sorry. Uh, the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, UNICEF, Doctors without borders, uh, World Central Kitchen, helping to get food to people in Gaza. Um, WHL. And lastly, head count if you are not registered to vote. If you're an American and you're not registered to vote, please do that head count. Rock the vote. So many different companies. Make it easy and make it simple. If you've never previously voted in an election, now is the election to do it in. If you, like me, do not feel represented by your government that is funding a genocide. Please, probably now is the year to vote. Stay informed. Keep talking about Palestine. Call your representatives. Thanks, guys.",

I was Naruto running in the hallway. I was too young for the show when it came on TV, but my dad took me to see some of the movies, and I thought that's what X men was. Fastball special. Pick Wolverine up, throw him at the eggplant. Robot Nightcrawler, do a little poof like a blueberry vape. All those inaccurate memes about Professor Xavier and Magneto being like, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. That's what I thought X Men was. So when X Men 97 came out, I thought it was just gonna be flashy fight choreographies and poorly executed social justice allegories. Nobody told me that the X Men are just the Real Housewives of Marvel. This show is Jean Grey's Anatomy. Madea's new in reunion. X men fans are just spicy romance readers in superhero uniforms. Now, uh, can somebody tell me which comic I'm supposed to start with first?",

But they actually have early sales starting today so you can get up to 50% off on books, up to 80% off on Kindle books. They have three months free of Kindle Unlimited if you don't have Kindle Unlimited yet. They have sales on, um, e readers if you don't have like a Kindle device yet. The sale looks incredible. I haven't had enough time to sit through and pick out what I'm gonna get, but my little bookish heart is so happy seeing it. So literally don't delay and going and checking it out!",

I really like to read books, and I got into reading e books, so I got an e reader. This is my phone sized e reader. It doesn't make phone calls. It's just an e reader. I decorated it because that's what the Kindle girlies do, and I'm just copying them. Well, it wasn't enough to just get an e reader. I also needed a clicker that I could hold in my hands so I could lay in bed and not have to physically swipe on my reader to turn the pages. So I proceeded to get a miniature keyboard. And then not only did I get a miniature keyboard that I can customize the different buttons to work on my Android e reader device, you can literally change these keycaps. So I bought these custom keys. These also do light up, by the way. And now if I want to read my book in bed like the nerd I am, goes forward, back, and this one refreshes the screen, and I love it. It also lives on this cute stand. I have a charm. So cute.",

    "voice_to_text": "So Luke Newton has spoke about Colin\u2019s reaction to Penelope in the Goodnight, Mr Bridgerton dress. And let's talk about it. So Shondeland released like a video on their website and it has a lot of new little clips from season three. And there is a clip of Collin looking at Penelope when she enters the ballroom. Now, Luke Newton said that this is Colin downplaying his reaction to seeing Penelope. Yes, you had that right. Downplaying the reaction. And this man is literally looking at her as if time has stopped, like he always does. Like he doesn't the Hastings ball like he does when he sees her at the day of the races, when he sees her when he's returned from Greece. He always looks like time has just stopped when he sees her, and I feel like we see that in this scene here. So the fact that Luke Newton has said that Colin is down playing his reaction to seeing Penelope, that man is down bad for Penelope. He truly is. Like, I cannot wait to see how this scene plays out. But, like, Colin is so obsessed with Penelope and I feel like he's really gonna be so amazed by seeing, like, the real her this season. I think that's why he realises the feelings, because he's spending a lot more time with her and he's seeing the Penelope that has always been. Because I feel like Penelope's always just, like, kind of been to Colin Like Colin, and she's very much like, let the. The crush kind of be the forefront in the interactions a lot of the time. Like, she cares a lot about Colin, which is very evident, but it feels like she is trying to, you know, the crush does come to the forefront in those interactions a lot. And I feel like now she's like, right, Collins off the pedestal, and she's not like Collin every 10 seconds, which she's so real for that cause, like, I'm in love with that man, too, but I feel like that's why he's like, wow. Because she's not trying to impress Colin. Like, she's just being herself. And that's why he falls in love with her. And I feel like he's really gonna see that this season. And just. I feel like that love story, so beautiful. And I feel like that's what the season is about, is them seeing the real versions of themselves. Like, it's a lot about their own journeys, but also their journeys together. And I feel like with pollen, I feel like the reason why they both kind of fall in love with each other this season. And obviously, I definitely think both of them have had feelings for each other in previous seasons. I feel like the reason they truly fall in love. And I feel like with Penelope, it's like, re falling in love with Colin. And for Colin, it's him realizing he's in love with her. Is because they're seeing the real versions of each other. Right? So I cannot wait to see this, and I just think it's gonna be so beautiful.",

After I read it, I put out another message going if anyone downloaded it, please be warned. This is darker than any book I've ever read before. The amount of you that then message me asking for the details. The moment I said I actually think it might be too dark, that's when you was all like, what's the book? You're fucked. I recommended that to my book club. There's a pregnant woman in my book club. I thought, they're gonna kick me out, I'm done. They're deleting my number, they're blocking me. I'm gonna be on a no book club allowed list. Is that a thing? They would make it a thing. I finished that book at 12:00 last night and I full heartedly laid in bed like fuck, fuck! For at least an hour before I could mentally switch off. Pregnant lady finished it before I did. Susan, I'm seeing you. She finished it before I did and is already on book 2. My best friend started the book at 10:00 last night. She messaged at about half 3 going finished. I was like, if You like HD Culture and specifically Hunting Adeline, which is the second book to Haunting Adeline, because the second is way more disturbing and more graphic. If you liked that book and inside you thought, oh, more of this, please, maybe even a bit darker. This is for you. If you thought any of HD Colton's books, including haunting and Hunting Adeline, Shallow River, does it hurt? All of those ones, if you thought, fuck, this is dark, stay away because it's so much worse.",

If you don't know who she is, she's basically a mom that willingly dropped off her kids at CPS so that they can be placed in the foster care. It's just home so that she can do what she needs to do. But don't worry, she said she's gonna pick them up. I'm coming back for my kids, and I am going to get my kids. When her video first popped up on my for you page, um, I had a lot of sympathy for her, because if you're a mom, you know this shit is hard. But after going through Facebook page, something tells me she's not going back for them kids. Just a few hours after going live and posting about her dropping her kids off at CBS, this was her first post. I'm outside today. Yeah, she's outside, and her kids are finding out how traumatizing a foster home can be. This was her second post. So this is exhibit B. Um, I just wanna clock in and get some money. She did mention that she was dropping the kids off because she had no help and she's in college, but she didn't mention the then go shake some ass part. She then made a post to make sure that we all knew that she really don't give a f. In case anyone of you were wondering if she cared, it's Definitely giving manic episode. So obviously she's posting a lot and frequently on her Facebook page, so I'll keep you guys updated. This is another video that I found on her page, and it's basically just her telling the dads of the kids that they're at CPS and if they want them to come and get them because she's about to give them to CPS. So that's. This video was at the firehouse for two hours, but we're here at Children's Services now. If there's any family out there on my case, dad's side. I don't have nobody's contact information. If there's anybody out there who would like to take the kids, we're here at Children Services, Main Street, Whitehall.",

    "voice_to_text": "this is an excellent prompt cause I feel like a lot of us are probably in the same boat as far as like the business of our lives I'm s m Campbell I'm an author of Dark Ocean Punk Fantasies and I am not a full time author I have a full time job so I work for a construction company doing design and budgeting and so that fills up all my days and then evenings and afternoons are filled up with kids I have a three and a half year old and a five and a half year old and they have busy activities and my wife works a part time job and has other things going on that means I don't get time for myself to write until after the kids are in bed which I would love it to be earlier but it's usually between 8 and 8:45 but I've just set a standard time uh for myself that is my time to go right and that's 9 about nine PM after the kids are in bed I right now I have pulled back a little bit and so like my wife and I have a night just for ourselves and then Tuesday nights are my lives and so typically I haven't been doing any writing then and you have the occasional things pop up but three to five days a week I try to write from nine PM to eleven PM if I can make it sometimes it's gone longer on the midnight to depending on where I'm at in the flow state and if I if the words are coming then I'm not putting a stop to it if I can if I can go a little further that's kind of how I've overcome writer's block I haven't really experienced writer's block I'm kinda constantly thinking about the book and what I wanna write and when I sit down I haven't really had a moment where I struggled with words to put on the page and so I don't have great advice for anyone on that I just uh I just do it which I know is terrible nobody wants to hear that just sit down and do it but that's what I do I just sit down and I do it and if I am struggling a little bit with a scene or or or how to word something I will just go ahead and just write something terrible I'll just write anything I can I'll put things in brackets I'll just throw stupid stuff in there and make a note to come back and correct it when I am feeling a little fresher and feel like I can actually make the writing a little better but I know everyone is different so I'm a little more aware and awake at night and that's the only time I have so I've set that time aside and that's when I do it and I just kind of allow myself to do it poorly when I need to but I've really found my passion for writing now and so it's just something I really I love doing I just love sitting down and getting the world and the words on paper and so it's not hard for me to want to do that I also come from a theater background a technical theater background and so I'm very uh used to this kind of fast paced process and the drafting process and building on ideas and I've been writing uh things you know for a lot of my life uh and a lot of academic papers and dread and you know design briefs and things like that and so a lot of that has kind of helped transfer over I can talk about that field another time but those kind of skills and that uh mindset that I had to get in for Gram School and other things have kind of helped and I've also written screenplays and and some small plays for for the stage and so that has helped with dialogue and I've Learned a lot there oh anyways like I said everybody's gonna be a little bit different you might be a morning person you might be an afternoon person you might have more time to kinda devote to smaller chunks uh I have been trying some writing sprints lately just to kinda freshen things up a bit and those have been going pretty well uh but for me it's just a matter of setting the time sitting down and doing it for a set amount of time and having a word count that I'd like to try to meet in an overall goal and if I'm struggling a little bit take a deep breath and then just write something poorly and let it get on paper"

I had found a quote by Brett Goldstein about being like a muppet that it sort of cracked my heart open. Then I read Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert. That book right there that convinced me that you don't have to be good at something. You don't have to be perfect at it. It doesn't have to be the best thing that's ever existed. And in order for it to be worthy of you creating it. Few months into the year, I decided I was going to start writing every day. Just anything, even if it was. I'm writing today because I promised myself I would write soon enough. The book started coming New Year's Eve last year, like 2:00 o'clock in the morning. Before I went to bed, I finished the book. If there is something in you that says you are supposed to write, even if you've never been able to get more than a few pages, you need to be writing. Don't let your fear or insecurity or feeling like you're not good enough stop you. Because the best thing I've ever experienced was living into the truth that I'm a writer and that there was a story inside me bursting to get out. And however this coming year ends up unfolding, when the book releases, the dream has come true. I wanted to write a Book all my life. And now I have, and I hope you do too."

And then is it good selection? Like, our popular books that you would see on here, or, like, have a friend recommends you, were they on there? Or our. Our less popular books on there?

Well, it's basically a comparison title. It's when you say, my dystopian YA is for fans of The Hunger Games and divergent. And that basically, in a query, tells the agent that you have researched and found out where your book sits on the market. It's a really, really important tool. And every single time somebody has said in their query, I can't find anything that's like my book, I have been able to list a minimum of five titles that they could have comped. It's also not just for querying. Creators, agents use comps. I just sent out a book last week that had three comps. And that's how publishers know where to place the book if they buy it, and basically how much to pay for it. As for the reading question, I honestly don't know why you would be writing in an area that you're not reading in. Um, that is kind of bonkers to me. But, you know, fun little story time. I used to do one to one sessions, and, uh, the number of times somebody would be like, I've written this middle grade historical fantasy, and I'd say, great, do you read middle grade? And they go, no. And I be like, why you here? Why you not reading in the area that you're writing in? You need To know what's working, you need to know what works, need to know what sells. Because at the end of the day, much as your writing is your art, the second that you're trying to get it published, it is then a product. So, yes, I would say it is imperative. And it is very obvious. When somebody isn't reading. In the similar genre for submission. Okay, more to come. Let me know if you have any questions."

Who has the time to chime into shit like that when this is the stuff we're waking up to? This is the actual reality of our world right here. And I'm trying to figure out what anybody thinks there is to celebrate. We literally see that APEX has just completely bought out our government altogether. Um, and this is the. The hugest attack on our freedom of speech. We literally are not even allowed to critique Israel without being labeled anti Semitic. This is. This is a complete overreach of power, and this is done in the name of APEX dollars. See, this is why I'm not interested in watching a red carpet. Red carpets are the fucking distraction. They showed you guys that they didn't give a shit about your freedom of speech, and they're attacking the college protesters, showing you exactly what's gonna happen when we don't comply. I don't have time to give a shit about the Met Gala, and neither do you. We need to be focusing"

    "voice_to_text": "All right, I read five books in the month of April. Let's talk about it. Number one, Stone Blind by Natalie Haynes. This book is a retelling of the story of Medusa. It is a fucking banger. If you really enjoyed, like, Madeline Miller's style writing, like Cersei, Song of Achilles, you're really gonna like stonebly. I love the writing style. It has this poetic Grace with, like, a touch of humor, cause it is really funny and parts, but it's a. It's a heartbreaking story about just the consequences a lot of women face, uh, from men in positions of power. And it's. It's fucking good. It's a good fucking book. I gave. I gave that book four and a half stars. Up next, I read eye of the world, the first book in the wheel of time. I was really looking forward to getting into this series because it seems to be, like, a staple for, like, fantasy readers. But I ain't gonna lie to y'all, I was. I was bored as hell. Like, I feel like this book did not have to be this fucking long. Like, it's a 14 book series, like, get to the motherfucking point. Like, it was. It just drug on and on. But, I mean, I like the characters, um, I like the direction they're going. I'll probably end up getting around to book two eventually, so I gave. I gave that book three or three and a half stars. I don't Remember somewhere in there, the next book I've read because TikTok kept telling me to do so. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. And goddamn, that book was fucking incredible. It's a story about an astronaut on a mission to save planet earth, and it's so fucking good. And I don't know if you've ever read any of Andy Weir's books, like the Martian Artemis. He was actually an engineer, so he knows what he's talking about. And so there's like all these equations and shit in there, and it feels real. It doesn't feel like SCI fi. I just felt like such a fucking smart cookie reading it. But yeah, I get. I give that book five out of five stars. Up next, I read Storm Front by Jim Butcher. This book has a sick ass premise. Wizard detective, and it's an interesting mystery. But every single female character the main character encounters, he has to comment on their body in some way. In a way, it is, like, creepy, and it's like, dude, chill the fuck out. I gave that book to two out of five stars. And last but not least, I read the troop by Nick Cutter. This is my first horror book of the year, and damn. Don't check it out if you can't handle body horror or graphic animal abuse, but that shit is good. He knows how to write. Dynamic between boys. 4 to 5 stars.",

This one I have two copies of. I like the girl prints and keeping my version besides a second copy. And then Prison Healer. It wasn't for me, but it could 100% be for someone else. Um, so I'm gonna be schmoving away these two books. I don't know if you're allowed to say that on TikTok. All you have to do is follow me and then comment. Just which one? Cruel prince, the prison healer. That's all you have to do. Um, and I'll send it only inside the US. Um, I've never done this before, so hopefully that covers all my bases. Um, so, yeah, this just feels like a more sustainable way of getting rid of these books. I don't want them sitting on my shelf. I'm not gonna read them. And I want someone who actually will want to read them to have them and also not just sit in a goodwill warehouse for who knows how long. So, yeah, that's the reason I'm doing this.

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. I'm not sure how many of you are aware that content creator Aaron Hadtimer has started an initiative where she is partnering up other creators and influencers with families in Gaza who have Gofundme's in order to help raise money and evacuate as many people as possible. We all know that no one person can do it all, so she is assigning some of us volunteers, our adopted families, to maximize reach and help raise as many funds as possible. When I Learned about this, I knew I wanted to participate, but the algorithm doesn't always favor me, so I'm gonna need a lot of your help in the upcoming weeks to try to reach my adopted family school. This is the Shaheen family. A father, a mother, two sons, and their respective families, including two very, very young children. Their daughter, Amani, was lucky enough to leave Gaza, and she is organizing this gofundme on their behalf. Family is currently in the south of Gaza in a building that's housing over 80 other displaced people. There is not enough food or water, and they all take turns sleeping because there is also not enough mattresses or blankets. This includes the babies, Yusuf, who's only three and a half years old, and baby Ahmed, who is just a year old. Ahmed has osteomalycia, which obviously can't be properly treated where they are. I will be posting about the Shaheen family until their goal of \u00a360,000 is raised. I am Begging you all to give what you can, even if all you can is $5. There are enough of us on this platform to truly make a difference. Even if we all pull together, we can get this family out of Gaza through the Egyptian border, which is a money's ultimate goal. Please help by liking, commenting, sharing, reposting, and go to the link in my bio to find their gofundme. I know that we can't help everyone everywhere, as much as we may like to, but we can help here. Let's help this family, please.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hello, everyone. As you may know, may is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. And this month I'm wanting to really focus on Pacific Islander authors because there's not a lot of them out there, so I really wanna highlight them. And today I wanna talk about SCI fi and fantasy books by Pacific Islander authors. Now, this will be part one out of two, because there are actually a lot of SCI fi fantasy books that I found, and it's just we need to talk about in one video. First up is the Dawn Hounds, and it sounds so, so good. It's like a SCI fi mystery sort of thing. It follows our main character, who is a thief turned cop who ends up being murdered one night, but then she finds out that she's woken up and then gets rescued by, like, pirates. There's also, like, an evil plague, queer representation and cool powers, and it just sounds like such an interesting book. And I believe that the second book comes out this year. Next up is the upwelling, which I believe follows three main characters and includes time travel and also has Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander folklore. One of our main characters is having visions about the end of the world, and there's two warring spirits which are possibly going to be the cause of the end of the world. And at first, no one believes this girl until she finds the two other characters. In this story. I read Dragon Fruit the other week and I loved it. It was so much fun. Dragon Fruit follows our main character Hanale, who returns home to the kingdom that she was born in and grew up in, but she's been living away from it for years because of something horrible that her father had done. Once she arrives back home, she goes on a quest with the Prince Sam to go and find a sea dragon egg. You heard me. This world has sea dragons and they're so cool, they're so interesting. It's beautifully done. But anyways, they're trying to find the sea dragon egg because it has the power to grant one wish, but it comes out of price. Also by Makia Lucier is song of the abyss, which follows our main character Rayna, who is like a navigator and she's returning home from a big year long exposition when her ship is attacked. When she escapes, she finds out that the people that like, attacked her have totally disappeared and vanished. So she ends up having to team up with the king prince, some. Some royal dude from the rival kingdom. And together they discover that there's some sinister things happening from one of the neighbouring kingdoms and they have to figure out what it is. Naviro is a SCI fi novel which follows our main character Tia, whose sister has gone out on like an expedition in space in a spaceship. But that Spaceship gets sucked into some whirlpool thing and goes missing. And so then Tia has to go and traverse the space to try and find and rescue her sister. So yeah, these are just a couple of the fantasy and SCI fi books that I found. And stay tuned for part two so I can tell you about even more of them, cause I am so excited to talk about the rest as well."

Um, I wanna know all the reasons why you guys need enough books. I will go ahead and be the first one to start this off. Uh, number one, the font was too small on the book that I was reading. Now, could I have remedied this by going and getting the Kindle version and just move up the font size a little bit? Yes, I absolutely could have. I stopped reading out of protest. Number two, the MMC referred to himself as an alpha male. Okay, look, I'm but a woman. I'm but a woman. Anytime I see the phrase alpha male, if it's preceded by, I am immediately will close that book, put it back on my shelf, and will never touch it again. Will never touch it again. Number three, I did not like how the book felt in my hands. No, that was a real one. I just simply did not like how the book felt in my hands, and I stopped reading it. I've lost track at this point, but I did not like the overall vibes of the book. Now, I feel like this sounds more normal than it really is. I genuinely just. The vibes were off, and so I stopped reading. The vibes were off, so I stopped. Last but not least, but also a very good one. Um, he started Singing. Okay, now, look, in real life. Never mind. Not even in real life. I cannot handle a man singing to me at any point, for any reason, at any point in time. Okay? Either it's a way to get her back, or it's just something that he's doing out of love. I will immediately close that book, and I will never pick it back up again. Twisted love. I'm looking directly at you. Y'all got me at the end. Y'all got me at the end. I want to know your reasons.",

    "video_description": "Raziell is a Dragon. He\u2019s meant to have subtly Draconic features in his humanoid form, which emphasis on subtle. Every time I draw him in his humanoid form, he looks too much like a Dragon. The average bystander doesn\u2019t know Dragons are shifters, and neither do most Hunters. Only the most well-trained Hunters (and oldest, as well) would be able to tell, and they\u2019d have to get exceptionally close to him, close enough to see his eyes.  With how I\u2019ve drawn him before, his heritage is too obvious to me. His pupils too cat-like. His appearance not human enough. Or he has otherwise just not looked like himself.  I want to draw the cover of Scales myself when time comes. I even have a design, but in order to do that, I have to be able to draw him. I wish I knew why I can\u2019t seem to capture his likeness on paper. Sometimes I consider giving up- I\u2019m a writer, after all, not an artist\u2026 But I desperately need to draw him. 10 years of not being able to draw my own character correctly is far too long.  The other deuteragonist, a woman named Kalyrah, has a solid design that I\u2019ve been able to consistently draw. I have never once deviated from what she\u2019s meant to look like. I\u2019ve always drawn her the same, but for some reason that has never been true for my Raziell. I am never satisfied with how he ends up on the page. He always looks wrong. He never looks like he should.  #writing #characterdesign #dragon #fantasynovel #scalesnovel #shapeshifter #RaziellofScales #KalyrahofScales #fantasy #novel #dragons #elves #art #characterart #author #writertok #fantasywriter #novelist #aspiringwriter #fantasywriting "

I feel  obligated to overshare. two years ago I moved to NYC and I was fresh out of a  long term relationship. I hated men, I was swearing them off, I was actively  declaring celibacy, all of the  post relationship drama -  whatever. then I'm moving into  my first apartment,  which was above  a coffee shop. I'm like unloading  the stuff from the car, and I see this guy  working on his laptop  in the window. and I'm like okay fine maybe I'm not  swearing off men  cause that guy is so cute. a week later  I'm sitting out on  the fire escape and I see that same guy  walking down the street  with one of his friends. and I'm like oh my god. he lives here. he's my neighbor. that was the last time  I ever saw that guy. we're gonna call him  guy 1. the guy that he was walking with guy 2 I started seeing  all the time. everywhere. I would be in  other neighborhoods  and see him across  the street. I would run into him  at the pharmacy. I would see him  at the coffee shop. then he starts  showing up on my socials. his content on my  for you page. his posts on my  explore page. his profile on  hinge. this motherfucker  is everywhere. a little over a month ago, he hit me up  and he asked me out. and we had this  date planned. you would think  that this would be  the full circle moment. this guy that I have been  encountering on the  regular  in such a huge city? we're finally  gonna go out? no. the date got cancelled  and then neither one  of us ever made a  second date. I run into him - ISH by that I mean  we were in the same tiny tiny coffee shop *two days ago  *on Saturday except now it's awkward, now it's like an awkward  encounter because I'm  there with a co worker. he's there.  it's a small ass space. we have like this mutual shared  experience that we  haven't been able to like hash out in person be like hey you. I haven't been able to  shake that interaction  all weekend, and so I woke up today  and was like I just need to like sit down and have a conversation with  this person. he's such an enigma, I've ran into him  too many times. so I text him  and I was like \u201cYo I'm leaving town for  like a month on Thursday do you wanna grab like a casual little coffee  or something?\u201d he replies and he's like \u201cyeah totally, but to be like super honest with you I like started seeing this girl  a few weeks ago and like if we got coffee it wouldn't be like a  date coffee it would be  friend / neighbor coffee I responded and was like \u201cperfect.\u201d  this is the full circle moment. he says  \u201con the low, I would love to  set you up  with my roommate.\u201d if his roommate  is that guy  from the window  *two years ago I'm telling you, I'm gonna die on the spot.",

You're starting to get the point. Yeah. Or, you know, any of these 124 family. I know every year, the MET Gala gets more and more capital of the Hunger Games kind of situation, but, you know, like, it is very stark right now, and so many people are doing auctions like the Gaza book auction or, you know, trying to give $5 to every family that they can find, when the people who are going to the MET Gala could easily and without trouble pay for every single family on that list to get out.

This might be my least favorite Kim Kardashian Met Gala look. This is classic. I was hoping she brought out King Kylie with the pink hair and did something really nice and fairy like, but of course, she kept it nice and classic. Doja. Once again, I am confused. I don't get the concept to garden of time or Sleeping Beauties at all with this. But I know that you'll eventually let us know. See, like, I find this really camp and adorable, and it fits with the theme. Boring doesn't fit the theme. Boring doesn't fit the theme. Sleeping Beauty. Garden of time is literally a Lana Del Rey song title, so this was meant for her. She looks fucking phenomenal. Giving the first woman Eve. Like, this is garden, this is of time, this is timeless, and this is just simply not. I'm sorry. The Kardashians and the Jenners have really killed me this year because none of this is giving. How is this garden of time? You guys just wanna come to look beautiful. I get it. But, like, there's a theme here. That's why you guys weren't even invited. Oh, my God, why? Like, I kind of understand the dress, but that fucking hair. Karl Lagerfeld's cat has arrived. Love the hair. Love the dress. Beautiful gowns. Not on theme. And this was my 13th reason has to be schiaparelli, but this is actually really nice and cute. Boring. That's why Wisdom Kaye ate you up. Basic boring. I hate it. Okay, Cynthia, I obviously love the opposite looks with Glenda and the Wicked Witch of the west. Karol G, I'm sorry, but whoever's idea it was to have that buster on your waist like that did not want you to look good, because you look a little wide. But I guess I appreciate the little fairy nymph moment that you're trying to have here. I think this is pretty \u2026..boring. Mustard on the beat. Oh, okay. I like this. This is giving, like, fall. Like the falling leaves. Again, beautiful gowns. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Not on theme. Wow, Serena, this is, like, stunning. It's like a kaleidoscope mermaid dress. I'm obsessed with this.

We have made clear that they should accept that offer, that Israel made significant compromises, showed that they wanted to reach an agreement that would lead to the release of hostages, that would bring an immediate ceasefire. And we have hoped that Hamas would take the deal that was on the table. Now, as to what's in their response, what it looks like, we're gonna review that, uh, and withhold judgment till we've had a chance to conduct a for. So if the ball was in Hamas, is court in Israel already agreed to the terms, or at least, you know, we're okay with the terms. Before they sent it to Hamas, and Hamas has accepted. Why did Israel reject that and then continue to invade Rafa today? They agreed to their terms. Hamas agreed to the terms that was laid out in front of them. That Israel was apparently okay with two days ago. But now, when the Hamas agreed, Israel went back and said no, and then invaded Rafael. Which would they have been wanting to do? So can we finally drop this back and forth of, oh, Hamas is the one that's continuing to prolong this? No, Israel has been prolonging this. Israel does not want their hostages back. They have been using that as an excuse to invade Gaza, and now they're invading Rafa. I just saw a video of people that Were blown up to bits. That there was not even semblance of a human body left behind. We're about to watch a blood bath, because 1.4 million people are in Rafa, and they're invading Rafa. Hamas has agreed to the ceasefire agreement. Israel refused. And the United States can continue to say that they opposed the Rafa invasion, but they're still continuing to supply weapons, they're still agreeing to Israel's demands, and they're still siding with them at Security Council. The United States is at the home of this genocide. It's not just Israel.",

    "voice_to_text": "a few days ago I made a video explaining  just how powerful Sun Wukong from The Journey to the West is and well the man himself king Lion decided to debunk my video if you can even really  call it a debunk because he didn't debunk anything he just yapped for  almost eight minutes so today I'm gonna go through  every single debunk he made  and explain why he's wrong so in my video the other day the first point I made was  that Sun Wukong solo\u2019d the entire Chinese pantheon all by himself to which King Lion said this scathing absolutely scathing oh and to answer your question yes he did solo the whole pantheon when Sun Wukong ate  every single peach of immortality  in heaven right before  their giant Peach festival the Jade Emperor was  understandably pissed so he sent down  the four great heavenly kings along with Heavenly King Li  and Prince Nezha to mobilize the 28 constellations the 9 bright shiners the 12 gods of the 12 branches the revealers of truth and the five regions the 4 duty gods the constellations of the east and the west the gods of the north and the south the deities of the five mountains and the four rivers the star ministers of all heaven and a total of 100,000 heavenly soldiers that is quite literally every single god and constellation that the Taoist Chinese mythology  has to offer and Sun Wukong soloed all of them so after refusing to address  my first point about Sun Wukong  destroying all of heaven's deities King Lion back pedals to  what about all the fights  that song Sun Wukong lost what about all the times  he got captured and to that I say  if you know anything about  The Journey to the West at all you know that Sun Wukong gets  significantly weaker after being  sealed by the Buddha for 500 years he literally could not  cultivate his taoist superpowers  while trapped under that mountain and after getting out  from under that mountain he gets a cursed crown  placed on his head that limits his abilities even further even then throughout the entirety  of The Journey to the West storyline there is never a moment in time  where Wukong is genuinely in danger unfortunately the monk Tripitaka  is super weak so Wukong  has to be super careful  in all of his fights to make sure Tripitaka  doesn't just die from excess explosions like I said there is never a moment  where Wukong couldn't just bust in and absolutely destroy  everyone he comes across but he has to actually be careful which is part of the theme  of his journey to enlightenment in the first place  to have some self control I also mentioned in my previous video that Wukong jumped all the way  to the edge of the universe during a bet with the Buddha and that was a massive  speed feat for him King Lion then completely ignored the fact that I was  using that interaction for speed feats and then said this yes Wukong did lose that bet but that's not the reason  I brought that interaction up  in the slightest I used it as a speed feat I didn't bring up the fact  that he lost a Buddha because Buddha is not a part  of the Chinese mythology pantheon the Chinese pantheon  like the Jade Emperor  are part of Taoism the Buddha is part of Buddhism they're two different religions the Jade Emperor calling up  the Buddha to handle Wukong is like if Zeus decided to call up  Jesus to handle Kratos so when I say that Wukong solo\u2019d the entirety of the Chinese pantheon I'm not including Buddha  because Buddha is not  a part of that pantheon my final point was that at the end  of the Journey to the West Wukong attains the title of Buddha  after achieving enlightenment meaning he's part of the Dharmakaya making him essentially omnipresent and King Lion then said this this is so simple it's absurd this is quite literally just King Lion not understanding  the book that he is reading the whole reason that Wukong joined Tripitaka on his journey to the west  in the first place was so that he could obtain  true immortality and enlightenment the reason the Buddha Tathagata  grants Wukong the title of  Buddha Victorious in Strife is because he understands that  Wukong has attained enlightenment at this point he's even mentioned  in the Buddhist chants when they're paying homage  to all of the Buddhas in history right here homage to  the Victorious Fighting Buddha so to say that Wukong obtained  an empty title as Buddha and didn't actually attain Nirvana is you just not understanding the text in fact it makes me think that you didn't even read  The Journey to the West in the first place and just skimmed over it for this video because to miss that fact you have to have missed out  on the point of the entire novel to put it simply King Lion has no idea  what he's talking about here and his eight minute yap sesh  was absolutely ridiculous",

Um, no, I'm. I'm not worried. Um, thanks for picking me. Of everyone. I guess you were chosen because of all the humans we observed, you seemed to have the least connections and would therefore not be missed. That is hideously rude. But I can forgive you, blue eyes. Say, how tall are you? Um, in human terms, 7 foot one. That is crazy. And would you say that you're proportional? You will be taken to be bathed now and sterilized prior to the experiments. And will it be you bathing me? It will be a machine with tubes. But will all of those tubes get in may Kravis? I suppose I can supervise. Is this a concern? I mean, I suppose you can say that I'm dirty. Say, does your people have mates? I understand this term from earth archives. My species reproduces asexually. I wish to be returned to earth.",

    "voice_to_text": "hey book besties I hope you guys are having a fantastic day I had a very exciting day today today is the day that I finally hit and crossed over the 1 thousand follower Mark and so firstly I just wanna say thank you so so much I have I'm I'm so grateful and so thankful for every single one of you whether you're just someone who followed me or if you are like a repeat you know watcher or someone who's just like my videos and especially if you're one of my mutuals I've I'm so grateful to have this little piece of the internet that I've carved out for myself um especially someone who's who's neurodivergent and introverted and shy it's absolutely wild to me that I found a community that I just absolutely love being a part of and love engaging with even if sometimes I'm maybe not the best but I I'm gonna say this a lot in this video but seriously thank you it means so much to me to have you guys here there for a little over two months so to cross over that like thousand follower Mark is insane to me the growth has been astronomical um I would love to see that growth to continue but even if I don't even if it doesn't I am just here to have a good time to talk about my books and to make a couple friends along the way um I don't wanna ramble on too long I do have a bit of a schmivaway for you guys and that I'm gonna talk to you about now I'm gonna talk to you about what the chival way entails and what the rules are so there will be four opportunities for you to win here and they're all different first thing that you can win is two books off of your wishlist I will just need to have you send me your Amazon wishlist that is public um they don't share your address with me so if that's concern don't worry about that I won't know what your address is the second option is that I send you two of my favorite books to you so and they will be off of Amazon um I don't necessarily need a wish list because I will be picking them out it will be one fantasy book and one romance book but I will need your address to send us to you so I promise not to be a creep about it if you send me your address however I understand I am a stranger on the internet so if you don't want to um if you don't wanna send me your address I again I understand is you just won't enter in to win now the third option is that you can win legends and lattes in bookshops and Bundes these are the fairy loot exclusives um just a quick tour legends and lattes does not have sprayed edges but bookshops and bone dust does have straight edges and both both have digital signatures I I'm totally blanking these are the fairloot versions I literally can't remember if I said that or not but you can also enter to win these you will have to send me your address so and I will pack these up all nice and pretty and send them directly to you so and the final option is you can enter to win Neon Gods and Electric Idols by Katie Robert again these are special editions these are the bookish box exclusives here are the sprayed edges they are both digital digitally signed this is another one well I where I will have to pack up and have your address and send them to you so again if you don't wanna send me your address because I'm a stranger on the internet I understand just don't enter to win this option right cool so now that we've run over our options for this schmivaway let's talk about the rules first rule you will have to like this video second rule you will have to be following me third rule is you will have to comment which one you would like to win and tag your book bestie now since there are four options you can enter to win each one you don't have to just pick one so let's say I want to enter to win two books off of my wishlist so I would say at let's say Layla Casteel that's one of my besties I would like to win two books off my Amazon wish list that's one comment if you would also like to enter let's say if you wanna win legends and lattes in bookshops and bone dust then you would also comment at Kristen reads a lot another book bestie of mine I would like to win legends and lattes in bookshops in bone dust so you absolutely have to do those three things again you can enter to win all four if you'd like I will say I will not have the same person win more than one option so if there's one that you really want maybe just stick with one you can also if you would like Book Fairy need that will give you one extra entry per option so let's say you enter two to win two options if you book fairy me then I will give you extra entries for both options right I hope that makes sense please do not book fairy me four times if you wanna enter all four this is not what this is about and truly you do not have to book fairy me I do not want this to be about me getting free things this is supposed to be me getting back to you however if you would like to book fairy me I will put where you can find my my Amazon Wish list to book fairy me now that I've given you your options I've given you the rules I'm gonna give you how I'm going to pick a winner I will be randomly selecting a winner how I will be doing that is I will take everyone's comments and likes and whatnot and entering them into like a wheel so it will just randomly generate a winner so I can keep things fair um I will be posting this on Saturday May 4th I will be keeping this open for one week which will be Saturday May 11th is a week from today so that's when I will be closing it and I will be picking a winner on Saturday night on the 11th so there will be plenty of time for you to like this video for you to follow for you to tag your book bestie and if you would like again there is zero pressure if you would like to book fairy me for that extra entry you'll have a whole week to do so so thank you guys so much for your support thank you guys so much for watching I I'll catch you in the next one",

If you go to it, the first one is a spreadsheet that you can check out and see if anything sparks your interest. It will tell you the genre description for the bundle, how many books you would get in that bundle, and the cost for the bundle. That cost does include shipping and tax, so nothing in addition to what is listed there. Some of these books are quite old there as far as these are books that I published when we had a publishing house, so that anywhere from six to 16 years out from publication. Someof them are more like first draft, so there may be typos and things like that so be aware of that. And I have some of my own on there. They're kinda listed at the bottom \u2014 says Gail. So, if you see anything that interests you, either DM me or email me of the address on this spreadsheet. And I will work it out with you. Thanks!",

Please listen close and let me know what you think in the comment. I don't know what's wrong with me. And I talked to a doctor the other day and they said that post covid, sometimes you can have like heightened cortisol. I guess. It's definitely very strange. I'm what, two months out now, and I still don't feel good. Do you think that doing like NAD multiple days in a row is fine? It wouldn't be harmful, but at a certain point you kind of saturate your receptors. And I'm gonna NAD for the rest of my life and I'm never gonna age. The youth supplement they're talking about is NAD. If you're wondering why your doctor hasn't told you about it, you're not alone. Whether because of Big Pharma or their own greed, doctors in America never tell us how to stay young and healthy. After all, the sicker we are, the richer they get. NAD's anti aging properties were discovered by Doctor David Sinclair. Our bodies naturally produce NAD, and it can be found in every cell of the human body. So crucial for living because it converts food into energy and helps build all the molecules we need. When we age, our bodies produce less and less of that chemical. But when people start supplementing with NAD, they can promote healing and stop the body from Aging. When we produce more energy, our skin becomes tight and full, and we get way more mental clarity. After watching that video, I did a deep dive to find the right NAD that you can take to see real results. If you're interested in staying young and healthy for as long as you can, you can take the supplement I've LinkedIn this video. It's from a small company that has nothing to do with Big Pharma. Frankly, I'm kind of scared they could get in trouble for giving regular people like us access to real NAD boosters.",

So I thought I'd hop on here and talk about it super briefly, because I promise we had your best interest in mind when we decided on these dimensions. Something I've Learned since being in the publishing world is that there is a reason for everything. Um, so the first reason for this little adorable copy is the price. Um, and we knew if we made a standard edition of a novella, it would definitely be pricier, and we didn't want that to deter people from reading this story. Um, and secondly, and most importantly, we really wanted to differentiate the original powerless series from the novella and the next one to come. So we didn't want there to be any confusion on if this was book two in the powerless official series. And the other novella is also gonna look this. They're gonna be the same size, so those are gonna match. I promise. And also, the original powerless series is all gonna be the same size. I will reassure you that right now, because I know that's very important. Um, and I get it. I get that you want these to look all pretty on your shelf, and I think they will still. So maybe I'll post a video on some ideas to order them on your shelf. But, uh, I just thought I'd let you know why we did what we Did. And besides the size and the cover and the dimensions, I hope you guys really just enjoy this story. For Adina and Mac and their love. So that's all. Thank you, guys. Ha ha.",

I saw an ad for them on Facebook and they advertise themselves as a co-op book store for book lovers They have a annual membership fee and then you get discounts on your purchases and such and I went to it to look around and what I was curious about was how they get the books that they sell. Now I am listed on the page on the website,  and they're all the print versions \u2014 paperback and hardcover \u2014 so it's I'm not worried about it being like a pirate site or anything like that. Not even close, but I'm just curious about how they're doing that because the prices are pretty deeply discounted.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I'm not really good at making friends and I think I've realized that one of the main issues with it is that social media has ruined my life and I now think that things are normal that most people don't find normal for example I was at my son's baseball practice a few nights ago and two of the moms who were sitting on either side of me were talking about the books they like to read and one of them looked at the other one and said yeah I was on this trip recently and on the plane ride home I read this book and I'm getting excited right and I love to talk books and she said it was so inspirational and I thought oh no where we go with this and um she said it was about Mark Cuban and Serena Williams and like how they overcame different adversities and became so successful and she was like I just read that book and I was so motivated and so inspired and the other mom was like wow okay I wanna read this book please send me the link like that sounds so good and I was like can't relate that sounds boring um and there was this awkward pause like kind of silence after that because what else do you say about a book like that nothing and I I don't I realize I don't really like awkward silences and pauses and I really wanted to join the conversation so I let the intrusive thoughts in my brain win and I said and I quote I read Fairy Corn just like that into the silence I said I read Fairy Corn and they didn't know they didn't know what any of those words meant none of them except for the I read part so then I had to elaborate as to what I meant by that what what kind of literature is that I've never heard of that so this is how I explained it as best I could um and you know what's worse than telling a group of moms who read inspirational books that you read Fairy Corn is having to explain to them what that is and so I said of course corn that's pretty easy to explain um um but when I gave them the synopsis of the fairy part I was like you know there's this girl who's living in poverty in the human world and she goes and kills an animal because her family is starving and then this wolf comes to her house and kidnaps her and it turns out he's a masked high lord with pointy ears who shape shifts and he kidnaps her and keeps her prisoner in this rich palace and gives her pretty dresses and food but then this other high lord with pointy ears comes and he's a murderer but he comes and kidnaps her from him and he's got bat wings and they're both like 5,000 year old men and she's like 20 and their faces throughout this conversation I mean it wasn't conversation it was my monologue but their faces were just like you know they're like slowly pulling their children away from my children I don't know um I have two 2 positions for friendship still available",

Homes where the bodies are is gripping, thrilling and twisty and is laced with 90s nostalgia.

    "voice_to_text": "I just saw an author post on TikTok that she has written three books so far in 2024 it's April and I just think I don't know if that's the flex you think it is so that's me I'm the author who posted that she wrote three books in three months which I am very proud of  and I just thought I would add some context because that seems to be missing from the original video this is not also this is not me coming for the original video or Jack or anything like that it's not me trying to start anything this is just there's a conversation that's going on particularly in the comment section on that video that I thought could do with some context and if you're interested in that that's what this video is about and yeah I finished writing three books in three months but like they're not finished they're not like I've written first drafts they're not complete they're not ready to be published I never said that they were and this is the question that a lot of people ask in the comments on the original video So two of them were written to be sent off to my publishers and I'm gonna be working on them for the rest of the year doing edits in all the different stages and stuff cause that's just how publishing works the first one I could have started it sooner but that's on me I'm a procrastinator the second one I thought I was gonna have till August to write it  turned outI had till April so that kind of crept up on me I feel like this was the point that was maybe missed in my original video that I posted because I used the I cry a lot but I am so productive sound because I was making a joke at myself for how burnt out I got by doing this which maybe was missed maybe that's on me like I put so much energy into getting these books done for these deadlines but I didn't have the bandwidth for anything else like I was just rewatching episodes of Bluey in the evening cause that was all I had like the brain power for everything was going into these books and that's not normally how I would do it but it was how I had to in this case also like I write fast this is just how I write my brain works fast  I write fast like I'm I feel like it's a race between how quickly my brain is coming up with the ideas and building out the scene and how how quickly I can write what's happening that's just always how I\u2019ve written that's what my process is like and it's different for everybody and everyone's gonna have a different approach in different way of doing things that works for them but this is also the way that I enjoy it the most and like I will sit and write like 10,000 words a day for a few days on the trot and then nothing for a little while I didn't necessarily have a luxury of that this time with these deadlines which is why I got a bit burned out but like I\u2019ve sat down and written 50,000 words of fanfiction in a week several times cause like you know  Like I said that's just how I work and it's how I enjoy it and for me first drafts are fun it's where I'm enjoying the whole process and discovering characters I'm just having a good time with the writing then the editing is where the hard work comes in and that's why that takes a long time  for me anyway some people might be able to edit really quickly because their first drafts are in a stronger place that is not necessarily case for me I never said it was  the third book I didn't start writing this year I just finished writing it this year and again just the first draft I started writing it late 2022 I think and I was picking up putting it down cause it was just a passion project like my publisher turned it down and I was like cool okay well I still wanna write it anyway it was basically a rewrite of a fanfiction that I'd written and I kinda just lost steam on it last year and I put it down and didn't pick it back up until after I finished these two books and I was feeling really inspired and motivated and I thought now is the time I'm gonna finish that book cause I knew where it was going like I've always known where it was going because of the fanfic that I wrote so I wrote like the last 30 / 35,000 words on it in April and great that was book number three this year finished so hopefully that answered a lot of the questions that I was seeing in the comments on that original video um but I there were some comments and I cannot stress this enough this was the comments this was some people not Jack the original creator by mile um but there were some very interesting comments in the problematic sense that they said this is a red flag if you're not Brandon Sanderson and it's also not to diss Brandon Sanderson but like we're really in a post barbie movie world saying that it's essentially saying it's okay if it's the fantasy genre or this or it's okay if it's a man doing it but it's not okay when it's romcoms and romance and women that's really the stance that you wanna take okay okay  again not not Jack saying that not in the original video it was purely in the comment section but I I interesting okay okay now listen if the fact that I write my books quickly for the first draft is gonna put you off reading that's okay my books aren't for everyone but they are easy going light hearted fun romcoms the hopefully people enjoy reading and make them happy that's all that's all I'm intending to do and I'm just trying to have a good time while I'm doing it and you know what I figured this conversation's happening with or without me here's some context here here's the conversation with me and if you have more thoughts then let me know in the comments cause I would love to chat to you about this stuff and if you wanna know more about like my writing process like I said there's some playlist on my profile where I oh did I say this I documented the first two books I wrote this year the ones for my publishing deadlines like I anytime any day I sat down to write I was documenting that in a video here on TikTok so you can follow the whole journey on here if you want um but if you have writing questions in general let me know let's chat about that too",

    "voice_to_text": "We are reading the books we already own. There is a pillow and a mug on top of these books on the floor. What is happening? If you're new here, I'm going through my bookshelf one book at a time, reading the ones I haven't read yet, and deciding what gets to stay and what's gotta go. Whence last we met, I had just finished an Ember in the ashes, and now I have finished A torch against the knight. Oh, my god. Let me tell you something about this. Okay? Let me. Let me just. Let me, let me. This book was a lot. There are moments in this book that are akin to, like, the Red Wedding in game of Thrones. There are things that happen at the end of this book that change the status quo for the character so much that you would think it was the end of the series, and yet, somehow, somehow, there are two more books. All I wanted for these characters for 450 pages was for them to find a save point. You know when you're playing a video game and you go into a room, there's a save point. You're like, woo, least I'm safe in here. I wanted them to find that room, and they never did. Everyone's in danger. Every single person in this book is in danger for the entire. Every page of it. And in this one, we actually get three POVs. We get a Helene POV I don't love Helene, but I feel for her. She also had my favorite line in an Ember in the ashes, so there's that. And in this book, bad things happen to everyone. But arguably the worst things happened to her. Like, my list of people who are not allowed to live to the end of this series has doubled just because of her storyline so far. I am obviously planning to keep these. Now, I got very lucky because one of you had the kindness and the audacity to send me books three and four in the mail. Though, whoever you are, you didn't put a note of any kind, so I. If you are the person who sent me these, thank you. That was so nice of you. So next up, I will be finishing this series at. Do you wanna check in when I finish Reaper at the Gates, or should I just read both of them and then check back in with you? What. What would you prefer? Do you wanna hear one combined meltdown or two separate meltdowns? By the way, I don't think I've ever showed you guys this. This is a pillow, and the pillowcase is a bookcase. I think my grandma made this for me. Maybe it was my mom. I can't remember. This is what I lay on when I read this in my giant teddy bear. Have I shown you my giant teddy bear? This is him. He's actually Taller than me. Unlike most of the men on the internet, when he says he's six feet tall, he's not lying. Feel like we got a little off track. So. Love these. Reading these next books. Thank you for your time.",

The posts and the DMs and the emails I don't have. Some of you got my email with music that you have written for this movie. It's really made me think. Here's the news. I want you to have a chance to potentially have a song in the film. There's so much talent on this app. So if you've written a song that you think captures the heart and the emotion of our story. Nothing too literal, please. Literal songs never work in movies like this. I can't promise anything, but I'm really hoping to find a song that I can include in the film. Sourced from the very people that have made this film possible. And I just wanna say thank you. Thank you for your support, for your passion and for showing up on August 9th when this movie gets released all over the world. I am so proud and I cannot wait for you to see this film.",

First and foremost, I would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who took part in Human Voices only. All of the talented narrators, all of the talented authors, and everyone who liked and shared and did all the things to spread the word. That support shows me that human connection is so important, and it's there. We don't want virtual voices and digital voices in our audiobooks. And you guys have shouted that from the rooftops, and I cannot tell you how good that makes me feel. And I've been trying to think of a way to really say thank you to this book community which has given me so much. And to say thank you, I'm gonna be making in an audiobook for an indie author for free. I will narrate it and edit it and bring it to life. All you would need to do is provide the audiobook cover, have a form on my profile. If you fill it out, you will automatically be entered. If you make a video supporting human voices only, and let me know, I will give you a second entry and then in a couple weeks will do the spinny wheel thing and I will pick a winner and that person will have Their book turned into an audiobook by me. There's a few little caveats. Um, I'll list them all below, such as how long the book is, there's certain triggers I'm not comfortable with, things like that. Um, but as long as all those things align, I'm really looking forward to making this project happen for somebody who wouldn't be able to make it happen otherwise. So I hope that this works out for everybody. Um, if you're interested, please head over to my profile and enter yourself in. And thank you again for supporting myself and my colleagues. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is a 36 dollar hot food plate from Air 1. Let's see if it's worth the price. Okay, so I got what I think is a salmon skewer, as well as some cucumber salad, some broccolini, and gluten free Mac and cheese. I honestly had no idea what to order, and there was so much pressure because the line is so long and everything's moving so fast. So I was like, oh, yeah, that looks good. I, I don't know. It was very stressful. So if I didn't order the right thing, then just blame it on this dress. First I need to try this salmon skewer. Looks like we got zucchini, salmon, bell peppers, and that's about it. Oh, wait, girl, stop, stop. There is so much flavor on this. I think it's like a teriyaki. Hmm. I wanted this to be bland and dry, but the salmon's flaky and flavorful. The zucchini is cooked perfectly. The salmon skewer is a thumbs up. Hmm. Next I'm gonna go in for a bite of the broccolini. It looks cooked nicely. That's the best broccolini I've ever had. Just look how vibrant it is. I really didn't want to like this because it's so expensive. Like, honestly, I barely even usually like broccolini, but this is so good, I'm upset. I didn't want this to be good. I was kind of praying on its downfall cause it's so overpriced. Okay, I have to try this cucumber salad. Cucumber, tomato, avocado, Girl, it's delicious. Perfectly seasoned, super fresh and crisp cucumber. The avocado. The avocado is even fresh. I'm starting to understand, but I still feel like $36 is crazy. Okay, it's finally time to try the Mac and cheese. I feel like this is a true determining factor of if the hot food is actually good or is this gonna be bland and not good? Let's find out. Girl, just trust me when I tell you you're gonna Wanna buy to this. Have a bite. Hello. Loudest car in the world alert. Hmm. That's good. No, that's so good. $36 is crazy, though. I feel like it should be like half the price at like $18, and that would even be like, wow, that's expensive. But $36, really? But honestly, everything is really freaking delicious. I cannot lie about the truth. I'm trying to buy it with a little. Okay, I'm trying to buy it with a little bit of everything. Okay, well, we've deduced that that's good. I also. Hello. I also got one of these 12 dollar green juices. I felt like it was a necessity to try along with my hot food to get the full experience. So there's a little bonus for the end of the episode. Can't really base it off of taste, though. These are more so for the nutrients that you get from it rather than taste. But let's see this. That is really good. That is really good juice. Okay, I think That might be worth $12. It's a lot of juice. I did not wanna be defending Air 1 in this video, but honestly, you can really taste the quality and everything. You can tell everything is super fresh. It's really good. Hmm.",

Sadly, my TBR list and my reading schedule is just way out of whack. I'm basically mood reading at this point. I. I don't like to mood read, but it does happen when I get busy. So the books I'm reading right now are how to become a Dark Lord and trying. I'm listening to words of radiance by Brian Sanderson. I'm also reading stone and sky by ZS de Monte. I'm also still in the process of reading the first binding. Almost finished reading The Traitor God. And I need to start reading sea of souls by NC Scrimmerger like today because my book club starting it today so I have no clue what I'm doing anymore. I'm just like so busy it's crazy. And I also have been playing a lot of tears of the Kingdom, so that's also probably a factory into it. Happy reading everyone! Put your books in the comments!"

Don't worry, I'm gonna explain it how you can do it if you wanna make money fast. This shit, it fucking works. Okay, so what I'm talking about is the ancient spell practice of blowing cinnamon into your doorway to encourage wealth to flow into your life. And specifically doing this on the 1st of every month to welcome wealth into that month. Cinnamon is used in a lot of spell work to attract money, luck, blessings, etc, etc. And all you're gonna need for this is some cinnamon. These are the important parts. Okay? This is what you're gonna do. So you need to go to the entryway, the doorway into your home, and open that door wide open. It can't be just a little bit cracked open? Open that door wide. And which hand you use is up to you. I see some people talking about using your less dominant hand, because that's the hand for receiving. So for me, my left. But because this is a ritual of giving money into your life, I would go for your more dominant hands, the hand you write with. And simply put the cinnamon in your hand. Stand outside your doorway, like, facing in towards your house, and just simply blow the cinnamon full force into your house with The intention in your mind of this cinnamon bringing wealth into your life. And this step is crucial as well. You've got to leave that cinnamon there for at least 24 hours. Don't sweep it, don't clean it, leave it there to do a small thing. And I promise you, unexpected money will start coming into your life. Just watch if you can. And I post loads of tips and tricks like this, so make sure you follow me on here and on Instagram so you don't miss anything. And also, all my manifestation workbooks, as well as my crystals that encourage wealth, are available now through the link in my bio, if you wanna go check that out. Anyway, bye. Love you. Bye.",

I will be the color of milky coffee. But they will be, of course. Hopefully you'll be dead and gone long before you even get to meet her. Oh, you know, you never tell me what's wrong. You're not on my side, Tom. I can't always be on your side, Queenie. Because I can't always be angry. What do you mean I'm angry? Why are you banging on my door like that? There's bringing snacks. I don't know what's wrong with me. My life is falling apart. This is quarter life crisis thing that everyone's talking about on TikTok. We'll just work on ourselves for a little bit. Does grandma know her babies living in the trap house? There's always a room here for you. Don't worry about me. I'm out here living my best life. You know, I like about you. Wow. Most people try to find themselves, but you always knew. You were oh, so deep. Girls like me. Loud, rash, confrontational. I can't not be a strong black woman. That's the problem for girls like me.

I don't know how you pronounce it. I don't watch manga cause I'm not fucking weird. Oh yeah? Imagine walking around with your Naruto sleeve and going out on a date to meet a girl. 99% of girls won't even know what it is. So then you're gonna have to explain to them what it is. But then you're also gonna have to explain why isn't weird for a grown man to watch cartoon fight porn. Then she'll make fun of you to our friends and you'll use this as motivation for your villain arc. Before you say relax, it's just a tattoo. Remember, tattoos are forever. What's even worse then is potentially having to go back to his room, where I think things could be even worse with posters and figurines. I mean, surely there are girls females that actually enjoy watching manga and cartoon whatever anime, right? They should exist. Said no one ever.",

It was not unhinged. It was disturbing. This is the type of book where it's read at your own risk. And I dare you. I dare you to read it and see if you can make it past Chapter 13, cause I, I, I 100, I make. I bet money on that. You couldn't. I didn't read the book.

So to sustain my budget and support the local libraries, I wait on Libby for all my different library cards to deliver all my digital books to me. So it's snowing and that means we're cuddling up and we're reading a good book. There's no weights to throw today, but I just wanna show you all I got this book delivered and I've been so excited cause I've had it recommended to me so many times. And I open this up and this is what I see. In the year of our Lord 2019, 32 year old Eva Mercy nearly choked to death on a piece of gum. She's been attempting to masturbate when the gum lodged in her throat, cutting off her air supply. I said, Dear Lord, this is gonna be a good, but it's gonna kill me. So you know what? Dabble in some fiction, support your local libraries and get a good laugh.",

They're all well and good, but, um, what are some really unhinged reasons that you absolutely will not pick up a popular book talk book? Because your girl right here. I wanna talk about mine. So, for example, I cannot read corrupt by Penelope Douglas because this FMC. Yeah, she has the same name as an ex bestie of mine who did me just real fucking dirty. I'm not afraid to admit that I can't read about a girl with this name. It's triggering. Reading is supposed to take me away from reality, not induce flashbacks. And I know the book talk thinks it's an incredible series. I kind of want to read it. I just. I can't get past that name. I hate that name. Like when people refuse to name their kids a certain name because it's like, oh, no, I knew a Benjamin and he was a cunt. Same font, but different. I'm gonna get hate for this one. Yeah, I am. I'm not gonna read Red Rising cause it's about a man. I'm sorry. Like my drink, my diet, doctor kelp, my FMC. Then I'm supposed to love and be obsessed with and feel like I can relate to and put myself into her world, and you hand me man. Ew. I can already see the hate comments from the Men, it's nothing. Nothing personal. It's personal. This next one is pretty unhinged. But valid. This man has a tail. Book talk. I beg, I beg. I beg of you. Be so fucking for real. Or, like, he's scribbling her name all over shit, like, okay, crazy girl. No, that's not hot. Book talk. This one's obvious. Any  Colleen  Hoover book. I'm actually convinced that, uh, that author has a vendetta against women to brainwash us and do thinking that mistreatment for men is hot. And don't get me wrong, Miss Hoover, I'm reading about things I would never want a man to even remotely do in the real world, but, um, those books. No. It's giving the romance that I would romanticize as a teenager when I didn't know better.",

She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? Her eyes? This course is I will answer it. I'm too bold. Does not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do. And treat her eyes to twinkle in the seas till they return. What if her eyes were there? They in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight of the lamp. Her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it would not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand?

I mean, this crazy son of a bitch literally takes her and holds her on his private island and then forcibly tattoos her. This one, the very opening, forces her to marry him after he unalived the guy she was gonna marry. He holds her neck the whole time while the priest says their vows. This one, this man has, like, a secret little club. He owns, like, a secret club, and when he sees her, he decides, oh, my god, I must know her. So immediately has her sent up to his office and proceeds to eat dessert on his desk. Doesn't even know her name. This one, I can't even tell you what this one's about. This is. This one might involve family relations. Sister, cousin. Absolutely disgusting the age gap on this. And. And it's his best friend's daughter. Who. Who would do such a thing? This one is a reimagining of Aladdin. The bad guy gets the girl. Same thing with this one. This is a reimagining of Peter Pan. Once again, the villain gets the girl. I mean, wrong with these people."

    "voice_to_text": "so I'm gonna give you the official spoiler free ultimate emotional damage reading order for the entire universe of Solaria including Zodiac Academy Ruthless Boys and Darkmore Penitentiary for your ultimate reading experience journey so let's get into this massive series okay so up first you are gonna start very basic almost like you're reading a trilogy with Zodiac Academy 1 2 and 3 they are gonna be your introduction to the series they're going to introduce you to the characters and you're going to know when you read the third book whether or not the series is for you and if you're gonna continue so after reading Zodiac Academy 1 through three you're gonna make your first deviation your first pit stop into Aurora Academy you're going to move on to the ruthless boys of the Zodiac series this is a prequel series that takes place five years before the beginning of Zodiac Academy so yes this is a prequel yes you can read it before Zodiac Academy but I think once you're familiar with Zodiac Academy this is much easier to read so the reason that I'm recommending it after Zodiac Academy 3 is there is a main character in here named Gabriel and you will have heard of him in Zodiac Academy before you meet him officially in this book this is super important if you read Zodiac Academy 4 before you read this you will spoil Gabriel's ending so that's why I recommend reading it after Zodiac Academy 3 but before Zodiac Academy 4 because you will know who Gabriel ends up with and that is a big like plot point of this book so this is where you're gonna read Ruthless Boys of the Zodiac you're gonna read it nothing special in publishing order 1 through 5 nothing crazy and that's it from here after ruthless boys of the Zodiac you're going to read Zodiac Academy 4 Zodiac Academy 4 is a whopper and it will emotionally damage you not gonna quite know what to do with yourself at the end of this so this is where you're going to take another deviation into the first novellas of the series after Zodiac Academy 4 you're going to read 0.5 which is origins of an Academy Bully and 1.5 which is the Awakening Book 1 retold in Orion and Darius's point of view so it's as told by the boys so you are going to read these novellas after Book 4 because there are spoilers in them if you read 0.5 and 1.5 before Zodiac Academy Book 4 you will spoil some things for yourself and I don't want you to be spoiled so read 0.5 and 1.5 after Zodiac Academy 4 and then let's jump back into the series Zodiac Academy 5 Cursed Fates this is the next book you're gonna read and then from there we're gonna read two more novellas after Zodiac Academy 5 you're going to read 5.5 this year the big a s s party and right after this you're going to read 5.6 which is Seth on the moon okay and then you're gonna jump back into Zodiac Academy after reading 5.5 and 5.6 you're actually gonna get to read 6 7 8 8.5 all back to back with nothing crazy in between them so you're gonna go this order right here 8.5 is technically a novella but I mean look how thick it is basically a whole book this is where you're gonna go from here and we're almost at the end so after you read 8.5 you're going to jump into the most recent novella which is live in let Lionel and then finally you're going to read Zodiac Academy 9 Restless Stars that's gonna conclude Zodiac Academy this is officially the end of the series there's nothing else after this unless the Twisted Sisters want to Grace us with you know another novella which would be amazing and then you're going to move into another spin off series so after you complete the entire Zodiac Academy series your life is in shambles you don't know what to do don't worry you don't have to leave the world we're going to go to Dartmoor Penitentiary and that is going to follow Rory Knight who is Leon's brother from Ruthless Boys of the Zodiac the prequel series we're gonna catch back up with him and Amelie who we saw in Ruthless Boys and Zodiac so it's gonna follow them it's gonna be a dark more penitentiary this series is currently unfinished but that's where you're going to end at the moment your Zodiac Academy Solaria journey trust me I promise I got you with this one okay so let me know if you started yet if you plan to start what you think are you overwhelmed are you excited and if you've already read the series let's talk about it I can talk about Zodiac Academy all day but I hope this is helpful so happy reading",

And I just think it'd be so cute once I put a frame on this, to have it up in my library or wherever, see all their signatures and stuff, and it's easy. This is like, 10 bucks from Etsy, and it's actually already getting some scuffs on it, so I bought this thing so it's protected. Teeth are not tools. How. How. Got it. Haha. No. Hmm. It's fine. It's not coming out. So should I get a strap? Should I?",

Someone use punctuation and attacks anxiety. And yet you have no problem generalizing that an entire generation can be awful. So they're the worst. Number two, do we know you? Have we offended you somehow? Did we do something to you? Fuck Gen X, by the way. Where the hell did he come from? You motherfuckers really trying to look, get under the radar, ain't they?

Six of crows. Amazing. King of scars. No, thank you. The Mortal Instrument series. Listen, I know we can all look back on this now and say it probably wasn't as good as we thought it was. But at the time, we thought it was really good. However, we never thought these were good. The second set of the Mortal Instruments, books four through six. I wish I could scrub them from my Brain. Delirium by Lauren Oliver. I know this book ended dramatically, but there was nothing more traumatic than having to read the rest of this series. This one is painful. Graceling was amazing. Fire. Still so good. Bitter blue tapered off a little bit. And here is my copy of Winter Keep because it sucked and I didn't wanna buy it. The rock and rose series by Emma Carrick. Couldn't really have stopped while it was ahead because it would have just stopped in the middle of the story. However, I do think they should go back to the drawing board and try again. Sorry. Book one was so good. Book two was one of my favorite books ever. And book three was so disappointing, I would have sworn under oath that it was written by different people. And almost any time that they've wrapped Up a series, and then years later, they come back to revisit it. It never ends up working out. You should have stopped with four. This trilogy was perfect. It didn't need another book. One of the world's best trilogies ruined because you couldn't leave it alone. That's why I'm too scared to read vengeful. Because when I read vicious, it was a stand alone. And then five years later, she came out with vengeful, and I heard it wasn't as good. And now I'm too afraid to read it because I don't want this to be ruined. Don't do it, Stephanie. Don't do it. What are some other",

So for those of you don't know, Sierra Leone is on the west coast of Africa, and they are currently facing an epidemic where there's a drug called Kush that being used all over and manufactured partly by using human bone. This is causing people to come rob graves and steal the bones of buried people. Apparently the drug is pretty cheap to manufacture, just requires one specific ingredient that requires people to steal bones from old cemeteries, in which case the government has actually had to beef up security at cemeteries to stop this problem. And this drug creates sort of a hypnotic high, as ones would describe. They said this drugs first started being produced around six years ago in their country. And the epidemic of users and the increase in grave robberies has skyrocketed since. The doctors are also seeing an increase of around 4,000% of deaths due to organ failures, which is a direct result of this drug use.",

Why do you think people are saying it wouldn't do well today? And to be fair, maybe it wouldn't, but it definitely is an action heavy. I've tried telling this people. I don't recommend Lord of the rings to everyone. If you start reading Lord of the rings, you start skipping the poems. You like, get to the tavern scene, you just kind of gloss over the poem that's being read and the song. The books ain't for you. Stop reading it if you're skipping that. Read something else if that is your thing. It's going to spark this curiosity and wonder inside you. If that's not what you're looking for and you want this action heavy epic, you're not gonna find it. I read it after watching the movies, after reading some other epic fantasy series. I don't think I've had a better reading experience than Lord of the rings. While I'm reading it, I had some of the most fun ever because it sparked so much curiosity. Where I was constantly on Reddit forms, I was looking up questions, I was investigating maps. I felt like a kid. I loved it.",

The first step is to get the ads removed from your Kindle. There's a free way to do this. They're gonna try and make you pay 20 bucks. I'm gonna make a video on how to do that, so check out that first. So it's gonna be easier if we open all our tabs first. So the first one you're gonna Wanna open is Canva. This is where you're actually gonna be designing your lock screen. The next one we're gonna pull up is convertio, and you can just Google all these names and they'll come right up. You're gonna Wanna make sure it's the PNG to e pub version. Our next one we're gonna pull up is online converter com. Again, just Google that and then epub and it should pop right up. And the final one we're gonna Wanna pull up is this. Amazon com, send a Kindle. This is what's gonna send it to your Kindle. So let's go back to Canva. We're gonna go over to the right hand corner and click create a new design. Scroll to the bottom and do custom size. It's gonna be 1080 by 1440 pixels, and that'll give you something that looks like this. Now, what you're gonna Wanna do is make sure this is black. We wanna make sure our Design really pops. And so that's why we do this. And then you're gonna go ahead and just search whatever designs you want. Here's my finished product. I just searched books and put a cute little font. And make sure it's in white. Go ahead and click Share Download and download that as a PNG. Once that's downloaded on our computer, we're gonna go to our first tab, which is convertio. Go ahead and upload your PNG. And you're gonna Wanna click this drop down menu, go to ebooks and click epub. Go ahead and click convert. And this might take a minute, but that's okay. The next tab we're gonna click is our online converter. Go ahead and upload that epub we just got and the PNG we got from Canva. Change that imagery size to fill and click convert. I think this is honestly the hardest part, making sure you've got the right files uploaded. Now we're gonna go to that, send a Kindle, upload that file that we just downloaded. It should look something like this. And send it to your Kindle. Now we just have to change one thing on your Kindle. Go ahead and click those three dots, go to setting. And on mine, it's in the screen and brightness. And toggle on that show covers on lock screen. I have the newest version of the paper white, but yours might be somewhere else, so if you have a different version again, go to settings, You're gonna click on device options, and the toggles gonna be somewhere in here. Again, I've seen it on both areas. That one's gonna be for older generation. So now when we turn off our Kindle, this is our new lock screen. I know it was a process, but so worth it.",

I don't think he cares if Palestinians are murdered like roaches and ants. Um, but to the rest of Americans who have normal human values, uh, they do care. And, uh, you know, one of the other things that Mark and I wrote in that piece is that the blood on the trauma bay floor and the operating room floor was dripping from our hands. And that's. I think that's accurate. We again, we provide the crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support. Um, your viewers are no surprise to that. And that makes us responsible. If our support stops, the attack stop. If our support stops, the occupation stops. It's. It's instant. It's been proven a hundred times. It's not hard. Not hard to see. Um, and so that's what I would say to people is if you want to stop participating unwittingly, uh, in these. In some of the worst crimes that I've ever seen in my life, then you need to organize and you need to raise the cost to people like Joe Biden, because that is the only thing they care about there. The US is attempting to manage the Middle East with the system that I put in place since the Arab Spring, and the Palestinians are just kind of an annoyance to that system. So I would say To people that you know. You know what's going on. So stop thinking about it all that much and just start acting. Go to, uh, go to your houses of worship, go to your community centres, go wherever it is that you go and talk to people and say, look, let's go talk to our congressman in person. Let's demand a meeting. If you're a veteran, put your uniform on and go. I've had several veterans reach out to me. Put your uniform on, go talk to your congressperson. Film it, put it online. Do anything you can to embarrass these people and to make it obvious to the world that they are not acting with normal human decency in mind. They're acting with purely cold, almost Mafia like political calculations. And, um, the only way that we are going to stop this is by raising the cost to them of doing so.",

    "voice_to_text": "when it comes to um the word narcissist I know it gets thrown around like a ridiculous amount and which is so annoying because people that actually have been a victim of NPD or narcissistic abuse know that it's like it's terrifying they're up there with psychopaths it's not just like this term to just call someone when you're pissed off at them or you think that they're a bad person or whatever like it's an actual thing and the abuse that they do is wild sorry I'm just trying to find my lipstick the abuse that they do is wild and goes unnoticed okay unnoticed to even the victim victims don't know that they are at the hands of a narcissist okay this is the this is why we hate victim blaming cause they don't know they are master manipulators that know what they're doing and they know they have a knack for exploiting their victims weaknesses trust me I have been studying the absolute crap out of NPD and narcissist narcissists and ultimately it's because actually I I think I've said enough um but I just wanted to read some of the things that I've read uh that I've read from this book just in a couple of days okay okay this part here is called a phrase book of love to a narcissist love means \u201cyou make my life more comfortable\u201d it could also mean \u201cthank you for giving me what I need\u201d or \u201cI love you because you make me look amazing\u201d how you make a narcissist look to other people matters a great deal if you're younger more attractive or have some cash hidden away for a rainy day this will reflect well on the narcissist watch out that's exactly the kind of person they want to be seen with it could also mean \u201cI'm glad you acknowledge me and recognise my greatness\u201d or \u201cthank you for sticking around even though there isn't much in it for you\u201d I love you really means \u201cI love that you love me\u201d \u201cI love you for making my life fantastic\u201d \u201cfor continuing to tolerate my little abuses and for never calling my bluff\u201d \u201cI love you for buying all my bull crap day after day\u201d \u201cI love you for taking all the responsibility for our relationship\u201d \u201cand keeping it going I don't have to do much while you wear yourself out trying to get me to reciprocate your love\u201d in the worst case I love you means \u201cyou're a bigger fool than I thought you're lucky to even to get to spend time with me\u201d loving a narcissist is no walk in the park basically however there are enough people struggling in life to ensure that there will always be a steady supply of people who will put up with anything to avoid being alone narcissist know this too they are fully aware that they can get away with treating their partner quite badly without having to worry about the consequences there is a wealth of testimonies from all over the world about what living with a narcissist can be like and the reality that describe that they all describe is very different feel free to read more about this chapter in 15 the challenges of being close to a narcissist wait it seems then that narcissist don't just have a hard time loving but they frequently cause their partners to feel miserable and neglected some people describe feeling used exploited ignored betrayed and abandoned and then to top it off intensely hated I just get had to give her a snack as one listens to some of these testimonies the victims denial is sometimes so obvious he told me that he loved me so this can't be happening unfortunately it is happening to my mind this is the kind of mental abuse that is actually worse than physical violence it can harm people for life especially good people this book everyone except the narcissist should read them because I mean should read it because this is just like gonna tell you so much about how their mind actually works and will ultimately tell you how to protect yourself and people that don't have NPD or aren't psychopaths are gonna read this and be like I cannot believe that people are other like this and I'm like stuttering because I'm so passionate about this because every like I cannot believe it took me until 27 to know what a narcissist was I had no idea what they actually were I heard the name sure had no idea what they actually are like they like in my personal opinion a narcissist or like someone with NPD the actual disorder is like a psychological serial killer when you realise that they do all these things to abuse you on purpose that is absolutely crazy it's crazy it's absolutely insane and it is terrifying because you're looking at like someone with NPD going what the hell are you like how can you purposely be doing this to me not only that they don't see people as people they see people as objects wild educate yourself learn about it cause it's the only way they're gonna be able to protect yourself and once you see the signs you're you're gonna be able to spot them out instantly like within the first couple of minutes of meeting someone you're gonna know whether or not they're a narcissist trust me trust me words can't teach but life experience definitely does good luck out there buy this book",

These fantasy authors be pulling words out the crack of their ass. They just be throwing letters together and calling it a word. You don't know what the hell that is. They don't even know what that is. That's why they made a glossary. Okay? And you might even want to go to extra mile and, um, do an ancestry report on some of them characters in the book. Because they family trees be so goddamn big. They be having a hundred and seventh cousins. You want to pay attention. The most important one for me. For real? For real. Um, just read until shit just start to add up. Them first couple of chapters, you ain't gonna know what the fuck going on. You just gotta keep reading until shit that start clicking, because before you know it, your ass gonna be over in Wakanda fighting to protect vibranium, and you ain't even gonna know it.

Okay, so everyone that said that this book was phenomenal and amazing and life changing and just. They loved it so much, and it was perfect and all of the things, they weren't lying. That's. That's all true. If you took everything that brought me joy as a young adult and a teenager from books like, if you put divergent in The Hunger Games and Maze Runner and throne of glass and forth, if you put all of that together, you took all the best things. All the best of things, minus a dragon. Right here, right here. Made me excited about reading and life again. I was kicking my feet like a little fucking schoolgirl. I was like, oh, my god, I have found what I have been looking for. And thank fucking god I found it when I did, because the next book comes out this month. Yay me! That was until I found out that the next book, the one that's coming out this month, is a 1.5. It's not book two. Miss Roberts, don't you think we have some important things that we need to be worried about right now? What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to focus? Why would any of you do this to me? I thought that we were friends. I'm gonna start it over.",

Because that means I was chosen special. They didn't just beam up Sally next door cause she was out in her yard working. They beam me up out of my own bed as I'm relaxing, playing Candy Crush. So they took the time to specifically pick me out of all these other humans that are around me. Yes, I'll make love. That shows effort. Unlike these people on Tinder who the only thing they wanna do is scam me and catfish me and extort money from me. You never know. An alien might make such good love to you, you might fall in love with an alien. And I'm not opposed to that.",

It's about how the world has been designed by man for man. Oh, I have heard about this, but it's been just never been recommended. Shocking, honestly. Like, in terms of women, what we've Learned, like, we made changes. I read a few years ago and in channels that it really changed how we approach so many things. Like, it's, you know, women die much more often in car crashes because seatbelts were designed for the male body. So I've heard that drugs are tested on men, and women have always been assumed, or were usually assumed to be just small men tell, like you, medicines are less effective. It's, it's better. The biases that are, are, are built into every product. And as we're building AUD, AI and, and all of these new technologies, you have these biases becoming more ingrained. It's really. It's. It's absolutely fascinating. Fundamentally changed how I think about building products and trying to root out biases. And the fact that you, you're aware of bias, you think, I won't be anymore, you actually more biased in many cases, so that's brilliant. It's phenomenal. Every time we have women entrepreneurs on the, on the show, like, just the stories they have, and you're just gone. That is absolutely shocking. And since we've had our daughter, I'm just so much more aware of My actions and, like, the future actions of, like, how do you make the world a little bit better for her? So I'm definitely gonna read that. That's a brilliant recommendation. Thank you so much.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I'm doing a rewatch of Bridgerton to prepare for the new season, and I just generally read a lot of romance novels. Um, so I just wanna share my potentially unpopular opinion, which is that romance needs more bitches. Like, the reason that season 2 of Bridgerton, to me, is so vastly superior to season 1 is because the female main character is, like, not a perfect person. Like, she's kind of antagonistic and complicated, and she's being somewhat deceitful to her younger sister, and, like, just generally, she's not a perfect person. And I feel like in general, but especially in mainstream romance, the female characters are held to such a high standard of likeability and morally consistent behavior that, first of all, the male characters are never held to. Like, half the time the male love interests are, like, borderline emotionally abusive with how avoidant and withholding they are, and it's treated as sexy. I also just kind of find it really tiring to constantly be reading about these women who are perfect moral beings who are arriving into these relationships almost as a blank slate. In general, my favorite books in any genre are ones that follow somewhat complicated or otherwise problematic female main characters. And not just because it's interesting, but also it feels more true to life. Like, women are human and humans are imperfect, but I feel like women so rarely get to do that in romance without being completely destroyed anyway. We need more black cat golden retriever love stories. So if you have any really good romance novels or ROM coms, uh, starring a bitch, uh, drop them in the comments.",

And this was last minute, about two weeks before the event. I got added to the panel and I find out that the store is charging a five dollar cover charge. Five dollars is not being put towards the purchase of a book, anything like that. There were no snack served, no drink served. This was just an overhead fee. And I am uncomfortable with that because I am donating my time. I'm traveling there, I'm paying for gas, I'm paying for parking. I'm donating about two hours of time. And some books are like, oh, but you get exposure and you get the cost of your royalties on the book. I make $2 per hardcover book. So if I sell five books, which would be pretty decent for a panel like this, that's $10. The bookstore makes $8 off of each of my hardcover books. And I get it, you don't want people bringing outside books. So then maybe make the cost of the book the ticket for entry. Or maybe make the $5 to be applied to any book in the store as to ask people to pay for your overhead. When the authors are donating their time, it doesn't sit right. Because, yes, bookstores are Struggling, but so are authors. To stay afloat, authors give up all the time, and I think our time needs to be just as valued. So what do you think? Should book stores charge an overhead fee when they are inviting authors in to speak for free?"

One of my best friends, Sarah A. Parker. I love the way she writes. She's super lyrical and I just think we would have a blast. Hi, I'm Danielle Jensen and I could co write with anyone, it would be with my bestie, Elise Kova. Hi, I'm Rebecca Kenny and my dream would be to co write with Jane Austen because I think she would have written spicy books if she could have way back in the day. Hi, I'm Sarah Alpaca and I would love to co write with Raven Kennedy. I might be Asher, and if I could co write with anyone, dead or alive, I would probably choose Sarah Parker because I've already written with wave in. I've already with Ann, so I feel like it would round out the squat, so I would do Sarah. Hi, I'm Teresa Weeks and I would love to co write a book with Laney Taylor. My name is Rebecca Garos and I would love to co write with Octavia Butler. Hey, I'm Sophie Lark and if I had a chance to co write with my number one romance author crush would have to be Emily Henry. But she probably would destroy my soul in some way cause that's what she always does. Hi, my Name is Loretha Lassa and I would love to co write with Carissa Broadbed.

    "voice_to_text": "So I have two questions. Well, I guess I just really wanna see if my assumptions are right. The first one is, when y'all be saying that y'all don't like long chapters, what's the reason? Is it because y'all feel like that y'all can't take a break from reading until you're finished with that chapter? Because if a book is 500 pages long, it really doesn't matter whether the chapters are long or short. So I'm guessing it's because if you start a new chapter, you can't put down that book and take a break until that chapter is done. And then my second question is, y'all get bookmail, and, like, I'll be seeing videos of you, like, oh, you know, I came home today, and I had a package outside my house, and I didn't order anything. Bookmail comes from strangers, right? Well, our friends that we know off the internet, y'all be giving out your real address and not a PO Box, because it be the. I came home today, and I had this package sitting at my front door. Like, I don't know. How does that work? Maybe I'm wrong. Like, maybe you get it to a PO Box, and then, I don't know.",

First up, and I've talked about these before, villains and virtues. This is a trilogy and the art style is absolutely incredible, both inside and on the extra bonus picture you get in the last book, and it fits the characters so, so well. I don't think I've ever seen artwork and just been like, that is exactly who was in my head. This is a fantasy fairytale romcom. Grumpy Sunshine, enemies to lovers. It is absolutely incredible. I have a whole video all about them, but the artwork, stunning. Next up, anything by FT. Lukens. I don't know how they do it, but every single cover is so incredible. So well fitted to the characters and just so amazingly done with the scene that they choose to depict. All of these ones I'm holding are M M romances. They are like you've stepped into a fairy tale. Absolutely incredible, heartwarming, standalone happily ever after. Would definitely recommend. Next up, and a much newer find of mine, although it is not a new book, is the fairly edition of silver in the bone. And the reason that I love this one so much is because the characters look for the age they are in the book. I see so much fan art of characters are like 17 18 As these guys are. And they look like they're in their mid twenties or 30s in the fan art. And this, they look like teenagers in the end paper art as well, and I absolutely love it. This is a YA urban fantasy based in authorian legend. I have a video about this if you do wanna learn a bit more. The last one and the one that surprised me the most is forged in magic by Jenna Wolfhard. And I was surprised because this is such a typical romancy cover. They look, you know, very intimate, very cozy. Um. And it's one of the more realistic art styles, but I just think it works so well. The colouring is amazing, and the rest of our books have the same kind of style on them. I just don't have them with me, even though I wish I had them with me. Someone who doesn't like character covers. There are actually more, and I might make another video with them. But those ones that stuck out to me when I was thinking about character covers that I actually like."

If you had told me that in December, I would have called you a liar. This is crazy. It's really bit sweet because I love my job at Waterstones. I enjoy going to everyday. Obviously, every job has its downsize, but I love it. I really do. I just got to a point where I was struggling to juggle everything. I mean, I have three jobs pretty much. I have this, my author stuff, and Waterstones. And guess what? They're all books. My whole life is books. And it's a lot. It. It really is. And that is not complaining in anyway because I love every single one of my jobs. I, uh. I have never loved a job so much. It's truly a blessing. Honestly think everyone has their limits, and I've gone back and forth so many times the past couple months, but it's ultimately speaking to people and telling them my situation, and they all say the same thing is like, do it. Just jump for it. Put everything into it. So I'm going to try. Honestly really nerve wracking not having that stability of like, a monthly income that isn't gonna do this. Really excited to see what this year holds. It's already been an absolute whirlwind. I got a book deal. My debut horror thriller comes out in September. Let's split up. Go pre order it. We hit over 100 K on here at, what, like, 1:20? Now what? We're about to hit 10 million likes. Some really other exciting things coming up that I can't say. Yes. Gonna be really weird, but expect me to be a lot more active on here. I post every single day, but expect more. I think that's. I think that's guaranteed. I'm gonna miss my job. Uh, I already said to all my colleagues, I am gonna be in here every week to annoy you guys. And I shall. A couple months ago, my friend was visiting from abroad, and I went into a Waterstones, uh, like 20, 30 minutes away. I have not been in a Waterstones just to browse in over a year. I had the best time, and I'm gonna enjoy doing that again. I know it sounds so silly and so, like, non sequential. Non. Non. Is that a word? You know what I mean. It brought me so much joy, and I miss that, and I'm excited to be able to do that again. I just wanted to give you guys an update, and I can't wait to see what happens next. Ha ha.",

    "voice_to_text": "I got a lot of money I have a mountain of evidence proving that Morgan is a traitor but for this video I'm just gonna talk about two literary elements that SJM uses in ACOTAR & ACOMAF to prime the character of Morrigan to be a traitor the first element is SJM's use of color to symbolize an omen and also be used as foreshadowing the second element is the sequencing that SJM chooses and her storyline and also her use of the number three so so starting with the color theory as JM has intentionally created the color red in the Acotar series to be an omen the first book is a red book and it all started with Farah being in this white snow covered forest killing a Fey wolf and its blood shedding then fast forward and we get to the spring court the roses symbolize not only Tamlin's true character but also the true nature of the spring court and it also foreshadows the events to come under the mountain and then of course we get to under the mountain and there's blood everywhere and if it wasn't obvious enough SJM tells us very clearly through Feira and achemath that the color red is symbolic to her personally of just evil and bad things and stuff like that even when Feira puts on red lipstick in the book really focuses on like her red plump lips it's because it's symbolizing how she's becoming evil like she's acting like this evil person like the the color red symbolizes evil okay and then we meet Morgan and a staple of her character is wearing the color red that's not a coincidence that's as JM priming us as readers to accept the truth that she is a traitor when we get to discover that in the next book second thing I mentioned is how she chooses to sequence the events in the book there are four attacks from Hiburn in achemath the first one is Reese Bates Farah or uses Farah as bait and they torture the tour and the tour says yeah like someone's feeding us information about you so they know they have a traitor next three attacks are all surprise tax and more is not present for any of them but there is a pattern of sequence in all three of these attacks and it goes attack more more is not at the attack and then we have a scene with more every single time so the first time is when I see an Azrael Reese and Farah flying to the court of nightmares more is waiting for them there and they get shot down and when you read the book it's literally like one sentence they're talking about how they got betrayed and then the next sentence starts with her name more more was waiting for them um and I know you're thinking like oh oh does she was waiting for them like the book told us she was waiting for them but that's why it's important that this is happening in threes because it wouldn't be a pattern if it only happened once right so that was the first time it happened something you know traitor has happened more shows up the second time is uh after Farah finds out that Reese is her mate you know how burn attacks them Farah saves Reese brings him back to um his mother's cabin and we see more so there's that sequence again attack but because of the traitor more so now we have a pattern cause it's happened more than once and not only that that in this specific scene more acts very out of character and Farah notices it but Farah has these rose colored glasses on for more and so Farah just assumes that more's looking at her and thinking oh no you found out Reese's hurt me I don't think that's why more was looking at Farah like that at all I think more was looking at Farah like oh shit they just found out who I am it's completely out of character for more to look at Farah when her cousin her high lord her best friend is dying in front of her right she doesn't even act surprised that he's hurt she acts surprised that Farah is there the third surprise attack is on valeris and guess who is not there again more but and this third one SJM kind of you know brings it to this Pinnacle so instead of doing traitorous act more she makes a more sandwich so right before um the king of Hibern attacks Valeris Fara and Cassian are discussing more the attack happens and then more shows up later all three more is not present for them but all three she happens to show up later this is SJM again priming us to accept the fact that more is a traitor whenever she decides to expose that to us and then we move on to why it's significant that this happened three times because in literature the number three is kind of like this powerful number strongest shape is a triangle when things happen in threes it it kind of represents completion or power right so that's why there's three sisters and three brothers that's not corny romantic writing that's that's this very intentional um symbolism of how how this unit is meant to be its destiny right whenever the surprise attacks happen three times in the sequence of traitors behavior and then we meet more that happens three times that is because it show it's a demonstration of truth it's symbolic of a complete understanding if you will again this video is just talking about how SJM's brilliant writing is priming us for the fact that more is a traitor but there's there's so much more to it like how in a quarter wings and ruin Pharaoh lies to her and more acts like she didn't know Pharaoh was lying when she went to go meet the serial Moore's gift is truth so she would have known if Pharaoh is lying and yet she acted like she didn't know Pharaoh was lying and let her go put herself in danger I don't think so and then later on in Aca War when Pharaoh calls her out for her odd behavior she's like oh yeah well maybe I'm acting weird cause I'm gay and Pharaoh's like okay but like that's not unusual in this world a lot of people mate with the same sex so it's just this weird stuff Moore's doing and then you get to a quarter frosted starlight and she's kind of doing her own thing and being mysterious and then you get to a court of silver flames and it ends with heiress saying you don't know the full truth about more and Cassian believing him which is huge because he used to be obsessed with more I could go on and on but I thought it would be fun to talk about how in a literary sense SJM primed the characterization of Morgan to be a traitor I think that's beautiful writing this is not just some cheesy uh what do you call it romantic see book is this is these are good books and um if you haven't seen my other videos I'm doing a series of Ferris paintings and I'm working on my Etsy shop now and going back and kind of doing touch UPS on those paintings so go check those out and if you're interested in buying them DM me so I can make sure you're the first to know when the when I actually watch my Etsy store also let me know if you think Morgan's a traitor because she is"

Because obviously we have a lot of women living in the state of delusion, thinking that they just gonna find the most perfect man ever. And if not, and they can't find that, they'll just be single. As if that's supposed to do any type of advancement to our society. Ask yourself, what is your purpose on the earth as a woman if you're not seeking some type of family, and especially family of your own? Like, what exactly are you trying to accomplish on this earth?

Okay, while her boyfriend Hamelin was over picking a girl to go taking a cave and rail. And I just found out that this is an actual day. It's actually May 1st in the real world. It's technically a Welsh holiday celebrating the first day of may. Okay? The start of summer, obviously. In a guitar. It was the start of spring. However. What.

There are forces at work in the marketing department that you don't have access to. I have a new book. It's another young adult horror novel. And we were going back on titles forever because sales and marketing would say it needs to be a short title. Long titles aren't selling anymore. So needs to be 2, 3 words Max. No, you can't use girls in the titles. We noticed that books with the word girls in the titles aren't selling as much as they were before. Leah, it's a true generic. Cause then it won't have any search engine optimization. And we're just going back and forth on all of these titles. So do not get your heart set on the title that is on your current manuscript, because once it gets sold to traditional publishing, there are a lot more forces at play based on what they think will sell the book, not on what made most accurately represent the content of your book. They are selling a product, and what are consumers going to be attracted to? What is going to look good in conjunction with the art on the cover, and what is going to make a consumer want to pick it up right now in this current market. And we just don't have access to that information. So you've got to be flexible and just know That titles are going to happen",

When this man popped up on the screen at AMC and stopped a minivan with his sex appeal in his fangs and then walked Bella into school the next day wearing these Ray Bans, and that song was playing in the background. Things were gyrating, okay? Like grown women were on their feet hooting and hollering at the AMC and flashing the screen while their Diet Coke and popcorn with M and m's in it were, like, spilling over. This was revolutionary, this. Nothing like this will happen cinematically, I, I don't think ever again. You know what I mean? Like you saw those clips of when the Spider Man's all came together. No, no, that was child's play compared to what this did. And I think about it frequently."

Don't really know what they think of you. Actually, as well, most of the time, you're projecting onto them your own images. Let's say, you know, you had particularly bad relationship with your father or your mother. And you don't like people in authority because of the relationship to your father. And so you meet somebody who's powerful, who has authority, and you hate them. You have a bad instant reaction. Because you're projecting onto them some image from your own childhood. So you don't see the people that are in front of you. You're not seeing them, you're not understanding them. And what happens when you operate in darkness? When you operate without knowledge? You make mistakes. You say something very stupid that offends the other person. You don't even realize that you've offended them."

Because they were trying to get book recommendations. And then the amount of people that were stitching them, calling them all kinds of things and accusing them of all sorts of things. So I just want to remind everyone, this is a 16 year old and there were people out here asking, I want to see your internet search history. You know, you probably into that. Barely legal. Yeah. Saying that to a 16 year old, that's. Yikes, you know? Yeah, um, I, I, I what? Just wanna point out, um, every time that I look up book talk, um, the first wreck, like, there's always at least 2 3 of the first wrecks are always like spicy wreck. Like the description the creator that I just showed um, was giving, it sounds like a man going after a child. Y'all are glorifying and fantasizing harassing NSA. That's literally what these two were calling out the side of bug talk. But y'all wanted to get so defensive and be like, um, actually you're projecting cause your for you page. Ha ha ha! Get work. We're not to blame. I dare Someone to stitch my video and say that I'm wrong, even though I just showed you concrete proof, cause I'm not gonna share the creator's name that I showed, but her entire page, like, most of it, is just spicy books. And it was literally the epitome of what these two were calling out. These two gentlemen didn't even say anything bad. It was literally like, y'all just got on them for nothing. Y'all jump them. This kid was getting hundreds of stitches, calling him all sorts of things, and y'all were. Y'all just like, please stitch this. I dare you. I'm encouraging you to stitch this and say, like, hey, defend this. I would love for it to hear a defense, but, like, these two asked a very simple question in a very valid one, and y'all took it to heart, acting like it wasn't"

Literally, I only picked it up cause I. I had some time to kill before shadow and flame came out. So I thought, watch quick and easy. That's when you got one book in the series. I'll read that. And ended up fucking obsessed with it. Like, look how much I tapped. I ran out of tabs. I had to say to myself, Lily, you are tabbing the whole book. Relax, it's not that serious. But it was. It's just perfection. Loved it. So much fun. Cannot wait. I literally. I'm just clawing at the bit for reckless to come out. But obviously in the interim we have had powerful released. And like I say, I'm very concerned and scared and frightened. Now, I haven't read powerful yet, and if you haven't read powerless, I'm about to drop a big spoiler, so for your own good, don't listen to what I'm about to say. Obviously this is about Edina. Edina dies in powerless. So I think personally it's a bit fucking sick and twisted to write a love story which I'm under the question. That's what that is. What is? I haven't read it yet. It's sick and twisted to write a love story about a character we know isn't gonna make it to the end, is going to die. Now it's Only. Oh, look at that. That is fucking stunning. Now it's only like 200 and something pages. Oh my God. The font is fucking huge as well. I could literally do this in about half an hour. Um, but I'm apprehensive to do it cause I'm fucking terrified. I have a video on my page somewhere of me crying when. When Adina dies. It was violent. I the sick in my mouth. It was not a good time. So obviously I want to read it before reckless so that I've got all the information I need to know. And I'm praying somewhere in the depth of my soul and I'm really trying to manifest that the somehow she's not dead, but I know she's going to be. And it's just gonna be really raw. I don't if anyone's read it yet, obviously don't spoil it for me, but I do. I have a reason to be scared. Should it be hopeful? Should it be optimistic? Or is it just going to ruin my life more than the first time when she dies? Cause I'm very, very. I'm very scared. But I really do wanna do it, so. No. How cute is my jumper?

Just rub me the wrong way to where by the time you get to the second or third season, you're not watching this show for her. Let's be real. Reason everyone watches the show is because of these four right here. Next is gotta be Peyton from one Tree Hill. Listen, I am a one Tree Hill stand. I am a 90s kid. But Peyton, I'm Team Brooke all the way. We get it, you're the emo girl. You hate everything about the world cause your mom tragically passed away. But that makes no excuse that she is easily the worst friend of all time. She's constantly me, me, me. Doesn't give a shit about any of her friends. Team Brooke all the way. And last, but certainly not least is Ted Mosby from how I met your mother. This man, throughout the entire of the show, claims that he just wants to find true love. But at every turn during the show, just constantly makes excuses and whines about every last thing. So by the time you get to the end of the show, you don't give a fuck how we found love.

    "voice_to_text": "Blowing $10,000 a year is only $27 of miscellaneous spending every single day. Now I know you've probably heard this stat before. It can be shocking and also frustrating but I do think that there is an important lesson to take here. But first, I'm Paige. I'm the founder of Overcoming Overspending. I help you stop impulse shopping and overspending and this is your daily deinfluencing video. Every single day I drop a video that's either going to deinfluence you help you form healthier consumption habits or just get a little better with your money. So if you need more content like that make sure to interact with this video so that every single day you can get a little dose of deinfluencing. I think what triggers a lot of people around this stat is that it really ties closely into the narrative that a lot of us have been fed that you know if you just give up your daily latte or if you give up appetizers at the restaurant that that will be the make or break difference between you being able to retire or being able to buy a home one day. And of course I've never subscribed to that because when you do the math the math just obviously doesn't math. But I will say I have a community of hundreds of women who all struggle with their spending and consumption habits and from what I see it's not the big expenses that happen once in a while that throw them off most\u2026 it's just the daily miscellaneous spending that's happening on a daily or a weekly basis. So it really can turn into a death by a thousand cuts situation and it's like the saying goes small leaks can sink a great ship. When it comes to our spending we tend to be in an all or nothing mindset where we say okay well if making these changes isn't going to do the big things for me if it's not gonna help me buy a home or if it's not gonna help me retire one day then I'm just gonna do what I want and spend what I want. And so no, the $27 a day probably won't be the difference between you being able to retire or buy a home one day but it could be the difference between you actually having some cushion in your checking account and not constantly overdrafting it and paying those really expensive overdraft fees. It could be the difference between you being able to take a weekend trip away one time a year or being able to pay off that pesky retail credit card that's just hanging over your head that you never really seem to have the money to pay. It could be the difference between you not being completely stressed and spiraling out of control when your dog needs surgery or when something breaks down in your car that you need to repair. So no these things aren't buying a home or building a seven-figure retirement portfolio but they are the tiny little things the tiny little moments in your financial journey that when you're not prepared for them cause the most stress and the most angst and are the biggest hit to your financial confidence and the things that when you actually are prepared for them they can actually boost your financial morale more than you think that they will.  Now, this isn't to say that you have to cut out all of your miscellaneous spending but I think you will be surprised when you can just focus on one area of your consumption and really tweaking that and reigning that in what a huge difference it just makes overall. So yes, maybe it is the coffee if that's something that's big for you. But it could be something else. Maybe it's books. You stop buying books that you just never read and you say I'm not gonna buy a new book until I read all the ones that I have. Or maybe it's skincare or perfume. I'm not gonna buy anything more there until I use what I have. Maybe you just make a commitment to stop adding like the small random tchotchke\u2019s and trinkets into your cart when you're standing in the checkout line at Old Navy or Homegoods. Don\u2019t tell yourself it doesn't make a difference. Don\u2019t tell yourself it doesn't matter. Because it does. Even if it doesn't allow you to do the big things and reach the big milestones it'll help you reach those smaller ones which again boost your financial morale and confidence more than you think that it will. If you're needing help with your spending or consumption habits I'm here for you. Make sure that you give my page a follow. Head to my bio and you can start listening to and binging my podcast which is called the Money Love Podcast.  You can also sign up for my free master class called Why you Impulse Shop and How to Stop. It\u2019s a great free resource to get you started. Alright I love y'all. I will see you in tomorrow's video.",

Like, how come every time I hear a book talker advertising a book, it has at least one of three things borderline essay, some freakalicious ginormous age gap, or straight BDSM? At least once a week, some book from Book Talk goes crazy viral and blows up, causing the average person to be exposed to it and read it and start calling out all the crazy stuff happening in it. Which causes all the Book Talk gurus to crawl out of their caverns and be like, um, it's a dark romance. If you can't handle that, don't read it. Note to self, if a book talker describes a book as a dark fantasy or dark romance, immediate red flag. Do not read it. Don't get me wrong, it's not all books on book talker. All book talkers. But it's enough for us to step back and think, maybe we just gotta eradicate this whole thing. Break it up, start from scratch. We. We gotta do something. For some reason, even the most moral book talkers refuse to call out other book talkers for bad behavior. So it's left the people outside of book talk, people like me who are in the community, because that people just say that we don't understand book talk, and then they move on, much as us in the outside. One book talk to be a better place. Change happens. From Within? Oh, all I can say is book talk. Do better",

I self published this book two years ago. Two full ass years ago, and it did okay. It didn't, you know, have a ton of sales or really blow up. Signed with my agent, who was pitching my adult book. Um, she offered to pitch this around a little bit two years ago, um, to foreign publishers, to audiobook publishers. And nothing. Crickets. No one was interested. But three weeks ago, Book Talk as a whole decided that you guys liked this book, that you wanted to read it and share it. And there were no big agents that were involved in this. There were no publishing houses, no nothing. You guys just decided you liked my book and made it viral, and within five days, we had an audio deal. You guys don't know the power that you have right now. Major publishers are quaking in their goddamn boots trying to figure out how the hell this book talk thing works and how to blow up the authors that they sign. But they don't know the trick. There is no trick. There is no way to harness the power of book talk. The readers are the ones who decide what they like and what becomes popular. And that is. That's crazy. It's like in the iconic 2000 movie Stick it, where the gymnast choose who They want to win each event, which is completely unrealistic, obviously, but that's what's happening right now. Publishing is this massive Dinosaur of an industry, and the readers are disrupting that industry in real time. You have no idea what that does for smaller authors like myself, who don't have a lot of sales to our name. It completely changes the game. Seriously, the power is in book talks hands. It's in the readers hands. So don't waste it."

I harbor a fear that no matter what I bring to the table in a relationship in my life, it is not going to be good enough, that it will not measure up to what an equally situated aloe person would bring to the table. That, of course, stems from the messages we receive all the time about the illegitimacy and inadequacy of asexuality, which come from Allenormative ideas and compulsory sexuality. We have to remember that our sexual orientation isn't everything we are, and that when we are feeling that insecurity about being not enough, we have to think about all the things we are, all the things we bring to the table, all the ways we are unique and special and worthy."

Oh, sweetie, I think you need to look a little harder. Are you being serious right now? There. There is no way those two aren't together. The pale one's your boyfriend. Oh, shit. Oh, OK. OK, so what's the story, then? That one's a werewolf, honey, do you mean bear? Werewolf. Really? Okay, I've never heard that one. Okay, no, this is fun. So what's the other one? Vampire? No, I've never heard that one. Actually, I was gonna say he's like a twink, but he's kind of tall, so maybe not. Oh, is that what it is? Oh, is vampire like tall twink? Wait, what are you talking about? You just said that one's a vampire, that one's a werewolf. You're still sticking with not gay? Okay, no, no, no. So the story we're settling on is that those two guys over there, inches away from each other, looking hot and bothered as hell, running around calling each other werewolf and vampire are not gay. Okay, okay, sure. Wait, so how do you fit into all of this? I honestly thought that guy was your brother because you're both so pale, but so He's your boyfriend. What about the other guy? What do you know about him? Got it. Just a friend who doesn't like your boyfriend because he's secretly into hit you. This is really taking a lot of unbelievable twists and turns. Wait, you wanna be what? You wanna be a vampire. Oh, honey. Well, I feel like you're already there. You're pretty pale. I mean, what else is there too? Ha, ha. Oh, a real vampire. Sorry, are you talking about your gender? No judgment, of course. I've just never heard anyone refer to it as becoming a vampire. I think most people just say transition. You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say that. You don't have to make up some convoluted story about wanting to become a vampire. No, it's fine. I'll get out of your hair.

So I pick this up because of the cover and also where the Dark Stands still slaps. What a great, great title. And there's a 20% off sticker that helps, too. And then I read the synopsis and I was like, that super interesting. And then I went on Goodreads and the streets are loving it.

The red goes in there. Now the purple. Okay, the purple hit the pink and we lost. Okay, bad start. Well, let's try again. Okay. Hmm. What do we wanna start with? Maybe we start with the yellow. So the yellow goes into the correct spot, then the blue goes into the correct spot. Nice. So we got them two sorted. Now that gives room for the purple to go through. No, it hit the yellow one. Right. One last try. Here we go. Okay, um, what do we start with? Maybe we start with the. It must be the yellow. We have to start with the yellow. Or maybe do it at the same time. No, you don't, cause then they hit each other. What do you start with? I'm so confused. Like, look around. Where do you start? Surely this is just genuinely impossible, even Though I made it and I know it's not. Ha ha ha! Well, I've come back for one last try. It's like 20 minutes later. I'm not even trolling, and I am not allowing myself to fail. What do we start with? Do we start with the pink? No! Ah, it's so annoying. Like, I know I made this, but I forgot how to do it. Blue, blue, blue, orange, yellow, pink, pink, red, green, purple. There we go. What do I hear? I hate the pink again. It's impossible. It's actually impossible.

Are you gonna go with 4th Wing book three or are you gonna go with a guitar book 6? I man. I would say if you haven't read the Avatar series, throne of Glass, Crescent City, read those first, then get a guitar book 6 if you haven't read 4th Wing. I would breed 4th Wing Iron Flame and get book three. So if I've never read it before, I would probably go with reading fourth Wing 3 first, but since we have plenty of time I would probably you got to read both. Okay, I don't know, what would you guys choose? Would you read a guitar book 6 first or fourth Wing book 3? And if you've never read it before, would you binge the whole series, Actar, throne of Glass, Crescent City, and book 6, or binge fourth Wing, Iron Flame, and Book 3? Which would you do first?"

The witchy aesthetic, whether it's in your tools or your clothing, doesn't inherently affect your craft and improve the quality. We all want the fancy tools. We all want the fancy besons, the fancy cauldrons, but the problem is we can't always afford it. Historically, when it comes to the tools the practitioners have used in the past, they used what they had. They didn't have fancy shops that they could go to and get the most expensive cauldron. They had to make do or they had to make the items themselves. And we can learn something from that. If you want to get fancy tools, that is completely fine and you should not be judged for doing that. But at the same token, people shouldn't be judged for using what's available to them because they have a very tight budget, whether it's custom made or is bought from a supermarket. The quality doesn't inherently change when it comes to how we use them in our practice and how effective they are. For example, instead of a fancy bessemble broom, I have a bundle of twigs that my mother bought me from marks and Spencer's. Blesser. And before you go, marks and Spencer's is expensive. These were on a \uffe150 yellow label, and they work. They are kind of falling apart a little bit, though, but I'm On a budget? If they do the job, they do the job. And I'm gonna use them just as much as instead of a fancy cauldron, you can use pots and pans. If you're on a budget, do not put pressure on yourself to buy the most expensive tools out there. Use what you have. Which brings me to the witchy aesthetic. Just because I adhered to the witchy aesthetic, it does not make me a better or worse practitioner than somebody else who has a different style. Witchy aesthetic is something that flows in and out of fashion every couple of years. And while I really like it, a lot of people don't. And not every practitioner needs to adhere to that. Style is not a requirement. You could do your spell work in a comfy, oversized T-shirt and a pair of leggings for all I care. I do. The spell I'm doing doesn't require very specific things in terms of what I'm wearing and ritualistic clothes. I'm gonna wear the comfiest clothes imaginable, thank you very much. Especially if I'm gonna be sitting there for hours. In conclusion, style does not inherently have a factor to play in the quality of the work that you produce in your practice. It is just an aesthetic. And whether you would hear to it or not, if you're practicing witchcraft, you're a witch. Period."

There's not a lot of research on this fungus, but what I can tell you is that folklore states if you find this fungus growing on your gate or door of your house, then a witch has cast a spell on you and your family.

The first one. Freddy Krueger. I don't sleep no damn way. You know how easy it is for me to stay up for a punk ass 24 hours? Yeah. Good luck Frederick. Next is Freddy Fazbear. Matter of fact, throw all. Throw the whole gang in there. I don't need 24 hours with them. All I need is 6. Pull up to the pizzeria, chill all day long. With midnight come start hitting them locks on them doors. My hide in the closet survive to 6 a m. I think I'll be straight. Next is Ghost Face. I'm sorry bro. Ghost face is the most plot armor having as horror villain of all time. Bro. It's like the Batman of horror villains. I thought was really getting clipped by teenagers with anger issues. If you don't shoot this mother. The next one is Carrie. That's easy work. I'm not an asshole. You know how they tell you to be nice to the weird kid in school? Cause if he fuck around and come to school the next day with a big ass book bag, you might be safe. Same thing. The lastly, I will not really had to think about who the fifth one would be. But I'm gonna go extraterrestrial and say the aliens From a Quiet Place. Because how hard can it really be to just shut the fuck up for 24 hours? To be honest, a lot of hard feelings really could be defeated. Or just flat out avoid it by simply having common sense. But for the sake of the video, let's just let these rock. So, y'all tell me, who would y'all survive?",

I flinch against the floor and touch an incredibly dangerous hot dog. Something must be wrong with me. Something is wrong with you, girl. Something is wrong with you. Pure terror washes over me, and it takes all of my strength to keep from foreign sobbing. Holding a corn dog to my head as far less until you get pink. Holy, A corn dogs!

I'm a horror author, so if you tell me the book, you're going to get extra points. And with over 50 novels and countless screenplays, not to mention all the short stories, the amount of Stephen King's work to choose from is staggering. He's one of my biggest inspirations as a horror writer, and even I have a hard time coming up with which one is my favorite. Well, that's not entirely true, because when people ask me what's my favorite Stephen King book? I immediately say the stand. The uncut version of the stand. Epic. This is Stephen King at the top of his game. If I had to pick a close second, I would say the entire Dark Tower series. And rounding out third, we're gonna go with 11 22 63, all of them in novel form. Not the movie. Although the first original series of the stand was pretty good, with Rob Lowe and Molly Ringwald and Gary Sinis. What's your favorite work by Stephen King? Extra points if you tell me you read the book. I'm Damon Mags. I hope your day is as awesome as your favorite Stephen King book. Peace.",

Look how big this book is. And I still have like. I still have like 20% of this book left to read. But I am convinced that this might be one of my favorite books of all time. Like, don't read this book if you are not into toxic love stories, cause this is very toxic. This is going to make you very upset. But it's also very beautiful. And you also really want the main characters to win, okay? Because it seems like there's so much going on that stops them from getting what they want and deserve. And that just really pisses me off. And the way that this book ended, this is like two books and one, because she had the. The book and then she had like a little shorter book at the end that I'm still reading because I guess fans didn't like the way that the original book ended, and I can definitely see why. Very much a cliffhanger for the most part. But listen, this book you. If you know my page, You know, that I love before I let go. And this could be. Yes. Like, those are my top two books. This is one of my favorite books now. Like, those gonna be my third. Three. My top three books. This is on the list. I wish I could read this for the first time again. Like, I know that I sound like I'm being dramatic, but when I tell you that this book has crack in it, and I will stand up until 4:00 o'clock in the morning for three days straight so that I can read this book, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't. It's beautiful. It's tragic, it's heartbreaking. It's really frustrating. It's going to piss you off, but then you're gonna love it at the same time."

Usually we don't have this many weapons when we go to the Hamptons, but today we have got all the cool special magic items that appear in season one. And they're actually letting me play with this stuff. I can't believe it. First of all, obviously, we have to have the invisibility Yankees cap that Annabeth Chase wears throughout the series. Sorry, Boston. It is what it is. Hermes's gift to Lou Castellan. These are a set of flying sneakers. I mean, you just shout Maya, which is the name of Hermes's mom, and off you go flying into outer space or wherever you happen to be aiming your shoes. Now, if you're in the market for some more serious headgear, let me suggest for you the helm of darkness. Let's talk bladed weapons, shall we? We know, of course, that Percy has a ballpoint pen, which is called Riptide. I said it has to be, like, really, really plain looking, like a 30 cent ballpoint pen. But they did manage to put this really cool detail here. You'll notice that the, um. The guard here on the pen cap is shaped like the blade of Riptide. So if you're paying careful attention, you might guess that this is more than just a pen. Oh, I love this. This is so cool. Check out my Riptide Celestial Bronze for all your monster slaying needs now. Annabeth typically uses a dagger, and this is Annabeth's dagger. Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. She's all about strategy. She's about using her head rather than just using brute force. And so she kinda likes the challenge of a weapon that she can conceal. We have a family size blade here. My goodness. I don't want to kill myself or anyone else with this. Folks, this is the chosen battle sword of Aries, God of war. I've seen the fight scenes that Aries uses this for, and it's pretty intimidating. You see that guy coming at you waving this thing? Yeah. Personally, I would not be as brave as Percy Jackson. I would get out of the way. I'm starting to feel kind of Olympian, just sort of playing with these wonderful, magical items. Well, I hope you've enjoyed the tour. Uh, I don't hold these and use them as well as our wonderful actors do, but it sure is fun to get to play with the toys.",

    "voice_to_text": "Oh, no. Has JWST broken the universe again? Well, actually, the universe was already broken. JWST just kind of confirmed it. Let me explain. All right? All of this can be summarized really nicely by this plot. This is showing something called the Hubble tension. What we're seeing here is the Hubble constant, or h, not a number that tells us how quickly the universe is expanding. And we can measure each knot in a couple of different ways. One method is to compare what the early universe look like, the cosmic microwave background, to what the distribution of matter looks like today. Just slightly oversimplify. It's just saying, at what scales do we see density fluctuations in the past? At what scales do we see density fluctuations in today's universe? Take the difference between those, that gives you an expansion rate that's represented by these black points. The other way to do it is to look at nearby galaxies and measure how far away they are and how quickly they're moving away from us, and get an expansion rate from that. Those are the blue points here. And as you can see, over time, as our measurements have gotten better for both of these methods, the error bars have gotten smaller, but the values have diverged. If we start with the early universe and extrapolate forward, you get around 68 kilometers per second, per mega per sec. And if you start nearby and work out, you get around 72 This gap right here, that's the Hubble tension. And clearly it's been a problem for a while. So where does JWS T come into play? One possible explanation is that when we measure how far away galaxies are to get these blue dots, we're not doing it correctly. Calculate the distances to nearby galaxies. We use something called Cepheid stars. These are what we call standard candles. They're objects where we can always figure out what their actual intrinsic brightness. So if we compare how bright something seems to be to how bright we know it actually is, we can calculate its distance. But doing this with the Hubble Space Telescope was difficult because it got a little bit fuzzy. There was a concern that maybe the brightnesses were measuring aren't accurate. There might be multiple stars here, and we can't resolve that. So they looked at them with JWST, which can get much higher resolution, and they got the same answers. They weren't seeing multiple stars. They were getting the same measurements of the brightness. It wasn't a problem with how we were measuring the distance to these galaxies. So that rules out a possible cause for the Hubble tension. On to the next idea.",

    "voice_to_text": "\u2018oh writing a book is easy\u2019 shut up I'm not gonna promise you a New York Times bestseller and anyone who does is full of shit but I am gonna tell you how to write a couple hundred words and get rid of that blank page that I know you've been staring at for hours so I present to you how to write a book by yours truly Oli, in a Powerpoint presentation that I made in two minutes so first of all there's a lot of discourse online about what you need to do before you start writing a book there's a bunch of people who will tell you \u2018oh you need to plan a book before you start writing it\u2019 \u2018you need to like\u2019 \u2018thoroughly plan on every single thing that's gonna happen in the book\u2019 and then there are other people who will tell you \u2018oh no\u2019 \u2018you can't do that\u2019 \u2018because then the story will not feel natural and that you have to like um\u2019 plant a garden or some shit end of the day no one gives a rats ass how you plan your book except for you and they're not gonna break into your untitled word document that you made when you were 12 consisting of 913 words that you put no spaces in between so it's just a big block of words, however once you get that out of the way you quickly realise what the fuck do you even write about you're writing a book and books contain words and words have a lot of meaning so what should those words even be when people tell you how to write a book they tell you that you need to have an idea but what do you even write about if you don't have any ideas here's the answer um okay sorry I'll explain better the trick to coming up with ideas to writing a book is figuring out what you want to read in a book don't be afraid to take inspiration from your favourite books your favourite songs your favourite TV show every writer steals from every writer it's okay so like what are your favourite tropes what are your favourite character dynamics what's your favourite plot types what are your favourite look at your favourite book what is it about that book that you love so much and take what you love so much and implement it into your own book oh what's that you don't read books well see the thing is if you want to be a novelist you kind of have to read novels and it's not just like you read for a one time thing no no no it's like you have to read all across all genres okay you have to read consistently you have to keep reading at least like one book a week I mean it doesn't matter if you're a slow reader or a fast reader you just have to keep on reading you have to buy books you have to read those books and you have to actually keep those books instead of just looking at those books because they're pretty okay you have to read until you at this age you have to transform yourself into this boy wanting to be a novelist but never having read a book in your entire life before is like auditioning for a musical that you've never seen before what musical is this once you've read a couple books dip your toes into the the um the pages so now you have a vague idea of what you wanna write right oh wait all novels have a main character right what do I do with mine just have a scene I just have an idea it's not a main character well good for you because we're gonna create one right now okay say this is your main character um we'll call her we'll give her a name that would sound cute if it lost its meaning let's call her felony this is felony now you have to ask yourself what does felony want in life what is she trying to achieve what is her goal what is she actively striving for what is something that she cares so much about that she's willing to put all her money on the table just to achieve what is something that she wants so badly that it would literally rip her apart if she cannot get it and why are you not giving it to her that's right if you were excited to create your villain in your book before but guess what bitch you are the villain and felony is pissed off at this she's willing to commit a crime for this goal okay a felony if you will but now she's getting payback what is she going to do to try and achieve this goal this is the basic fundamentals for your main character to at least make them somewhat interesting pro tip \ud83e\udd13 because this is your main character we're talking about  try to make it related to them and not just the plot because that's external conflict and I'll delve into like external and internal conflict and look at the difference between them and another video speaking of another video um oh oh boy um right uh the plot um yeah that's the thing in a book that you have to have if you wanna write a good book uh listen the plot is a whole other can of worms so I'll just give you this for now and you can just take that okay just like figure it out yourself uh but now at least I will make a separate video like this I could write an entire book about this specifically that's how daunting it is so just take an idea and like start here or like here or here and just see where you can like connect the dot see where it leads you oh my God I didn't finish this part of the Powerpoint you kidding me that sucks bonus points um keep writing if you really don't know where to start even after this video after all my yapping after my 4 minutes and 53 seconds of yapping you just kind of have to like write just kinda have to like enjoy your first draft okay even after all of that you finally completed your first draft when you've done something that most writers cannot do you even like it is it terrible do you hate it do you leave that first draft knowing that it's an absolute hot mess do you feel like it's something you'll never be able to fix ever do you feel like a complete failure",

    "voice_to_text": "respectfully I invite you to recognize why telling people they read too much or too fast is rooted in white patriarchy in childhood we were rewarded for reading which was considered \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cladylike\u201d behavior we read constantly because we were raised in a world that still believes that unheard and unseen is better our parents praised us our teachers and librarians rewarded us Pizza Hut fed us we connected with characters on an emotional level we trained our brains to keep track of characters and settings we stayed at home after school and on weekends because who needs to go out when you can stay safe at home surrounded by hundreds of friends if you want to read slow by all means read slowly but telling the world that reading fast or reading a lot is a bad thing why does it bother you?! I saw a young man on social media a couple of weeks ago insisting that reading too many books denied the purpose of literature he said that people are better off reading one book slowly and in depth rather than reading tens or hundreds of books a year I weep for his loneliness if my analytics are any measure 85% of book related social media accounts are curated by women or female presenting readers when someone says \u201cpeople who read a lot of books aren't reading thoughtfully or with intention,\u201d they mean \u201cI will regulate your time (and body).\u201d when someone says \u201creading slowly is the only way to sink deep into form and meaning,\u201d they mean \u201cover consumption of pleasurable activities signals promiscuity.\u201d when someone says \u201creading too many books a year means a lack of recall and understanding,\u201d they mean \u201creading a wide variety of multicultural authors undermines the influence of the Western canon.\u201d when someone says \u201caudiobooks don't count as reading,\u201d they mean \u201cmundane activities require your full attention and should not be used as opportunities for education or entertainment.\u201d notice how many of the same people mock readers who annotate their books if we read too much we're \u201cbook sluts\u201d if we annotate and take notes we're \u201cobsessed\u201d if you think I'm reading too much into it ask yourself why those people aren't saying the same thing about the other arts no one mocks strangers for going to art museums or concerts why is it okay to listen to music while you drive or fold laundry or cook but not listen to an audiobook?! it's because information is power and a well informed populace challenges the status quo George R R Martin said \u201ca reader lives a thousand times before he dies,  the man who never reads lives only once.\u201d I want to live them all and none of us whether we read fast or slow will ever be able to make up for the voices lost to the white male establishment who dominated media and publishing for, like, ever wanting to control what or how much a person reads is about wanting to have dominion over them and it's a slippery slope to book banning and book burning and shutting libraries no one is better at selecting the quality or the quantity of what we read than ourselves mind your own business",

Amanda Montel is back at it again with The Age of Magical Overthinking. Her original book that I loved was cultish, all about cults in America. Somehow fascinating, informative, and educational all at the same time. Can't wait to get my hands on this. Little Bachelor Queen is back at it again. Mistakes are never made by Hannah Brown. This time she's moving into the fiction genre with a ROM com story coming this spring. Ellen almost never Misses. Swansong is the final book in her Nantucket collection after 20 something years, and I know it's gonna be incredible. If you didn't read the house in the Cerulean Sea, what are you waiting for? TJ Cloon is back with Somewhere Beyond the sea, sequel to the Cerulean. Matt Haig wrote The Midnight Library in 2020, and it was everywhere. He's back this year with The Life of impossible. His books are always transformational and heartwarming. Get to pre ordering.",

When you're a student, for instance, money, exams, job prospects. When you reach 50, you realise that things were not that complicated and the pressure was unnecessary. I completely understand and I sympathize with the pressure that the younger generation is going through and feels, cause it's obvious. But I just think that later on in life she perhaps you become aware of that what really matters the most is, you know, what's around you, your family, what you do with them. Perhaps you're less demanding on the bigger picture. And that fear of failure, how does one go about fighting that fear? I mean, failure is, you know, it depends to, um, the type of standards you set to yourself. The only standard that we should set up to ourselves is to be happy in our life. Content.

    "voice_to_text": "All of your favorite artists steal from other artists. We see this in every art medium by every iconic artist. If we see this so often, why is there such a negative connotation of stealing? Pablo Picasso once said, good artists copy, great artists steal. So there is a difference between copying and stealing. When these iconic artists steal, they work like collage artists, taking art pieces that inspire them and creating something new. Which is different from taking that inspiration and copying or tracing it inch by inch. Your art can be inspired, but it starts crossing the line when your art heavily relies on its origin. My goal with creating this is to encourage you not to copy, but instead steal like an artist. Take something you are inspired by and expand further to the point that it is something new. The reality is, art has existed since 30,000 BP. So artist putting this pressure to make something that's never been done before is just wasted energy and is creating an insane amount of imposter syndrome. The Isaac Newton once said, if I had seen further, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants. And that was after he stolen that quote from John of Salisbury.",

    "video_description": "Here is the idea around art that doesn\u2019t get talked about. I believe that art is a shared culture. We as artists need to embrace the idea of grabbing references and inspiration when we are looking to create art. It gives us a better perspective on what we are sculpting together. Whether you are in film, animation, painting, or any other art medium this information all applies. Learning from the successes of others is how we grow and succeed \ud83e\udd0d When I was in film school I saw this video called \u201cEverything is a Remake\u201d focusing on this very idea. It gave me a whole new outlook on creating art. If you haven\u2019t seen it I really suggest that you do!  - #motiongraphics #animation #vfx #tutorial #animationbreakdown #graphic #design #illustration #2danimation #art #aftereffects #adobe #mograph #3danimation #animationreels #vfxeditor #motiondesigner #film #cinematography #director #series #lighting #directing #photography #pablopicasso #quentintarantino "

Okay. Oh, my god. So back when blood of Olympus came out, I was a sophomore in college, and Percy Jackson, it meant. It does still mean so much to me, but in that time period, it was like my life, right? Like, every time a new heroes of Olympus book came out, I would start from The Lightning Thief. I would read all five of those. Then I would read whatever heroes Olympus books were out, and then I would read the new one. Like, my Octobers were determined. I was like, what day does the Percy Jackson book come out? Here's Olympus book come out, because I'm busy that day. Booked and busy, all right? And it's just like, that was. Oh, my god, that was like. That was, like, eight years ago. And when I first went and I got blood of Olympus, and I opened it up and I skimmed through it to check the points of view, and I realized that Percy didn't have one. I cried. I cried because I thought that that meant, you know, that the house of Hades was the last time that we were going to ever have heard from Percy in his head, from his POV. And it. That made Me so sad. I felt like I said goodbye to a part of my childhood I didn't realize I was saying goodbye to at the time. I don't know it, it's. I don't know how to explain it better than that, but. So the fact that now we have this, and I just opened it to read the first line cause I knew, I knew he was gonna do that and he did, and I'm just like. And I'm also hearing rumors that this might become a trilogy. Like, 19 year old me is. Is healing. Is healing. I'm gonna have to work really hard to avoid spoilers though, because as much as I want to read this, I have to read all the other books again first. I, I have to. It's in my blood. It's in my blood. I don't know it any other way."

Now here he is gleefully destroying the cake everything's good everything's fine people are reacting with the boos and awws  and all of a sudden his face drops and then that's when he picks up the beer and starts trying to play like oh he's so drunk trying to play it off oh what a big accident \u201cI just was over enthusiastic\u201d what we're seeing in real time is Kens are being revealed as ab****** and they don't wanna be exposed so they start playing into this you know dumb hus.band oh bumbling id.out role I mean you guys gotta see this in real time we're gonna run it back once more it's just a few seconds it starts out look he's gleefully destroying the cake he's destroying the cake actively he's not stopping he's fine, there's nothing wrong with this man but then he hears the sighs of the crowd he's looking around oh he's like \u201coh my God, I'm so embarrassed\u201d he's picking up the bottle he's acting ashamed oh he's gotta wipe the sweat off his brow \u201cI'm so drunk! How could I save the cake?! oh my goodness! I'm just so flustered!\u201d- and then he gets off camera very quickly this is all intentional these guys are so used to intimidating their victims in private that they mess around and forget and ab*** them in public and they're like oh snap \u201chow am I going to preserve my good guy image?\u201d so he knew better than to smash the cake in her face you know he's very clever because he knows we've already marked that as ab***ive he knows nobody's gonna think that's a good-natured joke so instead he swipes as hard as he can at the cake he's taking all his frustration out on the cake he is violent towards this cake this is what happens when you try to turn a shut-up ring into a marriage, ladies these guys have been clear they do not want to marry you and that's not excuse for this behavior I'm just saying there were many red flags before this day but once he's into destroying the cake he thought everybody was gonna laugh along when he started getting kind of booed and whatnot as the bad guy he couldn't take it he's used to being the affable nice guy He thinks, \u201cso I'm gonna flip the script, I'm gonna play the victim.\u201d this guy is clearly a very mentally agile ab***er and you know she better watch out I hope she's safe now, like and follow for more"

And we're gonna take the 5 key points, and then we're gonna discuss it. Point one. This is so significant. Never outshine the master. The most important part of your life as an assistant is to help your boss shine. This rule advises you that you must never do better or get more credit than the person that you serve. Number 2. I love this one, and I'm sure people have heard this before, but so true. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. This law tells us to keep our people with us who love us, but also to keep a close eye on those who don't. This can help us stay ahead of their moves and prevent them from causing us harm. Number 3. Make the illusion of your power greater than the reality. People will always follow what they see and not what they truly think. This law advises you to project greater power and control than you actually have. Number 4. Oh, I love this. Practice this my whole life. Always say less than necessary. This law preaches that we should speak only when required and let people assume at what you might mean, keeping them curious. I've never heard this before. It says, use selective honesty. Selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim. People trust those who seem honest. And generous. This law advises that you use this image to get them to lower their guard and gain an advantage over them.",

And this is no hate to them, because I think they're all really cool. I love interacting with them and listening to them. But I noticed that they're all white. Not one person of color has come across my feet. And so, um, I went to the search bar, and at first I typed in POC, audiobook narrator, and you don't really find much. In fact, you find a lot of, like, videos, white narrators for some reason. So then I said, okay, let me be more specific. Um, I typed in black audiobook narrators, and I'm like, you gotta be kidding me. I don't see one person. Until I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled way down at the bottom, and I finally found some. Now, here's the thing. In traditional publishing, it has always been easier for authors, white authors, to get published. And so as we're seeing more indie authors, I don't. I don't want to say bypass those biases, it's. You still have your barriers. Um, but as they're finding it easier to have their work published and tell their stories, I would imagine that they would wanna have more access to narrators of color. And so here are a few people I found, and I watched a few videos. I thought they were really cool, but, yeah, I'm not sure what I'm not gonna Say, I'm not sure why the algorithm is doing this. I think we all know TikTok has a thing. Yeah, if you've noticed this, too, could you follow some of these. These black narrators? Tag some black narrators. Let's have a follow party, because it's really saturated. It's really saturated right now with white people."

Never visit you in the nursing home. I mean, if they saw you in line at Starbucks, they probably sighed at you for a minute and then pretend like they didn't even know you. All because you failed so fantastically, so monumentally at your job. Your one job, as the loving, supportive presence in their lives that your children would rather dethrone you from quite arguably one of the most irreplaceable positions you could ever hold in another human being's life.

I have a couple of minutes or so to describe you a synopsis of a book I've read recently and I let you know whether or not you should cash it or trash it and this week we are talking about Yellow Face by RF Kuang I've seen all of the discourse on TikTok um let's get into it so at the top of this book we meet Athena Lou and Juniper Hayward or June um and they are frenemies they both went to Yale together as aspiring authors and they both applied to the same writing programs things like that at the top of this book we find out that Athena Lou is the literary darling of the industry at this point I mean she's got the girls sick right hit after hit after hit you know and all the other girls are shaking crying screaming throwing up and one of those girls that shaking crying and screaming and throwing up is Juniper Hayward who I think is the most ultimate hater in a book I've ever read in my life on top of being a racist but we'll get there so one night Athena and June are kicking it at Athena\u2019s crib and Athena chokes and dies on some pancakes it's a hell of a way to die and June is there to see the whole thing she does try to resuscitate her but she don't really know what she's doing anyway Athena dies one thing leads to another and June ends up stealing one of Athena\u2019s manuscripts for a book called The Last Front and this book becomes a national bestseller but not without its pros and cons and without people calling her out this book is tricky y'all this book is tricky because we Learned through the book that Juniper is a disgusting person she's narcissist she's racist she can hardly take any accountability and funny enough which I don't find a lot of people mentioning this in their reviews she is surrounded by people who consistently and continuously support her ideology oh child let's talk about it let's talk about it Eden Books is the company that publishes not only Athena\u2019s work but also June\u2019s June\u2019s team I find is also as just as disgusting if not more which to me is also a sickening part when you think about how this is like RF  Kuang\u2019s like angry angry letter to the publishing industry these same people that are on June\u2019s team at almost at every moment they go out of their way to try to help her even when even when it is confirmed and factually checked that she stole the manuscript y'all I mean this book should be called Watch \u26aa\ufe0fness Work cause that's what the hell it is oh my god but there's also other parts of this that I think are tricky too and I think RF Kuang did a very interesting point with this I think if you're not someone who isn't necessarily careful about paying attention to \u26aa\ufe0f supremacy and \u26aa\ufe0f privilege and \u26aa\ufe0f ideology and \u26aa\ufe0f dog whistles you could find yourself agreeing with certain points or Povs that June presents as inner monologue in this book okay the other funny part about this is that Athena she's not that great of a person either and we Learned that in flashbacks and you know prior stories in situations that June had with Athena right so also it's like it's also it's giving us a morally gray kind of area because you're like oh \ud83d\udca9 okay Granted she did steal from Athena and Athena\u2019s not a great person but that don't make that right and that don't make that right like I see why all of the reviews have been like split down the middle but I thought oh my god this is very very interesting take on the publishing industry and how we constantly hear even on book talk alone have a conversation about you know whether \u26aa\ufe0f people should be writing characters of color can they represent them right and I think I mean if I'm looking at this the answer the answer is no man this book is so goddamn good y'all you gotta read it there's gonna be moments in here where you're gonna be like Oh I mean cause it's like unbelievably racist oh my god y'all it's so fucking good you should cash it",

I got interviews with me and him on my YouTube page. And it was banned in prison because, allegedly, it has brutal manipulation tactics or instructions. The reason is one of my favorite books. Not because I want to manipulate people. I just want to know how not to get manipulated. There's also things that you did I feel anyone can use. Like, for example, Law Number 10, avoid unhappy and Unlucky People. It's contagious, man. Life falling apart. And they have all this bad stuff going around and their life. That stuff can seep into your life. What happens if they start bringing their problems and all their issues into your life? What do you think you're gonna start seeing everywhere? Right? Same thing. I look at this book as it's a cheat code to life. It had a really positive impact on me and my life, and I think you should read it."

I think you're committed to this ending up as a slow burn in some capacity and if it doesn't happen you'll riot like for part 2 no I'm kidding for the record he would love that I kept you in suspense for him I do wanna point out that if a man spoke to you the way he speaks to his mate you would go to prison on felony charges it's not even a question he can get away with it because of his purple eyes and \u201cwingspan\u201d but it's also why I'm worried for the live action because certain things shouldn't come from a human mouth",

Lo, Kylie Jenner, and of course, Madonna. so next we have Libras. they're all about their aesthetic. they're always on top of the latest trend and always have perfectly tailored clothes. some famous Libras are Kim Kardashian, Bruno Mars and Dakota Johnson. last but not least, we have Capricorn, so they have a more classic appeal to their style. quality is of the utmost importance to them. famous Capricorns are Timothy Chalamet, John Legend, and Nina the Brave. all just so style."

For those of you that don't know, Superhuman is an email platform that brags about being the fastest email experience ever made. I bet you that there's a strong contention of Superhuman users that personally use it because they wanna seem as if they're so busy get so many emails that they have to use superhuman or else they can't survive. And I know that they get a huge ego boost knowing that they sent their email with that signature. Sent via superhuman.
