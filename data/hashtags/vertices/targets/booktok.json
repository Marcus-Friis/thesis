Rachel and Jordan were supposed to chase their dreams together, but things don't always go according to plan. They made promises to each other, but when their paths diverged, those promises were put to the test. Now, years later, they find themselves back in their hometown and must decide if they want to revisit the past or continue on with their separate lives. But when the heart gets involved, nothing is ever simple. Rachel: I always thought I knew who I was, but now I'm not so sure. I fell in love with my best friend and ended up with a broken heart. Can I trust myself to follow my heart again, or should I stick to the safe and comfortable version of myself? Jordan: Country music was my first love, but Rachel was my best friend. I never wanted to risk losing her, but now I realize that staying true to my heart might just be the biggest risk of all. Will we find our way back to each other, or is our story already written? If you enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' \"The Notebook,\" you'll love this heartwarming tale of love, friendship, and second chances. Don't miss out on this emotional rollercoaster!

I bet you could be friends with both of those kinds of people! if you tried not insulting them. no buddy I I understand that it was a \u201cjoke\u201d but a joke is when both people laugh right? if only one person is laughing then it's not a joke is it it's it's kinda mean isn't it? and hey listen nobody's perfect but when you get your feelings hurt and you kinda double down on that and become even meaner that's not gonna make people welcome you either so we need to think about our own behaviour before deflecting it to others okay and then once you do that maybe you can find some common ground and try again. hey Andrew I'm a member of Booktok and I'm a member of Gentle Parenting TikTok. many millennials like you and me we weren't taught how to deal with hard emotions emotions like feeling excluded and this is not the first time you've kicked the door in a booktok there are lots of creators that have stitched you or made comments to talk about this and you have not answered any of them with listening or concern at all for their opinion you met it all with immediate defense we love welcoming new people onto booktok but only if they genuinely want to be here to talk about books and are not just using the community that we've built for likes and follows and you come into our space willing to be welcome and kind to everybody that's here everybody that's been here for a long time and spent a lot of time and energy in building this community that you're jumping into we'd love for you to try again when you're ready Kay bye",

An old friend of mine once tried to make a flying ointment from American Mayapple and it was not a pleasant experience for them. No shop should be labeling or selling this product as \"Mandrake\" and I've even seen some label the plant with the scientific name for true mandrake - a frankly dangerous and seriously underhanded practice. These plants don't even have similar root structures, hence the reason the \"mandrake\" you get from most herbal shops and occult stores is small and twiggy. These plants are both poisonous, but their poisons affect the body very differently, with true mandrake being used for centuries as a deliriant and inxoticant, as well as a highly valued medicinal plant. My #PSA for you, if you find a shop labeling this plant as mandrake, especially if they are using the scientific name \"Mandragora officiarnum,\" they need to be reported for purposefully mislabeled their products and potentially harming consumers. This is a very unfortunate yet common practice amongst occult and herbal stores, with many knowing full-well what they are doing. . #witch #witchcraft #witchtok #witchtalk #vvitch #vvitchcraft #witches #vvitches #vvitchtok #witchery #traditionalwitchcraft #wicca #vvitchery#witchbook #witchbooks #bibliophile #witchy #vvitchy #books #booktok #magic #magick #spell #spells #ritual #rituals #rite #rites #spirit #spiritual #spiritualtok #spirits #animism #animist #folkwitch #folkvvitch #tradcraft #divination #diviner #mandrake #mandragora #root #roots #knowledge #caution ",

    "video_description": "#stitch with @Jodi Picoult  It seems like every few years someone with a new book claims that Shakespeare didn\u2019t write his plays because (some noble aristocrat) did instead.  It seems that a frustration with the relatively limited personal details of Shakespeare\u2019s life in contrast to the impact of his plays leads to this kind of speculation.  It genuinely feels classist with a pseudo-feminist twist to claim this other rich lady wrote the plays instead of Shakespeare.  There are plenty of women writers out there. We know women are more than capable of writing just as well as men can. A different set of social moraes of the time would certainly have allowed a woman writer to reach prominence in the way men were. Yet even with the oppression that women faced there are many incredibly women writers to celebrate instead of a false one.  #jodipicoult #byanyothername #booktok #shakespeare",

    "voice_to_text": "who was the elementary school teacher who had beef with you for no reason I'm not even gonna attempt to say that I remember my elementary school teachers I only remember three of my elementary school teachers but that's only cause I loved them well two of them I loved one of them I only remember because I could not say her name and I only called her teacher but that's beside the point I had the worst high school teacher oh my oh my goodness this this woman this lady this matron I do not understand why she hated me so much she just did so it was my sophomore year of high school and so I had taken computer science the year before with my friends and then two of my friends from that original computer science class the three of us decided to take advanced computer science so we were all the three of us just went and we literally got accepted going into advanced computer science and it was like a really big deal but anyways first day comes around I literally I literally I don't know what such a problem what what problem she had with me like not to really like I I like I don't know how to say this without sounding like a such a teacher's pet but like literally all the teachers loved me I was like such a good student but like I don't know it I don't know how to say that without sounding like a freaking teacher's pet except for one of my I'm not even gonna lie for one of my classes I definitely 100% was a teacher's pet I'm not even gonna lie but this class like I literally just don't understand why she has such a problem with me it's not even like I was a bad student or anything like I literally just tried my best but I also tried to be respectful to teachers that's why like I was always labelled a teacher's pet because I was respectful and people just like messing with teachers I guess anyway so first day of school comes around and like me and my three friends are in the class and um we're literally sitting on the opposite side of where the door is so the door like over here we're on the other side of the door against the windows and so she's going through like the attendance list and all that she gets to my name and she screams it I literally like jump out of my seat and like my friends laugh at me like oh what the hell like she's yelling your name whatever what like I lowkey just chopped it up to like oh my name is last on the list because my first name starts with the Z and my last name starts with the W and typically I'm always called last but it was kind of it was really weird like I was just like ah ha ha like oh she screamed my name whatever but it was kinda like okay and then she did it a second time she just like she finished attendance she screamed my name again and I like look at her and she's like go close the door miss girl there's literally a kid sitting right next to the door why do I and I'm literally the furthest from the door I'm all the way on the opposite side like my friends are closer to the door than I am so I literally like I'm like okay and I get up and go all the way to the other side of the class not that it was like a big class or anything but it's kinda like it's quiet and everyone's looking at me because I'm literally walking from one side of the class to the other closing the door and walking back to my seat like what do you mean and like from there she would like always just solely pick on me and I'm very much like the type of student well I was because she kinda low key hit all my confidence but I slowly like I was always the kind of student who like if I really did not understand something like it didn't click in my brain I would ask questions but I was like also like I was conscious enough to be like oh if other people don't understand this I'm gonna wait until she's done with her lecture or whatever and then I'll ask my questions so she can come work with me one on one cause all the other people like understand it but even then like she'd come and help me and I've asked the question quietly cause like everyone else is like typing on the computers tryna code and all this stuff like make a game or whatever we were supposed to do and she comes to me and she loudly talks about how do you not understand this I literally explain this the answer is like this the Miss Girl help me understand I don't need the answers I don't need you yelling at me I need help to understand the concept so I know what I'm doing but at some point I like I literally just gave up on asking her and like my friends tried helping me it like as much as they tried like I just could not for some reason I couldn't grasp the concepts because of the way she would talk and like literally I would literally go home and like have nightmares or whatever like even daydream nightmares of like this woman literally scheming like she was able to get into my brain whatever and like be like oh she won't understand if I teach it this way so I'm gonna teach it this way so everybody else knows what she's what I what I'm teaching but she's the only one who doesn't oh my gosh she like literally drove me up the wall so at some points my friends and I would like literally copy off each other or we would like if we have like individual assignments or whatever cause you know nobody really does individual assignments most of it I don't know but like with those kind of projects it was more like nobody really did individual assignments cause it's computer science everyone's helping each other so my friends and I would like split it into parts like oh you do the first part you do the middle part you do the last part we put it all together the code works so we would like once in a while do that stuff and my friends would always like my friends would always help me because I was the one who struggled the most in the class but I loved computer science like I literally my uncle was in computer science my dad is an it I loved the idea of like working with computers everything about it and in my original freshman year computer science class I was literally amazing I passed that class with 150% I was amazing but this class was literally the worst for me I could not understand the classes I couldn't grasp anything so my friends and I would literally work together and we'd have the exact same code and everything but Miss Girl literally had like such a problem with it but only with me like my the US3 me and my friends would have the exact same code I'm the only one who would get picked out for cheating first of all I'm not cheating cause we're literally helping each other work on it and we will try to explain to each other oh like this is why this is this like okay we're literally helping and if we are cheating why am I the only one getting called out for it like it's not even like me and my friends were the only people in this class copying off each other or working together or cheating literally everyone was forming little groups and doing the exact same thing that we were doing so this wasn't even like a oh it was only us three doing this like oh my god we were scheming we were cheating how dare we it was literally the whole class but she only had a problem with me and would only pick me out and like it got to the point where I literally to this day I do not like computer science like anytime I'm like have to do something remotely computer science it gets me like it I don't know what the heck and not computer science like tech in general but like I mean like when it comes to coding cause like I do understand some concepts like literally do remember how to do some of the coding but the idea of like actually going through with it like just I can't like computer science at a point was literally my dream major that was the career like I wanted to do something with the computer science degree but I just at this point I can't I tried to back in college I tried to go back in computer science but all I could remember was how it felt like being in our class and being so degraded and feeling like I was not smart enough to really do anything like her the way she she would like treat me made me feel like I was not gonna be capable of doing anything with my life but like she it it ruined computer science for me and my god I do not wish that for anyone I do not why know why she had such a problem with me but oh my god oh and I literally just remembered I literally ended up dropping out of her class halfway through the semester because I could not deal with being around some a teacher like that like I don't understand like I literally do work with kids I work at a Kumon center and I know as much bad stigma there is around Kumon I don't I honestly don't feel like that's considered in my come on center because it's not that bad like my students literally love me and they always come in with happy smiles and I'm not just saying that like just to be like oh my god like whatever but I just don't understand like why a teacher of all people would like degrade someone so badly to the point where like it just pushes them out of the class like you're not helping you're making someone feel worse about themselves like to the point where like it it's such a big deal that I couldn't even make it like a career possibility because of how much it truly affected me like just her caused so much trauma for me like what do you what do you mean you're a teacher you're supposed to be teaching the next generation and like I know there is like a huge problem with students being so disrespectful but I wasn't one of those students so I don't understand why I was the one being picked on but anyways",

I couldn't find books that really supported the fact that being scared, being anxious is totally normal and actually it's our body trying to help us and tell us things. Um, this book is all about how to know your body and to trust yourself and to just really realise that everybody feels anxious, everybody has these big feelings. But it's not the end of the world. We are more than just our emotions. Everything goes to a good cause. So if you are interested in the worried dragon, please pick up up a copy from Amazon. If not, please go and support place to be there, a fantastic charity trying to do better for this generation. Coming up.",

    "voice_to_text": "I get the feeling from a lot of the questions I see surrounding what an English degree is that a lot of people don't really know what it's for and they take it to mean that it's for getting into publishing getting into being an author learning to write and those are all tangents of it let me explain the point of any Liberal arts degree whether it is English or history or any of those subjects is not necessarily to do that thing as a career in English you are learning to read critically you are learning to do some research on what you are reading critically you are learning how to structure arguments in essays and so what I mean by I think people have a misunderstanding is that these are degrees that help you to think they teach you ways to think and to ask questions and then you can go on and pursue future degrees based on that if you want or you are free to enter the workforce applying those skills I think one of the things that we have done irreparable damage to is the concept of a Liberal arts degree um you know for the last 40 years people have been saying get it going to stem get a stem degree get stem don't worry about the humanities and now we're wondering where did all these fascists come from but it's in the humanities that we learn to read argument to understand rhetoric to critically think to ask questions to find solutions that are not necessarily within the box and so if you are the kind of person who likes learning and likes going to school and you want to learn to write then you would probably pursue an MFA which is a Masters in Fine Art focused on creative writing that usually comes in the flavor of poetry or fiction however that is absolutely not required to be an author to get published um it's it's just not you there are many many very successful authors who have never gotten a terminal degree or sometimes even a college degree it's just not required but you will learn things in college that you're not going to learn necessarily unless you really seek it out things like history of literature and various styles various ways that we can analyze literature concepts like reader response theory and the lenses of feminism and Marxism um what have you the other great thing about getting a college degree in English is you're going to read a lot you're going to read a lot of books from a lot of different places using a lot of different theoretical lenses and just experiencing a lot of different writing without that you're not necessarily going to branch out that much unless you're a very driven person and want to but there is some value to doing this in a classroom setting and be involved in these discussions with other like minded people trying to understand and learn something and you know the right professor can really help you out with that now I I do wanna be clear I'm not saying this is the best path it is expensive it is exploitative in a lot of ways if you enter grad school your labor will very likely be exploited to teach classes but you're also going to learn a lot and a lot of what you learn is going to be how driven you are to continue pursuing it if it's not something you wanna pursue I cannot trust this enough don't do it if you wanna write the best advice is to get out there and write to sit down every day and write with intent or even if you can't write with intent just write anything just sitting down and writing that's what's going to be helpful but I think if we can kind of change the way that we think about an English degree a humanities degree to stop thinking about what what job can you get with an English degree and start thinking about what skill set are you building with an English degree because you're learning how to conduct research you're learning how to read critically you're learning how to problem solve you're learning how to read deeply into something see what makes it tick explain it find a solution for it if it needs one and that is something you can apply to literally any job ever",

And I'm probably gonna finish it today because I'm gonna get to third book cause action starts happening. But I'm at the park, as you could tell, if you know where that parts at where some shit just went down. And, um, Selena and Cal, how you say his name, capture the guard, aren't speaking terms after they were just, you know, on speaking terms. You know, I love this book so far more than this book. And the order I'm reading is the author's order. So after this book, I'm reading Assassin's Blade. And I really hope it doesn't ruin my journey through this series, cause everyone's telling me, should have read Assassin's Blade first, should read it first. And then someone's like, should have read it fourth. And someone's like, oh, I'm glad I read the author's order because I appreciate it more. And then there's like a different order to have a be romantic, more romantic. And there's a different order to have a be more action.

    "voice_to_text": "Booktok has got to be one of the least hospitable places on the entire internet the only reason I'm stitching his videos because he said that apparently people aren't tagging him um in their responses to his video um and so Andrew if you wanna respond to this go right ahead I literally there's no malicious intent behind this response um and same with your followers if they wanna be all up in my comments again don't care uh me and the block button are best friends uh but I just wanna touch on something that you mentioned in this video um specifically the part that I stitched where you said book talk using just that general phrase and then you proceed to say I'm not talking about all of book talk um I I genuinely don't understand why people feel the need to if they know this if they know that there's only certain parts of book talk that are toxic or full of keyboard warriors who have something to say about every little thing um they know that that part of book talk exist why come on here and then say Book Talk is this mean place book Talk is so not welcoming their blah blah blah blah x y z um because everything you said in this video uh people who make fun of cosplayers people who have something to say about a super popular series whether that be negative um because they choose to not support a problematic author which I don't even wanna response to that because your super detailed video was enough um and also there's people who read that series and they either hate it they love it they hate certain characters they love certain that that in itself is a divided group um so basically what I'm trying to say is that cause I've tried to record this like a bajillion times and I keep getting off track we know it's not all book talk because my book talk the one that I curated um and the people I see never causes this issue I never have this issue where people are flooding comments making fun of cosplayers because I don't do that people I follow don't do that um the people I support don't do that um and also I choose to make my page not supporting problematic authors um and the people I follow also do the same because I follow people who have the same morals and beliefs as me which causes my TikTok to not have this issue um and from the sounds of it it's it's a certain group because most of your examples that you mentioned I can tell what group of book talk that comes from um so that's what happens when you go and want to join Book Talk and you see those bright ass books and decide hey it's a popular series I'm gonna read it cause I don't have this issue and I read quite a few popular books and I also do negative reviews sometimes more brutal than what you've said and I still don't have this issue and also don't forget blog button exists um maybe try diversifying your reading the types of book you read um the types of authors you choose to support um but again nobody's holding a gun to your head and telling you not to read a certain author or not to read a certain series or whatever the whole point of this is to do whatever you wanna do but don't be mad when you put something on the internet and people have something to say about it just like how you have your opinion on certain books and you share them however you feel like you wanna share them people are gonna share theirs don't don't call it a not welcoming community because I've had nothing but the best experience on here and when I entered Book Talk um so hopefully all of that made sense um but yeah again not surprised that this is what you're experiencing um it's just that community and we said the same thing when we all got roasted by ESPN not all of book talk is like this but that loud side of book talk there's there's a crap ton of them over there um I don't see it because that's not on my page um but maybe you should try following other people that's my tip take it leave it toss this video in the trash who the fuckers",

But the stories we know are not the only stories to tell. There is another story, one that has been lost to the mists of time: the saga of the dark queen. This saga begins with Yafeu, a defiant yet fiercely compassionate young warrior who is stolen from her home in the flourishing Gh\u0101naian empire and taken to a distant kingdom in the North. There she is thrust into a strange, cold world of savage shield maidens, tyrannical rulers, and mysterious gods. And there she also finds something unexpected: a kindred spirit. She comes to serve Freydis, a shy princess who couldn\u2019t be more different from the confident and self-possessed Yafeu. But they both want the same thing: to forge their own fate. Yafeu inspires Freydis to dream of a future greater than the one that the king and queen have forced upon her. And with the princess at her side, Yafeu learns to navigate this new world and grows increasingly determined to become one of the legendary shield maidens\u2014to fight not only for her freedom but for the freedom of others. #fyp #fyp\u30b7 #book #booktok #booktokcommunity #willowsmith ",

His hands clamped on my waist, then moved, one going to cut my rear, the other sliding between us. This. This moment when it was him and me and nothing between our bodies. His tongue scraped the roof of my mouth as he dragged a finger down the center of me, and I gasped, my back arching. Fair, he said against my lips, my name like a prayer more devout than any Ian had offered up to the cauldron on that Dark Souls this morning. His tongue swept my mouth again, in time to the finger that he slipped inside of me. My hips undulated, demanding more, craving the fullness of him, and his growl reverberated in my chest as he added another finger. I moved on him, lightning lash through my veins, and my focus narrowed to his face.",

This is a really interesting question, and for the sake of this discussion I am going to talk about my Baker Street Legacy series. I just finished writing the last one and this series will be complete in August. Thr villain in the series, which I have to be careful so thatI don't give away spoilers.  He is the hero in his own story, which is often the case of villains. H believes he has the right to revenge and the right for restitution. And he is highly intelligent, but he is also highly mentally unstable. Delusional in some aspects. And that drives his vengeance and his retribution. He had a plan and that's the first book is the launching of that plan, and he did a very good job b cause he's very intelligent, he did a very good job. However, he did too good; too good of a job. I can't give away anything. But if he had succeeded at any point in the process in the series, if he had succeeded to do what he wanted to do, he would have left a man absolutely decimated and changed forever. And probably, I would imagine, had it worked would have turned him \u2014 for lack of a better phrase \u2014 to the dark side. He would have become a very very dark and dangerous reflection of who he was meant to be. There you go.",

But guys, you don't want to know how many books I have downloaded on Kindle Limited and searched see you Monday in trying to find this GD book. I can't find it. My best guess, I've received a tip that the author might have gotten banned and that would explain why it had doesn't show up in my library anymore. Like. Or my red. My books red. And I got a tip from someone else about who the band author might be, so I did reach out to her and ask if she has a book like that. But it would make sense cause I also remember reading something that was like so out of pocket. More than that. Like humanity wise out of pocket around the same time. And I wonder if it's like in the same series of novellas and Amazon was like girl, you gotta go. But the girlies love it apparently. And guys, guys, I don't judge anybody, so all I'm gonna tell you is that Kindle Unlimited is a beautiful melting pot of literature and whatever the fuck that kind of book is, okay? And all you have to do is search Mountain Man. Gem Aware has like a whole series. There's a book called Mountain Daddies Milk and honey. The possibilities are endless. Just search Mountain Man and you will find books very, very similar to that stuff.",

I wanted to share that the book series is by #JuliaQuinn and if anyone has yet to read her novels, chances are you are missing out. As an avid reader and fan of Miss Quinn\u2019s penmanship, the books are absolutely wonderful and absolutely romantic. Miss Rhimes did a beautiful job bringing them to life on-screen and spicing them up however they were Miss Quinn\u2019s creation and I think we all deserve to read the originals as they were written before the storylines were changed for television. Thank you, Queen \ud83d\udc51and I hope you don\u2019t mind the #stitch! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc  The reading list js below for those that haven\u2019t heard of them. \ud83d\udc97 Happy Reading! #fyp #fy #foryou #bridgerton #aboutbridgerton #booktok #booktokfyp #reply #stitchkindness #educationalpurposes #bridgertonscandal #simonanddaphne #thedukeandi #colinandpenelope #romancingmisterbridgerton #benedictandsophie #anofferfromagentleman #antonyandkate #theviscountwholovedme #eloiseandphillip #tosirphillipwithlove #francescaandmichael #whenhewaswicked #hyacinthandgareth #hyacinthbridgerton #itsinhiskiss #gregorybridgerton #gregoryandhermione  #onthewaytothewedding #ladywhistledown #ladywhistledownstrikesback #queencharlotte was not oart of the series however i am happy if was made because we get to see more of her and the king and her much needed friendship with #ladydanbury ",

Now on the other hand, here's a book that I bought just last week. This one, also a hardback, cost 30. A hardcover book should not cost $30."

And I have 16 titles and I'm concerned about like, how do I decide what to keep on hand cause I really think if you do a TikTok shop you have to be shipping it yourself because relying on dropshipment like IngramSpark, that's where a lot of people have trouble with that three day thing.

The box does come with both of the plushies, four bookmarks, the signed book, a couple extra little goodies that I have, um, that will go in there. I am just so grateful. I did end up hitting 500 pre orders, and I've already sold, um, 500. Almost 20 away from 500 books since I released a week early. Um, so all you gotta do is click on the other video, enter.

Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire it is not sufficient merely to say \u201cI want plenty of money\u201d be definite as to the amount (there is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter). Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire (there is no such reality as something for nothing.) Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once whether you are ready or not to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire name the time limit for its acquisition state what you intend to give in return for the money and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it Sixth. Read your written statement aloud twice daily once just before retiring at night and once after arising in the morning as you read see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money",

I worked at our relationship. I was patient. I forgave\u2014the thoughtless remarks, the disappointments, the test results when I was expecting our youngest that proved he hadn\u2019t been \u201cworking late.\u201d Then, when we finally made it to the altar, he looked deep into my eyes, smiled, and cracked a fat joke. That wasn\u2019t the worst of it. His vows weren\u2019t a promise to love. They were a final test of exactly what I\u2019d do to get his ring on my finger\u2014what I\u2019d take\u2014in front of family, friends, and their cell phones. Was I going to be internet famous? Another sad bride who must\u2019ve known the kind of man she was marrying? My two little girls stared up at me with big, round eyes. Was I really going to laugh it off like I always did? In that moment, my house of cards came crashing down. When the moment was over, for some reason, my best friend\u2019s older brother was on his feet with his chair knocked over like he was about to punch someone. This is the story of what happened next. Please check the author\u2019s note for specific content warnings. Standalone. No cheating. HEA guaranteed. Thoughts: \ud83d\udca1 This book broke my heart and put it back together again so many times. I loved Angie\u2019s determination and Brandon\u2019s whole cinnamon roll heart but rough around the edges blue collar vibe. The way these two pinned for each other but had so much respect for one another  and focused on building one another up was brilliant.  Gah! I swear I will read anything from Cate C Wells because she hits it out of the park with every new premise she tries. \u2728standalone Quote\ud83d\udcac I should be getting over it as it happens. That\u2019s how this relationship works. He steamrolls me. I peel myself off the floor and bounce right back into shape. One day, she\u2019ll see this, and she\u2019ll understand every word of it. They both will. They\u2019ll be ashamed of me. Like I\u2019m ashamed of myself. \u201cEveryone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect by the people who love them.\u201d \u201cAnd it is never too late to speak up for yourself.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t marry you,\u201d I say, forcing myself to look Tyler in his bright red face. \u201cI won\u2019t do this. No.\u201d \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f #spicybooks #books  #booksoftiktok  #booktok #bookrecs #bookreviews #kindleunlimited #kindleunlimitedromance #bestfriendsbrother #bestfriendsbrothertrope #bestfriendsbrotherromance #bluecollarmen #hurtcomfort #angstybooks #angstyromance #romancebooks #booktok #smuttok #steamytok #spicytok #steamybookrecs #spicybookrecs #kindleromance #kindleromancebooks #kindlespicybooks #catecwells #spon",

So basically, 14 years ago, I needed a prom date. And we met through friends of friends, and we went on a date, and the date was great, but I just wasn't really feeling it, which sounds awful to say now, but, like. And I don't think he really was, either. At least at the time, I didn't. Right? But I was like, hey, here's the situation. I really need a prom date. Can we just keep this thing going? And he was like, yeah. We just started hanging out, became friends, went to prom together. Prom was very romantic and lovey dovey, and things kind of changed that night for us. And then, like, a month later, he told me he loved me, and he loved me the entire time. So it was definitely a he falls first. And I was just like, oh, okay, let's try this. So we tried it, and 14 years later, two kids. I'm very happy, and he's still my best friend.",

tipo o cara claro tava\u2014 maravilha foi preso mas tipo ela ainda teve que sofrer as consequ\u00eancias sabe e tudo isso porque no v\u00eddeo dessa mo\u00e7a que eu coloquei no come\u00e7o muitos caras tavam na\u2013 nos coment\u00e1rios falando assim \"porque c\u00ea n\u00e3o chama a pol\u00edcia primeiro?\" \"porque voc\u00ea deixou esse cara andar como voc\u00ea?\" e tipo ela literalmente explicou porque ela deixou o cara andar com ela porque ela tava com medo de se ela falar \"n\u00e3o\" acontecesse alguma coisa com ela tipo claramente ia acontecer porque o cara se achou no direito de tipo  s\u00f3 porque ele andou e falou com ela ele tinha o direito de entrar e tomar alguma coisa dela e tamb\u00e9m s\u00f3 pra finalizar eu lembro de ter visto uma entrevista com um homem que escreveu um livro sobre como as mulheres deveriam aprender a falar  um livro que pelo que eu vi \u00e9 realmente muito interessante porque de fato quando a gente \u00e9 mulher a gente \u00e9 meio que ensinado a ser boazinha com as pessoas ent\u00e3o a gente ia ensinar a ser educado tipo se voc\u00ea ver um homem estranho falando bom dia tipo te olhando estranho voc\u00ea pra mim pelo menos \u00e9 tipo meio que natural falar bom dia tipo depois meio que pensar meu \"mas u\u00e9?\" e apesar desse ensinamento ser interessante tipo assim voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa ser educada com todo mundo voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa parar pra ajudar ningu\u00e9m nem nada disso voc\u00ea tem que aprender a tipo seguir em frente ignorar ou tipo negar sabe apesar de ser interessante nessa situa\u00e7\u00e3o por exemplo ela falou ela demonstrou que ela tava com medo da seguran\u00e7a dela ent\u00e3o ela n\u00e3o fez e \u00e9 isso que muitos homens n\u00e3o entendem porque muitos homens n\u00e3o passa disso passam por isso* porque \u00e9 um privil\u00e9gio muito grande que eu vejo muitas vezes na rua de homem andando com fone e andando mexendo no celular  e andando tipo descontra\u00eddo (despreocupado) porque eles n\u00e3o tem esse medo o pior medo que eles t\u00eam \u00e9 tipo ser assaltado mas a\u00ed c\u00ea t\u00e1 num bairro que ele sabe que n\u00e3o acontece, tudo bem mas tipo a gente n\u00e3o a gente tem que ter essa- voc\u00ea tem que t\u00e1 ligado aos seus arredores porque pode acontecer milh\u00f5es de coisas e \u00e9 isso urso \u00e9 a resposta certa",

Which makes this even weirder, too, because she used audio specifically from the first Harry Potter movie, where Harry Potter is only eleven. Furthermore, Daniel Radcliffe is a real, living human being. Imagine if you woke up one day and some stranger on the internet who you've never met decides to post that they got a tattoo of you depicted in that manner. That would be a little bit weird, wouldn't it? I don't care if it's fictional. There's real people involved in this. And you're still preying on the idea of putting a child in a compromising position like that? That's odd.",

THERE!! you're probably wondering what's in the bag let's take it back a little bit first sorry my voice is a little raspy I'm just getting over the flu so I was in sixth grade I had to read a book for class that traumatized me so bad that my mom actually had to come in and talk to my teacher and the principal and that book was Sadako in the Thousand Paper Cranes in case you're not familiar it's the story of a little girl in post World War 2 Japan who suffers radiation poisoning from the atomic bombs that we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and it's about her slowly passing of cancer in a hospital while she tries to fold 1,000 paper cranes because there's an ancient legend that the gods will cure a sickness or grant a wish or something to that effect if somebody folds 1,000 paper cranes so what made it more traumatizing was this is a true story like I'm supposed to just go to recess after I read the part when she finally stopped folding the cranes because her fingers were in so much pain that she just physically couldn't bend them to fold the paper anymore and I'm just supposed to go play like Foursquare so what's in the bag about 600 or so paper cranes that I folded between probably like sixth and eighth grade because they had us fold some because they do there's like a festival in Japan or something that they sent them off to and I just never stopped because I didn't know how to fugging process this book can't get rid of them no can't get rid of them I've held onto that bag for heccing 20 years because I didn't hit a thousand yet I can't get rid of them until I hit a thousand right y'all this book f'd me up",

Its not to say I didn\u2019t love my dad, cause I absolutely did, but those rough moments imprinted in my brain and kept me from really spending time with him when I got old enough to make my own decisions about our relationship.  #fyp #taylorswift #bbldrizzy #booktok #wwe #dysfunctionalfamily ",

Instead of shaming him and videotaping him and trying to embarrass him, how about you sit down with him and ask him why he does not want to be around you and your family? You said that he's old enough to make his decisions. But in the same breath you also said it had something to do with his mother. So which one is it? Is he old enough to make his own decision, or is he being influenced by his mother? I would say it's the former as opposed to the latter. You might wanna figure out why he doesn't wanna be around you and your family instead of throwing all of the materialistic things that you do for him. That doesn't make up for all of the lost time that you may not have or some of the things that he may need for you to pour into him. But by shaming him, is not gonna make him like you or wanna be around you anymore. In fact, it's going to make him not wanna talk to you. And then you're gonna wonder why when he becomes an adult, why he doesn't fuck with you as a man. Figure it out."

That's what I've been asking everyone on the pro watermelon content, and so many of you were kind enough to comment that I have enough to make a series out of it and hopefully help a few families. Now, we've actually talked about this family before, and they've made so, so, so, so much progress since then. But they still have quite a way to go since they're trying to rescue eight families. So let's do what we can to help them. Okay, if you click on the video, I just stitch it will take you to this page where you can learn about these families and you can find their gofundme link. If you are in a position to donate, please do whatever you can donate, no matter how little. It will go a long way and it will make a difference for these families. And if you're not in a position to donate, there's still a lot you can do. You can go to this family's page, give them a follow, interact with their content in any way. You can do whatever you can to spread their story, even if it is by making a video of your own. Evie said that her favourite is once upon a Broken Dream. I've heard very good things about that book. You have great taste. I is currently in a book slump. I stands for me because same girl, but they really like never let me go. By Kazoo Ishiguru. That's awesome for you! Someone said The Kite Runner! Once again, I love that they are now favourite books in this comment. It tells me good things about their fandom. I love BTS so much. What a great username. So that they don't have a favourite book, but they don't need it because honestly, I already love them. Thank you so much! If you're still with me, if I've entertained you in any way, please consider donating to these families. And if you can't donate right now, please do everything else that you can by sharing their page and interacting with their content and doing all those things. Let's do something good today, folks. Let's help them however we can. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "inferiority be italicist this is a tough one to answer and I'm gonna say sometimes if it's internal dialogue you're talking about then yes that should be in italics you can use quotation marks for that if you want but I think italicized looks better but the thing is interiority and internal dialogue share the like rectangle to square relationship internal dialogue is always interiority but not all interiority is internal dialogue interiority is more an expression of a character's feelings usually in a way where other characters would have to infer that information or pick up on the signs where it's not outright stated internal dialogue is among that because other characters wouldn't be able to hear their thoughts unless it's a whole telepathy thing but that's very specific and this is generally done through the body language of the character or through just the narrations themselves or just adding the voice of the character to that narration it can be something as simple as the POV character pulling their hand away when someone's hand gets too close to show that they're uncomfortable with them or here's an example of injecting character voice into a line of narration a little bit of a character opinion in this example Janet would probably be the POV character and neither of these are things you wanna put into italics because that would be super weird looking interiority is such an important aspect of storytelling of writing and I've really only just scratched the surface of it but internal dialogue really only makes up a small percentage of that and that's the only percentage I would recommend putting into italics I hope someone out there finds this helpful happy writing",

    "voice_to_text": "What are your plans for your writing future? So my most immediate plan is to get \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019 published. It\u2019s still in the developmental edit which is taking longer than I thought however it is a developmental edit of a book. I don't think\u2026 I I gave myself two months to get it done and that's really far too little time but it's okay we're still on track for my planned release date at the moment which is\u2026 I don't wanna say it just in case I don't meet the deadline cause that's just a bit embarrassing but I am aiming for end of October but before Halloween so make of that what you will. The good thing is though is once the developmental edit is done then I can send off to be proofread by someone I know and then once I've got that back then I can format it and then I can put it for pre order which I want to do maybe a month out but it depends on how I do it with Draft2Digital so fingers crossed! The other plan I have in the more immediate future is to continue working on the first draft of my new romance novel. I started it two and a half weeks ago and I've written most days except for when I had that horrible migraine. I couldn't look at a screen let alone write so yeah but I I've written pretty much every day even if it's only you know a few sentences. I'm on Chapter 7 at the moment so that's pretty exciting. It's it involves a character that I've had in my head for like nearly 20 years. I just haven't found the right story for her and I finally have this story and it just feels right this time. So yay! I'm hoping to have that one out next year. I'm hoping. It wouldn't be like you know Valentine's Day but it would be probably around October time but it it does depend on how I crack on with the book and how quickly I can turn it around. After that? Well I'm not 100% sure. So with the romance book I just mentioned I do wanna make that a series however I don't wanna not work on other things whilst I'm working on that series if that makes sense. So it it does depend. In my head all I can think of right now for the series is release a book every two years but I don't know for definite yet so we'll we'll we'll have to see and yeah those are my future plans for my writing at the moment. Obviously this isn't accounting for any more ideas I might have crack into my head but no one can see truly into the future so you know let's just see how it goes, eh?",

Tiktoker and professional interpreter, Amalia  makes a really good point! a lot of what's seen as rudeness in New Yorkers  is actually consideration New York City is densely populated  despite close quarters New Yorkers wanna respect your personal space and, yes, smiling at or making eye contact with a stranger does break the bubble  of his personal space now Amalia also points out  what's a fairly typical scenario in New York when a traveler will ask subway patrons  if they know where such and such a stop is at which point New Yorkers will readily break their bubble to offer what assistance and directions they can As soon as that aid is rendered, however, the invisible wall goes back up and people revert to respecting each other's bubbles interestingly British author Ben Coates in his book, Why the Dutch are Different among many other factors he will point to population density in The Netherlands to account for both Dutch tolerance  for a pretty wide range of difference but also a brutal directness  that is often shocking to say a British or American visitor and the Dutch, of course  as the founders of New Amsterdam apparently still have  a profound influence on the city's personality",

(one of my mutuals was actually abducted by 12 \ud83d\ude22) the person I'm stitching runs I think a publishing business? and one of their major funders pulled half a million dollars because of their stance on Palestine. so of course our priority as far as fundraising goes is making sure that we have money for OOB, and making sure that we have money for e-sims, and making sure we have money for mutual aim - I believe those things to collectively be our immediate concerns - and if we don't have extra money to spend, making sure that we're really tight on our boycotting and our divesting. but I would also encourage us to look around and see which businesses are actively supporting the liberation of Palestine. find them and follow them. not only do I believe in our ability to take care of each other as this movement advances, I also believe that it is imperative to do so. so if you are a pro Palestinian small business, please let me know so that I can follow you.  I would love to see what you do and I would love to support you! and to everybody else, make sure to look through the comments to see who else is there and to see who you could be following as well.",

So if you want to go back and watch my previous video, I'm going to try not to cry on this one, but I am feeling a little bit more hopeful today. Uh, we had an appointment with the fertility specialist, and on the way to the appointment, I got to see a rainbow. And then I actually got some news at the doctor that was actually good news. Um, so we're starting a medicated cycle this month with letrozole. But like I said, my. In my previous video, my insurance does not cover it. So pretty much every time I go to the doctor and I have to go back, I have to go twice a month. I have to pay like three to 4 hundred dollars. So that's fun. A lot of people suggested to start a good gofundme account, so I did that, and the schmink is in my shmio. It's there. And I just wanted to say that no one is like, I'm not begging you to donate, but if you do, I appreciate it and my husband appreciates it very much. I am not a person that asks for help, but I know how, like I. As I was going through all those comments and well wishes, honestly, if I go through them, I will cry. And I just appreciate all the support. And I said I was Gonna cry. But I'm so grateful for this community, and I honestly, I don't know what I would do without you guys. You are the best. And I thank you for all the prayers and all the good vibes set my way, because I am starting to feel a little bit more hopeful and a little bit better and heard because I don't feel so alone anymore. Because so many people go through this. And there I go crying. But thank you so much for watching this video and watching the first video. Um, and like I said, the link is there. It looks like this if you wanna go check that out.",

Um, but my two are Dalinar and Iroh. Right. Because they were both horrible warlords that committed war crimes and just went conquering city after city brutally during the war, until they both had something traumatic happened to them where they lost someone important to them, had to rethink their life and turn their entire lifestyle around. Yeah, they went about it in different ways. Um, but the result is the same. We now have two elderly men who are way overpowered but refused to use their power in the ways that the people around them think they should, instead going about trying to bring people together and unite them. And also, if they were in Star Wars, both of them would have white lightsabers, and those sabers would be their very own red lightsabers from when they were Sith. I'm not taking any opinions on that.",

She gives off very judgemental feminist in that she doesn't understand why people would want to get married rather than saying okay, the whole point is that we should all have choices, no? As long as it's not the choice she wants. Oh, you can go jump into a ditch. And I still maintain. Although again, I am going to watch just to make sure, like, you know, my mind hasn't changed. I still maintain the fact that she enjoyed Lady Whistle Down until it was about her, until she was no longer entertained. And that disturbed me just a little bit. And like, yeah, I was kind of on the fence with people. Like, she was a bad friend even before she discovered the whole Lady Whistle Down thing, but seeing her act like that to Cressida this season, make jokes about her problems or make light about her problems, I was like, bro, you are kind of shitty.

    "voice_to_text": "absolutely within a reviewers rights to publish their review so that's a great video breaking down the issues that currently are happening right now with some indie authors and reviewers where um their they're putting expectations on reviewers that are unrealistic and not professional and are definitely out of the norm so definitely go back and watch that video to get context but what I wanna talk about is what I think is a social um societal route to what's causing these misunderstandings and these expectations often when this happens and I think this is like the third time that this particular conflict has occurred on TikTok in like this year uh often when these kind of conflicts happen because they happen in fandom I see them on other social media platforms they happen in other communities where there is an expectation that actually isn't necessarily professional or reasonable but there is a great deal of backlash against not fulfilling that expectation of like why aren't you like that seems reasonable why can't you just do that and often the communities in which this kind of reaction in this hub of this happening is dominated by white women um but I do think it's a phenomena that comes from like the expectation and training the one receives to be a woman and to align with the concept of what women are supposed to be and that is that women should be of service women should prioritize other people's needs above their own that's where you get the expectations of strangers wanting you to smile because the expectation is that women should be putting other people at ease and comforting others and being there for other people whether they know them or not whether they're co workers or friends that's just a thing you're supposed to do that's the whole caretaker role one thing that we don't talk enough about is how on being conditioned in that way you also internalize the expectation that other women are supposed to do that for you and that they should know and they should prioritize you because you're a woman and they're a woman and they should know how hard it is for you so they should definitely go the extra mouths so should you right what that actually is that is not women supporting women that's why that term has essentially become like misogynistic and its use that is women policing other women women women when they see other women not conforming to those expectations of women we behavior of being supportive of being there for you of doing going the extra mile especially for other women that is policing them because they're not being the right kind of woman and it may not be verbalised in that way like I said like that's how we get a lot of feminism being uh flipped around and used as misogynistic you know beating sticks to punish women for not being uh uh an ideal of women that doesn't exist and is is sexist often a way that it manifests is an inability to have healthy boundaries between the types of relationships that women have with each other and other people like that healthy boundary of I don't need to perform for a stranger cause I don't know them no right this is why um in even a professional like office settings you will find women struggle to like separate or have a healthy understanding of a boundary between a co worker or peer or a colleague and a friend I when I sit down and I think about it it is very rare when I am talking to a woman for her to ever refer to co workers as co workers rather than friends or enemies that is by design because if we don't have an ability to draw healthy boundaries then we aren't as exploitable right then people can't expect us to always serve them and to be nice and polite to them and to be pleasant and not to be rude and not to draw boundaries ourselves and tell them to stop doing things that are absolutely unprofessional and inappropriate within any situation be it personal be it strangers be it even familial right that is how patriarchy and white supremacy break us down and make us incapable of being able to protect ourselves or support each other in a real meaningful way and that is the lifeblood of Mlms so much about how MLM's (Multi Level Marketing) work is about violating the boundaries between what is a friendship and a professional relationship like Hey Girl that whole thing is constructed on monetizing women's relationships by using their connections and their expectations of friendship and of performative women womanhood as a way to make money and to pray on each other if women don't have those types of friendships or relationships or didn't have the ability to cross lines between professional relationships distance acquaintance distant acquaintances or different you know distant familiar relationships in order to exploit those relationships to monetize them MLM\u2019s wouldn't work the way they do and sadly that's a big part of how like a lot of social media works too because so much of how it is been marketed especially using as a marketing tool is to break down that that barrier between the person on the screen and the person watching the screen and to create an artificial sense of an a more intimate relationship than what actually exists no I'm not saying everybody on social media is fake what I'm saying is that so much about how all of this is presented and definitely used as a marketing tool is to cross that line and to assume that there is nothing beyond this that I am giving you the 100% me and this is part of how and it's part of why we struggle to understand that there is a boundary between a performer like an actor or celebrity and their personal life and that they get to have a life that isn't something that we're part of and that we don't need to know everything about and that that is what a boundary is like I don't need to know that whatever celebrity is pregnant or having a baby oh it's interesting if they wanna share that fine but I don't need to know what they look like when they go to get their Dunkin Donuts I don't need to know eh I don't need to know about their sexual proclivities I don't need to know that about YouTube personalities I don't need to know these things I don't need to know that about my coworkers I don't need to know those things but again because women are taught to not have boundaries around those things there it is a difficulty within these professional interactions and relationships to not see the professional's personal and by connecting our livelihoods to that interaction it is much easier to see something that is just a professional thing that you do that it is you know just seeing something like not liking your book isn't saying you're a bad person I am not personally 100% the person who was stomping out your dreams and taking food out of your children's mouths if I gave your book a two stars that's not how that works but it is much easier to look at another woman and say she's the reason that I can't do what I need to do she's the reason that I'm not succeeding and that is by design like I don't have a great way to round this up other than to say to start looking at your relationships that you have with colleagues and peers and to think about where is the boundary between friendship and professional relationship and if you have not drawn a boundary there like if you have if you are constantly flipping from like personal conversations about your life and then about financial exchanges and what not you may need to start creating those boundaries to safeguard yourself and also to safeguard them as well if you found anything that I said useful or informative uh please consider going over to uh my friend Spencer's page and uh donating to get a family out of Rafah and uh and also support Operation Olive Branch Free Palestine"

Do you know what I think, Potter? I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you think, Potter?\u201d \u201cI\u2026. I don't agree, sir.\u201d Mind you he almost \ud83d\udc80 Malfoy okay? So remember that He almost \ud83d\udc80 another student he's getting detention of all things he's getting detention and he still doesn't believe that he should be getting detention okay let's keep going \u201cWell, we shall see how you feel after your detentions. 10:00 Saturday morning, Potter. My office.\u201d \u201cBut sir! \u201cQuidditch!\u201d Harry you almost \ud83d\udc80 someone and you're worried about Quidditch? And then everyone in her comment section was mentioning that scene  where Snape is teaching everyone non-verbal spells so he was teaching them how to protect themselves without using their wands and that scene is funny so let's let's continue let's continue okay so backstory Harry and Ron as always are partnered with each other and they're struggling Snape sees, he walks over to them and enters  this scene: \u201cPathetic Weasley. Here, let me show you.\u201d He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively All thought of non-verbal spells forgotten he yelled \u201cProtego!\u201d His shield charm was so strong Snape was knocked off balance and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself up scowling. \u201cDo you remember me telling you we are practicing non-verbal spells, Potter?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Harry stiffly \u201cYes, SIR.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no need to call me \u2018sir,\u2019 Professor.\u201d book Harry is superior movie Harry could never and that's why book Harry is my favourite character in Harry Potter I love him",

We've actually talked about this family before, and they've made so, so, so much progress. But they still need a little bit more help. So let's do what we can to help them. Okay, if you click on the video I just stitched, it will take you to our reaches page where you can learn about their story and you can find their gofundme link. If you are in a position to donate, please do. Let's help this wonderful family get to safety. And if you aren't in a position to donate, there's still a lot you can do. You can still go to a riches page, give them a follow, interact with their content in any way you can. Whatever you can do to make sure that he reaches the most amount of ice, do it, even if it is making a video of your own. Irena said stand by far. I am not the biggest Stephen King fan, but I read and love that book so much as well. And then what happened happened and it was twice as terrifying. But great book. Sagittarius said that they don't read a lot of books and asked for Rex. Well, sadly it Became too close to our reality, but how I live now by Meg Rozoff is one of my favourite reads ever. That book is my Roman Empire. I think about it constantly. Abida replied A thousand splendid sons. Another favourite in this comments. Love the consistency. The first quick trolls fan! What a username! My friend said how to train your Dragon series and that they think the 7th book is their fave. Love that for you and thank you so much for commenting! Thank you so much! If you're still with me, if I've entertained you in any way, please consider donating to these families. Gofundme. They desperately need our help and anything that you can give, it will go a long way. So let's do something good today, folks, alright? Let's help this family."

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me about your writing journey. I guess I should start from the beginning cause this is actually a shockingly long story. Bear with me. I should preface this by saying that writing runs in my family. My great grandmother so my mum's maternal grandmother she wrote like poetry and stuff I think. And then my mum herself she's a published poet in her own right. She has\u2026 how many poetry collections? She's up like six or seven poetry collections out now and also she published a young adult novel called \u2018Dart\u2019 which is basically about Dartmoor during the Black Death which is actually really fascinating and not gonna lie. I'm not just saying that. She's my mum. I'm just saying if you see \u2018Dart\u2019 by Deborah Harvey you should pick it up. It wasn't necessarily guaranteed that I would turn to writing especially as when you consider what I've just said. You could have said \u201cOh! That's gonna skip generations maybe the next generations of your family will be writers\u201d but no that's not what happened which is you know interesting. I better start from the beginning of my writing journey then. So my journey starts when I'm 7 I was in year three at primary school and we had been given a creative writing homework. It was essentially just to write a story of a certain I think of a certain word count but I'm not 100% sure on that. The most people told us I'd have a clear beginning, a clear middle, and a clear end. Alright! That works for a 7 year old. I did it. I don't remember too much about what actually happens in the story. In fact I don't remember at all. All I remember is that I'm pretty sure dragon was in it and there was some princesses who weren't like damsels in distress cause clearly I had some feminist energy in me when I was 7. Ha ha! I hand it in. I don't think too much of it until my teacher turned around and said that she'd liked it and she thought I could do this more often. I was like \u201cWhat\u201d and then I was like \u201cOkay\u201d cause I had enjoyed the process. I had actually enjoyed writing the story even at that age even though it was homework which I didn't like doing too much. So yeah it was really fascinating From there we jump till I was about 11. Now I'm moved on from writing short stories to plays. At this point I was in year six at primary school at this point and we were doing like I think it was towards the end of the year or maybe the middle of the year? I can't remember but we were doing a play and like a big play and there were the play was in segments. So each sort of group of between years three to six had had their own little segment and it would have like a theme and all that stuff. I thought that ours sucked. I'll be honest and that was unusual of me cause I was thought that would sort of just go with it and all the rest of it but I somehow developed the notion of \u201cOh I should tell my head head teacher this.\u201d So I did and shockingly to me, even to this day, she let me rewrite our entire segment and used it in the play! She let the 11 year old rewrite the play! How weird is that? But yes, we move on from primary school to secondary school and that was a terrible time in my life. Namely because I was bullied for just like everything from the jump and I mean everything. I'm not gonna go into all the details right now but cause that's it that's a story in of itself. So yeah I ended up being very lonely and quite isolated at points and it was a real struggle. I'll be honest. So one of my main comforts was writing. I loved to write little stories but mostly plays and mostly dramas and it was it was a lot of fun for me. To the extent that I didn't wanna do my homework. Sorry Mum. Sorry Dad. Ha ha ha! I then ended up moving on to film scripts when I was about 16/ 17 because I started studying film studies at A-level which I really enjoyed for the most part cause I think film and TV and all the rest\u2026 all those mediums can be so transformative when they're good and they can really speak to people. They can change people's lives and I think for the better sometimes. Not always but most of the time it's for the better. I think I then continue\u2026 yeah\u2026 I continue doing that for quite a long time even when I dropped out of film school at university twice which is so embarrassing. Yeah I dropped out of university twice from university that I don't think even exist anymore. So make a fact what you will and then in my 20s I wrote but not a huge amount purely because I was going through a lot in my early 20s on top of everything I went through like with school and everything else and then I spent a lot of my 20s trying to process that stuff so that I can actually live a productive life and I\u2026 so that I could get through without all the trauma being constantly on my brain. Then I got to about 30/31 and I thought to myself: \u201cYou know, no one's ever gonna see these films I'm writing and this is just really depressing. What the hell am I going to do?\u201d And then it occurred to me \u201cWait a minute. What if I turned it into a book? And then maybe people would actually like read it and then maybe someone, if it got really popular somehow, it would turn into a film on its own. Great!\u201d So now we're here. I'm 34 I have one book out there called \u2018To Love At Comic Con.\u2019 I am working on the developmental edit for \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019 which I'm hoping will be out towards the end of October and I'm on the first draft of the book after that which has a character in it that I've been trying to develop since I was 15. This has been with me for nearly 20 years! So yeah that's my writing story or more specifically: How did Jenn become a writer? If you enjoyed that then you should stick around. Maybe follow me a little bit because I do enjoy doing these little sort of you know story time videos. They are quite fun.",

The first is the first book I ever wrote, the second is the first book I ever wrote with true intention of being published. Neither of which are published. The first one, I was about 15 when I wrote it, and I first wrote it handwriting and then I typed it on a manual huge Smith Corona tech writer with the ribbon and everything. It was a fantasy romance, and I suppose in today's standards it would probably be like YA cause I was YA. It also had a very distinct Christian fantasy undertone because I was raised in the church and so that's what I was doing. It was called Calpernia. I had ideas for future books. it was about a stolen kingdom and an unknown princess and the power to be to fulfill her destiny. It will never be published because I just don't think that way anymore and and I don't write fantasy. I was very into fantasy when I was a kid, and I just haven't had that pull since I'm in it, that's all. The second is called,  currently called Grey Clouds and this is the book that I wrote with the intention of hopefully being published with it. And this is the book that got me an agent, and this is the book that almost had a movie deal, and this is a book that I think is absolutely horrible. So, you know it was a contemporary romance. It\u2019s  it's not a terrible idea and I may try to rehash the story eventually, but it's not on my radar anytime soon. Like, I wouldn't I wouldn't try to redo anything; I would just start fresh and and go from there. But that was the first one that I wrote with the idea of potentially being published with it. And again, never got that far. Supposedly \u2014 according to my agent \u2014 supposedly almost had a movie deal, I don't know. I fired the agent, so take that as well. Anyway, that's my story.",

I do like it overall as a story, but she mentioned specifically stylistic issues and I would agree with that. There are number of stylistic issues in the book That said... as someone who has contributed to a peer-reviewed book of essays on Dune scholarly essays I do feel the need to defend myself just a little bit. Here's the thing I it's totally fine I'm not here to yuck anyone's yum or yum anyone's yuck, but I do think that there's a tendency in academia to kind of needle at something and say here's why this thing is wrong, here's why I don't like it, here's why it's bad even. And I'm not saying that she did all of those things, she just said why she liked it and that's fine there's a long standing academic tradition of kind of these literary takedowns of works, ideas, authors, whatever it might be what I like to see just personally is when someone can go and look at something and say you know that really wasn't for me I really didn't like it and I do think there's some problems with it let me take a look at it anyway to kind of see why other people seem to react to it why other people seem to engage with it and why other people seem to draw some sort of meaning from it because whether you like it or not Dune has had a cultural impact on us in many ways and has have many other works so that's just for me personally I would challenge anyone who kind of looks at a book or looks at something that they don't like to really kind of dig into why other people do like it or what value other people see in it and I think a lot of times you might find that people will often acknowledge some of the flaws in there but say yeah you know but I liked it anyway and here's why I liked it and maybe you can just pick up some thoughts on why that is I totally get if people are coming at you yelling at you like you don't understand you don't this and that that's a turn off and nobody wants to hear that also the assumption of people who look like me that you just didn't understand it because you didn't like it um is rampant out there I've experienced it even myself as a as a fellow white male so I definitely will say that I I understand why that might turn you off as well all that to say just I think when you're kind of talking about something academically it's it's much better to kind of approach it from a let's investigate what's really going on here and uh where in its badness consists of steal a phrase from Dr. Corey Olsen and and really look at what the root of you know what it could be what it's trying to say and why there are people who associate with something and then you know kind of take it from there",

We didn't have to drink from the hose, per se, because we were home alone and we could stay home all we wanted to. So we could drink from the hose if we were outside, didn't want to come in. But pretty much we stayed at home alone and watched all my children. One life to live. And if we didn't really wanna watch your hospital, we would ride, like, our bicycles, like, five miles. I'm literally five miles to the city swimming pool to swim. After the second grade, I remember I've always been a library nerd. Draw my book, talk friends, you know? This was, um, so 1972, 73, 74, somewhere like that. I walked to the library, and it was a good walk, and it was a walk through town on busy streets. I was just finished the second grade, and I walked all the way across town to the library. That's your Gen X kids. That's what we did. We were feral. We did what we wanted to. We ran the neighborhood. We watch soap operas. We went swimming after. We rode our Bikes to swimming pool. If we wanted to go. My mom was at work. We rode our bikes. That's Gen X. That's why we're so cool. You think I would have let my kids do that? No way. That's why they're not as cool as we are.",

They're not happy with it. Yes, it. It may sound nice, but in the end, it's not great for your book. So, for example, if you have Stephen King fairy tale, great book. If you have a quality cover book, it should have a space between it, should not be glued, so you don't need to break it. There's no. There's no need to break the spine of that book. And if you have a paperback, for example, um, this way, just wiggle it back and forth. You can read perfectly fine without big breaking or even denting it. So please take better care of your books for yourself and for the good of book talk."

    "voice_to_text": "So of course you know, I have to use my book series as an example to answer this question So of course, starting from the top, you see Louise, then Trina, Sarai, and Rachelle Now of course if you read my books, you are already introduced to Rachelle, Sarai, and Louise in the first book But Trina, who's in orange on this cover, she's introduced in book 2. So, of course with Rachelle's situation in the first book, she had low self-esteem, because she had gotten out of a very toxic and emotionally @busive relationship with her ex  so she had to regain her self confidence, and through that she learned to embrace her sensuality, because one of the things she had to constantly deal with was sl\u00fbt shaming because she was a pinup model and she did boudoir modeling so she was shamed for that But when she meets her new love interest, who is a photographer, he gave her the courage to step outside of her comfort zone, and she started doing full n00d shoots So she fully embraced her sensuality and her sexuality, in a society that shames you for doing that, and I think that's a true show of strength Now with Sarai, Rachelle's best friend, her struggle in the first book was the fact that she was the \"black sheep\" of her family She was goth, she listened to heavy metal she was a horror enthusiast, she was an aspiring horror author, she was bisexual, and her family, aside from her father, looked down on her for that because they were a conservative Baptist family Like the only person in that family who truly accepted her was her father But when she got deeper into her spiritual practice, and discovered the powers she didn't know that she had, it gave her the courage and the confidence to embrace who she was unapologetically And when you get to the climatic scene later in the book where she stands up to her @busive relatives, she's not afraid to say that she's a Witch She's no longer afraid to say that because it's part of who she is, and she was no longer going to be ashamed of that, and that is it takes a really strong person to do that In a society that wants to put you in the box that that wants to tell you who you should be to unapologetically just say \"This is who I am\", it takes a really strong person to do that Now when we introduce Louise, she's already a strong character She comes from several generations of magical practitioners and root workers and she's kind of a mentor to the other characters, because it's through her and her family that Rachelle and Sarai learn how to hone their abilities But it's mentioned in the second book she wasn't always like that Her powers didn't show until her late teens, and she dealt with intense bullying throughout her adolescence So she wasn't always powerful She had to unlock that power And I truly believe her power comes from not just her supernatural abilities, but the fact that she's able to help empower other people I feel that's where her true strength comes from So then we have Trina, who's introduced in Book 2 Trina is a transgender woman, and when she's first introduced she's in a dangerous situation where if Louise had not intervened, Trina would have been unalived Trina was living on the streets, because her egg donor kicked her out and disowned her, because she refused to accept Trina So Louise and her family opened their home to her and you know they let her stay at their house She's immediately welcomed into the friend group with open arms They love and accept her for who she is She even goes to an anime convention with them and they got her to cosplay with them And Trina is an aspiring fashion model and through Louise and their friends' support, Trina is able to achieve that goal She's able to achieve her goal of being a fashion model And when she encounters her egg donor later in the book, she gets the strength and the courage to stand up to her And not only does she stand up to her and tell her about herself, she also cuts her off she disowns her in the end And I will say this: I have nothing but love and admiration for the trans community because it takes true courage and strength in this society to live your truth in a society that wants them to not exist it takes true courage to just be who you are in a society that hates you so hopefully that answers that question And for those that are interested and wanna know where they can get the books, you can go to my linktr.ee which is in my bio I have physical copies on Etsy I have a limited amount but if you get them through my Etsy shop I will personally autograph them you can also get the books on Amazon you can also get them directly from my publishers website which is also on my linktr.ee",

    "voice_to_text": "What is the best way to do audiobooks? Do you use your apple books or do you use audibles? In my opinion, there's not a quick and easy answer to this because it depends on several things. Where you live, how often you listen to audiobooks, what kind of audiobooks you wanna listen to, and how much you wanna spend. The cheapest way, if you live within the United States, is to get a library card and borrow audiobooks through Libby and hoopla. The downside of this is sometimes there are a lot of long waits, especially if it's a newer release book. And it's gonna be harder to find a lot of indie authors this way because a lot of them will choose to go audible exclusive. So you will not be able to get these through your library. And because of that, I think an audible subscription is really valuable for a lot of people. You can pay the lowest tier just to have the audible plus catalogue. That's not gonna be every audiobook, but that's going to be a lot of them. And you had unlimited listens and you're just borrowing through audible. But that's like $8 a month. If you want to add a credit onto that, which is probably their most popular plan, it's gonna be about $15 a month. You have access to that audible plus catalog, plus you get one credit a month that you can use to purchase any audiobook that you want. And you keep that forever. If you like to read e books as well, Kindle Unlimited is an excellent option because you pay the monthly subscription for that. But then you can borrow ebooks and get a discount on the audio. Sometimes there are sales going on with those. You can get them as cheap as $2 or up to about seven dollars and fifty cents. They also have their own catalog of read and listen for free. So these are audiobooks that are just included with your Kindle Unlimited subscription? But I do the borrow the ebook and then buy the audio for a discounted price a lot. There are many more subscription services, but you can also just buy the audiobooks outright. Many authors will sell them directly through their websites, or you can go through a website like chirp to purchase without any subscription at all. If you have any other questions, let me know. If I don't know the answer, I will definitely help you find it."

    "voice_to_text": "okay y'all I finished reading and I'm gonna give it a 3.5 out of five I actually really did enjoy the two main characters Josie and Alex I thought both of them had characteristics that make them complex and there were times where I was like I'm not sure if like you know this narrator is being dependable right now like if we're getting the full truth um and I always love books that make me question whatever it is that I'm reading I also loved the way that it was written it was written as if we're like watching a Netflix documentary and then like the events are unfolding in between there's like interviews and there's like past events it's sort of like a it's not a constant time jump but there is a time jump between like when this event happens and when the Netflix series is being like you know recorded I thought that aspect of the book check it love it I wanna read more like that my biggest issue with this book I don't know if this is like a spoiler or not moderate spoiler up ahead both of the husbands of these two main characters are shitty people like Josie met her husband when she was 13 and he was 41 and he was dating her mother and then when they turned when she turned 16 they had sex and when she turned 18 they got married like a full on pedophile and yet somehow we're being fed that you know he even though he was a terrible man and a terrible husband you know he was still a good father and I don't understand why we need these redeeming qualities about this man who groomed and abused his wife like it was sexual abuse from the beginning and then Alex's husband is a drunk who will go on vendors and not come home at night and always had these excuses and we're also made to kind of seem like well you know he's a good person because he didn't cheat on his wife and he still loved her and would talk about her all the time even though he was drunk and leaving her at home with their two kids what do we need this for why are we trying to get these redeeming stories for these men who are clearly terrible people so yeah those are my overall like issues which are huge issues with the book and this is why I'm rating it like you know just a 3.5 and not like a 4 or a 5 star because the story has potential it's so good I thought it was beautifully written um I love the characters I just didn't really like that aspect like I could have done without it I also heard that the audiobook for this story go crazy like it's a full cast audiobook and I am very interested in hearing that so I think I will still check out the audiobook",

See, I just counted all of my unread books yesterday, um, which is 96 books. And then I have a couple of pre orders coming in with, uh, within the next couple of weeks. So let's say that we're at roughly 100 and read books on my physical TBR. There's also many, many more on my ebook reader, but we don't talk about that. Um, so I read 45 books last year, but in May 2023, I was at 20 books, and in May 2024, I am currently on my 30th book. So I'm 10 books ahead of where was last year. And I also had a quite a big reading slump last June and last October. I'd say I will definitely reach my reading goal of 50 books this year, but I might even go above that and maybe 60. That would be cool. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. But going from that, um, and I have 100 books and 60 books this year. So a little less than two years. Ha ha ha. And I don't think that is that bad, but it because I'm also like a mood reader. I have multiple genres, I have multiple series on there. Um, so I think that is not that bad. It could be a lot worse. So, yeah, a little less than two years. Is that Bad",

I don't think so either anyway so the plan is to publish this in September and I'm kind of working through edits a little bit as I'm working on finishing my science fiction um novel that's coming out in almost a month exactly and I still have yet to finish writing it ah thank goodness for self publishing right except they still have to do all the editing and beta reading but yay for romance I'm excited about this one coming out this will be book eleven that comes out that I published like in total if it comes out in September so that's crazy to me and it'll be the fourth book that I published this year which is also really exciting if you're interested in this there's more um of my writing style um coming out on May 31st so in 10 days um I'm publishing through um a publisher called Gold Dust Publishing and uh it's called the Ancient Wonder Series book one is called The Sword's Secret and I'm very excited about that and um it's available for pre order there's a shmink in my schmio can I say bio?

As a mother, I get being child free by choice, and I love that for you, that is your choice. That's amazing. Like, live your damn life. Perfect. What I don't love is the mom shaming and the baby shaming that is this video. Like, how do you. I'm, like, at a loss for words, honestly, because this video just confirmed my worst nightmare. Okay? Like, babies throwing tantrums is going. It's gonna happen. Okay? They're little humans trying to learn these big feelings that they're feeling all of a sudden. And as a parent, the high anxiety parent at that, thankfully, thank the Lord. My son is so great in public 99% of the time, but that 1% that he is not. My anxiety is already up here, and I feel bad. I feel awful. I feel like I'm failing as a mom and that everyone is annoyed around me, but I'm also trying to give my kid Grace at the same time, and I'm worried that this exact thing is happening, but to my kid. I know that's not my kid in that video, but I feel so bad for not only that mother, but that baby that you chose to make a video about and post it for the world to see. That mom was already having A hard time? And imagine if she's scrolling through her TikTok page and sees that you're calling her baby a nightmare when she's already having a hard time. Not only that, but you don't have all of the facts. That kid could be on the spectrum, and that's okay. But not only that, but you're at an aquarium. Okay, an aquarium which is baby friendly. If you don't like kids, that is fine. That is your prerogative. But don't go to places that are baby friendly and then make videos like this. And mom shame and just all around. Like, what were you thinking? I just wanna know, like, what did you get out of posting this video other than confirming mine? And I'm sure whoever else, if their parent sees this video, you're confirming their worst nightmare. So I hope that's worth the laugh for you. I just. This is not my normal content. But like, how are you about to market yourself as an author? And while doing so, you're also mom shaming and baby shaming. Like, can you just explain that to me? Like.",

Our bills for the month come to like 8 800 pound a month. So we're able to save. We have a nice little savings account.

That's what I've been asking everyone on the pro watermelon content and so many of you are kind enough to comment that I have enough to make a series out of it and hopefully help a few people. We've actually talked about this family before and they've made a lot of progress since then, but they still have quite a way to go and we can help them achieve their goal. If you click on the video I just stitched, it will take you to this page where you can learn about this family and you can find their gofundme link. If you are in a position to donate, please do anything you can give. It will go a long way. And if you aren't in a position to donate, you can still go to the video I stitched and give a follow to this page and interact with their content in any way you can and then do whatever you can to spread their message, even if it is making a video of your own. Matt said that they liked Maze Runner adaptation even though they are not 100% loyal to the books. You must be having a great week then with the reboot announcement. Hope you get all the book details that you want to see! Then someone whose username is the name for Watermelon Land's favourite book is A Good Girls Guide to Ta Ta Ta Ta. The fact that I had To censor myself so much did not feel good, but thank you so much for commenting! Susie replied the little prince in Italian. My first Italian comment! I'm so happy! Liza lot replied the leftovers, which very much has lost vibes, so here's a TV show rec to keep you all on your toes as well. And also let me add how much I love the username Lisa lot. It's just beautiful. And someone says that they don't have a favourite book because they feel they don't read enough to have one. Well, I hope you find it eventually, and I hope reading is always fun for you as well! Thank you so much! If you're still with me, I hope I entertained you in any way. And if I did, please consider donating to this family. They could really use all of our help, so we shall do whatever we can for them. Okay, let's do something good today. Bye!",

    "voice_to_text": "it's always reassuring when famous authors talk about their process and it's at least close to what I'm doing when I'm writing so Neil goes on to talk about Neil because we're on a first name basis of course goes on to talk about how his first draft is really just him kind of throwing stuff out to see what sticks to see if anything comes out even remotely close to good and then he goes back through and starts to refine and add and take away to make whatever looked okay that much better and is actually very similar to the advice that Stephen King gives in his book \"On Writing\" which is appropriately his advice on how to write a book so I have tried to follow that loosely in my writing journey where my first drafts are a little bit of word vomit sometimes I just go go go I try not to get too hung up I try not to edit as I go just gotta get the words out there first and then I go back through do a quick clean edit to fix grammar and spelling and stuff and then I let other people read it as well as I'm rereading it to see what they liked what they didn't like what worked what doesn't what's too long what's too short and then with all that feedback and having a fresh view after having stepped away for a little bit then I can go back in and I can start to refine so for example Mattson Academy the first book that I've ever published I ended up making a lot of changes so just for some numbers perspective the first draft was 112,000 words the second draft was 136,000 words and the published version is under 100,000 words so it got much bigger I added a whole lot of things that I thought were really cool I really fleshed out a lot and tried to embiggen the world and add more time for characters that I really enjoyed and then I realized that that was just way too much and I had to really chop it down and get it to a point that it was marketable for lack of a better word so we ended up cutting out four or five whole chapters and certainly shrinking a whole bunch of them the original first chapter is actually up on my website just I mean I saved it I didn't get rid of anything why would you ever get rid of anything in a digital world I have everything saved and backed up and all that stuff so the first chapter is certainly there on my website anybody wants to read it uh this uh there's also a chapter one of my favorite chapters I didn't put it on my website after I cut it but what I did do was I ended up repurposing it and using it in book two albeit in a very different format but the idea and kind of the bones of that chapter are still there in book two so never any reason to throw anything away but it's true it just characters got shuffled around characters got added characters got cut as just you know the first draft really is just kind of getting the idea out in its roughest form it is first draft is just another way of saying rough draft right you just got to get it out there first it's really hard to edit it all up in your head although god knows I try I don't have nearly as many notes as I should but first draft rough second draft refining and then it's those later drafts where you're cleaning it up even more making sure everything flows making sure everything fits exactly the way that it should so that it's nice and clean and perfect so that hopefully you can get it out there either self publishing or get it in the hands of a publisher whatever works for you and that's just the way that I do it and I'd love to hear how other authors do it too uh cause it's always reassuring to know that you're not alone so thanks for listening to the ramble",

After The Shut Up Ring By Cate C Wells @Cate C Wells  Romance: Single Mom, Friends to Lovers, Hurt/ Comfort, Finding Yourself Again Coming Soon (Friday, May 24, 2024) Thoughts\ud83d\udca1 I absolutely loved this book and finished it in just a few hours. I\u2019m always a fan of Cate\u2019s work especially when she tries something new and brave. Blurb\ud83d\udcd6 shut up ring (noun) \ud83d\udc8d a marriage proposal meant to get you off his back, intended to last indefinitely. I waited eight years to marry the father of my children. I worked at our relationship. I was patient. I forgave\u2014the thoughtless remarks, the disappointments, the test results when I was expecting our youngest that proved he hadn\u2019t been \u201cworking late.\u201d Then, when we finally made it to the altar, he looked deep into my eyes, smiled, and cracked a fat joke. That wasn\u2019t the worst of it. His vows weren\u2019t a promise to love. They were a final test of exactly what I\u2019d do to get his ring on my finger\u2014what I\u2019d take\u2014in front of family, friends, and their cell phones. Was I going to be internet famous? Another sad bride who must\u2019ve known the kind of man she was marrying? My two little girls stared up at me with big, round eyes. Was I really going to laugh it off like I always did? In that moment, my house of cards came crashing down. When the moment was over, for some reason, my best friend\u2019s older brother was on his feet with his chair knocked over like he was about to punch someone. This is the story of what happened next. Please check the author\u2019s note for specific content warnings. Standalone. No cheating. HEA guaranteed. Quote\ud83d\udcac \u201cHow do I make you feel?\u201d I ask, feeling like I\u2019m at the edge of a high ledge with my \u201ctoes are curled over the edge. \u201cLike I\u2019ve got reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cFor what?\u201d His lips curve ever so slightly. \u201cEverything.\u201d \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f  ##bestfriendsbrother##bestfriendsbrothertrope##bestfriendsbrotherromance##bluecollarmen##hurtcomfort##angstybooks##angstyromance##romancebooks##booktok##smuttok##steamytok##spicytok##steamybookrecs##spicybookrecs##spicybooktok##booktokfyp##kindleromance##kindleromancebooks##kindlespicybooks##catecwells",

(She's been my favorite character since day one) I'm sure you are very excited this morning, or you a feral last night or you were---maybe screaming into your bonnet at 2 a m, trying not to wake your child. um And this is all very exciting but another reason I think we should focus on the actress uh one of Nicola Coughlan is that she is a fantastic advocate for G\ud83c\udf49z\ud83c\udf49 and was, you know, using some of her star power to encourage medical donations n to G\ud83c\udf49z\ud83c\udf49 on her platform  so um I can't find the video I think it's on Instagram but right here on her official Insta Medical Aid P\ud83c\udf49lestine she's been 10 toes down raising money for P\ud83c\udf49lestine and using her platform the best (as she) can for this cause. And I'm going to continue to try and be awesome like her and follow her example here on my platform the AbuDagga family is still trying to raise $4,000 $34,000 four thousand more dollars they are right now. And they can do it, with your help. If we all work together we can get them to this amount And I'm encouraging folks to contribute with this giveaway of HER OWN HAPPINESS, it's my second novel,  came out September it's a Friends- to-lovers so if you're a Polin fan and you like the slow burn and the yearning you might like this only it's contemporary. But yeah I'm encouraging folks to with a five dollar minimum donation so I can get those donations up up up to donate if you're on TikTok send me a DM and I'll send you my email ( for proof donation) If you're on Instagram, please just DM me proof of your donation and I will enter  for a giveaway for this very book, with  its gorgeous cover. And the cover of alone is the reason I have in your library um and um So we can get---help get the AbuDagga family to their next goal of $34,000. They are currently in Kh\ud83c\udf49n Younis where everything is very expensive and life is very hard. And every cent that they get donated helps them get to exist a little bit longer, so they can get to Egypt. We know that the um borders are closed right now but they still need a funds and meds ---still needs money to get by day until they can get across to Egypt and to safety. So I'm asking for your help: donate $5 to enter or donate a $1 and don't enter um. Whatever you need to do um I encourage everyone to be like Nicola Coughlan, and use the little power that you have to do awesome things um. and also uh just be cool so that one's for my Bridgerton fans  and my \"Penelope Featherington can do no wrong stans.\" \ud83d\ude18",

    "voice_to_text": "Question for my people who have multiple hobbies like gaming and writing and reading, watching TV, at this point, I've just given up, and I let the hobbies choose me. Sometimes also depends on what I'm doing that week or whether I'm busy or not. For example, I've been cat sitting at a friend's house all week, so I do not have my consoles with me. I do not have, like, all of my manga, manga books, whatever. I've also been pretty busy this week, so there will be no gaming, there will probably be no super productive or creative anything because I get home and I just wanna sleep. I did take a book with me. I have managed to read one chapter of that. So no gaming or creating for me this week, because I know I won't be able to do it simply because I don't have my stuff with me. Now. The rest of the time, I do catch myself being super overwhelmed and being like, okay, what? What do I wanna do? That I think I wanna write, but it's just not coming to me. I think I wanna sing, but it's not coming to me. I thought I was gonna read, but then I just stop after two pages because I'm not feeling it. And I catch myself scrolling my time away on TikTok. And at this point, I've just accepted that that's just the way it is. If I'm too overwhelmed to actually Do anything creative. Read, write, sing, content creation for TikTok. That. That means my head just isn't in the right space, and I really just don't want to. And if doing nothing is what I need, then doing nothing is what I will do. And the rest of the time, my hobby is just me. As in, I find a manhwa that's really interesting, and then I will hyperfixate on that, and I will not stop until I finished reading it. Or this book is particularly good, I will spend the next four days reading that and nothing else. And sometimes when I'm, like, really in the flow, or, as I say, my Muse comes back from vacation, and I really feel like, I must finish this chapter now, then that is what I'm gonna do. Next week, I hopefully will be on a long vacation. Hopefully, my creativity will come back to me. Like, I need to get my hands on Boulders Gate 3. I really want a romance Esterion. That's gonna take some time. And I will be binge watching Bridgeton the second I get home Monday evening. But, yeah, that's basically it. Let your hobbies choose. You do what you feel like doing most, and the second that you feel like you wanna do it. And if you don't scroll away the time on TikTok. Because of my force myself to do things, because I feel guilty that I'm not being productive enough, that I'm not being Creative enough. Then I don't wanna do it. Because you can't force me to do shit. Even I can't force myself to do shit. Let your hobby choose you. I'm pretty sure that was absolutely not helpful at all.",

And this even works on the Kindle app. I think this also is possible if you have an iPad and use Apple Books or whatever, but let me show you. So on your Kindle you will highlight the portion you're trying to translate? Or I guess in this case it would be pretty much the whole book. Then you would, after highlighting, click on it, then appear the three dots, click on that, then translation, and then just translate from the language it's into the language you're trying to read in, and voila! A translation for you to enjoy. Maxton Hall, I hope this works out for you.",

Ebooks are great for this. I look at them as sort of a try before you buy because they are usually cheaper than the physical version. Because I don\u2019t keep everything I read, this helps me basically weed out excess. If i do read a book I like enough to buy, I\u2019ll just go buy the physical copy and add it to my library. If you don\u2019t want to spend money, your local library is a banger, especially with the introduction of Libby. Even if your specific library is tiny (mine serves a town of 4k) it\u2019ll likely be linked to a greater county or state borrowing system so you\u2019re not limited to just what your tiny town\u2019s library has on hand.  #booktok #sellingbooks #tradingbooks #donatingbooks #librarytiktok ",

This time last week I did a giveaway of my debut novel, THE BENNET WOMEN, and we got 10 people to donate to the AbuDagga's GoFundMe. So this week I'm giving away my second novel: HER OWN HAPPINESS. A mistake I made last week was I forgot to tell you what it's about. It's um set during the pandemic at the story of a woman who is rebuilding her life after everything fall apart um in Hawaii but she only has her best friend to be with her um. And she's trying to figure out her career and her love life and everything and it's um loosely inspired by EMMA (by Jane Austen) and if you like ph@t rep ph@t heroin's we got them if you like ace rep um her love interest is ace if you like Black romance they're both Black people wait when she's Black he's Biracial  and if you like a funny good time, it's that too. So (that's) all things on the book, the bigger thing is um we are loving your donations the AbuDagga Family Gofundme from now until Sunday, Sunday at 11:59 PST and please DM me or with I'll send my email and you can send me proof of your donation and thank you. The AbuDagga Family  thank you, they're trying to get to 34 k (by the end of the week) they're at 29K now. And they are trying to get out of um G\ud83c\udf49z\ud83c\udf49 They're trying to get to safety in Egypt and they are going through so much---it's like at least 20 family members. And you are going to help them. um We're gonna help them together and maybe you'll get a book out of it. So doing another giveaway Thank you so much for your willing to participate and use that human-to-human power to change someone's life for good.",

Armentrout. Love you to the end of the world, to the end of the earth, everything. Lauren Asher, love and along love. Look at this fucking problem, dude. It's. I'm knocking things over the sprayed edges. I can moan right now. Oh, Kennedy. What got me into hockey romance. Thank you. I bought them all in one sitting. Hadn't even read the first book yet. Thank you. Lucy score, the queen of a slow burn. Dirtiest book I've ever read was Prison Center. I swear to god. And it's probably so wrong. Some people probably like, oh, this one's way easier. I don't care. That a work of art. I'll see. Silver is what got me into cowboy like country romances. Love, reckless. Who? My Sarah Kate. Those dirty little bitches as well. Thank you. Icebreaker and wildfire, of course. I've yet to read wildfire yet. Actually my favorite book of all time. Uh, I love Karina Holly. Anymore of her books? These are the books that got me back into reading, actually. Her, like, European Prince series. Yeah. Sarah Damas, of course. And y'all are sleeping on Raylan Marks. Doctor Brooks Amnesia Trope. Never read that before. Before this book. Sobbed, sobbed. That. That woman knows how to write a book, let me tell you that much. Damn. You will See books in this video that I cannot support the publisher, but amazing books. Oh, my god. And of course, Liz Tomford. The Right Move. I could drink that book through like, a Boba straw. Oh, of course. Special edition of Iron Flame. Fourth Wing is with a friend, and I'm a little crazy. Night. Alphabetized authors going across cause it's just so satisfying. So there's my bookshelf tour. Thank you for watching.",

    "voice_to_text": "is it possible to create your own punk subgenre the short answer is yes because there are a ton of punk subgenres out there and they were created because things started not fitting into a neat category so a new one had to be made to more clearly fit the aesthetics and values punk is very much a marketing term that you can use as kind of a buzzword to create interest but you should decide exactly how you're going to define the punk parts of your book if you're talking about aesthetic values then you might wanna use more of it has a punk quality to it in the aesthetics I did a whole research paper on this on the difference between actual steampunk and Victorian futurism Victorian futurism is imagining a future or a world that is kind of advancing in its in its steam technology or the technology of its times to do similar things that we have today but not in the same ways true steampunk would be adhering to more punk values which is anti authoritarian themes social societal outcasts anti establishment and then putting it under the banner or the aesthetic look of the steam era so if you're going to create a punk subgenre for yourself or use one that exist you might wanna just make sure you're clarifying which parts of the punk are you using are you saying it has more of this kind of aesthetic look of this kind of punk sub genre or is it a punk book that upholds the punk values so it's like your book Buck Social Transdescent feature a lot of characters who are societal outcasts have a lot of anti establishment and anti authoritarian themes the whole punk genre has kinda gotten watered down to become more of just talking about the aesthetic values of things so you would describe cyberpunk and diesel punk and biopunk two things but that doesn't necessarily describe what the book is about or the themes that the punk movement was actually trying to progress"

[most of us are traumatized but we're not gonna hit on that right now] so WHO IS IT that has this belief and why are they reading my (our) books? if they believe women and young girls are unintelligent and immature why are they reading books about them? Led by them? Better yet why are we changing the story to cater to them? I'm pretty sure it's not young adult women who think young adult women are dumb and immature if I do say so myself and we have not even covered the romance thing I'll leave everybody with (another) question do you think the person you're writing for is the same person they're publishing for? and why not?",

    "voice_to_text": "Tomorrow is the first day of Amazon's huge deal on books. Okay, if you were like me and woke up this morning and went to Amazon to see what amazing deals they had and were really disappointed in those said deals, I got you. So I use one of my favorite sites is, um, Book Outlet com. It's amazing. It's got every genre you want. Paperback, hardcover, whatever it is that you like. Um, all sorts of different genres that. That people like. And honestly, it's got some really popular books on there as well. This isn't one that's just indie. It's not any. It's not just smaller, more unknown books. It's really well known books. Um, I'm a big fantasy, SCI fi reader. I also love romance. And I just wanted to show you guys a side by side comparison, because the Amazon sell is, to me, absolute bullshit. Like, it's not great deals. Um, they've been marketing it as something that is amazing. It's not. Let me show you. Okay, so if you're looking at this absolutely amazing sale, this is on Amazon site right now. This is the romance, young adult, teen books. So all of these, it's 8, 13, 10, 10, 8. Nine dollars. Um, if I go down to fiction, let's go to right here. SCI fi. So, SCI fi, same thing. Like, you've got $9, 11, 12, 22, 15. Like, this is on their book sell. Like, I don't even understand how that was A sell. But hold on. We go to um, book outlet and you've got all of these books here. This is romance. And they've got like thirty five hundred results. And look at these prices compared. You've got. There's five dollars $5, $6, $7. Like hard covers for $8 versus. What was that? That hard cover was $20. Something insane. This one's $11. So huge savings all year round, all the time. And honestly, I've come on here before and there's been even bigger savings. Um, because they will have and $10 off orders of $50, free shipping over 35. No, I don't work for them. I just think it's a great deal. They obviously don't always have as many options because it is a random site. Honestly don't know how else to say that. But they don't always have a ton of stuff that you might be interested in. But they are fantastic. So for all of you that were really looking forward to this Amazon huge deal and you got on there and we're pretty disappointed. I would highly suggest checking this out. Book outlet com. Phenomenal. I've. Every book I've gotten from there has been in great condition. It has been met all my expectations. I've yet to be disappointed. And I order from them all the time. So do this information what you will.",

    "view_count": 773,
    "voice_to_text": "What is your favorite dream movie? The movie that no one on this planet has seen except for you. It's movie called storybook, which I so randomly on TV one day. I feel like it was a lazy Sunday sometime in the 90s and then stuck in my brain for 20 something odd years. And I finally went on Reddit and basically was like, here are the details I remember from this movie. Can someone help find it? And I managed to identify it as this movie storybook because of that. And one of the things that is the detail that really stuck in my head for 20 years is that there was a scene basically where the kid, in order to pass some sort of obstacle, had to undergo basically multiple choice quiz of morality. So essentially he was trying to go through this cave and there was a giant rock he had to stand under. Well, the wizard asked him questions and if he gave the wrong answer or the bad answer, the rock would fall on his head and squish him. And the first question was something like, you find $100 on the ground, do you A. Pick it up and put it in your pocket? B. Look around to see who might have dropped it? C. Give it to the police or something along those lines. And the kid goes, I would pick it up. And the rock kind of above him rumbles as if it's Gonna fall on his head because it thinks it's gonna go put it in his pocket, and that's the wrong answer. And then the kid, quarter course corrects and goes. And I'd look around to see who dropped it, and good answer. Like, well done, kid, you pass. But even at 8 years old, I remember thinking there was a huge plot hole there, because how do I, as the viewer, how does the rock know that that is really what the kid would do? Would he really do that in a real life scenario where he didn't know? It was a testimony. Because we all know that the right answer is you don't keep the money that you found, moralistically, but how many of us actually would under pressurized circumstances? And that kind of stuck in my head as a plot hole for many years. And ultimately, this LED to me writing an entire book about this plot hole call the notorious virtues. And the concept of the book is basically people being tested to see if they are virtuous under circumstances where they don't know that they're being tested. So in this scenario, they would just find the hundred dollars, and the test would see what they do, rather than give them the choice where they know they're supposed to give a right answer. See what they would do in a real world scenario. And so, yeah, I feel by all accounts, is probably an awful movie. I Have not seen it since I was 8 years old, nor do I have any desire to. But it did inspire partly me to write 130,000 word book about this tiny plot hole I found in it. So, yeah. So, yeah, if anyone else has seen this movie, please give me a shout because I feel like I'm the only person on the planet who has.",

People that are living in a standard of living that's, you know, okay, not so bad, but not so great. They couldn't get them to watch them hurt the districts and still be okay with it. So they had to make it entertaining. Like cops. You know, the TV show cops? Like sports events. Because most people who are in sports are coming out of poverty and sparing their body to be in sports.

So he was a pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays. Is currently a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uh, this is what he looks like. Mmm hmm. Yeah. Uh, he is 6 8. He has that face. He has every abdominal muscle. So one day, he's, you know, hanging out in the dugout, cause starting pictures only play every five days or so. Um, he notices a girl in the crowd. He has the team photographer, because the photographers, like, are, like, in a pit next to the dugout, zoom in on her, apparently likes what he sees. He gets a ball. He writes his phone number on the ball, tosses her the ball. Um, and, you know, it says, like, text me. Um, and so she comes back at a future game, uh, tosses him a ball that says, with her number, that says, no, you text me. And they've been dating for several years. Um, certain things work if you're a six to 8, handsome, millionaire, professional athlete, is what I am going to say. Uh, but, yeah, if I wrote it, you wouldn't believe it. But it really did happen.

I'm gonna guarantee that they're always millennials, um, who probably are divorced, probably have children, and are so addicted to book corn that they think that this person that they're so in love with is just gonna spawn magically into their life. Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don't think a billionaire wants that. I don't mean to body shame anyone, okay? I'm not talking about how she looks. I'm talking about someone who's addicted to literally reading corn in a book. I don't think anyone's gonna be really attracted to that except for other corn addicts. And it's kind of weird to say that out loud, but the more you think about it, the more it makes sense. It's always like, book talk. I'm just gonna call him goon talk for now on. That's how, like, I seen with the guy who said, who's gonna call him goon talk? I full on stand with him, bro. And you. Book talk. I see y'all hating on him for calling you guys out.

That's funny. He's a minor. He's a kid, and y'all are going after him for that? That's crazy. I'm more scared that if Book Talk finds this video, it's like, I don't want to talk to them. They're nasty. I'm gonna get off the pepper spray. For real. All jokes aside, though, if you guys are gonna, book talk is gonna hate on me for calling y'all out on your disgusting behavior, at least I'm doing it looking better than you. Hmm. Strike for the fucking camera, man. Yeah, get it? I guess. I don't know. And before you come at me, so. Oh, well, you're an eddsworld fan, and you're in love with Tord, and you. Okay, at least I'm not obsessed with it to the point where I will, like, make fantasies about it. Like. Like, imagine doing that. They're gonna be so cringe, bro. Honestly.

But if you have something in your life that you think is super sweet and make a good cover, you can scan it with an app called Genius Scan on your phone and then follow the steps from there to turn it into an ebook and use it as a cover. Because I got that caricature of my husband and cats and I drawn in Korea, and now it's on my Kindle all the time, and I think it's just so sweet and cute.

    "voice_to_text": "so that was a question asked by uh book talk pal Jennifer couple days ago and what a question it is I mean wow how do you write a book there are volumes of books out there instructing you on how to write a book there is all kinds of media out there to help you uh in that chore um so yeah her question is you wide open um but there's been a couple of videos that have been posted since she asked that question I'm gonna tag them to this one that do a good um job of summarizing the entire process but what I wanna do is to focus on a specific area of Jennifer's question and that is how do you take the spark of an idea and decide whether or not it needs to be a book or not so I'm gonna start off with a quote and this quote is gonna maybe surprise a few people everybody I think if has heard part of this quote and the part being that everyone has a book in them and it sounds inspiring right well maybe not when you hear the full quote well that was like quote came from an American journalist by the name of Christopher Hitchens and the full quote is everyone has a book inside them which is exactly where it should I think in most cases remain so maybe the quote's not quite as inspiring as what people give it credit for anyway I think it's common for in in my opinion for writers and authors to have multiple ideas floating around in the back of their brains for books that they think that they wanna work on it's it's the process of this of picking out that idea the one that interest you the most and deciding whether or not to move forward with it um I've seen multiple videos here on TikTok of authors who are like 50% through 75% through of the first draft of a whip and an idea strikes them for another book and then they come on TikTok and say what do I do should I continue to work on this book and just jot down the idea for this book that I'm super excited for or should I jump onto this other idea and abandoned my other book put it in the back burner and jump onto this idea that I'm just hot to try on it's it's a conundrum and one that I'm not gonna answer here that's a whole other video to answer that question but it kinda leads into another question now myself I usually have several ideas for books um written down somewhere that have come across um my thought process and yo the question that Jennifer asked about how do you write a book it's it's taking those ideas would you mmm a lot of times are just flashes of inspiration that pops into your head they come in all kinds of different forms it could be that you think of a character that you wanna write about and then you gonna form a book around that character could be a specific plot device that you think about that you wanna develop um they can be all kinds of things now forgive my hesitation because I'm tryna keep my thoughts together as I go but fleshing out that idea however it comes to you and deciding whether or not it needs to be built can be done in a multiple multiple multitude of different ways myself I am a plotter which means if I get a spark of an idea for a book I have to plot it out before I decide whether or not to move forward with it and actually make it my next book I have to know that there's enough meat on those bones and actually I need to find out if there's enough bones to support the meat and that you know that just the flash of an idea is not enough to make the decision of my in my case there are other authors out there that get that flash of inspiration and they just run with it they run with their gut um they run with their um instinct and in most cases it serves them right um it doesn't work for me but you know doing that taking these ideas that you come across and deciding whether or not it needs to be a book that could be the make or break in your success rate as an author uh authors who pick inspirations and turn them in the books that nobody wants to read uh you know it's a bummer but it happens a lot of bad books that are out there are books that nobody wants to read I'm not gonna say they're bad books but a book that nobody wants to read you can't pull in readers to you know that's that was a bad investment in time for that author you need to be able to sift through these ideas that you have and pick the one that garners your attention that you can think through to say I will enjoy writing that I will enjoy fleshing that out and I think people will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it picking out that book from these ideas is the first step of process and then everything after that is just about how how you uh actually write what your idea is uh but to me it is a huge step and one that I think is overlooked a lot anyway that's my two cents for today it's Monday full week ahead of us we'll get through it uh everyone take care of one another out there and I'll be back again soon with some more content bye",

No matter what nation, no matter what you do, no matter what your hobby is, no matter what your look on life is, you can relate to what's going on by. If you work in healthcare, look what they've done to the healthcare sector. Talk about the implications of it. If you're an artist, look at how they. How much they have destroyed. Or just talk about how much being an artist can help raise the cause. Look at what Macklemore did. If you are an engineer or if you're an architect, look at what's happened in the strip and talk about that ramifications. For example, it's gonna take over 900 days just to replace a building every single day in Gaza to get it back to where it was just a few months ago, let alone right now. This information is relevant to the cause, and we need it. And thank you so much for making that video, because frankly, you put into words what I could not. Because it's just hurt so much to see so many mutual silent on what's going on. Just Posting a video using the Macklemore song. Just posting a video using a filter that will raise funds for people overseas in the strip. Just posting a video that permanently stays on your feed means a lot. So thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you for doing this. It's greatly appreciated. And frankly, if you don't have a video recently on your profile that is talking about Huzzah, at this point, it just hurts. It genuinely, physically hurts. As usual. Let's use the views from this duet to help Abdulaziz with his family in the northern part of Gaza. There are three families of 15 people that they are taking care of. His main concern is food. So again, for anyone saying that the borders are closing, we shouldn't donate, it is irrelevant because currency still needed. He gave great examples. A bag of flour costs about $1,000. Coordinating an exit is about $5,000. They still need our donations. Currency is still important. As you can tell, he's really close to our goal. So let's take this one home, baby, because there's over 11,000 of us in here. If the majority of us donate $5, we're gonna get him to his goal. So let's help this family get there. I pledge $10. This is his account right here. Go to the linglio in their biblio. Donate, and if you can't, make sure to press all the buttons so those that can will be able to come forward. As always, keep it strong, rebels for Palestine!",

Now I happen to write chronologically which means that obviously I start from the beginning and end at the end. I will however have ideas for stuff that comes up later. I try to write that down ahead of time and then once I hit those points then I use them if it's relevant. Obviously if the story takes me in other directions that might not be needed anymore or maybe it'll be later or earlier whatever but I try to write down the rough ideas ahead of time. This helps significantly because it helps shape the story a bit more without actually being too bitty about what I'm doing when. I do have ADHD and Autism so I do find the idea of working chaotically as it were by doing snippets here and there quite daunting and terrifying to be honest. I don't know I just like to have a very set order as to how I do things and it just logically makes sense to me to start from the beginning and end at the end but hey look each to their own. I think whatever works for you works for you so no hate no shade from here.",

And I compare Hunger Games to the real life, and it doesn't end well. Let me just say that. It doesn't end well. It ends when all of the districts come together. Katniss does this whole thing, right, cause 1 and 2, the cops and. And the. The peacekeepers and all them people, they're still holding on their. Their love to the capital is like, no, guys, we. We gotta. We gotta fight for them. And then Katniss is finally like, guys, they're killing your kids, too, and we can't continue to do this. So the rebels, who are the district people, they, um, kind of take over one and two. Not necessarily in a good way, but they take it over. And then all of the districts man together, because there are different sects of the districts, and each of those sections, they, like, are LED by certain people. Now, when we finally get to the end of the end of the end, we're getting into the capital, they're storming the capital, going into the capital, and this is, like, the mansion and things like that, right? So we get all the way up to the point where pretty much it's over for the capital people, and they know it. But then what happens is they drop a bunch of, like, What are thought to be aid parachutes, but they're not. They cause a chain reaction of explosions. And those explosions bring in more rebels, the district people, and then those medics are then exploded. And at that point, even the capital people were like, no, we're done. This, I can't. We're done. And was it the capital that did that? No, no, we find out it was. It was the rebels, so it doesn't end well. I mean, but if we wanna talk about, like, the age of enlightenment that we eventually get to, that's all right, you know? Okay, we all have PTSD and healing, but Katniss grows primroses.",

    "voice_to_text": "um Hi. This is Eden your friendly neighborhood author um and I write books inspired by uh Jane Austen and Jane Austen is a brilliant author. She can make me feel and do a lot of things but you'll never make me hate Mrs Bennet. That's because Mrs. Bennet was just a girl. She was just a girl who is valued for her beauty and her good humor. And then she married a man. And then she didn't have sons. And he stopped valuing her. And then he got her daughters to stop valuing her. And then she started having issues with her \"nerves.\" It is tragic. When you put it that way  and  she's that \"figure of fun\" when she's in the side of the story. If she was the center of a story she's Mrs Dalloway. um And yeah she didn't have a chance at real life and it's not fair. And speaking of people who deserve a chance at real life: this is Raghad. She is a 23 year old and supposed to be graduating like this month instead of running for her life and um fleeing the IOF and trying to stay alive with her family and crossing to Egypt. And um we can help her do that um this is her GoFundMe. um She's got a lot of family members including a lot of kids. Looking at the little little kids, the mom in my heart screams. I think of these kids especially,  in danger. How their mothers must feel. And you can see Raghad in her cap and gown. She said she was trying to to celebrate the graduation that she knew she wasn't gonna be able to have. All the people in this picture all the people trapped in a situation deserve a shot at a real life. And you can help them. I saw a creator -much bigger (following) than mine say to ask anyone to give a dollar. So if you have um less than $1,000 in your bank account (which is me \ud83d\ude05) give a dollar if you have more than that get five.  I think that's a great idea um I think you can think of it as giving a gift to all the mothers for Mother's Day. um Or giving a gift to Raghad for a graduation But a dollar, $5 and if  you can't give anything ---we get it it's hard times out here share, boost, like Thank you so much."

You can pause and read this message and if you click on the video I just stitched, it will take you to this page where you can learn about Yasuna family and you can find their gofundme link as well. If you are in a position to donate, please do. This is a young family with multiple young kids and they desperately need our help. As you can see, they're still at the beginning of their journey, so do whatever you can. If you can't donate, please go to their page and share interact with their content in any way you can. Whatever you can do, do it, even if it is making a video of your own. Regulars is currently reading a Simon Stephenson's book and they bought two other books A Special Summer and Beer. Ask Masali A Love Story from Hamet Umit, which is a love story about seven princes having the same dream about the princes. That sounds like something I would love to watch in the right mood. And I'm so sorry if I pronounce any of the names incorrectly, which is what I always do. I don't think I pronounce one name Correctly, in this entire series, and I apologize. Honestly, Kevan replies that the art of the manga MHA is incredible, but that the fandom needs to find a better name. Thank you for letting us know, and thank you for the new manga wreck! I haven't read about that one before. Chris's favourite book is The Song of Achilles and they are currently reading a book called The Fire Keepers Daughter. I hope you loved it! I've heard great things about it. And it's written by an indigenous author if I'm not wrong. I've heard wonderful things about it. Night Thrasher's Girlfriend favourite book is The Younger Games. Tough week to be a Hunger Games fan, isn't it fella? Thanks to Jennifer, Queen of no Thoughts Lawrence. Hey, the block button is free, thank god and I made use of that with her help.

But he's not. You know, when they have that fucking. That chalky shit on them. To be fair, it's just on his wings. Anyway, there's this moth man and this girl's come out of a divorce and there's this really nerdy moth man who's like, super lean, super tall, doesn't wear any clothes. But what's. What's very key here is where his penis is. It's of an interesting shape and area is where it is and. But it was a lovely story of how, you know, she's like, I want this man, but I'm just. I'm not interested. I don't want a relationship. Just divorced and I just wanna live my life. That she realises that she loves him. It's cute, man. It's cute. But let me. I would say. I would give this one. I give this one a six and a half out of 10. Still good. Still, you know, give. Give that smut. But I have to say Morning Glory milking forest still on top. I have now moved on to the moon blooded breeding clinic. I will let you know. Also, I forgot To say the beginning of this book. Um. It's a little thing. It's little.

    "voice_to_text": "I'm not gonna blame your 8th grader obviously this is the cover of Ice Breaker right they might have not known I'm gonna make a lot of people very mad with what I'm about to say and that is if you are a person who sells books to children like the person in this video is or if you're a person who cares for children buys books for them you need to do your fucking job because another creator already pointed this out that it would have taken a parent who bought that book for their child maybe five minutes to flip through it or ask somebody if it was appropriate and they just didn't fucking do it what especially gets me angry too is that this person says oh I work in a bookstore and I had no idea what icebreaker was about like okay I'm willing to buy the fact that your store sells a multitude of books and you're not gonna know the contents of each and every individual book but you're at least gonna know where the books that are appropriate for children are being stocked in that store but then what this creator does is that they dissolve both the parent and the student for reading the book and buying the book for their kid saying like oh a lot of parents these days are just like oh I don't care uh what you're reading as long as you're reading it and then absolves themselves of any responsibility saying oh my god I have no idea what icebreaker is about now I'm never gonna sell it to a child even if our store sells but then goes on to make the claim saying that oh it's meant to attract children right look at this cover look at the cartoon colours look at the people in the cover don't look any more than like 16 and that is my fucking problem 1 if you're an adult who deals with children who buys books for them who cares for them who sells books to them who loans books out to them it is your responsibility your job your duty to at least have a vague knowledge of what is appropriate for children to be reading as a caregiver or a parent it is your job to actually parent or care for that child it is your responsibility to look at that book look through a synopsis look you know flip through the pages and then be like hmm I don't know about this I'm gonna put it back on the shelf and we're gonna look at it online at home and if it is appropriate we're gonna come back and get it any direction that takes maybe five to 10 fucking minutes right but if you was a person who sells books loans books borrows books whatever want to absolve both the parent and the child of that responsibility then it falls on you and again you don't have to know every single word of every single book your store sell but you have to at least have a vague recollection of hmm I don't think I put that book in a section that kids should be in when that book comes to the register it is your responsibility to look at it and be like hey I know that this book may seem you know attractive to your kid because it's got a nice cover and you may not have looked through it but I don't think this is necessarily appropriate for children and whether they buy the book after that is on them but you cannot also absorb the responsibility of yourself as the person who is selling books in that interaction because then what you're saying is that there is some other magical invisible fourth entity who has designed this cover specifically to lure children into reading sexually explicit material and then put that book in their hands bought it for them and then let them walk away with it when that didn't fucking happen and that's the other thing that pisses me off is that when you say that a cover is made to cater to children you are repackaging the same language that bitches like moms for Liberty are using when they say that colourful covers on books about gay and queer people and trans people are luring children into reading them same shit different toilet but it doesn't make it any less shit because that's where it starts right is being like oh no no I care about children and that's why I'm saying that this cover is inappropriate for this book because it's catering to children it wants children to read sexually explicit material and then you identify yourself in a dichotomy of being like I'm on this side moms for Liberty and all the people who wanna ban books are on that other side who don't really care about children in the right way I care about children in the right way but when you repackage that rhetoric and say well I don't want kids to read things that are inappropriate because these covers these publishers these writers are making things to lure children in or as you said cater to children you are closer to stepping over that line in a Mom's for Liberty territory than you think and if you take nothing else away from this video whether you're the person who has stitched or anybody watching this I want you to take away three main points one if you're a parent or a caregiver who is buying or loaning a book to a child it's your fucking responsibility your job to understand what is appropriate for somebody who is middle school age that's this person points out in that video because when I was younger I would go to Barnes and noble like every other weekend with my mom because I loved reading I'm hyperlexic I didn't know that until later but that's beside the point and I would pick up books from all over the store I would be like mom I wanna read this look at the cover it's so cool my mom a working single mother had the forethought to turn around and be like you know what I don't know what this is appropriate for my 7 8 9 year old let me see if like what this book is about she would look at the back she would look at the summary she would look at the dust jacket and she would be like hmm I don't know about this maybe let's find a different one that's a little bit more your type meaning let's look at the same subject matter or the same genre but that is a little more appropriate for your age group when you are somebody who cares for children or parents then that is your fucking job you can't absolve yourself of that responsibility and neither can anybody else alright take away number two if you're a person who sells books to children loans books to children it is then your job to at least familiarize yourself with the vague notion of what is appropriate for each and every age group cause you know that's your fucking job there are charts available of what is appropriate for each age group in all corners of the internet and they're colour coded they're bright and pretty so that people actually look at them you cannot absolve yourself of responsibility if at least knowing the mechanics of your own job and number three there is no magic invisible devil who is putting sexually explicit books in the hands of minors because once you start blaming some invisible fourth entity that is not the person who loans or sells the books the parent who buys the books and the child who reads the books you start veering into moms for Liberty territory a lot faster than you fucking imagine we just have to stop absolving adults who interact with and care for and deal with children on a daily basis of the responsibility that they need to actually give a shit about those children because merely saying that children shouldn't be reading a sexually explicit material does not actually constitute you caring about them if you actually cared about them you would familiarize yourself with what is appropriate for a middle schooler to be reading you would approach that parent no matter how uncomfortable the interaction and say I don't think that's appropriate for your child I know that because I work here you would not be blaming the existence of this book on the publisher or the person who wrote it as though the mere existence of sexually explicit material is objectionable in it of itself what is objectionable is absorbing yourself of the responsibility the job the duty of actually doing what's expected of you",

So\u2026 one moment\u2026 Sunshine shone through the astrical bar windows in the office. Rays of sunshine loomed over a young woman who sat behind the front desk. Her ashen hair was tightly placed in a ponytail to match her monochrome office wear. She scribbled away into her multi coloured, worn out notebook. A trickle of sweat slid down her nose as she focused on the page in front of her. A fantasy world came to life from her imagination to her notebook as the seconds ticked by. The notes were scattered in their presentation but she could understand what she was writing. She was absorbed in her writing. The seconds ticked by the - by to the sound of her approaching college\u2019s clacky high heels. Hilda wrote of a witch walking along a disintegrated pavement, clacking in her heels as she walked. Hilda's colleague checked her watch as she stopped by the desk: it was 2:58PM She looked for an opening to grab the attention of the woman at the desk.",

It's part of, like, the whole process of learning. And they might have gotten this from a book. And that's okay. That's okay. So let me. Let me kind of help you. Just. Just a little bit. Hold on. Let me. Okay, so I see that you are using yarn, and if we're going to do a binding spell, we actually don't wanna use yarn. Um, in this case, when we are binding the luck to the book, we're gonna Wanna use twine. But in this case. In this case, a crystal gradient is gonna be fine. So the pentacle. Okay, so this next step is very important. You want to make sure that you have your comp author available. And you're going to just. Just here clear your space. And then you just kind of, you know, clear the area a little bit. Yeah. Uh huh. And then easy peasy. You know what you're asking for, right? So you're gonna go ahead and pull. So we got the Warlock. We're gonna set that aside, and that's gonna be our focus. You go ahead and add your sacrifice in the middle. So here and again, you wanna make sure that there is some sort of connection with, uh, your comp author. Um, so in this case, I have Travis Baldries. Signature. Um, because, um, Lot legends and lattes is one of the comps for not your mountain. So I'm gonna go ahead and set this in the middle of the spell array. So, again, uh, just like SF Henny showed, um, in this case, it's not with chalk. We are doing it with a crystal array, which is good. That's fine. And then you. You just kind of, you know, with your wand here, and you go, give this momentumous. And then you do that. That's what you. That's what this looks like. And then sometimes, instead of summoning, you just. You just get a dog, and that's just what happens. Huh? And that's just how it's gonna be. Well, anyways, I hope these tips really help. And good luck with all your magicing. Bye.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I like to think of stories in two capacities so the first capacity is simply exploring so what I mean by that essentially like maybe you know like I do fantasy and SCI fi a lot you know that's those are like my go TOS but maybe I want to you know Dibble dabble on some mystery thrillers but I you know maybe I've read the books and I've read the how two books and the the learn books but I haven't done it yet and you know devoting time to a whole book and maybe you're not on that level yet you know can kinda be daunting but what can you do short stories it's a I personally believe it's a great opportunity to just kind of mess around with with a con with a consport story and say okay I'm gonna do mystery and I'm just gonna just kind of make something and you could end with you know your own choice you can monetize it or just say hey guys this is a free thing I'm looking for feedback you know like of course you'll still have your batteries and arc readers and whatnot but it's good to have even a bigger community hey you know I like the way you did this you know polish up on this so I just over you know maybe this wasn't for me but it's good to just you know explore it without the whole risk of spending money on the marketing advertising spend a whole lot of money on covers you can just make an e book put out there on Kindle Unlimited and all your all your platforms and say okay guys hit me let me know now the second thing is more of like disciplining yourself and I mean this in terms of like we all fall victim specials in the office to sometimes give you too much information right we end up blowing our story with useless like like exposition that you know we just feel like it might matter but maybe it won't because you know we just wanna make sure that we just get every point in so that maybe might reference something or just to try over flush the world or flush out in general but I think when you have a short story maybe you can cap that like 15 20,000 words or what have you and say okay I this is my limit this is as far as I'm gonna get this is high as I'm gonna get so this teaches you ultimately um how much ex exposition is too much or too little how it can help you improve your pacing better um understanding character development like how much is enough and how much is is not enough within this this frame and I think it in a good way forces you to really figure out what matters to the character what matters to the story what matters the pacing and the concept and how the begin how the beginning middle and end transpire so all in all I think uh short stories are a great way just to take a little break but just to try something new with low risk and to improve your pen as an author I hope you enjoyed my very long TikTok I'm tryna I'm tryna keep my video short but you know I give too much exposition have a great day keep on reading keep on writing",

It is horror with a subgenre of romance. Um, what? I wrote this book back in 2,016. I marked it as pitch black for a reason, and that was because of the time I was writing Dark Romance. But I knew this succeeded that dark and it was gonna be more into pitch black. So, um, extremely dark. The order is 24, 6, 90, White out.

I think it was also, like Killian Murphy was maybe, um, inspiration or. Or drive from. But the way that they are written in her own words in the books, they are brown boys. Animate it. That gives you the mechanics of what you need for the build, the face, the look. These millions of women who have invented their own version of what these creatures slash humans look like in their own head can fill in the rest from an animated version. Just get a really, hmm, good voice, and we will do the rest. Thank you. Have a good day.",

Everyone says to read this one first, so I'm reading this first. I'm on the assassin in the Red Desert. The desert, whatever. On chapter 5 of that. Um, yes, but. So I don't typically use a traditional bookmark, so I use, like, weird ones, but this is, like, the closest thing that I can find. It's a sacrilege. I mean, I guess that might be taken down, so. But if I was using this as a bookmark one, I don't like it when it sticks out because I have. I throw it in so many different bags all the time that this shit is just gonna get bent, and I don't wanna destroy a nice bookmark that I have like that. So what I will do with it as I'll just put it in the middle of the page and then close it because, like, it's still in there and you just gotta flip to the. Flip to the page. But that's not what I use. I have this really cute little kitty cat that, like, dangles from its tail. Look, look how cute that is. Look how Cute. That is, um. That's what I'm using right now. Um, but I'll. I'll do that at the start of the next chapter. If I finish the chapter, I will turn to the next chapter, put my bookmark, go to bed, whatever. But if I'm like, let's say I get to one of these, let's see, like, a break in the chapter, like, in the middle of the chapter, I won't turn, I guess, like, it wouldn't even make sense to turn the page because I haven't finished the page, but, I don't know. I guess that's not too complicated. I could have touched that out, but, um. Definitely not groundbreaking, but, um. Yeah, I'm just happy to be involved. That's what I do.",

    "voice_to_text": "so go check out Seth's video he was asked a question about dealing with busy lives and and trying to find time to write and dealing with writer's block and so of course I decided that I would chime in with my answer that I wasn't asked about and if you don't know me I am C Britt the author of my zombie apocalypse Monstra Inter and I'm currently working on a fantasy novel tentatively titled Crimson and first of all I wanna say if you want to write and you're busy like everybody is sometimes you just gotta cram it in wherever you can if you have time on your lunch break you type out notes on your phone if you have time while you're waiting on a doctor's appointment you do it while you're sitting there um sometimes for some people it's not gonna work to say I'm gonna sit down at 6 p m every night and do this cause their schedules are just too chaotic sometimes for some people you're gonna have to just fit it in wherever five minutes here 10 minutes there it still gets written even if you're only doing a couple minutes at a time a few hundred words here and there it still gets written eventually so try not to stress too much about having a set time I know a lot of people talk about having a set time to write but if you can't do that you can't do that and I'm I don't have a super hectic schedule but for me sometimes I know I've got something going on this evening I'm not going to have time to write this evening I'm gonna do it at lunch so that's that is something to keep in mind if you are trying to write something and you have a busy schedule as far as the writer's block um I have a few different methods for dealing with that first of all I kind of analyze how long has this writer's block been going on did I write yesterday and now all of a sudden I can't write today if it's one or two days that probably means I just need to take a break and go do something else I know they a lot of people want to harp on that you have to write every day but that doesn't work for everybody it does not work for me I stressed myself out too much back when I was trying to do the right everyday no matter what so if I have a day that I just am not feeling it I go do something else play a video game watch a movie read a book anything just anything that does not have anything to do with writing now if this feeling has been going on for any stretch of time if it's been a week or a month or something then it gets the point I need to force myself to do something because I get stuck in this rut of well I couldn't do it yesterday I couldn't do it the day before and it just kind of feels overwhelming so I have to kind of get to a point where I just do it I know a lot of people talk about writing when they have passion or whatever but sometimes sometimes it's just sit down and do it and that can involve beat my head against the wall until I figure out where to go with the story or sometimes that means editing and proofreading past chapters I know they say don't do that till the end but it works for me if I go back through and start reading stuff that I've previously written and I'm start editing and stuff either I'm making progress on something that is going to have to be done eventually anyway and my story is still progressing because of that or I go back and read something that sparks an idea I find a detail that I had forgotten I included I remember a character that I haven't done anything with for a while something along those lines and that might get the ball rolling if not that if that doesn't work or if I don't wanna do that sometimes my technique is write anything and I mean anything like something that I know 100% that will get thrown away it has nothing in the world to do with my work in progress I kind of consider it um almost improv with myself I will sit down and I will start with some ridiculous mundane concept and I'll just type out Bob got to work on Saturday's computer and then I go okay what crazy thing happened to Bob next and I have to come up with the most off the wall ridiculous thing and then play off that so Bob sat down at his desk and his co worker walked up to him but today the co worker skin was green and he had antennas how does Bob react to that Bob's eyes bug out and he says what happened to you something like that and then you have to play it off with some crazy idea that happened to that yeah don't worry about punctuation or spelling or grammar or anything just a rough quick fast as you can improv idea that just is absolutely bonkers it will get thrown away nobody will ever see it but it gets that creative mindset going and gets the gets me into that writing mindset and again this may not work for everybody but it's something that I do that works for me so maybe it can help somebody else out and I know those moments are sucky when you have when you run into something like that but you gotta play around with it don't just listen to all the writing advice that says you have to write every day don't just listen to the stuff that says you have to wait for editing at the end or whatever those techniques may not all work for you if they don't work for you that's fine you just have to figure out what works for you",

You just stared at me to buy this book. That's how I stumbled upon Haunting Adeline, because somebody else was like, oh, it's dark romance, and it's super dark, and you're gonna love it. And then I read it, and I was like, oh, shit, it's pretty twisted. Little twisted there. But then you come along and say these things. You damn near challenge me to not read it. Like the people reading Haunting Adeline are fully there in the first place, and we loved it. So if you're telling me there's something more unhinged and not to read it and that you can't even make it through, I don't think I can add that to cart fast enough. So with all due respect, I will take your trigger warning and tell you to shove it. And I really hope it delivers. I say this with all love. Seriously, I'm really excited to read it. Thank you for the recommendation.",

It has depth of character, it pulls you in right away, multiple perspectives, and it takes a big switch in time. However, it does it in such a way that it's super seamless and it doesn't take forever to make the connection between why it started where it did and then where it jumps to, which I think is just Chef's Kiss.

Similarily with the chacters, in the beginning there are questions, some things were onbvious from context but I was worried I would have to wait chapters to find out more about the significant chacters and and actions. I was happy to be wrong! Kacie did an amazing job of quickly and without taking you out of the story building the world building character back in. When introducing a new character, Kacie gives great detail to this charcter foreshadowing her importance. She takes a bit over a chapter to reavel the chacters import. At every turn the book becomes more and more amazing. Druids, magic, humans, war, romance, sacrifice, and mystery. Oh, and shifters though in a way I have never read them. I am in love with this book!!! Cannot wait to read more by Kacie! "

    "voice_to_text": "Normalize posting why you broke up on the internet. I feel like enough time has passed where I can actually share the story. But one thing people don't tell you about going through breakups as an adult is how crazy people get over pets. I was fully living with my boyfriend, with my dog and my cat that I had had before the relationship. They were mine, when he randomly kicked me out one day and was like, we're done. We have no chemistry. Like, we were not compatible. And in hindsight, was he wrong? No, because Lewis and Clark themselves could draw him a map and he would not be able to find. But come to find out, the real reason is that he had a new girlfriend who he was seeing while I was still his girlfriend. Okay, whatever. Cheating is cheating. That sucked, obviously. But the audacity of this man, in just the nicest way. He has all my stuff waiting for me in garbage bags outside the apartment, so I cannot go in. Like, I have no more access to his apartment, and I have my dog with me. What I don't have, what's not waiting outside for me is my cat. My cat? What's his reasoning? Where's my cat? Can I have my cat? Maybe? Madison, my new girlfriend, has just really bonded with your cat, and she loves those kind of cats, and I. I just can't separate them. So we're keeping the cat. For Madison, my new girlfriend. And, I mean, I'm just gobsmacked at this point, but I'm trying to pull a legally blonde. Like, I'm taking the damn dog, but I don't have access, and I don't have a would be lawyer who can, like, tell him he legally needs to give me my cat. So I had to get creative. And again, I'm locked out of this apartment. But he has a pet door on the apartment, so I was like, fuck this. I'm getting my freaking cat while he left. And I tried to hoist myself up to his little, like, raised balcony to get into the pet door, and I couldn't really reach, but just my luck, there were these three guys who were waiting, and they were like, are you really obviously trying to, like, burgle this man's apartment? But I explained what was happening, and they helped me, like, get through the bed door and collect my things. But can you actually believe that he tried to steal my cat and give it to his new girlfriend like that? It's not like, here's her tea towel she left over. It was my fucking cat. It's been years, but I hope him and Madison are well and truly. Puck",

Okay, there's a lot of, like, gay coming of age love stories. There's obviously a lot of heterosexual coming of age love stories, but we never get Sapphic one. So this absolutely perfect. You need to see it. No.2. Friends to lovers. Romance. Absolutely perfect. Not just friends. Lovers. Like, best friends to lovers. Like, in a girl group. It's so good. It's so beautiful. And I just feel like you're gonna be obsessed with how everything unfolds. Anyone that has had to deal with comp het, anyone that's read the lesbian Master documents. Like, this is really starting to make sense for me. This is for you. It just makes you feel so seen. And, yeah, it's just. It's incredible. Like, it is your story reflected in these pages. Number four. Small town queer person. I feel like, obviously it's a certain pose, things like that. They show what it's like to being, like, big communities. But this one is, like, what it's like to be queer in a small town. Um, a small town where everyone's in your business, um, and it's so stressful, and you just wanna be yourself, but, like, people have so many expectations put on you. This is literally perfect. It reflects that so well. No.5. It's so beautifully written. And also, no spoilers, but it Is a pretty happy ending. And once again, we don't get that. We all know the kill your gaze trope. We all know the suffix. Get killed off within, like, three seconds. Um, but the author doesn't do this. The author that's these individuals just be happy that the girls be in love. And it is a long road to get there. You will cry, but it is so beautiful and it's so perfect. So, yes. There's a 5 reasons why you need to read sunburn."

    "voice_to_text": "I expect some a little bizarre a little if I am spending no but I've been complaining for months about this because look no shame to this author but look look it bothers me because some of these track pop books they come you get them and they're bare minimum there you pay like 25 to 30 dollars for them bare minimum you buy an indie book from an indie author let's say pay $30 for that okay okay look that look at that and then I'm not even I'm not even like excuse me ma'am I only pay $30 I only paid $30 and you gave me the mostest you know what I mean like look look at this beautiful look at that that's that's in this that's like the endpage look at this this is character artwork I paid maybe 20 30 bucks for this only 2035 I I should be getting this this level of quality in tripod books I should be getting they're getting a list some books are getting a little bit better with tripod books but some are still stagnant and it's like it doesn't make any sense to me look I know this one just got picked up by a publisher for when the moon hatched this is my indie copy version of it look at that glossy and it's it goes on for a couple pages look at that some some Chad pop books don't even have glossary Crescent City does not even have a glossary look creatures does Crescent City have that no this what I'm saying some like authors that make probably millions of dollars pronunciation guide pronunciation guide for the bare minimum will I be able to probably pronounce these names with the pronunciation guide probably not but you know what this gets me a little bit closer this gets me closer to the name than listening to the audiobook in like five years and being like oh my god I've been saying that wrong look at this the this is the indie version of when the moon hatched not trad pub not trad pub at all of course it's Tribe Pub now but chapter title chapter title this is this is what I'm saying like when I pick up a book we we need to be able to get an experience and it feels like with most Chad Pub books you just get this like bare minimum you you want the book get the book you're paying 30 bucks and then the Barnes and nobles editions they change the color a little they add a little like extra chapter that doesn't really do much for you it's like here's a one page annotations from the author and this is the Barnes and noble exclusive it's like oh oh no I'm good and when I say Chad Pop is getting a little bit better with this this is what I mean I know this was previously independently published but this is the paperback version if I'm gonna be paying $20 for it sprayed edge I want some character artwork in there cause look at that look at that look at that like this is this is what I'm saying if I'm gonna be paying this much like perfect I'm pulling out my copy of blood and Brujas because I need you guys to see this is what came when I ordered the box on the author's website Michaela's Amazing Bruja then you got the playlist then you got the character artwork look at that this is the experience like this is the experience that I'm expecting when I pick up books from Track Pop and it's it's crazy to me cause it's like look look character artwork in the book in the book in in the book like I feel like I'm going crazy because like I don't I don't understand these traditional publishers can provide an experience and it it doesn't feel like they really care to provide an experience it feels like they just they just wanna get their cash grab look at this it's beautiful these are all my opinions this has to do nothing with the authors that you saw in this video I'm just saying that the experience that they provide when I picked up their book box or when I got it in the mail and they had stickers they had bookmarks they had character artwork in the book or included for you and you pay a good 30 30 eight dollars for it and then you could buy a hardcover copy of another book that's 30 $38 at Barnes and noble and seeing the difference between the two it's like you know what I mean it's disappointing I think the only the only book that's Chad Pop published book that came and it felt like there was an experience to it recently was to case upon Wicked Gods and I didn't necessarily like the book but you know what you know what that book was an experience I'm currently in the process of packing stuff because we're moving so I can't show you but it has n papers and it's like the front cover is designed very beautifully it's red it's just beautiful I have it somewhere on my page if you guys are so interested on looking on the today's upon wicked but this is what I'm saying this is what I expect from trap up I need this in every book you know what I mean like in every book some people may not like character artwork but if I'm gonna be paying let's say 2599 you know I would like the option I would I would very much like the option for character artwork for stickers for bookmarks for just chapter titles that are beautifully created you know what I mean",

So I finished this book, and unlike the creator, whose video I stitched, I can't even be mad at TikTok about it or book talk about it, because this was my own doing. I went in knowing that it's an incomplete series. I went in thinking it's young adult, so I will not like it. And low and behold, I liked it. Um, I. My fuck bestie slash my book club. So her and I, um, decided that will start this book. I finished it in three days, and now I'm here, pissed off that I have to wait until July for book two, and then after that, I don't even know when book three comes out. So I should have known. I should have Learned from Zayden Ryerson that I should not be reading incomplete books. But here I go again. And I'm gonna read, um, the serpent and the wing of Knights after this. So, of course, like, I'm doing this myself, and I'm pissed off at myself. But otherwise, I very much enjoyed this book. It was great. I loved the banter. The characters were great. The female main character was not annoying, and neither was the male main character. So I enjoyed all of that. Um, I can't wait for the next book to come out. I can't wait for. For us to meet all of the other characters, because it can't just be Them. So I'm looking forward to all of that and so much more. Um, it was great. My only complaint is that I wish there was, uh. I wish there was a dragon or a river. But, Priya, not every single book can have a dragon in it. So I need to get over my Terran and Darna and Abraxos. Abra obsession. But aside from that, I give it a serious thumbs up. Thank you."

But when I was in high school, you know what I would do when I was in high school, I didn't, like, stop at the end of a chapter like I do now. I would stop, like, mid chapter. It wouldn't matter to me. Uh, but let's say I stopped reading around right here. I would put my bookmark like this, like that. Like, okay, that's where I stopped reading. And I close my book. Book work when we stick it out like that. So when I would open it, be like, okay, there I am, and I'll continue. Also, if I was reading a book with a dust jacket, like, let's say I'm reading this, right? If it had a dust jacket, I would use this as a bookmark. So let's say I'm, like, reading. I'm right here. I would, like, do this, and then I'd close it and then. And I do that until I couldn't do it anymore with the front. And then I'd use the backside to do it. But that's what I used to do as well.

That's for you. Great. It's better than Spotify because you get unlimited listening with audible. With Spotify, you can only listen to 15 hours a month. That makes no sense. Some of my books are 15 hours long. They're longer. So I have to wait for Spotify for the following month to finish a book that I could blow through in a day and a half. With audible, um, it's unlimited storage. I have over 110 titles in my audible, and, yes, I will listen to every single one of them. You can use your own money to buy books, but you get one credit a month, and the goal is to every month, pick a book that's worth more than the subscription. So I was able to download losers part 1 by, um, Harley Larue, and that was more. That book was worth more than the cost of my subscription. And then the next month, I use my credit to buy part 2, which was again more expensive then the cost of my subscription. Um, you get little badges for, uh, how many books you complete. Um, you do get an incredible amount, an unfathomable amount of free books you could just add to your library. There are books that I added to my library. Just A few days ago, that I have been itching to read, and I just was like, oh, wait for my credit. Wait for my credit. I downloaded over 17 books to add to my library for free. It's worth it.",

It's really good if you're looking for young, youthful skin, looking like early 20s. But for those who are looking for a little bit more refined, aged look, definitely gonna go with a Devil's Deal applicator. I can smell the silver fox coming out. While I face baby young. My toes definitely need a little bit of work. That's where we have this foot massager and applicator. Looking cracked as ever. So you get the youthful applicator, the scarecrow's feet away applicator, for a beautiful price of $45. Together, they come signed, and every order gets a dice roll for free. Additional merch, like this one's gonna be getting a sticker and also this beautiful print."

It has occurred to me that while my feed is completely inundated with Aaron Hadamer and Operation Olive Branch and Project Past the hat post that not everybody's might be. And so if you didn't know, Project Pass the hat is a way that influencers are helping to connect individually with people in Gaza to help them raise funds to either be safe and rebuild or survive or evacuate. Um, and my, my videos get like 200 views, maybe 300 views. And so I don't know that I could do a family, uh, justice, uh, but I will be doing what I can to support other people's, um, project past the hat goals. I wanna share this one with you. Um, I'm gonna put the creators handle right here. Um, she is currently creating custom summer reading lists for people who donate to her family's gofundme. Um, if you have money to spare. It is absolutely atrocious and disgusting that just like regular working class people are having to crowdfund to support people who are trying to survive a genocide. Um, when, like, the US government could stop funding this genocide, the Israeli army could stop just genociding people. Right, but, um, it seems like the only way that this is going to happen, where the people can really survive right now is for normal people who obviously don't have a lot of money to spare to do that. So if you Have a huge following. You should reach out to Aaron. If you don't, but you wanna be supportive, like, please check out some of these organizations, um, and donate where you can.",

So, I actually did the first draft for \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019 in 33 days \u2018cause I started it during NaNoWriMo hence why it took a very short period of time. But for the project I'm gonna release after \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019, I'm not sure what my target's gonna be. I think I want to have a first draft done by the end of the year cause the the aim is to get it out there next year but realistically I imagine I'll probably have a first draft done probably just before I release \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019. Not 100% sure on that one but seems to be the way to go. At the very least, it will probably still be in the very early draft stages when I go on my writing holiday to Malta in October so there's that at least. Ha ha!",

I'm gonna mention two here: Benelim and Maelim, the offshoot races of Nephilim we see very prominently. They are very much my answer the elves and orcs because I want to have some races that will kind of close to the to the next to the Abrahamic stuff while while still being vaguely evocative of like elves and orcs. Basically so I can kind of like take cues from elves and works without you know without just making it that. Cause there's been a there's a million fantasy stories of elves and orcs just just tweaking the name and and and altering some things here and there I wanna believe makes it a little bit more fresh. There's also a slight bilingual bonus with this at least with Benelim cause Benelim is basically the Italian word 'bene' with the word Nephilim. And this is similar thing to with the Maelim cause again Mal is a common you know form of evil especially and we're talking about like in romance languages. So it's it's kind of like a more subtle way of integrating the italianness into my into the Godshards world so yeah."

As you can see, I've been contacted by Abdul. You can pause and read this message here, and if you click on the tagged video, it will take you to their page where you can learn more about his family. And you can also see their gofundme link. As you can see, they're still at the beginning of their journey, but their target is not one of the highest ones. So if you share about the situation with everyone that you can, I'm sure we can help them reach their goal. If you are in a position to donate, please do. We've all seen the news today. Let's do what we can to get this family to safety. And if you're not in a position to donate, there's still a lot you can do. You can go to their page, give them a follow, interact with their content, and even make videos of your own. Anything that you can do that will help spread this family story. He's helpful, so do it, whatever it occurs to you. Lesbian cheese. Few people under your usernames said that their favourite book is The Star of the sea. They added that it has beautiful writing and feels like a dream. What a Glowing endorsement! Thank you so much! And yeah, I've heard about it before and a lot of people seem to love it, so I'm definitely curious. Silly ghost replied Five Nights at Freddy's series. Oh my god. I read one of their graphic novels about a couple months ago and I absolutely loved it. I had never heard about the series before and now I want to read all of them so same! Bestie captain said that their most recent favourite is a manga, Chainsaw Man, and that their favourite that stuck with them is JoJo's manga Rex. Thank you so much! Cody said that they haven't read in a while, but that their favourite book used to be Caroline by the Coward Neil Gaiman. I haven't read that one yet. Sienna commented that their favourite is the outsiders. A favourite in this comments. Thank you! Banner Duck said The Good Girls Guide to Ta Ta Ta Ta Ta, perhaps the most favourite book in this comments. Thank you so much! Thank you so much! If you're still with me, I hope I entertained you and if you are in a position to please, please, please donate to this family. Let's do something good today, folks. Thank you.",

Have to record this in my bedroom because it is hella loud in my library area. First reveal backwards. Oh, she's tinier than I thought she was gonna be. Like, she is so, like, little, little in dainty, but it's actually. It's honestly not that much bigger than my phone. Like, I'm comparing it right now. But she's cute. I like it. Here, you get a box. Power button is down here. Okay, that turned around. Pick your language. Next. Select your region. United States. Next. Now she is loading. It does come with a cable to charge it to, which is awesome. I do like how it gives the option to set up right on the Kindle or on your phone. So I'm gonna try it on my phone and see how that works. If you have the Kindle app, which I do have a downloaded right now, setting this up was really, really easy. It took me all of two seconds. So I'm gonna do a quick brief of how to do it if you're getting a Kindle anytime. So gonna ask you to go into your Kindle app, so make sure you have the app downloaded. Go to more right at the bottom here. And then it's gonna ask you to go to setting, and then in settings is gonna have the Amazon device. Simple. Setup. And it's going to find the Kindle, try to link it, log into your Wi-Fi, log into your Amazon, all of that. And it'll have you go through through a few more steps on your Kindle, but then everything will be right on it. It's so simple. I love this color, too. She's so cute and so simple. I love it. What should I start reading?",

    "voice_to_text": "How are some of y'all going around living life not caring what people think about you? Like, truly read this book. It was a Japanese mega bestseller. It was eventually translated into English. It's fantastic. It's based on the thought of a Japanese professor who, um, studied Socratic philosophy, ancient Greek philosophy. And he also became obsessed with Alfred Adler, who's one of the big three founders of psycho therapy, along with Sigmund Freud and Carl Young. And he's sort of the forgotten third, Alfred Adler. So this is a Japanese take, um, on a. An Austrian psychologist which also takes in Socratic philosophy, and it's written as a Socratic dialogue. It's a wonderful book. It's good for all ages to. Teenagers will get a lot out of it because it's written in an easy to approach dialogue. Adults will get a lot out of it. There's a lot of good core things to address this idea of how you can not care what people think about you. There's a concept in here called the separation of tasks. And so you often think when you're worried about something, you really stop and think and you say, is that my task, or am I worried about something that is somebody else's task? somebody's opinion of you is something that really you're imagining. You have no idea what somebody else's opinion is of you. You have no idea. You have no idea how strongly held the opinion is. Even if it's Good. And so that's their task. And so you eventually have to train yourself to really only focus on your tasks. And it's wonderful. There's so many other nuggets in this short, easy to approach book. Um, but that, that is how you do it. And it really is the core philosophy of the book. And you can see it in the title there. The courage to be disliked.",

Dear Literary Agents of Tiktok, I\u2019m seeking representation for my debut YA fantasy novel of 80,000 words, THE WARLOCK\u2019S SHADOW. In a mystical world where magic and modern life seamlessly coexist, fifteen-year-old Alex is an ordinary teenager with huge dreams of following in his late father\u2019s footsteps to become a Knight; an elite dragon-riding, magic-wielding, protector of the world. There\u2019s only one problem: he sucks at magic. While attending school he undergoes an affinity ritual to discover that he aligns with the mysterious element of darkness, something extremely rare and associated with black magic users called Warlocks. The only Warlock Alex knew of is Blight, the same man who tried to enslave all dragons in pursuit of world domination--as well as his father\u2019s murderer. Disheartened when no domesticated dragon egg bonds with him as it does for classmates, Alex stumbles across a wild dragon egg in the nearby woods. It immediately hatches for him alone, unleashing his previously untapped magical gifts. Intrigue mounts when his mother passes down a cryptic amulet, a gift from his late father later that evening. Meanwhile, black magic cults are on the rise and Alex\u2019s amulet begins to pulse with energy and his own magic starts to go haywire. Curious about the amulet\u2019s behavior Alex finds his father\u2019s journal while researching and discovers an upcoming cosmic event called the Celestial Shadow. The event in question would weaken the boundary between their world and the Void which is imprisoning the Warlock Blight. Cults worshiping Blight plan on using this event to free him. Alex and his friends vow to stop whoever is behind the plot to bring back Blight. Should they fail, life as they know it will be turned upside down. THE WARLOCK\u2019S SHADOW is a unique combination of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon 2\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter\u201d.  This work is aimed at a young adult audience seeking an immersive escape into a world where magic is not just a part of life but a force that shapes destinies. #seekingliteraryrepresentation #seekingliteraryagent #yafantasybooks #yafantasy #youngadultbooktok #queryingauthors #bookquery #indieauthor #literaryagent #booktok ",

    "voice_to_text": "BBR that I predict I'll rate 5 stars so first we have out on a limb by Hannah Bonamyeop not to be smug or anything but I was correct I rated this book 5 stars and I'm gonna tell you why so the main tropes are accidental pregnancy and then false proximity and roommate the male main character is boar he has prosthetic leg and the female main character is win and she has an underdeveloped hand they meet at their mutual friends's party it's a Halloween party and they're both dressed as pirates and they have a one night stand and this one night stand leads to the accidental pregnancy uh this is my favourite book which contains accidental pregnancy trope I usually really don't like it it's kind of like a common thing between readers that we don't like it that we don't like the accidental pregnancy trope but it's really good there is a really mature and necessary conversation on whether or not she wants to keep the baby um I think this is so needed for a book like this it's not soft under the rug and it's outright written on the page whether or not she will keep it and the options that are available for her and I really appreciate that this was mentioned and talked about that it wasn't just a given that she would keep the baby Bo and win eventually move in together because of Win's living arrangements they're they're really bad basically and they get to know each other they just wanna live as roommates they wanna just know each other as friends and then it goes from there and oh my god with both characters being disabled as well it goes into a lot of um the kind of thought process that disabled people have around being parents um and all one of the internal monologues contains when thinking that she won't be able to be a great mother because she's got an under underdeveloped hand and actually the her hand is based off the author's own hand as well and so her experiences are lived experiences by the author which I think is fantastic so overall the book is heartwarming it's beautiful it's amazingly written it intertwines gut wrenching emotion with humour at the same time so if you need me I will be reading every single one of Hannah Bonham Young's books",

    "voice_to_text": "our children cannot read let alone writing a paragraph if you haven't watched that video watch it um do a little research on the discourse going around talking about literacy in um America and in our classrooms where kids literally don't know how to read and then come back because I'm not an educator and I wanna talk about like the policy and the political reasoning behind this lack of literacy because it's definitely there and it's scary and it's strange and we should be talking about it um so join me on a little adventure shall we as you probably noticed by now a lot of educators have practically been begging parents to read with their children and to not leave teaching their kids how to read up to school alone because it is very easy to slip through the cracks in the public education system and also we're not learning how to read in the most effective way and you mean more than just class time to learn how to read you need like individual one on one practice and like learning how to love reading as well and that's where parents come in where they can read to their child read with their child um like replace screen time with books whatever those are all things that can be done but there's also this level of understanding that that is not accessible to everyone especially single parent household low income households like it is not possible to read with your child for an hour every day if you're working super long hours or if you're struggling to put food on the table it's just not possible and there is a solution for that matter of fact and that solution is the public library the American public library system is probably the most democratic the most free the most fair the most accessible animals community oriented institution that exists in America today it is everything should just operate the way that the library system operates in my opinion we'd be living in a much better world because everything is accessible everything is free getting a library card is most places free taking out books free the internet free printing cheap to free right most libraries are getting rid of their finding system to make it more accessible like the American public library system Chef's Kiss no notes delicious we love her we love her deeply truly you know who doesn't like her Republicans Republicans don't like her Republicans are passing all these book bans because they're homophobic and racist and terrible and they're incentivizing libraries to take these books off their shelves by saying that they're not going to fund them if those books are in their children sections or in their libraries at all and as I just mentioned the public library system no notes they are not the people who are going to be boring education boring knowledge and boring books that's like not what the institution of the public library system does so it's putting these libraries in really horrible positions where it's either we lose our accessibility to everyone or we lose our like relatability and our like need in the community for everyone we're not providing what the community needs anymore we're not providing what libraries are meant to provide freedom and learning and like solidarity with one another you know community if you will like those are the things that the library provides that they're not able to provide if they can't put in books written by queer authors or can't put in books that talk about race or do that and not get funded so those books can't get checked out for free anymore you know of course the Republican Party is going to attack these institutions of democracy that exist in our communities of course they are they want us to be as individualistic as possible they don't want us to have access to education or bettering our society they don't want us to learn about queer people or people of colour or people of different faiths but at least the liberals the Democrats they've got it under control right wrong Democrats across the country are cutting funding to libraries but I specifically want to talk about the New York Public Library because I think that the budget cuts of the New York Public Library is facing um and where that money is going is incredibly telling as to why these political institutions want to ensure that we are not literate as a population and within our communities especially minorities community so especially communities of colours especially poor communities this The New York Public Library's entire sad story explains exactly why and it's it's terrifying Mayor Eric Adams is planning on cutting the New York Public Library budget by $58 million $58 million that is a huge portion of the public library's budget and it is going to change operations the first thing that it's going to change is hours of operation so instead of being able to be open late in the evenings and on weekends they're going to have to cut weekend hours The New Republic library has already come out and said that with these budget cuts that's the first thing that's gonna have to go and that is incredibly devastating because if we rewind back to the beginning of this video when we're talking about accessibility parents who work the only time that they have with their kids to teach their kids how to read to teach their kids to love to read is during the weekend and now they don't have this free accessible option to do that and that to me is absolutely bonkers bonkers but it gets worse now fella where is all that money going I'm so glad you asked the N y P d that money is going to the N y P d let that sink in yes this NYPD same NYPD that's been arresting peaceful student protesters this is just recent NYPD behavior they have a long horrible history that NYPD so what does this have to do with literacy right at our base core we're taking an institution that excels in providing accessible knowledge education and literacy to individuals taking that money away putting it into an institution that penalizes individuals who don't have proper education see how it's cyclical see how if more kids knew how to read less kids would end up going to jail when they're older like it's really that immediate connection but it goes deeper than that the NYPD was essentially called into quell public unrest and this public unrest came from students college students specifically college students who were some of the last individuals to gone through elementary public education and receive phonics based reading skills so we are more literate than the generations that are coming after us if we were the last ones to receive this type of education right the MIT was brought in to destroy these encampments and the reason why is because the institution was scared that the encampments were self sufficient they weren't going anywhere they weren't ever going to go anywhere and that was because a community was pitching it they were bringing resources money food hence every awareness everything that the encampment needed to survive and the only way to cut that off was to destroy the encampment completely which was violent and the opposite of community right what I find most striking about the encampments was how much reading was happening all of the videos that I saw all the images I saw free libraries that started at Columbia and was at pretty much every other encampment that came after it students were sitting there reading Angela Davis they were reading theory they were reading Palestinian authors and this gets to my wrapping up point right you need to know a lot to effectively talk about specific political issues in general but specifically with Palestine the people who are really fighting for liberation have done a ton of reading like they need to be knowledgeable about things to even know that what is happening in Palestine is wrong right and that is why literacy is so important because that is how we find justice like we need to understand how things work by reading about it by reading theory by reading accounts by reading poetry and if people don't know how to read then there is no more descent and that is why our institutions are trying to destroy literacy in any way that they subtly can but who knows maybe I'm crazy sorry if that didn't make sense",

Yes, he is a light skin black man, but he is a black man. Based on his life experiences, going to HBCU, being in fraternity, all these things. He is a black man in a black city. And so I stuck to my guns. I did not change. And look, that young ladies holding my book in her hand. I say all that to say, do not change. Stick to your guns.

Like, coming to the store, just, like, take pictures and get in the way. Like, there should be couples that were, like, sit on the floor, like, crisscross from each other and, like, read or whatever.

I thought getting me getting a Kindle was gonna help the fact of me spending so much money on physical copies. No, it. It didn't. Uh, there are pros and cons of having a Kindle, which I agree that the Kindle is quite good and useful, but for someone who still buys the physical copy of each book I have read on my Kindle, it's just more money that I'm spending. So if you think you're gonna be still buying a physical copy of the book that you read on your Kindle, then, I don't know, it's. It's completely up to you. There are loads of pros and cons. It's affordable. Like, you can take it anywhere. You know, you can lie on your side and read with it. It's chargeable. You can have the lights all turned off and read it at night. But are you not gonna buy a physical copy after reading on the Kindle? I don't know. Maybe."

That's what I've been asking everyone under pro watermelon posts and so many of you are kind enough to comment that I have enough to make a series out of it and hopefully help a few people. People like Eva and her family. As you can see, they contacted me a while back and you can pause to read their message. And if you go to the video I just stitched, you'll find their page and their gofundme link. If you are in a position to donate, please do! Eva and her family are still at beginning of their journey, but their target is not the biggest one so we can help them reach it. If you're not in the position to donate, that's okay. There's still a lot you can do. You can go to Eva's page right here. You can give them a follow and interact with their content in any way you can, even if it is by making a video of your own about your favourite books and hoping it helps. Evelyn replied that their favourite book is probably The Perks of being a Wallflower. I love that book and it's another favourite in this comments. So either reply diary of a Wimpy Kid. Classic! Someone replied little women in Spanish. Yes! Love that multilingual crowd here. Amal is brave. She replied The Da Vinci Code. I remember reading that. Soft replied The Invisible Life of Adila Roux. I only read Gallant By V Shuv, but the rest of our books are on my TBR. Jesse is an organised woman because they replied the author saw the sea by Chris Colfer, which is book 5 in the land of story series. I couldn't have said that better myself, Jesse. Thank you! Mimi replied that her favourite book is Malice Wolf and it's about a girl in the Stone Age who finds a wolf puppy and raises it. That sounds super original! Thank you so much! Dot reply that they don't really like reading so they don't have a favourite. Thank you for letting us know dot Julia said vicious y V Schwab and ask me about mine. I'm trying to give a different answer every time someone asks me this. Well, I really love The Education Duology by Jane Harvey Barrick. They're an amazing indie author. They're awesome, but make sure to check the trigger warnings because there's quite a few themes in there that some people might not want to read about or might be slightly uncomfortable just being close to. But for me it really worked and it's one of my favourite romances ever. If you're still with me, thank you so much! I hope I entertained you, and if I did, please consider donating to Eva and her family. Anything that you can donate. It will go a long way. Let's help Heber by spreading her story and donating and interacting with their page as much as possible, folks. Let's do our part. Let's do our part.",

I feel like when you have a good support system, people who can really help you or understand your story, they'll help you to see how you can bring it to life. And you know what? Once again, if I haven't said it once, I've said it a million times, and I'll say it a million and two times. Your story isn't for everybody. And if you are worried about connecting with people, it's okay if you don't connect with some of them, because the ones that you do connect with are the ones that you want to be in connection with, because they're going to continue to buy your stuff because of the fact that they have connection with you trying to change. And I mean, maybe cause it said something about like, she said something about she wants to be able To connect with whites, the white audience. If it's not for them, it's not for them. That's okay. Everyone is not white, so they're not gonna connect. Everyone is not black, so they won't connect. I'm not looking, but you know what? That's the thing with me. I'm not looking for people who feel like they need to be able to sell to the masses. I'm looking for people who feel like they want to sell to the people who it's for, who it's who it's written for. Who. Who they're supposed to connect with. Because you typically have your dream client in mind, not just your ideal client or your. I, I'm sorry. You typically have your ideal reader in mind, but, yeah, sorry, y'all, I'm just got, like, fumbled. But you typically have your dream reader in mind? Cause I, you know, what am I? Dream reader. So you already know who you want it for. You already know who this is for. And it's not like, oh, who can I sell it to? Like, no. Like, who can this help the most? Especially with reading, who can this help the most? Who will be able to relate with this the most? Who can benefit from this the most? I, I am just like, and like, um, it's like, there's no way that that's what happened. And some movie too. Like, I promise y'all. Like this, it, it don't have to be that. You. You shouldn't have to Change your story to sell. And I get it. Maybe. Maybe you wanna be a multi million selling sells millions sold type author. But the greatest impact you will have will not be with the amount sold. It would be with how deep you have reached your authors or your readers. Y'all gotta excuse me with these terminology. I'm just, you know.",

And if you've ever actually read the novel, it's presented to you as an abridged version of a book that the author was read as a kid. And he is reading it to his son, cause he always had it read to him by his dad. And lo and behold, he's like, wow, this book was actually really boring. And he's just trying to recreate it from his memories. But he's making it very clear that, like, oh, this is The Princess Bride is by this author, and it's all fake. There is no original Princess Bride book. It was all a fabrication for the stick. For the book. But without fail, when I am selling this book at conventions on the weekends, somebody will come up to me and argue with me and be like, why are you selling the abridged version? You really should be selling, like, the OG. Like, this is just the silly, like, comedy version. Like, there is no original. Like, no, no, no, no, no. I read it. I'm like, you're lying. You fabricated this in your head. Please stop. This is my",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, I'm not stitching to be funny this time. There's no punchline or silliness. I wanted to recommend K. This video for any bookworm out there. So this. I guess this is a book talk type of video, because I've been using that technique or trick or whatever you want to call it for a while now, and it's a total lifesaver or book saver. Just see, in comparison, this is a book that I read years ago, three years ago, something like that. And you can see that the spine is very cracked. When I open it, there's like a. Yeah, you can see it's very cracked here. And it's not the worst example. I've. I've had thicker books that are just, you know, they look like worn out shoes at the end. But either way, you can definitely see that there's a crack in the spine in comparison. I read this one after I Learned about Katie's technique or I saw her video. I don't know if it's her technique, but she's the one who made me aware of it, at least. Uh, this is a slightly thicker book as well, and if I open it, there is no. No crack. The spine is completely intact, and I can still open it. Can even hold it with one arm instead of, like, forcing it open. Perfect. So go check out what she's doing and have at it. You know, I hope. I hope this saves your books as Well",

    "voice_to_text": "Apparently, this author, Robin Lee, had to switch her characters from black people to white people in order to. Honestly, when you think about it, this could probably explain why so many authors have to. Or why Shonda rhymes and Mindy Kipling, why they have to, um, basically create interracial relationships in order for people to be plugged in. Maybe that's why. Because so many. There's been so much commentary about, why do these minority writers, when they create romances, why is always have to be interracial? Maybe because if they did 2 Indian, you know, people are two black people, they wouldn't. They wouldn't. They won't watch it. They won't be interested. One thing I could think about is in the Heights. In the Heights was a movie that I think was Romance House based off of, like, two, I think, people of color coming together. And that movie went triple, right? But people love Queen Charlotte, and maybe they feel like, well, this is actually a way to get representation. Look at the challenges movie and how that's number one. Do we think the challenges movie would have been number one if maybe Zendaya's two love interests were black? Let's think. It wouldn't. So, like, I think that there's a reason. There's a reason. Probably why now when people say, oh, you know, why is there only, like, these interracial couples and stuff, because there's no other way there to get reputation, like representation otherwise, because other than That a lot of white people, they have to see themselves. They have to see themselves. We've Learned what The Little Mermaid. They have to see themselves. A lot of them have to see themselves in order to, like, connect. If they don't see themselves some way, somehow, they. They're not. They. They can't do it. And it's not all, but obviously, the fact that she had to change her characters to white and then it sold versus when our characters were black, people weren't interested, says everything. It unfortunately says everything. So, yeah, it probably explains why they feel like interracial couples are the only way representation can happen. For real. It's unfortunate, but, you know, it's probably the truth. There's only way anybody will watch it. And I would like to add, like, I like plot lines. I've read black love books, I've read white love books. I've read interracial love books. Like, I just like a good plot line. Nothing wrong with interracial love or black love or white love, child. It's just. It's sad that, you know, black people are not seen in human eyes. And, you know, it's just really sad. It's really sad. It's like we have these little victories sometimes with, like, Black Panther and, like, Spider Man and, like. But then sometimes we're reminded all over again why it's like, you know, it's unfortunate.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey! So one of my absolute favorite authors of all time, Mrs. Gail Delaney, is here on TikTok. And yeah, like the stitch says, she is clearing out her bookshelves and she's put together some bundles of some of her books that she's trying to move. and I looked through them and I'm so pissed because there are some really good deals on these bundles! Uh, some of them are mystery book bundles- you don't know what you're getting. But like, there was a bundle of her hardcover books from the Phoenix Rebellion series. And it's like, four hardcover books! It's like, the first like, part of the series. And it's like 35 bucks for four hardcover books! That's insane! And like, honestly, she's super nice. So if you asked her, (nicely!) she would probably sign them for you too at the same time. They're not all her books. They're like, books that she's collected over the years as like someone that was running her own publishing house in addition to being an author. So like, there's all kinds of different genres. She writes romance... um... with varying degrees of spice. absolutely (*cheeky grin*) You know those stories that you just get like sucked into and you pick it up and you start reading and you swear... Just one more page...  (One hour later) Just one more page... (5 hours later) Just one more page... And then like... nine hours later, you finish the book... and you're sad... and you don't know where you are... (That can't be just me right?) That's Gail. So yeah, So if you're looking for a really good deal on some new stuff to read- Some stuff is like six to 16 years out of print she said. Like, some of these books you can't get a hold of any other way. That's fun. Um... But yeah, I'm not sponsored or anything like that. I swear! =P I just love Gail's work. And I really think that if you are interested in reading some romance, and SCI fi romance, or some... some historical romance... or Oh! she's got she's actually got a series that I haven't started yet.

I- I'll be honest: I'm a very character driven person. Not just when it comes to reading but also to when I'm like watching stuff on TV. I'm always really fascinated by the journeys the characters go through rather than just the ancillary plots that happen along the way. Oh you know, the plot is obviously important of course ha ha and you know I I understand that but I'm very much into the characters. I wanna know what's happening with them and how their journey is going. How did we get here? What could possibly happen next? Like that's you know the psychology of a character is really interesting to me. It is pretty much always the character that comes first. I'm gonna give you an example: so there's a project I want to start once I finish \u2018New Leaves, Old Scars\u2019 I'm pretty I'm about 90% sure that this is the thing I'm gonna start next and the\u2026 and the thing that came first was the character. The character's been in my brain since I was for 15. 16 maybe at the oldest and I'm 34 so this character has been whirring around my head to some extent for about 18 years 19 years nearly. No! Hang on a minute! Wait a second! If I was 15 at the time, I'm turning 35 this year. Oh my god\u2026 it's been nearly 20 years. I'm actually having a really big, major realisation.

    "voice_to_text": "I just saw an author post on TikTok that she has written three books so far in 2024  I saw this video a couple of days ago and had thoughts so I wanted to make a reply to it and the reason I didn't do it a couple of days ago ironically is because I was turning a book around in 12 hours well actually first I line edited 125,000 word book in just over two weeks was only supposed to have two weeks to do it and then when I sent it back New York got it back to me midnight New York time and I got it to copy edits yesterday at about midday New York time so that was the 12 hours Beth Weekles one stitching here has a great response about what her process actually looks like but I just wanna talk about briefly how the same way that writing a book quickly doesn't equal a bad book taking a long time with a book doesn't equal a good book and I should know that sounded weird that sounded like I'm saying my next book isn't good what I'm saying is that it's not any better than if I had taken less time with it so for context my name is Alwyn Hamilton I have a book called The Notorious Virtues that was supposed to come out in 2020 initially thank god it didn't uh but it's now coming out in 2025 and I can do a full story time on what happened there but for now I'm going to touch on the fact that this book took five years so yeah The Notorious Virtues took five years not because it is a better book than someone who wrote a book in three months I probably actually did initially write the first draft of this book in three months maybe a little bit less from and it entered the sort of publishing process some things happened I had editors change leave come back on maternity leave come back a global pandemic happened some other things happened um but all in all the reason the book took five years is not because it was a perfect book that I was polishing to perfection and that is why it's taking so long and those five years are going to make it through the literary masterpiece of my life any more than a book that took a couple of months to write make it not a literary masterpiece what made up the bulk of those five years is not me polishing the same book to perfection I have probably rewritten this book I'm going to easily conservatively say six times from scratch and it's 125,000 word book I have probably written half a million words that will never be seen by readers in those five years and I am always a big fan of saying that there is no such thing as wasted words that you're doing work to show that that is not the direction that you wanna go or you're sort of working out of character there's always a reason that you're doing that right and it is never wasted work however in my case a lot of it was work that was coming from and just making me feel more sort of insecure and crazy about this book I had a lot of sort of spirals trying to write this I tried to quit several times um there was a moment where the reason that I didn't quit was because I knew that if I quit on this book I would be quitting on writing all together I wasn't quite ready to do that even though I was ready to quit on this book those five years represent long periods of being completely mobilized by struggling with this book struggling with self doubt struggling with my identity as a writer what I wanted it to be it doesn't represent me sort of crafting the perfect story this all began with Beth talking about finishing three books this year I have finished officially as of yesterday although it still has work to do um one book in the last 5 years and I am extremely proud of that however I'm also extremely in a nice way envious of Beth for how much work she has been able to do in a short period of time and also incredibly impressed by it because so much of what took me five years was coming from my own sort of internal life and internal insecurities and I think it takes a tremendous self awareness self confidence lack of ego in a negative way in order to do what she has done and I think that is kind of what is behind writing books swiftly it is not polishing them to perfection a short amount of time to write a book does not make it better than a long amount of time to write a book my book that taken five years to write is it any better than a book that I would have taken a year to write probably not it's just this is the process that got me here and one of the things about authors is that we all have such radically different process I know people who are lucky if they write 500 words a day but those 500 words are perfect words that never change I know people who write 5,000 words a day but those words will all be scrapped and rewritten to new better words by the end of the process everyone's process is incredibly different and um I think also all of our process for each different book is different I'm really hoping that the process I have for this book is never the process for another book I write again and yeah one day I hope to have as many books as Beth has although I'll probably never catch up to her because I've taken this five year slow down but again it's not a race she's written 14 books my fourth book will be coming out in April of next year finally after much much struggling and I'm excited for you to read it but I also don't think that it is any way a perfect book because it's taken five years instead of five months",

    "voice_to_text": "Home is where the bodies are tells the story of three estranged siblings who must return home when their mother passed. So I got the book today. Really excited to read it. And awesome cover. Um, and Drew, Geneva's husband, does a awesome job at selling it. Definitely got my attention. And so basically, three siblings reunite after the passing of their mother. And as they're going through things in the inner house, they stumble upon a box of old VHS tapes, you know, family vacation videos, stuff like that. So for nostalgic, nostalgic reasons, they decide to watch them. Until they stumble upon a video that is labeled The Summer of 1999. In that video, they discover that their parents have kept a horrible, dark secret from them since then. So. And then they have to decide, do we keep uncovering the past, or should we just not talk about it again? And there you have it. So I am super excited to read this. Um, what got my attention was, um, the three siblings. Um, I'm the youngest of three, and I'm also the only son, and my middle name is Michael, which is the first name of the younger brother in this book, so. And I'm hoping that's the only similarities that I have with this. Um, yeah, I mean, the difference is both my parents are so alive and well and both still together, and there is no dark secrets that they have kept from us. For the past 25 years. I hope so. Rachel, Haley, if you guys are seeing this, don't you think this would be a fun siblings book to read together?",

So we start reading books to see if that will help. And guess what? It does. But we also discover that we have a lot more issues than we originally thought. A lot. So we start reading more, and we decide to go online to see if we're the only ones with this problem. Only discover online. There's an entire community of people that have the same issue. And they're all little weird, but they're super, super cool. And we work together, and we have discovered the cure. And the cure is buying more books. So this is your daily reminder to go out and buy a book, because it will help your mental health and it's just the right thing to do. And because I told you to. So here are some recommendations for you to buy. Um, but do yourself a favor and check triggers, because some of them are, um, a little weird. Okay, bye.",

It's not that thick, but it looks like it. I'm so stressed. I'm scared. What do I do? Side note, but look at this little jelly cat my colleagues got me. I'm gonna miss them so much. But for real, this would not have been possible without you guys. This platform that I've grown over the past three years, I posted every single day for a reason, because I wanted to get to this point. And now that it's here, feels really bittersweet, and I'm scared, but I'm so excited for what's to come. I can't wait to share. Let's split up with you. I forgot you can't edit stitches. Um, sorry. Bear with. If you're somehow new here. Let's split up is Scooby Doo Meet scream. It's like, why I. Scooby Doo. The book of my dreams. I have been wanting to release this book since 2021, and it's finally here with a major publisher, which I never thought I'd be able to say. And again, that's down to you. I need to breathe. The edits on this book are very, very minimal at this point. It's wrapping it up. And I just love what this book has become since signing the deal. It's just. It stayed the same, but it's just so much better than it Was before. I just. I can't wait for people to read this book. If you were a Scooby doo kid, if you're a horror kid, if you are now like me, who's not a kid, but you are a kid, you're gonna love this book. Well, I hope you do. I hope you do, because the romance in it is great, too. And, uh. Okay, I'm gonna go and sit down and just try and reorganise my life. Oh, thank you, guys. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "I am mildly fighting with some booksellers over the other app thread because I put up the topic up for debate is should any booksellers charge a cover charge or fee for an author signing panel and my short opinion on this is no but there's a lot more to unpack here there's a lot of hate and frankly one sided hate from indie bookstores towards indie authors and yes I understand that indie authors do do some frustrating things to indie bookstore for example putting their books on shelves for readers to find that takes away from sales that the store could have been potentially making because they have no way to charge for that book there are also indie authors that don't put money or attention into formatting or their cover design or editing and by having these books on the shelves for indie bookstores that decreases the credibility of those particular store and from a marketing perspective readers aren't necessarily going to bookstores to request an indie book the same way that they would request a traditional publishing book I think this is for three reasons one because indie authors don't typically have the marketing dollars to put behind their books like a traditional published author would also because readers are assuming that the bookstore probably doesn't even carry indie books unless they ask for it and indie authors aren't putting effort into encouraging the readers to buy from indie bookstores because they're begging them to carry them on their shelves when they do get them on the shelves the indie bookstore acts like they're doing them a favour and it's so much easier to just point people to your own website or Amazon that's it I don't think any of that is a reason to hate in the authors and now even traditional authors are feeling this sense of better than you from these bookstores and it really does come across like these indie bookstores think that they're doing authors a favour by carrying their books and having them on the shelf and this becomes super apparent when they do things like charging a cover charge for an author event where they're not even paying the author for the most part a musician wouldn't be playing at a concert venue unless they were getting paid or a percentage of the ticket sales people don't just go to concert venues to sit and listen to nothing and while some of the bigger bookstores seem to get this a lot of the indie bookstores seem to be struggling with this and I personally am struggling with why as an indie author it has been so much easier on the whole to work with Barnes and noble then it has been to work with a lot of indie bookstores and there are some indie bookstores that have been fantastic to work with and I've Learned so much from and has really helped my brand but at the same time there have been a lot more that have been just awful and yes my book has been on the shelves of Barnes and noble but when it's on the shelves at an indie bookstore I promote them like crazy and I shout it from the rooftops because I know that they're like me they're just trying to make it and I want them to succeed so we can succeed together so let's dive into this scenario the indie bookstore is saying  when the author's books don't sell or people don't show up for the event they can't make any money off of it and for a traditionally published author you're pretty much facing the same consequences if you buy a whole bunch of copies of the book for people to come out for the event and people bought the book elsewhere no one makes any money from that event when indie authors do it a lot of times what will happen is that the bookstore will return all those books that they bought or offer to sell them back to the indie author and the authors will end up having to pay for that they will lose money so there is risk on both sides and that's just how business works if you're taking a risk by hosting an author event and getting all of those books in you're still taking the risk that people might not show up and as an author especially as an indie author you're taking a risk that you might have to pay back that money or that you've just wasted a whole bunch of your time the author and the bookstore should be in this together they should both be promoting the event and they should both hope that people turn out and drive sale when people turn out they both win if they don't turn out the bookstore shouldn't be scrambling to make the best of it while the author gets nothing for the time that they're donating people have mentioned that the bookstore is spending more money and is taking a greater risk than the author because they have staff and bills to pay and they're providing snacks and while sometimes this is a risk most times and especially with indie bookstores it's more likely that they're doing these signings during normal business hours so the staff would be there anyways the bills to pay would still exist and often times it's the author who brings the snack and in this particular case there were no snacks to speak up if we look at how larger bookstores do these signings like Barnes Noble you buy the book to get a seat or a place in line to attend the event you can't get in line to get a sign copy without a wristband you can't get a wristband without buying a book any bookstores could easily do that too but for some reason this one chose not to and hide behind the excuse of people are bringing in outside books and they can't stop it by working together with the author to ensure that nobody without a wristband get the signed copy of the book then you can prevent people from bringing their own outside copies of the book because they'll need to buy the book to get a wristband if indie bookstores would treat authors fairly and yes some do it would be so much better for them because they would encourage their readers to buy from an indie store versus buying on Amazon this would not only help bookstores sell more of that particular authors books but also other books that readers might discover while they're in the store but so long as these bookstores are only focused on their own goal and continue to demonstrate to authors they don't care and this is not a partnership they're not gonna get any return from the author and while there are cases like if it's a really big author and you're trying to limit the amount of people who are attending the event that I understand that you're selling and you have like an entrance fee or something it doesn't make sense when you're trying to attract more people to assign it I'm pretty sure that all artists can agree that exposure does not equal sales and donating your time and expertise for someone who's just profiting off you while all you get is exposure is only helpful to the person who is getting the money as an author I know of course I'm biased but I also always always support my local indie bookstore and I love them to pieces and they supported me in return so let me know in the comments below if you agree or disagree and let's continue this discourse",

It\u2019s called \u201cThe Man Who Laughs\u201d.  Look it up if you haven't yet. It\u2019s fantastic. But \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d. Disney's \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d. Not only did that film make me give my little eight-year-old heart to Quasimodo because he was the first character with disabilities that I came across who wasn't like a magical creature, like a troll or a dwarf or something, but he was one of my first, most intense Disney childhood crushes. Oh, my gods, I love that man. He can sing, he is a skilled craftsman, he is an absolute sweetheart. If need be, he can whisk you away to the cathedral to save you. He is a deep, spiritual person who learns over the course of his story that those of us with disabilities and other marginalized outcasts, we are the faces of the divine, too. Oh, my goodness, I loved Quasimodo so much! I had a little handheld puppet of him. I collected every little bit of \u201cThe Hunchback of Notre Dame\u201d merch I could possibly find. I should have saved it, because it's hard to find nowadays. I was like, \u201cEsmeralda girl, you love Phoebus, you wanna go out and be with him? Great. All the happiness in the world to you. I will gladly take Quasimodo for myself.\u201d He is 100% marriage material, abso-fucking-lutely.",

This book is just different than any other book I've really read. The narration is funny, witty, sarcastic, and that's my kind of humor. But there's also mystery and thriller aspects, and you don't really know what's going on until you do know what's going on. So it's a fun reading that's a quick paste read, and I really enjoyed it. And this author has another book that they released, um, that I picked up, and I can't wait to read that. May. What was your favorite in April?",

You don't even deserve to say that woman's name, okay? Put some respect on that queen right there. She would never in a million fucking years sit with your ass. And you don't even deserve that.

You think people who consume books with their eyes are superior to people who consume them with their ears. I mean, you would be wrong, and that's why the joke's not funny. I mean, I get it, I get it. Maybe I'm a stick in the MUD here, but audiobooks are a totally valid way to consume literature, and they're not inferior to paper books or Kindle books. They are appropriate technology and accessibility for people with all kinds of disabilities, from dyslexia to other learning disabilities to visual impairment. I mean, the diss here is really to audiobooks and audiobook listeners for comparing them to Drake. We can consume literature in a huge diversity of ways. Would you say if someone reads a book with their hands using Braille that that is inferior to reading it with their eyes? No. So why would you say that listening to a book and consuming it that way is inferior to reading it with your eyes? Ableism just isn't funny. And having books read to you versus reading them yourself are both valid ways to enjoy literature.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm not gonna blame your 8th grader. Obviously. This is the cover of Ice Breaker, right? I've said it once, I'll say it again, DJ. The reason that they do that is specifically because they don't wanna be harassed. Readers don't wanna be harassed. If this was like Grandma's Harlequin novel with a model kissing, with two models kissing on the front, how many times would they reader have to deal with some person coming up and harassing them for what they were reading? There's no reason for that, but it happens quite often. So over the last 10 to 15 years, those kind of covers have become more than normal. Now, you're gonna argue that it's disgusting, that it's consensual. As far as I know, it's consent. That's kind of important where it comes to intimacy. Now, in so far as, say, dark romance. Yeah, you need to be very careful. But that should be on the adults. It should be on the adults, the parents, to actually read the book first and determine whether it's good for a child to read that. If they don't want their child reading that, don't buy it. Read the synopsis, read trigger warnings on the inside, read to actually know what is going on with the book. Are you okay with your child being exposed to that? Now, in the case of a lot of dark romance, that's gonna be a no. But in the case of romance, I'd argue it's a Hell of a lot better than watching Porn. Porn? Excuse me? I'm gonna get banned for that. Eh, maybe. Maybe not. Point B. Too many sixth graders today have been exposed to adult topics and adult intimacy without the topic of consent, without the understanding of the birds and the bees. And what an enthusiastic yes is. Keep that in mind. Oh, all right, y'all take it easy.",

And I was like, do I wanna reread the click series? The answer is yes. So I started doing it. And then revenge of the wannabes, for whatever reason, is the only book that has a freaking hold on it. So I had to wait for that book. And I was like, I wonder what else Lizzie Harrison wrote. And I see the Alpha series. So I go look at it and I'm like, oh, my goodness. This is the freaking book that I've been looking for. So I call my sister and I'm like, do you remember that video I made, like, almost a year and a half ago where I was saying I could not think of this book, and it had, like, the clear gladiator sandals and all this stuff? My sister was like, oh, yeah. You mean the Alpha's book? The one that has, like, sky and Ali A who's pretending to be Ali J, and, um, Charlie and Darwin and the People, like, can't date the sons of the woman who's in charge. And I was like. She was, like, rattling off the entire plot of all three of the books in the series, and I was like, where were you 15 months ago? And she was like, yeah, I think about that series, like, once every three months. I was like, are you freaking kidding me? All that to say? I finally figured out what the book was, so yay!

You're gonna have people breaking shit that can't be repaired or replaced. See these cute little vases right here? Yeah, I got them about six years ago from a very dear friend of mine who was traveling through Canada and found them at an artist alley. They're vintage and irreplaceable due to the sentimental value. I am woman enough to admit that I would knock those shits off the shelf three times in a row if it meant that you were gonna come and fix them because you promised me you would. So I know that this is kind of a universal truth but I feel like it really applies here: Don't go making promises that you can't keep, because you will find yourself indentured to a woman that's put forks in the microwave and Googles how to explode the dishwasher. \"Stuff just keeps breaking!\" \ud83d\ude27 \"It's so silly!\" \ud83e\udd2a \"How does that happen??\" \ud83e\udd14 It's you.

And I want to use it as a reference point as to why so many Z!0s feel emboldened to behave the way that they do. So, caste is an ingrained hierarchal classification of peoples, and in the United States that's largely based on (visibly identifiable) race. And according to the Pew Research Center, the majority of J\u20acw!sh people in the United States identify as \u25fb\ufe0f. So, this self-identification- they believe - affords them protections of that caste. Now, we know that supremacists of the Casper \ud83d\udc7b variety don't believe that J\u20acws belong in the same level of caste that they do, but at this time, they are willing to put that aside for the sake of common interest. That common interest is a continued suppression of peoples of lower caste. And in this instance, we know that those people of lower caste are POC. They\u2019re Ar*b. They\u2019re \ud83c\udf49. They\u2019re \ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffc. So, it's almost the \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is my friend\u201d.",

Then lastly, we had A curse for True Love by Stephanie Garber, and I also read that one. The next book was Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, and I did not read that one. But after that was the twin by Natasha Preston. I did read that one. And then I said the, uh, king of pride by Anna Huang, and I did read that one. Then I also said throttled by Lauren Asher, and I also read that one. Now, the last one was still beating by Jennifer Hartman. Why is that so hard for me? Um, anyway, I did not read that one. So I originally said I wanted to read eight books. I actually read six of them. So I kind of killed it this month. Not to pat myself on the back or anything, but I did great. And those last two will likely be on my TBR for may, but we'll see. We'll see what kind of mood I'm in, but I think this is a success for April.",

It is of the utmost importance for us to deconstruct in our hearts and minds the lies that have been taught to us concerning Africa through a Westernized, Eurocentric viewpoint. Now, a great book to read that will help begin that process of decolonization and deconstruction, is a book by Walter Rodney called \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" this is a great book, that will increase your understanding concerning world history, African history, how things came to be.

    "voice_to_text": "so a lot of people are making fun of that choice and yes I get it but the search on that video is Octavia Butler which is telling me that this is maybe a lot of people's first time hearing about Octavia Butler so I would like to do my part and tell people some ideas of where to start with her work if you are unfamiliar with her Octavia butler was a science fiction author and in addition to just writing phenomenal works of fiction she explored a lot of themes of race and power dynamics and just like what it means to be human and exist in our world if I am convinced that anyone is a time traveller or a prophet it is Octavia Butler she knew what was coming for us and she tried to warn us and we didn't listen but we can look back on her work and see what it can tell us about the future if you are a fan of dystopian fiction I think you should read a parable of the sower and its sequel  parable of the talents I mean I think everyone should read this I think you should be required to read it um this one has a forward by Gloria Steinem  if you're looking for them in the wild this cover or ones that look like this maybe a little bit more common parable series was a series of books that was published in the 90s but takes place in the mid 2020s um it takes place on earth after it has experienced like an environmental and political collapse and follows a teenager Lauren as she kinda has to find her own way in the world I don't have words for what this these books mean to me they are phenomenal and so meaningful but also just so fast paced and like you won't be able to put them down the parable series was actually intended to be a trilogy but unfortunately Octavia Butler died before completing the final book Parable of the Trickster if you are a fan of historical fiction or time travel novels I would read Kindred and I cannot find my copy of it right now um this follows Dana who is a black woman who keeps getting transported back in time from the 1970s to the 19th century antebellum slavery south um and every time she gets transported back she stays for a longer period of time A little more removed from our own world I've actually only read the first one right now  but this is about like a race of aliens and their plans for humanity after a nuclear disaster basically destroys earth and while being like alien science fiction it also deals with themes of like power dynamics and just like what it means to be human and it just it'll make you think it'll keep you hooked and it is it's phenomenal that is all the Octavia Butler work that I have read but I know that a lot of her other work I think it's also kind of alien based science fiction so if you're interested in that you should look into her other work and if you are a fan of vampire stories then you should read fledgling plus if you're a fan of short stories or kind of just like dabbling in the science fiction genre I would read Octavia's Brood which is a collection of short stories that were inspired by Octavia Butler's work the tagline is Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements they are all great and one of them is written by LaVar Burton all this to say that Octavia Butler was a visionary and a writer of immense talent and I hope that Rebecca Yarros\u2019s I think very well intentioned gaffe introduces more people to Octavia's work",
