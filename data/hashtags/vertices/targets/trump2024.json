Thank god. This man is so smart, he made sure those appointed. Um. Uh, uh. The Supreme Court Justices were put in place because of things like this. Things like this. And you think Republicans and conservatives are uneducated? You just wait. The true verdict will be on November 5th, 2024. That'll be the verdict.",

And everyone that watches my videos knows that I don't take a Republican side, I don't take a Democrat side, I don't take a conspiracy theory side. I just take the side of common sense. And common sense tells me that this is insane. I mean, we're literally living in Sri Lanka at this point. This is what dictators do of third world countries to their political opponents. This is what Putin does. And if this exact same situation was happening to a Democrat right now, any Democrat, I would be saying the same thing. Because it's wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it's also entirely hypocritical, because people that were a part of this trial were saying that the voters of Donald Trump deserve to know this information before they voted for him in 2016, in 2020. So why don't the voters get to know about Hillary Clinton's 36,000 emails then? That's so hypocritical. Why didn't the voters get to know about Hunter Biden's laptop? Why didn't the voters get to know about hunter and Joe Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and what 10% for the big guy meant? And again, I'm trying to come out of a place of common sense here as an independent voter. I wanna know what Joe and Hunter's emails were about now. I wanna know what Hillary Clinton's emails were about now. As much as I wanna know about this Donald Trump shit. So you cannot say the voters deserve to know about this without saying the voters deserve to know about all of the other stuff that the Democrats also did. It's hypocritical."

If he was really caring about our country and really caring about our Constitution, he wouldn't be trying to undermine the trial against them in our justice system. And if he really cared about the country, he wouldn't have tried to interfere with the 2016 election by covering up his affair with an adult actress illegally so his election prospects wouldn't be harmed.

He has not been sentenced yet. And I still find it highly unlikely that they would give him jail or prison time for these charges. Putting Trump in prison would just be way too complicated. He still has a Secret Service detail, and these charges aren't the most serious, but let's face it, it's a lot of felonies, even for a dude like me who has a lot of felonies. What I still find to be the most likely scenario is that he's either gonna get probation, possibly a suspended sentence, maybe some house arrest. But even that would be complicated. And I'm not sure exactly how it would work because he's campaigning to be the president of the United States, and they have to be careful not to do anything that could be interpreted as election interference. What do you guys think? Will this affect the way that any of you guys vote? Because it seems to me like the people who wanna vote for Trump aren't gonna care if he's a felon or not.

As we are now getting the information, uh, from the jury, we're up to 18 counts. 19 guilty. Remember, we have 34 here. 20 guilty. And again, these counts were very similar. What they were looking at, it was different occurrences, essentially, of the same crime, a misdemeanor that was elevated, uh, by being linked to a felony, uh, to an underlying crime. We are now 24 counts in all, guilty. From inside, this is what we are hearing from our producers. Up to 26 guilty. Now, remember, each of these counts could maximum have four years in jail. Um, President Trump would be considered a first time offender. These are non violent crimes. Uh, so it seems that it is unlikely the judge would sentence him to prison. But we are now up to 31 counts. Guilty. Out of 34. 32 guilty. Also coming in from inside the courtroom are producers now saying 33 and 34. They're saying guilty on all 34 charges.

It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in the sky. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls insurrection to storm the capital. Patriots! Patriots! If re elected, he wants to pardon, quote every one of them. Let me ask you, what do you think it would have done on January 6th if black Americans had stormed. Think about this. What they would have happened if black Americans had stormed the capital. I don't think he'd be talking about pardons. It's the same guy wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five guilty even though they were exonerated. He's that landlord who denies housing application because of the color of your skin. He's that guy who won't say Black Lives matter and invokes neo Nazi third right terms we all remember. Trump is the same guy who unleashed birthism, the birth of his lie against Barack. Thank you, President Joe Biden, for pointing out how racist Donald Trump and his supporters are. You all know it. If black folks would have assaulted The democracy the way you Trump supporters did. You would have demanded they bring the electric chair if it was Barack Obama who did. You would have insisted they take the electric chair to the White House. So spare me this fake outrage you got about oh, doing a little jail time. You're all a bunch of liars and hypocrites. Addition is treasonous traitors!

    "voice_to_text": "Hmm. So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date.",

We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate Hustler masquerading as a big shot. A two bit playboy, lying his way into the tabloids, pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself. He was calling it as himself poor himself, to fool the press into inflating his net worth. A clown. But this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns. We have them all over the city.

No way he doesn't get blood on his hands. No, he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion, an inference, and his gang robles and follows his obvious order. It's no surprise that the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are falling under Biden. And now he's promising to use our own military to attack US citizens. That's the tyrant. That's the tyrant he's telling us he'll be. And believe me, he needs it. When Trump ran in two 2016, it was like a joke. This buffoon running for president? Nah, never could happen. We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing. Now, this is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all. We don't wanna wake up after the election saying, what, again? My God, what the hell have we done? We can't have that happen again. Yesterday was Memorial Day. It's a good time to reflect on how Americans fought and died so that we may enjoy the freedoms guaranteed to us by a democratic government. A government that is. President Lincoln said of the people, By the people, for the people. Shall not perish from the earth. Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth. I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait. Maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it. That's over. That's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave. He will never leave. You know that he will never leave. What does that mean? Is that the country we wanna live in? Do we want him running this country and saying, I'm not leaving, I'm dictator for life? I hope this new ad campaign.

And he said, they've got to get the hostages. They have to go get the hostages. Hostages have to be a priority. And then he said, and none of this ever would have happened if the 2020 election wasn't rigged. Was a rigged election, a stolen election. He didn't get animated talking about the return of Israeli hostages or what was going on inside the Gaza Strip. He only got animated and energized when he was talking about the 2020 election being rigged and stolen. He doesn't care about that. He cares about the 2020 election, and he knows. He knows it wasn't rigged. He knows it was not stolen. He knows that. He has known that since the beginning. He has known that since the beginning. But, yeah, his grievances are the only thing that matter to him. That his grievances matter to him more than his own children matter to him. Certainly more than his own supporters matter to him. He's disgusted by his own supporters. He thinks they're disgusting people. He wouldn't. He doesn't touch them. He doesn't shake hands. With his supporters ever? Not unless they've got a membership tomorrow Lago or are a billionaire donor. Those are the only supporters of his who he will touch. He doesn't. He's a politician who doesn't shake hands.

I am not affected by your booze because I've seen what makes you cheer me. To take your criticism to heart, I'd first have to value your opinion. And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions.

I'm sorry, but it has to be said, these older women who are in their 40s, 50s, even 60s, wanna be seen so bad and want attention that they are in competition with these younger girls. These women wasted their years, wasted their youth, and are doing any and everything to be seen. And they're not teaching the young girls. So instead of teaching the young girls to do better, you're trying to compete with her. You are in denial that you're getting older. You're doing things with your body, driving for attention, over sexualizing yourself at that age, all because you don't wanna accept the fact that you mess up your life. They don't have husbands, which they really wanted. They're realizing that, oh, wow, I'm at an age where nobody's checking for me. The men are not checking for me at 50, 60 years old. Unfortunately, they're looking at the younger women who do desire marriage, who do desire to have children, who are not just out here. So instead of. Again, I'm gonna try to find a way to be seen and encourage the young girls to do what I'm doing, because I don't want them to. To surpass me. That's what's actually happening. These older women are sitting around telling the young girls, no, girl, live your life, do you? Because you're intimidated by her. You don't want her to do better than You. You don't want her to have a chance? You want the chance because you see the. The men are looking at the younger girls, that the men are more attractive and. And more desirable of the younger women. And it's sad. This. This is the reality of where we are. The older generation is jealous and intimidated and in competition with the younger generation. And it's unfortunate."

See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome."

Um, but why is everyone wearing a mask? So they're making it harder for you to vote by mail. The same way, I might add, to the 2020 election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House in Florida. The White House in Florida. What is he talking about?

    "view_count": 103287,
    "voice_to_text": "California. What the fuck is with the stoplights on your own ramps? So I went to San Jose for work last week, and I saw something that I've never seen in any other state. Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights. Somebody from California explain this to me.",

Cause remember, the Democrats are putting out the message he's not welcome in the South Bronx. That's not the message I got. Look, Donald Trump is set to make a historic visit right here in the South Bronx. I decided to pop in and talk to some people who are gonna be there to see why they're excited about the former president coming to their neighborhood. I think that's amazing. I think it's epic. That's the best thing ever. Are you gonna go? Yeah. How will he be received here? Open arms. Really open arms. Everybody go show love. You come show love. They gonna show you love right back. If I do see him, you know, it's. It's a what's up? And thank you for doing what you did. 50 fifty. Honestly. People gonna have some love and hate. Some people do love them, but. Assets to perform as better than Joe Biden. Was life in the Bronx better under Donald Trump or under Joe Biden? It was better under Donald Trump. Um, I can tell you that the Bronx has been through many changes. Everything was getting back on track, and then, you know, everything is like, falling apart again. You know, she isn't gonna walk in the street. Our children have been killed. Uh, groceries. When you go to grocery store, you. You can't even buy Anything anymore. Everybody needs help. People need housing. Instead of giving migraines and everybody that's coming from other countries help, we here, we Americans, give us some help. As you know, they're giving all the money to the immigrants. Not that much, but. Okay. It's not that. It's not. I'm not against that. No, the problem is they're cutting our stuff. What can Biden do at this point? Nothing. Even he did something. The we're beyond the point of north turn when it's. Everybody's on the Trump train. I'm a Democrat. All my life I've been a Democrat. But Democrats have use us and abuse us, and they think that they own us. And Donald Trump, he's giving most opportunity. Black people and Hispanic people are very happy about him coming. Coming here, and they wanna see the options and they wanna put pressure on Democrats to step their game up. And maybe Republicans have an opportunity here. They cannot let go. What's your advice to Trump? My advice to Trump? Just to be himself, to be, um, relatable. Don't change. Don't switch up, because they're trying to take you down here. You got out of the president, you know, you. You was in the White House. A lot of people wasn't. A lot of people want your spot. Come to the park and, you know, keep it real with the people. Just let us know exactly what you're gonna do for everyone. Not just the Hispanic community, not just the black And the minority communities. But for America. Because when America succeeds, we all succeed.",

Nikki Haley was given the perfect opportunity to do the right thing and say that she's supporting President Biden because she cares about democracy and she cares about America, but she chose not to. She chose to bow down to Donald Trump and all these MAGA lunatics. And remember, Donald Trump is the same person who made fun of her military husband who is serving abroad. She even went on to say that Donald Trump disrespected the sacrifice of military families, and yet she's voting for him. Trump is also the same guy who called her bird brain on the campaign trail, sent her a bird cage after doing it, and she's still voting for Donald Trump. And finally, she's the same person who called Donald Trump a disaster and that so many Republicans are just too afraid to say that out loud and that she feels no need to kiss the ring. Well, now she's kissing the ring. She's voting for Donald Trump. This is the Republican Party. They don't care about our democracy, don't care about the rule of law, don't care about the people. All they care about is their Careers and bowing down to Donald Trump.",

Nearly 42 grand in legal expenses after he tried and failed to sue the company for accurately reporting on legal filing stipulating he'd secretly drugged his pregnant mistress with an abortion pill. The people that he's surrounding himself with, I mean, if the jury knows anything about them, and maybe they don't know the Details of some of these allegations against each of these individuals, but they're not. He's not surrounding himself with Angels, but rather Hells Angels. Very true. And literally."

I say to myself, you're a freaking genius. Hey, look, I had an uncle, my father's brother, who's the longest serving president. He's the longest serving professor in the history of MIT. He graduated. He was a phenomenal student, a real genius. Really brilliant guy. And, you know, I believe in the racehorse theory. Fast horses produce fast horses. He went to. Yeah. So, first of all, Donald Trump calling himself a genius when he's the same guy who looked at an eclipse without sunglasses on. His college professor called him the worst student he ever had. He doesn't know how to spell the word coffee is hilarious. But then he goes, my uncle's longest serving president. Then he pauses, he flails his arms around. He doesn't really know what's going on. Then he says, professor at MIT, this man is not fit to serve. If Joe Biden did this exact same thing, it would be front page news on Fox News for a week. But since Donald Trump does it and malfunctions a little bit, Republicans don't care. They brush it off. Trump is not well. He is not able to actually lead this country."

It seems like he had a bit of an emergency there or something like this. Reminded me of the time that Mitch McConnell froze in the podium, and I disagree with Mitch McConnell, but I'm thankful that he's okay. That looks very similar to me. He looked confused. He didn't really know where he was or what he was saying. I think this is incredibly concerning. Like, Donald Trump's ability to serve is certainly in question. He's stumbling over his words. He's falling asleep every single day in court, and he's doing stuff like this at his rallies. It's just happening far too often. So I don't know.

I think at one point you vowed never to come back to Minnesota after you lost the state in 2020. Is this a signal that you think you have a realistic chance to win the state of Minnesota in 2024? Well, I never said I'd never come back. I never even thought of that. I thought I won in 2020 easily. He actually did say it at a rally in Duluth in September of 2020 and appeared to be joking. I lose Minnesota, I'm never coming back. I don't care. I'm never coming back. Trump lost Minnesota by Seven Points in 2020. Yeah, so there's two options here. Either one, Donald Trump is lying. He knows that. He said he wouldn't come back to the state of Minnesota if he lost it in 2020, which he did. Or two, he's so mentally gone and as mentally deteriorated that he doesn't remember saying it. And I think both options are equally as likely. But I love to see it. I love to see Donald Trump getting fact checked in these interviews. Cause when he goes on Fox News or he goes on Newsmax or these other far right outlets, they never push back on his lies cause they're just a talking head for his campaign. He does this like independent media, these Smaller news channels. He gets fact checked like he did right there. Donald Trump is a serial liar and he has to be called out for it.",

He looks pretty when he sleeps. Oh, my. That is one of the most strange and weird things I've heard come from an elected member of our government. Seriously. But really trying to say that he's just praying when he's falling asleep in court. You have all these reporters watching him fall asleep, his lawyers trying to wake him up, having to shake him, and you think he's praying? They will do anything to defend Donald Trump. I really hope that we can all agree that we can't have these MAGA Republicans in government anymore. It's just too strange and too crazy."

Someone tried to assassinate the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, shooting him five times after a political event. He's currently in the hospital recovering from surgery and is expected to live in the United States. Another barge crashed into another bridge, this time in Galveston, Texas. The bridge remains standing, but the barge was carrying 30,000 gallons of oil, which is now leaking into the surrounding waters. The reported reason for the accident is that the current was bad, the tide was high, and the captain just lost control. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinkin announced today that the US would be sending another $2 billion worth of aid to Ukraine. And it's still pending congressional approval, but the Biden administration has announced a plan to send another billion dollars worth of weapons to Israel. Follow me if you give a shit. I have an additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine. And we put this together in a first of its kind, uh, Defense Enterprise Fund. And it has three components. Uh, one is to provide weapons today, uh, so this will assist Ukraine and acquiring those weapons. Two is to focus as well on something that Demetro just talked about. Investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base, helping to strengthen even more its capacity to produce what it needs for itself, but also to produce for others. And Finally using this fund to help Ukraine purchase military equipment from other countries, not just the United States, for Ukraine's use.",

Let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. And in addition to this video, Biden put out a statement saying that he accepted the June 27th debate offer from CNN. And he accepted the second offer from ABC to have a debate with Donald Trump on September 10th. And then, well, Donald Trump accepted the dates. Well, so there will be two presidential debates as of now. And President Biden is right. He beat Donald Trump in the debates in 2020, and he's gonna do it again in 2024. And look, my prediction is that Donald Trump is not gonna show up for these debates. He's a terrible debater. He's gotten significantly worse since 2016 and even 2020, when people see how crazy he is in comparison to Joe Biden, who has done a lot of good stuff and is sane, they won't like him very much anymore.

That be all that we talked about. These aren't normal times. We've got a former president on 34 criminal charges. And Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, he's a Democrat. He's on trial as we speak. In fact, they're trying to pick the jury right now. But Bob Mendez is guilty as a motherfucker in spite of the fact that he's a Democrat and he will be going to jail. It's funny how it takes a back seat to all the other crazy bullshit that's going on. And that's one of the troubles with having Donald Trump in the mix. He overshadows everything. And there are things we should be watching out for, but he drags our attention away. So while we have a day off from the criminal trial in Manhattan district, you maybe need to focus on Bob Menendez, cause he is a problem. He is a grifter, he is corrupt, he's criminal and he's a Democrat. And he's currently on trial. Picking the jury. Now, the trial probably take four or five weeks, and that motherfucker is going to jail.",

Sometimes I wonder if Donald Trump's lawyers paid attention in law school. Here's a little tip for Donald Trump and his lawyers. If you don't want a case in New York City against you in criminal court, don't commit crimes in New York City, because that's where the alleged conduct took place. If he commits a crime in New York City, you're not gonna have a trial in Alabama. What? Like if you or I were to commit a crime on the east coast, you're not gonna have a trial on the west coast? That makes no sense. Like, basic stuff. And also for all the MAGA Republicans out there, Donald Trump's lawyers had a say in jury selection. They picked those jurors as well. So unless you think that Donald Trump's lawyers intentionally picked bad jury members to hurt him, then the process is fair, and Alina Haba and Donald Trump's lawyers should stop complaining.",

Let's say that today is your college graduation day, and you are in your cap and gown, and you're sitting there, you're so excited. You're thinking back on all the years and the effort and the studying and the tests and the sacrifices that you have put in to get to this day, to finally receive your degree. And just before they start calling names to hand out degrees, this is the speech that you hear for the ladies present today. Congratulations on an amazing accomplishment. You should be proud of all that you have achieved to this point in your young lives. I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her location as a wife. And as a mother, I'm on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school. What? Converts to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Hole maker. Translation. Hey, ladies. Congratulations on all your hard work. You can come up here and grab your degree, but the kitchen and the man that you're supposed to make a sandwich for is back that way. You've made a bad decision. What was that? And how were people not stopping him? Oh, by the way, he is an NFL kicker. He kicks footballs for a living. Yeah. Would that make you upset, or is it just me?"

That those degrees ain't shit, and they need to just wife up and push babies out. This man is a professional football player. He can afford to have his wife stay at home and not work. Going to a college class and telling them that, really, it was diabolical what was done to you. You've been bamboozled. You shouldn't have gotten this degree. Like, does the college and understand that if you're telling people they shouldn't enroll and they should just wife up, that they're all lose money. And the reason we are seeing birth rates decline is because most people can't afford to fucking live, let alone live on one income. Because most people aren't married to professional football players."

You don't hear stormy you don't hear Mcdougall you don't hear this you don't hear it's because of that that it's so compelling the lack of detail shows the familiarity with this now he says this Trump told him don't worry how long you think it'll be on the market not long he wasn't thinking about Melania this was all about the campaign I have said I don't love this case I think it reeks of politics I think it makes the other cases that matter more in DC and in Georgia look less now by comparison But legally \u2014 the real ground for reasonable doubt which will hang this jury or maybe get an acquittal lies in the difference between these two stories which one do they think is really Cohen's truth did he do this and then he got jammed up and he had to save himself so he's saying Trump new or is what you hear on that video on that audio the reality there's a third possibility Trump knew about it but he was doing these things all the time and he didn't care about the campaign just for his own personal reputation could they believe that",

    "voice_to_text": "If you know literally anybody that lives anywhere across the entire East Coast, you might wanna watch this video, because experts are now warning that there's a giant invasive spider that's coming. Scientists are now warning that there's a giant invasive juro spider with 6 foot webs that could be poised to take over US cities. So fun. Thank you. If you don't know what a Zorro spider is, they're basically a species of orb weaving spiders, which is a group known for creating highly symmetrical circular webs. Cute. Also saying that your host spiders can build unique webs that could be more than 6 feet long and appear golden when they reflect sunlight. Okay, just to make this a little bit better for you, whenever the eggs hatch in spring, the baby spiders create parachute like webs that enable them to fly up to 100 miles away from where they were born. Doro spiders are actually supposed to be in Asia, but they were recently found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Then by the way, experts are believing that these invasive individuals were accidentally brought to the US inside a shipping container. So as of right now, these spiders have been spotted in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. And they've also been spotted in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. So good luck. I give you these news roundups every day, so make sure you add me and come back to me tomorrow.",

Donald Trump just said that the Republicans shouldn't come to the courthouse with him. They should stay in Congress and pass policies to block the charges against him. Really? You know, that's a very strange thing for someone to say who claims that they're totally innocent, right? I mean, Donald Trump says he hasn't done anything wrong, there's no crime. So he would have no problem going to trial because he's gonna be exonerated, right? He doesn't need any policy blocking it from happening. Oh, wait. Donald Trump knows he's guilty, and he needs somebody to step in to save him. He is quite literally trying to get the government to interfere with his trials, something we don't do here in the United States of America. But in Donald Trump's ideal world, where he's a dictator, that happens all the time. This man is so dangerous for democracy, I can't even put into words how bad a second Trump term would be. Don't fall for this. Don't fall for his incoherent garbage."

I don't think there was a pivotal moment. However, there's been lots of little moments that have added up to a large awakening of a lot of men in regards to whether or not it's worth it to chase women. Seems like guys can just put the bare minimum and not even really put an effort anymore. They don't really care to. Well, what's considered to be the bare minimum seems to change on a daily basis. So how can anyone truly know what the bare minimum even is? why don't girls just go and make the first move and make the effort? That's an excellent question indeed. Why don't they? Did it become a thing now? It's like roll reversal where they expect girls to be making the first moves, yearning for a guy and chasing him. I imagine that happens somewhere around the same time that a lot of women were indicating to men that they want them to leave them alone. So. And a lot of cases, they got exactly what they asked for. That is, I feel like the downfall of why it's so hard to meet someone. Cause men don't put an effort anymore, don't care to put an effort. But why should they when the possible benefits of pursuing women Are often far outweighed by the risk that they undertake in pursuing those same women. It's honestly just not worth it for a lot of men to pursue women, especially when so many women want to be seen as independent and left alone.",

And, of course, they've opened a lot of offices in democratic counties, such as Milwaukee right there. You can see some here up there as well. But only 14 out of the Biden's 46 field offices are in counties that he won in 2020. The other 32 are in counties that Donald Trump won, making inroads with a lot of the Trump voters and the independents who lean more conservative. And on top of this, Biden has more campaign staff and more field offices in Wisconsin and in every single swing state than Donald Trump and his campaign does. Biden campaign is quite literally squeezing Trump and his campaign of all their resources. They're making sure to hold down the democratic counties, make sure to win those votes, but they're also going after Trump voters. And these moderate Republicans and these independents live in these more conservative counties. Donald Trump has not made the same outreach. And of course, on top of this, Biden and his campaign have a lot more money than Trump and his campaign, allowing them to do stuff like this. The Trump Campaign is spiraling",

Spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending far in borders. For all those predictions of doom and gloom, here's where we stand. Do you want to use the word recession or depression? And you know Biden. He can't stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can't even find his way off the stage without a look.

And we had a woman get arrested because of the portal for blocking people from seeing the screen. We had a flip off battle between Dublin and New York where people were flipping each other off, which started on Dublin side. A man also decided to do this in front of the portal, surprising everyone on the New York side. And now, out of disrespect, someone decided to show a picture of September 11 on Dublin side again. This all happened in under a week, and they're contemplating on doing something back to Dublin because of this. Many are also wanting the portal to be removed, specifically. Typically after this incident, now people are not happy. And all the problems we had regarding the portal surprisingly seem to be coming from Dublin. These problems, however, were anticipated, and it's the reason why the portal won't be up for much longer. Right now, it's scheduled to be removed in November. And many are glad that it's gonna be gone since it's been causing nothing but problems. And who knows, we might be getting the removal date even earlier if something crazier happens.",

The deputy orders him to step back and then fire. Occaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aiden says his department released the video to be transparent. I want to assure you that we are not hiding, covering up, or taking action that would result in a rush to judgment of Mr. Fortson or our deputy. Fortson's mother, says her son was facetiming with his girlfriend during the shooting. A portion of that Facetime video, which appears to be after the shooting, was released by the family's attorney. Law enforcement can be heard talking about Fortson's injuries. The subtitles were added by CBS News. They just see. Oh yeah, he shadow. He shadow. My baby was shadow. Fortson's family claims the deputy had no reason to go to his apartment. The sheriff says his deputy went to the apartment he was directed to. In other words, contradictory accounts.

    "voice_to_text": "So this person asked me, how did Obama and Clinton make my life better? Here's the difference between me and you and how we think. I understand that a president is not here to make my life better. I understand that a president is put in place to make conditions for the country better. So expecting a president to do things that benefit you is the first misconception of how government works. Um, you are actually supposed to make your life better. What have you done to make your life better? What has your mama done to make your life better? What has your daddy done to make your life better? And if you wanna look at your situation in particular, what has your local government done? And do you know who your local government officials are? Do you vote in local elections? What have they done to make your life better? While you worried about the president, let me give you a few reasons why being involved in local government has a more profound impact on your life. Services such as education, transportation, waste management, public safety, all of those things happen with local government. How those departments run are local governments. Those are local issues. Local government, they are more responsive to your concerns about any of those services that you should be getting. They're more responsive to homelessness in your community. They're more responsive to, you know, educational concerns that you have in your local community. Local Government manages budgets that impact the services that you are talking about. Infrastructure, education, special programs, homelessness, the police department, the fire department. How money is spent in your local community, that is a local government problem. That is what you need to be concerned about. How is local land being used? Parks, quality of life, services for seniors, services for the disabled, homeless services. All of those things are community development issues that need to be taken up with your local government. So if there's something that is not happening, then you are barking up the wrong tree when you are talking about the president. The president has no authority about what goes on in your local community. So when you're asking, what has Obama done for me? What has Clinton done? What has even Trump done? What? I live in this city, so this is what I'm concerned about. I'm not expecting them to make it good here. That's actually the residents here. That's. That's our job. It's to hold local government accountable. Okay, local. Are the streets paid? Is there trash all over the place? That is a local government issue. I worry about people that think that the president is supposed to be making things better for them. First of all, it negates the responsibility of you and your family to make things great for you and your family. I am a huge advocate of local government engagement because that is where the change starts. And That is where the biggest impact happens. Don't complain about it unless you are willing to do the work to help fix it. And local government is where the change begins.",

So you just showed your hypocrisy for everyone here to see, because you and the fakest true media are the ones saying Trump is a danger to our democracy.

Can't say that about them. That's derogatory. And that was a great opening segment. Lots of things to talk about there. Oh, and I agree with many, many things you said during. In fact, probably more than than most other candidates, um, when you're running for president. But I still would not have voted for you, um, because you're an Indian. We'll get back to that. Um, and Coulter told me flat out to my face that she couldn't vote for me, quote, because you're an Indian. Even though she agrees with me. The most other candidates, I disagree with her, but respect that she had the guts to speak her mind. Republican presidential candidates are completely lights on. No one's home.

In other words, Donald Trump lied to Judge Marshawn to try to get out of court for that day, claiming he had to go to Baron's high school graduation. But now it is revealed that he's going to be attending a fundraiser instead in Minnesota to raise money for his corrupt and crooked presidential campaign. What a terrible father Donald Trump is.

He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order. But again, understanding the gravity of that situation and really what it would go into and making that decision happen.",

Well, Sean, you know how the fake news works. Um, they leave out some or most of the facts of a story, they put the worst spin on it, and that's what's happened in this case. I hope people really do buy this book and they find out the truth of this story, because the truth of this story is that this was a working dog and it was not a puppy. Yeah, she's using the death of her dog that she caused to sell books. Disgusting, reprehensible. Nobody's buying your book. Stop. Nobody's buying your book. Nobody wants to hear about this. And then trying to justify it by saying, oh, well, it wasn't a puppy and it was a working dog. Get out of politics. Seriously, get out. I hope that this is something that Democrats and Republicans can actually agree on. Don't do stuff like this. Don't do it! It's evil.

He's not the same man. His energy is gone. No one can deny it. And Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he's starting to throw around the nuclear war. Terry, you heard that? Nuclear. You're learning. He cares about himself, not us. Sioux Falls. Thank you very much, Sioux Falls. We've all had parents who we loved, but who changed over the years. Needed help, needed understanding, needed care. Including Obama. I'll tell you what. You take a look at Obama and take with Trump. It's happening so fast. We can all see it. Now you do, too? Yeah. Yikes. Donald Trump is certainly not the same guy he was in 2016 or even 2020. The rapid decline we've seen in the past couple of years has been incredibly concerning. He's stumbling over his words, he's confusing people. He's falling asleep in court. I mean, this guy is not fit to serve. He is not the energetic guy that the MAGA cult makes him out to be. If Donald Trump can't stay awake in court, then how do we expect him to Be able to wake up at 3:00am and take that phone call and be able to head down to the situation room and deal with whatever's happening around the world or in the country. I certainly don't think he can do that. Trump is certainly not all there, and I hope, I really do hope that the Republicans can come to terms with that and be honest about it.",

This one in the middle being the incumbent. The election is next week, next month in may. All three of them, at a debate, agree on one particular thing, and that is that the country has a right to deport undocumented immigrants. The country is sovereign and has a right to protect its borders with Haiti. Why do all three of these presidential candidates agree? Because if they dared disagree, they know that they'd be going against the entire populace of the Dominican Republic. They would be going against the will of the people in the United States. We don't have a will of the people anymore. We have a will of the left and a will of the right, and we stand on each side of it and shout at the other side. Here there's unity. There's a sense of nationalism and a sense of patriotism. I hate all those words. Get, get bad raps and those that. That unity amongst the people creates actual logic amongst your political candidates. We don't have logic amongst political candidates the United States, because the people are illogical. A lesson once again from down here in the Dominican Republic on how you do it, how you unify as a people and how you recognize that you're a country with rights and a country needs to protect its borders, period."

I'm excited about it, and I also can't wait to see my Republican conference show their cards and show who we are, because voters deserve it. Is the Republican Party has. Have they finally Learned their lesson? Have they finally heard the message from voters back at home? Are they willing to actually fight, or are they gonna just keep going along to get along? Cause it's really easy to do that in Washington DC. See.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on Wednesday vowed to force a vote next week on Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s (R-LA) ouster, setting up a scenario in which Democrats will provide the votes needed to save a Republican speaker\u2019s job.   \u201cI think the American people need to see a recorded vote,\u201d the Georgia firebrand told reporters. \u201cI think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d   Hardline Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated with Speaker Johnson, pointing to him frequently turning to Democrats for their support in passing key legislation like Ukraine aid, government funding and FISA warrantless surveillance.   \u201cMike Johnson is giving them everything they want,\u201d Rep. Greene said. \u201cI find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson. And you want to know something? I want to see it happen.\u201d   Rep. Greene initially filed her motion to vacate last month, but held off on triggering a vote, trying to use it as leverage to wield influence over the speaker. When she makes the motion \u201cprivileged\u201d next week, it will require the House to act on it within two legislative days.   The House will likely vote on a motion to table the motion to vacate, which will require a simple majority to shelve the effort.   So far, only two other Republicans have joined Rep. Greene\u2019s effort \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ) \u2014 but given the GOP\u2019s very slim majority, that would likely be enough to strip the speaker of his gavel absent Democratic support.   House Democratic leaders on Tuesday announced they would vote to table the motion, saying it was time to \u201cturn the page\u201d on the chaos in the House that\u2019s been driven by the hardline faction of the Republican conference.   Rep. Greene acknowledged her motion is likely to fail but said it would serve to get lawmakers on record.   \u201cIf this vote fails and the whole conference, the whole Congress, supports the \u2018uniparty,\u2019 let me tell you something, that is not a failure, it\u2019s a win for the American people because that\u2019s a list of names,\u201d she said.   #marjorietaylorgreene #speakerofthehouse #mikejohnson #cspan  ",

Good move, Donnie. I mean, how could he make it worse than that? Oh, never look past daddy. He can make it worse. He was being interviewed by a local newsman, and they were talking about abortion in all these states that have made abortion illegal. And the news person asked, Donnie, what? Do you think they should monitor pregnant women so they don't go out of state and get an abortion or get a secret illegal abortion in their home state? Do you think they should monitor those pregnant women? What do you think? Donnie said, said, yeah, I think they should. I think they probably will. Well, Donnie, let's take all pregnant women and put them in a fucking gulag and watch them 24 seven. What is wrong with these people? Why do people have to infringe on the rights of women? What is it? Donald Trump is the top and everybody else around him wanna control everything about women. They're so afraid of women. Daddy, this isn't going to help you. This isn't going to help the Republicans either. This is how stupid they are. They keep embracing the things that are Going to kill them, and I'm glad they are, but, Jesus Christ, it's so fucking draconian.",

    "voice_to_text": "you know that video of Kamala going around with Drew Barrymore where she's like you know we need you to be the country's mamala yeah yeah okay so the thing that's driving me crazy and then I can't stop thinking about is the fact that like now a lot of people are like talking about it but this is the thing when Drew Barrymore first started that show I immediately got the ick from the way she interviewed her guest cause have you seen it I haven't okay because the what she does is she builds the premise of her entire show as if it's a revolutionary act to interview people like barefoot and like with her legs crossed because she's basically unmasking from like you know office culture you know and thinking that that's like some new crazy vulnerable thing but the thing that gives me the ick about it is that it's so performative and it like drives me crazy because like I really liked you Barrymore but when I first saw that show come out I I I remember being immediately put off you know because I'm very sensitive to like body language and it's such a perfect example to me about how we are so easily duped by the difference between performative niceness and like the actual integration of being kind do you know what I mean that's what we get fooled by politicians all the time because we'd rather see them do these things like oh look at their displays of niceness you know their tones and all their promises instead of like when it comes down to action the reason like I get like so heat up about this is because she proved me absolutely right I thought I was going crazy when it came down to the strikes you know what happened during the strikes okay so whenever there's like all these trucks going on like writers blah blah blah I'm like I'm a member of unions you know above anyone else Drew Barrymore should have known better she basically like stabbed everyone in the back you know what I mean and she continued on with her show and did not stand in solidarity with like the fellow like artists that like worked for her you know and that's crazy because number one she drew Barrymore she's like an actor she should have known better you know what I mean but number two the entire premise of her show the entire point of her show is that but we're having these conversations and we're listening in a different way like we're having real conversations and so I'm gonna get real and so to literally be that performative about it you know what I mean to put on that display and then to go on like when the time came and it mattered with action to sell out your own people and step over the picket line and like that is that is so low key crazy like that's actually wild because that's when it matters you know what I mean like that's the actual integration of like your knowledge of intersectionality and like nuance and everything and that is what happens that's why we get duped by politicians all the time like that that's that is like so crazy to me you know and I remember thinking that I was this is why I'm so hesitant and like very like wary of people that are so performative about like being you know announcing the essence of who they are because here's the thing like if you really are the essence of something you don't have to go around like announcing it all the time kind of like how really powerful leaders don't have to yell they can just whisper because everyone knows they're powerful you don't have to go around being like oh I'm so vulnerable I'm so you know I'm so sensitive and I listen to people because the minute I see people do that it reminds me of church people that's the problem with religion you know what I mean like I don't need to know I don't need to tone police you like I'd rather just care about your actions you know what I mean I'm not going around getting offended by like your tone and it's also really crazy too because if you really think about it it's so emotionally manipulative because like you cannot demand emotional vulnerability from somebody do you understand what I'm saying like just because you're crossing your legs and just because you have a really sweet tone of your voice and everything that doesn't mean that like you're not also be some people are not ready for that you know like emotional vulnerability is not something that you can demand of somebody it's something you kind of have to earn there has to be like you know a transaction there right and so it is energetically and physically very akin to like asking these the manipulative and like emotionally leading questions almost trying to get somebody to have a breakdown like back in the days when they would interview Britney Spears and she would be asked questions like but aren't you really sad like you know what I mean it's the same thing body language wise we just haven't gotten to that point in like you know society yet to where you can see even on like some of the interviews she does people are uncomfortable because that is not everybody's like comfort level and like the quickest way to shut somebody down is to keep pushing and keep pushing especially if they're already climbing up you know what I mean and that level of unawareness on top of like these actions it's just it it it just follows my mind there's and you know what she said do you know what she said literally when people ask her why are you literally going against what seems like what your entire show is about your entire image and like not like going on with the show she's and I'm paraphrasing but she said something to the effect of either the world or like the country at this moment she was like because you know the world needs our show right now it it's needed like the grandiosity of that do you know what I mean like that's so dangerous and that and I call it every time usually the people that are that performative about like being like look at how I am look at how kind and vulnerable I am those are the ones that do those exact same kind of crazy things or when it comes down to like what really matters they like they don't stand behind what they stand for you know does that make sense to you it's like the grandiosity to literally be like our show is needed like that's that's why people do crazy things like we were just watching game of Thrones Khaleesi when you all of a sudden think that like you have like some higher mission and like oh it's different when I screw people over you know like like to think that uh it just and then to watch the amount of people all like on her show like in the audience just ooh and awe and fall for this performance like oh she's being so vulnerable and she's no actually she's invading like personal body space you know and if she really like understood the finesse of real journalism and like what it takes to be emotionally like aware and like then she wouldn't do that I don't know I'm just it just it's and my mom probably be one of these people not these members if she if she was still alive she probably be one of these people I'm not saying it's a bad thing like but it is crazy to me and it's not even about the Kamala thing and also like what did you think what did you think that Niffy was gonna do like",

Last October, I posted a video about why I decided to not go through with purchasing the home that I was gonna buy on a fucking I think was like a 6.5% interest rate. Even though mortgage lenders and realtors were telling me to buy because I can always refinance later, I did not go through with it because I did not wanna be house poor. Which is exactly what a fuck, what a what, what a fucking happened had. I went through with that. It is now about 6 months later, 2024. Where the fuck do y'all see Jerome, how about to cut interest rates? I'm only 25 recently, fresh 25 recently turned like two weeks ago, and even I knew this fucking economy was in the gutter. So for you guys who have been in this industry for over a decade, to sit here seeing the sign that y'all saw, and to still influence and persuade people to go through with purchasing these homes because you guys wanted to make a quick fucking buck, you're going to hell. It is now Q2 2024, and I've seen fucking maybe 20 tik toks about people either in foreclosure or about to go into foreclosure. This is why I always say it's so important to live below your means, because in reality, especially your middle class, we're all about a lay off away from going into foreclosure or Being evicted from our fucking homes, truly, especially in this fucking economy, is taking people damn near about a year to find a new job. And even then, when they do, it's not paying what they were getting paid before.",

Kennedy and sister of RFK Jr. \u2014 called President Biden her \u201chero\u201d as she rattled off a list of his accomplishments in office.   \u201cWe want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,\u201d she said at the campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday.   Prominent members of the Kennedy family have rejected RFK Jr.\u2019s candidacy and disavowed some of his more controversial positions, particularly his anti-vaccine rhetoric.   Ms. Kennedy did not mention her brother by name but said \u201cthere are only two candidates with any chance of winning the presidency.\u201d   RFK Jr. noted the endorsement on social media and said he is \u201cpleased\u201d his relatives are politically active, calling it a \u201cfamily tradition.\u201d   \u201cWe are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI hold this as a possibility for America too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.\u201d   RFK Jr. is the strongest of the third-party and independent candidates, and while he stands no chance of being elected, both the Biden and Trump campaigns fear he could siphon votes from them in key states in November.   It\u2019s unclear who he would draw more votes from \u2014 his iconic last name has been synonymous with Democratic politics for decades, but some of his political positions track more closely with potential Trump voters. #kennedy #kerrykennedy #rfk #rfkjr #potus #joebiden #election2024 #cspan ",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I bring you a fresh book publishing scandal. For the Atlantic, the writer Tyler Austin Harper wrote an expos of the New York Times bestseller White Rural Rage, and he argues that the authors of this book conveniently misinterpreted research and data in order to prove their own thesis. I'm gonna focus on two main problems with the book White Rural Rage. The thesis of the book is that white rural voters pose a unique threat to American democracy. But as Harper points out in the Atlantic, the authors of this book never bother to define what the word rural means. The word rural is defined by different academic researchers in different ways, and the authors of this book, instead of picking one definition that would work for their argument, just decide not to choose a definition of all. So rural could mean anything. Avoiding giving a definition of what you mean by the word rural, which is in the title of your own book, Harper says, is like deciding to write a book about Irish people and then drawing on studies of Irish people from Ireland, Irish Americans, people who took a 23 and me test and Learned they were Irish, and people who like to get drunk in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day. The second big problem with this book is that to prove their thesis that the threat of political violence is particularly acute in white rural America, they cite an article titled The Rise of Political Violence in the United States that directly contradicts the claim they are making. This whole scandal reminds me of 2019 when Naomi Wolf had a book coming out about how gay men were treated in the UK in the 19th century. And then while she was doing this BBC interview, the interviewer asked her about her interpretation of this two word phrase that basically her entire thesis was based on, and she had completely misinterpreted those two words, meaning the entire point of her book was null and void.",

    "voice_to_text": "How's this for saying the weird thing?: my favorite un-fun fact to bring up while in mixed company here in Washington state is the fact that we are about 50 to 75 years overdue for an absolutely mind fucking bendingly massive earthquake, that in every other iteration of its existence, has completely leveled the Pacific Northwest. See, about every 350 to like 500 years or so, the area just off the coast of Seattle known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone gets a little heify and releases anywhere from an 8.8 to a 10.2 magnitude earthquake. Granted, the 10.2 is a bit of an exaggeration, considering the largest we've ever recorded on earth is like a 9.5. But there have been like suspicions that there was at least a 10.0 somewhere in Alaska about 300 years ago  But the thing you have to remember about that magnitude scale is that it is logarithmic. Which means it builds on itself to basically make itself worse. And it's based on time, not shakiness. So that is to say that if a 7.9, which is the largest quake that has ever hit California, lasts for anywhere from two to three minutes, a 10.2 on that logarithmic scale could last up to 30 minutes. Just imagine what 30 minutes of shaking would do to the west coast of the United States. And not just the Pacific Northwest. About 7 out of 10 times that Cascadia goes off, it takes San Andreas with it. We're talking destruction on a literally fucking unprecedented scale. It will make Katrina look like fucking Babytown Frolics. And just like every other horrible fucking thing to befall the American public that has happened in last 20 30 years or so, we are doing nothing to prevent or predict it. Granted, there is no predicting or preventing earthquakes, but there are early warning systems, like the ones that exist in Japan and other nations on the Ring of Fire that are extremely advanced. Like in some parts of Japan with the really advanced monitoring um they can measure everything from like far off shaking to sea level drop and predict tsunamis and quakes to the point that they can tell surgeons to halt surgeries, and open elevator doors on the next floor, and instruct people to get to high ground and to brace for impact. We didn't even know the Cascadia Seduction Zone existed until the 1980s. Which means absolutely every single building that was built in the Pacific Northwest before like 1994 is not earthquake stable. Rhe estimate by FEMA is that up to 70% of dams, schools, hospitals, and like military complexes would collapse following this earthquake. FEMA also estimates that up to a third of the people in the Inundation Zone, which in some places in this destruction path could be as far as 30 miles inland from the coast, are going to be too old, too disabled or too injured by the earthquake to seek shelter, and to get to higher ground when the tsunami comes. A tsunami, mind you that could be up to 50 fucking feet in height in some places. So basically, they estimate that at least a third of the people living on the coast right now are going to die. And that's the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, this fucker hits in like the middle of summer, like on Memorial Day or fourth of July weekend, when everyone from surrounding areas has flocked to the beaches in Oregon Washington. Worst worst case scenario, it hits at night. But either way, in 2012, when interviewed, one of the heads of the Washington State Department of FEMA stated that if Cascadia were to go off in all of its glory and release the absolute like top top top tier of what it's capable of um that quote \"The operating assumption is that everything west of I-5 will be toast\". Like body recovery efforts, and that's it. I'm \"lucky\" to live in what they call the \"Inland Empire\". Which means all I have to worry about is a much smaller, much more diluted earthquake completely leveling downtown, because of all their fucking stupid un-reinforced masonry buildings. And like having no food or water for several weeks, and probably the Nazis in Idaho going apeshit. But absolutely all of that would be preferable to anything that is happening on the coast. Did I mention there's a one in three chance of the happening in the next like 10 years? The estimate used to be 1 in 10, in 50. Bu then about eight months ago, um the Cascadia subduction fault line out in the ocean started leaking what geologists call tectonic fluid, basically the lubricant on the inside of the fault line, which is an indication that shit in there is getting kind of tight. We've never seen this phenomenon before, except maybe right before really really really big subduction zone catastrophe earthquakes, like the 2011 T\u014dhoku quake in Japan. So that sped up the timeline a little. The point is, you could not pay me in solid gold bars to ever go anywhere fucking near Seattle, ever the fuck again. No part of the coastline of the Pacific Northwest is worth that risk. Call me fucking paranoid, but I'm too fat to run for high ground. I don't like earthquakes. But I do love telling all of these facts to the Seattle socialites who come to Spokane to flaunt their money, and make us feel like shit  and then just watching their pupils get to be like the size of dinner plates, and the horror like really fucking set in. Good luck, bitch! \ud83d\ude18\u270c\ufe0f",
