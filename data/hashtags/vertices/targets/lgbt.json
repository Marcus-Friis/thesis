    "voice_to_text": "except plot twist I'm actually using Arctic char here which is a close cousin to the salmon family they look and taste almost identical except char has a lower fat content giving it a more mild or some may say less fishy flavor steelhead trout is another similar looking and tasting fish and both of these are typically more sustainable options than your average farmed salmon this salad is a mashup of all of my favorite veggies and flavors like cherry tomatoes basil pickled onions and goat cheese and it ended up turning out really colorful hence the name rainbow salad I think the key to a good salad is having a lot of contrast so we have fresh, pickled, and roasted vegetables creamy goat cheese crisp little gem lettuce and of course the roasted char and you'll see here how roasting the char at 275 keeps that gorgeous orange hue with none of that white coagulated fat coming to the surface then I broil off some kale because my IBSC stomach cannot handle the raw stuff broiling it gives you crispy bits on the top and steams the rest on the bottom it makes the perfect base for a salad like this I'm using half little gem half kale but you could use one or the other I was proud of my mise en place like when have you ever seen me do this before I'm trying to be more organized you guys I'm also trying to eat more vegetables can't you tell but yeah as I assemble my bowl I like to keep everyone in their own little corner and I don't like to mix everything because I'm not an animal um but you do you feel like the star of the show here was the creamy basil vinaigrette I will be using this on all of my salads all summer this recipe is also perfect for meal prepping just keep all the ingredients in their own separate containers and assemble your bowls throughout the week rather than chowing down on protein bars between meetings I'm talking to myself this is so good"

I don't think you understand. 16 year old me, 15 16, was saying the most dumbass shit. Trans people do not have periods. We have, you know, period symptoms, but that does not equal a period. I don't know what it would be called, but it's definitely not that. And I definitely should not have boxed it that way. I have no idea how to talk about the new experiences of trans people who are on healthcare that makes them able to basically live their life authentically, but it definitely was not to step on any of the other girls toes. Okay? So just know, if someone said I had a period, or said that I said I have a period, that wasn't me. I am not that girl no more. With that said, I think that people definitely need to be more gracious towards trans people whenever they're speaking about their experiences. And do not have a name for some of the experiences that they're going through. Because we are so new in society, even though we've been here for years. Don't get that. And I think that was the reason why I ignored that topic for so long. But I kind of poked fun at it in my new song. I was like, that's on period. Call her beyond dream Mitchell, because sometimes beyond dream Mitchell in The past could have been ignorant. So, yeah. But, yeah. I love you, dolls. And I hope this gives some context to my thoughts."

It's sad that the one person, the one channel that we thought that we could rely on to be in the best interest of our kids, and now she's done this. I loved Miss Rachel. Loved her so much for my son, and I was so excited to start introducing her to my daughter. But after seeing that on my feed about her inviting Dylan on her show. Never again. And if you don't agree with me on that subject, you do not need to be on my page. Leave our kids alone! We're supposed to be protecting them, not exploiting them. To this. Wake up!"

    "video_description": "The UK government has introduced regulations to halt new private prescriptions of puberty blockers for under-18s in one of its final acts before the general election. No new patients under the age of 18 in England, Wales and Scotland will be given hormones to suppress puberty if they are experiencing gender dysphoria, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announced on Wednesday (29 May). The medicine prevents puberty from starting by blocking the hormones \u2013 such as testosterone and oestrogen \u2013 that lead to changes in the body. In the case of trans youth, this can delay unwanted physical changes such as menstruation, breast growth, voice changes or facial-hair growth.  The emergency ban will last from 3 June to 3 September and will apply to prescriptions written by UK private doctors and those registered in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. The medicines in question consist of, or contain, buserelin, gonadorelin, goserelin, leuprorelin acetate, nafarelin, or triptorelin. Patients who already have prescriptions will continue to be able to access them, the DHSC said, and the medicines will remain available for other uses. The government\u2019s move comes after the release of the Cass report and a similar decision by NHS England to stop prescribing the medicine to trans youth at its gender identity clinics. In March, NHS England decided that puberty blockers would only be available to young people as part of clinical trials. \u201cOutside of a research setting, puberty-suppressing hormones should not be routinely commissioned for children and adolescents,\u201d a spokesperson said. Sky News reported the government described the move as a \u201clandmark decision\u201d and in the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d.  However, transgender youth charity Mermaids labelled the decision \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d and a \u201cfurther restriction of support offered to trans children and young people\u201d. Wales and Scotland announced pauses to prescribing puberty blockers, in the wake of the report. The Cass report, an independent review into the provision of healthcare for trans youth in England, was published in April and urged medics to use \u201cextreme caution\u201d when prescribing puberty blockers to children and young people. The 400-page report into England\u2019s model of care for trans under-18s claimed there was \u201cweak evidence\u201d suggesting that puberty-blocking hormones positively or negatively impact gender dysphoria and branded as \u201cpoor quality\u201d historical studies into their effectiveness. Dr Hilary Cass, who led the review, said: \u201cWhat I am recommending is an expansion of capacity across the country, grounded in paediatric services and delivered in a consistent way\u2026 a much more holistic offer of care that considers the child as a whole person and not just through the lens of their gender identity, and the development of a robust research environment to provide evidence on long-term outcomes and efficacy of different interventions so that future care is informed by robust evidence.\u201d #pubertyblockers #transrights #genderaffirmingcare #protecttranskids #ukpolitics #uknews #lgbtq ",

    "voice_to_text": "I realize that you're trying to invalidate me, but, girl, this is actually one of the best examples I've seen to this day. Hear me out for a second. In this example, coffee would replace woman. Caffeinated would be for cisgender, and decaffeinated would be for transgender. Now, I'm sure that we can all agree that they're both coffee. They look the same, some might even say they taste the same. But there is a clear difference between the two. But Misty is absolutely right in that most people assume that coffee is caffeinated. I agree 100% that most people would not call their coffee caffeinated, because it's usually a given. But let's say that you're out in the world and you happen to be drinking a decaffeinated coffee today, and someone comes up to you and asks, hey, what are you drinking? You may very well feel inclined to share that it's a decaffeinated coffee. But then again, it's also really none of that person's business, and you can just tell him that it's a coffee. It's really up to you as to whether or not you wanna share if it's decaffeinated. Now, with all of that said and done, just because we assume that coffee is caffeinated does not mean that we shouldn't have this word at all. There is still a clear meaning and purpose to the word caffeinated. And perhaps you're having a conversation with a friend about whether or not decaffeinated coffee or caffeinated Coffee taste better or is better for your overall health. Both of those words are still very helpful when we're having open discussions about how these two differ or what our views and opinions are about the two. And it would be much harder to have this exact same conversation without that word. Caffeinated. You could definitely try your best to have this conversation, but it's gonna end up getting very messy and very confusing because at the end of the day, they're both coffee. And that is exactly the purpose of these terms. You don't have to constantly use them to distinguish the two. Caffeinated and decaffinated are adjectives that help us describe a noun. Cisgender and transgender are also adjectives that describe a noun. So Misty, thank you so much for this amazing example. Hope this helps.",

Um, I have a niece and she just turned 5 today, and I've only been transitioning and presenting femme in front of her for like maybe like 8 months or something. Um, and it's just really interesting, like, seeing how they perceive you and like, understand things as you go through these changes. It's just really funny because the first thing that she said to me when I came out to her today was, you're not a girl, you're a boy. And I'm like, I changed and now I'm a girl. And then she goes, no, you're a, you're a boy. I saw you kissing a girl. Like, oh no, not explain both lesbianism and being trans to this five year old. Now obviously me and my sister, like, we're trying to do this in like an educational way, um, because I feel like it is a lot for a kids to try like wrap their heads around, especially at the age of five. And so we basically just said like, hey, like, it's okay. Sometimes boys like boys and sometimes girls like girls. And if you really want to, when you're older and you grow up, you can change your gender. And so like, she just like, really didn't want to call me a girl, which is okay. She's still learning and like, there's not like a lot of like queer representation for her, um, and it's just so Lovely. Because as I was leaving today, she called me a fancy girl. She's like, bye, fancy girl. And where did this come from? What? And she wouldn't stop calling me fancy girl as I was leaving. And so, like, I don't know. I just really don't know what goes on in children's heads and, like, what they're taught. And it's just, like, it's kind of, like, cute and, like, kind of, like, admirable to, like, see, like, how a child, like, perceives trans people, because they. I feel like they, like, understand it a lot better than, like, adults do sometimes, because there's so much prejudice built up, and they don't understand that being trans isn't, like, a, like, typical thing. And so, I don't know. It was just, like, a funny moment when she just kept coming. Pretty girl. As I was leaving, I was like, oh, that's so sweet.",

I'm not Gypsy Rose, but I'm Jennifer. I spent six years in federal prison, and these are my stories of before, during, and after incarceration. Now, one of my favorite things to make was pizzas, but tasted with those crackers was super creative. I'm gonna do something a little bit different. So I've heard that the feds no longer have microwaves, which is a bummer. You're gonna lay your tortilla flat and hit it with a fork on both sides. You wanna make sure you get a lot of holes in it. Pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. In prison, we didn't have pizza sauce, so we would use ketchup and make a sauce. I, I burned it. I burned the first one. You gotta watch it. But look a crisp up. We're gonna try again. Okay, round two. Now, this time I gotta watch it. I was talking and not paying attention. You wanna take it out every, like, 20 seconds and see how it's forming a bubble. You wanna pop that, and you don't want any bubbles. And again, see little bubbles. This step is so important or it will burn like my last one did. So make sure you get all those bubbles out. So this is what you're gonna end up. With you hear that? It's hard. It's like a flatbread pizza. Mix ketchup, Italian seasoning and garlic. Mix it together really well. I like to add a little bit of Velveeta cheese in mine to make it more creamy. I also put a layer of Velveeta cheese on my tortilla before I add my sauce just cause I like it cheesy. Now my toppings of choice are pineapple and pepperoni. You can use whatever you want. We had dried pineapple on commissary. So I would chop them up and do this and then add cheese. You would have to get cheese from the kitchen from one of your hookup. And of course I wasn't recording when I took it out of the microwave. But this is what it looks like. Would you try this? Let me know in the comments.",

Bringing a lot of bags, you make a lot of noise, you sniff salts, you get chalk everywhere. Can also be a bit off putting for other members cause maybe it doesn't serve these types of people. We have powerlifting gyms, we have Crossfit boxes. We have gyms for those specific training modalities. Fair play to the guy though. I think he did it in the right way cause that must be a hard conversation to have. Especially with a dude squatting that much weight. He's clearly a big geezer. I wouldn't really like to do that. We've never had to do it cause our gyms kind of open for for everyone. We do like powerlifters, we do like bodybuilders, we do like crossfitters, we like a bit of mess.

And between that documentary and the conversations that we've been having on TikTok about the 4B movement and men and women and dating and how everyone is upset and unsatisfied, why are we pretending like this is working? I think we're on the precipice where we're finally gonna stop that. But I think when something is so prevalent as cheating has been for men, it begs the question, do you wanna be doing this? Because I don't think that men want to be married. And I think that women have historically needed to be married. And maybe we don't wanna be married either. At least we don't want to be married in the traditional sense of what marriage has meant. I think that there may be people out there that want a partnership. But do men even want monogamy? I mean, honestly, I think it's okay to just tell the truth if. If most men don't want monogamy, maybe we need to have a deeper conversation about what this looks like. I don't think that the nuclear family works anyways. The idea of the nuclear family originated based on slavery and based on a very large extended family system where there were sometimes hundreds of people maintaining a home, which was probably significantly larger than the small homes that were living in. But the point is, we were not made to raise children with just two adults and a lot of Us are also now raising children with just one adult. And none of this works. It doesn't work. So what we're doing is we are resenting each other for a systemic problem that honestly has nothing to do with us. And I think if there is a time for us to have this deeper conversation of what do we really want? What do we want this to look like? Because if. If most men don't want monogamy, what they really want is just somebody to maintain a home for them, that's something we need to talk about. The damage that it does to children and a woman when they find out that their entire life is a lie and that their dad is with a bunch of other women is really extensive. I've lived it as a child. I've lived it as an adult. It's not good. It's not a good thing. And I think that you'll find as a man that most women just want you to be honest. Like, if you were to tell a woman, this is what I'm looking for, I'm looking for X, Y, and Z, there are probably women out there that will be into that. But the problem comes with the lying. You don't have to live in a way that you don't want to. No one is making us do this. But I think, again, the societal difficulty that comes with not being married is real. It's very real. There is so Much pressure. And the truth is that men make more money when they're married. Even men who are divorced make $9,000 more per year. And again, I think that has a lot to do with our social structure. But if we're not happy with this, we can stop.",

Women cannot wait to be dumbfounded, a damsel in distress around men. So if she is acting like a man around a so called man, maybe you need to take a deep, dark, long look at yourself and ask yourself, what feminine qualities do you have?

    "voice_to_text": "So as I was editing today's reel, I came across this anecdote, and I think it might be the one Rachel's asking about. So basically, ginger tells the story of a three year old girl who puts lipstick on the dog, even though she knows she's not supposed to, and lies about it and says it was an action figure named Doug. And the little girl kind of doubles down, and you can see here Ginger's kind of, uh, humorous, storytelling, relatable style that's throughout the book. So she relates this anecdote where the three year old, um, keeps saying it's, uh, the action figure, ends up getting sent to a room, ends up missing her brother's soccer game, which she's really sad about. And so she cries herself to sleep. And at that point, the mom wakes in and wakes her up because, quote, she doesn't want her to go to sleep with this sin weighing heavy on her heart. So she wakes the daughter up, and eventually the daughter kind of fesses up and cries and feels bad. And the mom says, it makes you feel bad to tell lies, doesn't it? You know, honey, the sad way that you feel right now is the same way god feels when you tell a lie. And I note that because that kind of anthropomorphization of god shows up a lot in Christian parenting teaching. Like, oh, as a way to motivate children. Like, this makes god sad when you Do this. And in the end, after all of this, so after missing the game, after being in the room, after crying yourself to sleep, she still gets a spanking. To let her know that, um, her sin was that serious.",

This is by Silva. This is. You know, I don't really know how heavy it is. I didn't weigh it before I wore it, but I really love it. It's super industrial and interesting, and I just really love working with everybody on my team. Nicolas. Incredible. Sarah, Frederick, everybody that's here. Um, many of them worked on the chromatic ball, and so it's kind of nice to be here tonight to keep creating and doing something new. Absolutely. In the Chromatic Ball tour, I mean, you broke audience records. Dodger Stadium for this. This film. 52,000 little Monsters, 30 cameras. What, of all of the things that you kind of needed to put this together, blew your mind the most? What made even Gaga stop and say, oh, we really did that? You know, it's always the fans. Yeah, it. Every time I see the fans, I think to myself, I can't believe that I get to do this for a living. I can't believe I got so lucky to also have fans that are really excited for things that Are new all the time. Every album that I make is usually a new genre of music. Every time I putting a show together, I am doing something that I've never done before, even if I'm looking back at things that I've made. So it's the fans. They are. They're down for it all.

Sign legislation protecting children and banning child sex changes. House Bill 4 6 2 4, named the help not harm Bill, prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from receiving sex change surgery or any form of puberty blockers or hormones, with the noteworthy exception for children that enter puberty early. It also protects parental rights by ensuring that either the vice principal or principal has to inform the parents if their child wants to go by a different name, different pronouns, or anything that doesn't match their actual sex. This kind of legislation is common sense. Children cannot consent to this kind of stuff. So the question is, where are the other 25 states and why do they seem to think that children can consent?",

And she scored the record breaking bucket off of a pass from her current fiance Alyssa Thomas. First of all, imagine your ex passing you on the all time scoring list. Second of all, imagine her doing it off of a pass that she got from her new girl. But that wasn't the only couple drama that happened this week with that same team. Dijonay Carrington plays with Dewana Bonner on the Connecticut Sun and she committed a hard foul against fever player Erica Wheeler. And after this foul was committed, Erica Wheeler went to go get in her face and she got pushed back by her own teammate Melissa Smith. Melissa Smith also happens to be Dejonay Carrington's ex girlfriend, which had a bunch of people questioning why did you just defend your ex over your own teammate?

The king has granted this request and we will have a general election on the fourth of July. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the Cold War. Putin's Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds, that war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead. And technology and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to charter course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children?",

So look y'all, I already know that there are people out there who refer to themselves as maps, and we all know who the these people are and that they're trying to make themselves a part of your community. How do you feel about that? Do any of you guys watch shredder smiles, PB Touchers, and purple headed pamper eaters in your community? Do you accept them? Would you ever accept them? How does it make you feel when they try to insert themselves into your community? How does it feel when other people try to associate you guys with them? As I got a lot of homies y'all and I've talked to them all and they are 1,000% not down with the sickness. I also understand that there might be some people out there who don't have the same access to be able to openly and freely communicate with people in your community. So I thought it might be nice to make an open forum right here, right now in the comments so that you can let those type of people know exactly where y'all stand on this. I love y'all.",

This boy is 12 years old. I've been in his life all his life. Except for the times that when his mama kept him away. You know, this boy have the nerve to say he don't like me and don't wanna come to my house. And that he missed the times with his family. Speaking of his mama family and not his daddy side of family, like we don't exist, right? So he say he. This is taking up time. He said the two days that he spent over here feel like a whole week. And then he's not even looking forward to the 30 days he had to spend over here. For some, he said he don't wanna come over here at all. Like I'm a bad person. Like I've traumatized him and did anything wrong to this little boy. We have done so much stuff, so much fun things. Spend time together, play basketball together, go amusement parks, go swimming, take riding in toys like this. He had the nerve to choose his mama. Look at the camera, gay. Choose his mama over me. Like I'm around here. Treat him wrong. What kid don't wanna be around a daddy? Please tell me. And as a daddy, is hurt because I know his Mama got something to do with it too. But still, he's old enough to make his own decisions. And he chooses mama over his daddy, his flesh and blood, somebody that can teach him how to be a man. But he wanna be up on a woman all day. Look at the camera, gay. Tell people how you don't love your daddy and how you rather be with your mama and time over here is boring and you don't want to spend time with your daddy. Tell people how you don't want to spend time with your daddy. And you, he act like I. I haven't been picking him up all these years. Like what? What is the problem? Like this not your first time at my house. But yeah, he hurt my feelings, world. He really hurt my feelings. And you can't take that back, gay. I'm gonna give you what you want. And I'm erase myself out of your life. I'm give you what you want. Gay, that is so messed up on so many levels. You know, I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. My dad was in my life. I would never tell my dad because I know that were hurt my daddy's feelings. I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. Ever."

    "voice_to_text": "The transgender protagonist of the latest Super Mario game for the switch has received a special treatment from Nintendo because in the thousand year door for GameCube, Vivian was censored in its English version, being transformed into a cisgender female character. However, it was all a big lie, because Vivian was actually born male, as stated in her Japanese, Spanish and other language versions that remained unchanged in the original release on the Nintendo Switch. This issue has been fixed and all dialogues concerning Vivian's transition have been altered, removing the offensive slurs Belgium used to her litter simply for being a transgender character, now scolding her instead for being somewhat clumsy. Nintendo didn't wanna leave the character situation unresolved and it's thought to explain Vivian's story in the best way possible with a touching moment where she confesses to Mario that at a certain point in her life, she realized she was not the brother of Marilyn and Belgium, but their sister.",

I feel like hieroglyphics would be easier to understand at this point. Let's try to make two plus two equal four. You go by he him pronouns, but you don't wanna be referred to as a man, so you recognize and still wanna be referred to as a woman. Which while still adopting the he him pronoun set, claiming that you're trans while simultaneously not doing a single thing to transition. Yep. Nope. The math is not math thing. And then people wonder why the trans community is not taken seriously. The movement is being diminished. Being trans is not a trend that you just hop on. It's not a community that you just attach yourself to just because. Sounds like you might just be a little self conscious about your body, which is nothing to be ashamed of. A lot of people go through that. But to try to adopt the he him pronoun set and then claim that that makes you trans. No, I'm not buying it. Stop making it harder for everybody else in the community. Thank you. Let me know. What you guys think in the comments about this video? I love you guys and I will see you in the next one.",

I feel like whenever I'm seeing the Bridgerton stuff for season 3, it's like people are saying, I'm Team Eloise. Pin betrayed Eloise. Did you not see the Queen threaten Eloise in that carriage? Honestly, I don't even think Penelope took it too far either. Like, she said, enough, just. Just enough so that the public and the Queen would be like, oh, it's not her, it's not her. Every time she tries to explain it to Eloise, Eloise just cuts her off and says, I don't wanna know. I'm like, you're upset, but you don't wanna communicate. That's talking about. Pen did her dirty. She really saved her reputation and her family's reputation. Cause what the Queen was saying to her in that carriage. Baby, I would have been scared."

So I was just out looking for some chicken at the woods in Chopin Placewood and I didn't find any of those, but I did find someone else, which I'll post after this video. But when we're walking along is Yasmin and taking the dog lychee, someone came out of the bushes and after a while they're just having a wee and then someone else walked past with a dog and went to the bushes. Strange. And then somebody else came past with a vape and went to the same place. So I just thought it must be hunters. And there was a car. I thought they must be hunting or legally doing something. Anyway, walked on a bit, found what I wanted to find. Um, and then got back to the car park and as we're walking back to the car park, there was lots of cars with their doors open. You probably know where I'm going with this one. Um. And then a transvestite will pass me. Um. Ha ha ha! Yeah. And then I did a bit of research in the car and um, yeah, it's a well known dog inside. So there you go. Could you believe it? Don't go to chop them or Cobham Place Woods. It is a full on dog inside."

I feel like they're fine to be friends with in social and casual settings but if you were looking for a really great supportive friend  that you can lean on these type of friends are not it"

To the heights! Harrison Booker is a Christian man who holds Christian values and he gave a speech that was filled with Christian values at a Christian college to Christian students and after giving this specific speech to his intended audience he received a standing ovation both men and women alike were in this crowd and everybody stood up and cheered for this man when he was done the people that his message was intended for heard it and received it well the people who got offended by his message either aren't the ones who the message was intended for in the first place or they're just not ready to come to terms with  the absolute truth he was speaking he wasn't targeting women by diminishing the value of their degrees and telling them that their only sense of purpose will come from being a homemaker even though an uncharitable analysis of a 60 second clipped out portion of his 20 minute speech may suggest that he addressed the men also and told them that their role in family life was just as important the truth is most people both men and women will find most of their value, sense of purpose, and fulfillment in their family life because the people in your life who you love and care about the most will always be more important than any degree or how you choose to earn money for the rest of your life and that was the truth that he was getting at"

That's how ridiculous you all sound when you say this shit. Just because someone goes to a meeting with people in the government does not make them a goddamn fed. Just because you disagree with someone does not make them a goddamn fed. These contrarian types, these down with everything that's uptight people, are not capable of building anything because their entire practice is tearing things. Tearing people down for the sake of tearing them down. It's vulture behavior. Some people who hold the same political positions as you are just more pragmatic. Any healthy movement has pragmatists and idealists. You need both. When it becomes unhealthy is when a movement is so pragmatic that it has no Ideals and therefore no morals and no movement. Or become so idealistic with no pragmatism that it becomes nothing but foot stomping and contrarianism and purity testing and self cannibalization. Stop copjacking people, it is so toxic.",

We had a cool run. I'm grateful for what happens. I'm not here to seek sympathy for that. But when we broke up, verbatim, it went exactly the same as my last two, which is them essentially telling me that everything is going really well. I've treated them incredibly. I'm very emotionally available. Communication is great. We get along greats. Dates have been fun. They're very mentally attracted to me, and they have no doubt I would be a good partner. But the catch is that they are not physically attracted to me. And then, um. But times I've asked, well, what is it that you're not attracted to? Because if there's something, glarian that I need to address, then, like, I should definitely want to be aware of that. Like, do I have bad breath? Do I need to. Do I need to lose more weight? And they said no. Like, they can't put a finger on it. Um, it's more of a vibe thing. So I come here today more as a last resort, because this has just been a pattern where I haven't really gotten a clear answer, and the internet is brutally honest. So I just want to know, what am I doing wrong? Is there something about myself physically that I need to Address. Or is there, um. Is this more of an emotional thing? And is this something that, like, no one has the heart to tell me that I'm just not aware of right now? I'm. Yeah, I'm not here to seek sympathy. I just really, like, genuinely want to know, like, what. What am I doing wrong? Or is. Is this. Is there something, like, I need to consider, like, about myself?",

I had to keep the lie going. Yeah, I got a twin now I really dragged it out. I said I had another twin who went to a magnet school in our district. She was 10 times more than me. That's the only reason why we didn't go to the same school. Teacher felt so bad. She was like, Shawty, you're so smart. So is your sister. You guys should be in the same school together to make your mom's life easier. I thought she was just being sweet. So I kept bringing in pictures of me as a baby. And I was like, this is her. This is me. This is her. This is me. I don't know why she believed me. As an adult woman, why would you believe a 7 year old girl saying this? Anyways, I kept this lie going for Like, maybe two months. Some days I'd come in with, like, my hair different way, just to keep the lie going, you know? I thought at some point, my teacher knew I was joking, but I wasn't lying to her. I was lying to my classmate Amber. Anyways, parent teacher conference comes up. Had good grades. I thought I was smooth. I come home, my mom's like, Shawty, who's Amanda? I. My whole body was shaking up. I cried, I cried, I cried. And you know what I did to get out the situation? I lied again. My mom was like, why would you lie about this? At the time, my little brother did not live with us. He was staying with my grandma. I was like, I just miss my brother so much. I was just making up siblings. And my mom didn't believe me again. Like, I was a pathological liar. I don't lie no more, because clearly I was really. Get away with that shit, but, yeah. What did you lie about",

TikTok will give me a couple of cents, and, um, those couple of sense add up. Um, because of you watching my TikTok videos, last month, I was able to pay rent, um, from what I made just by you watching my videos. And when you're fighting cancer and you can't work and you can't provide for your family, it's everything. If you've been following my journey, you know that we have been fighting tooth and nail with my disability. Um, they keep denying it because they're saying that my cancer was pre existing. We're still fighting them on that, so we're just relying on my amazing wife and, um, her income. She's a hairstylist. Although currently she's out of commission because she has done something to her thumb and she's unable to work. Um, when it rains, it pours. But just watching this. It's been a minute, 20 seconds. You watching this this long has helped my family. It Has helped us pay the light Bill. It has helped us put food on the table. It is helped. Paid one of the four code pays. I have next week. I have chemo next week. So. You're thinking about me on Monday. I could use your prayers and good vibes, but, um. Yeah. You guys have stayed this long. When I say it is life changing, I mean that.

My car is busted, and I've talked to my husband, my father in law, my best friend's husband, some other men that I know, and they're all saying that I have a blown head gasket due to not properly taking care of my car, basically due to not getting oil changes. Okay, but, like, first of all, yes, there was a light on, but I always take that as, like, a suggestion. I'm, like, always like, oh, I got time. I know this is my fault, and I'm very disappointed in myself, but does your husband remind you to get your oil changed or no? Okay, second of all, I always have lights on in my car, and I am mad at myself and disappointed. But more than that, I'm, like, more scared because I know my husband's very gonna be upset. Like, he is upset. He already knows. So basically, what happened was two days ago, I went to go get Mia from school, and my car started smoking. So I ran in and got my husband, and he was like, oh, girl, like, of course it is. Go get your oil change. And I'm like, now you tell me, why didn't you remind me? So I went got my oil change, and as I was pulling out from the oil change place, they didn't Say anything? They were like, there was a point where four of the people at Valvoline were, like, all surrounding the front of my car, and I was like, hmm. But they didn't say anything, so whatever. As I was pulling out from getting my oil change, it was smoking. But I thought just stuff. Just had to, like, clear out a bit. Um, but it was driving funny. It felt, like, heavy. It was making a rattling noise. And I was like, I think it's more than just getting my oil change. There's something going on in here. And then I just got in the car to go tanning, and it is smoking so bad, I can't drive it. I don't feel safe driving it. And I'm pretty sure I ruined my car from being an irresponsible idiot. But I'm just a girl. Like, I really wish my husband. I love to blame other people for my problems, if you haven't noticed. I wish he would have just reminded me, like, that light is a suggestion, isn't it? Yeah. It's literally. Honestly, it might even be more than two years. Like, I cannot remember the last. I've had this car for three years. I remember because when I got the car, they said I got two free oil changes, and I only got one of the free oil changes. So maybe it's been three years. I gotta go."

Any regrets about that kind of language, especially given that you were trying to make a point, frankly, about decorum in the hearing room? I have no regrets, and I'll tell you why. Because Marjorie Taylor Greene is the type of person that if you give her an inch, she'll take a mile. And the fact that they continue to allow her to break the rules of decorum over and over and over, whether it's the state of the union that the president is delivering and she's wearing a MAGA hat or otherwise. The reason that she didn't have committee assignments before was because she did not know how to conduct herself as a member of Congress. And so if I just sit there and say, oh, well, Marjorie said it about me, what's to stop her to continue to do it again and again? And at the end of the day, I was elected as a representative of Congress, but that doesn't mean that I'm supposed to be somebody's doormat. But Michelle Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. Are those days basically over? Um, I don't know that we can even call this a low. I mean, she goes to hell, and then I do my best to remind her as to why she should not cross me. So one of your colleagues, Jamie Raskin, actually suggested that some members might Have been drinking. Others have said that as well. Making that suggestion. That's a pretty serious allegation. Do you think that that played a factor here? I think when Marjorie Taylor Greene. It doesn't require alcohol for her to be unhinged. I'll be perfectly honest. I don't know. I don't have any facts to that, so, you know, I won't say and I won't participate in rumors when I don't have any facts behind it. So you also called Greene racist, what she said about you. Why is that? Yeah, because as I've received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress, a lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factful way, what they would try to do is say, oh, look at her hair, or look at her nails, or look at her lashes. And they would all then associate anything that I do as a form of beautification with being, quote, unquote ghetto. And so to me, she was just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there. Because I am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she's never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me. A black woman who sits On the committee. And then of course she went after AOC and called her unintelligent.

Okay, so you said one thing LED to another, but in my head, for some reason, I see two things lead to another, but there's neither here nor there. You took entirely too long to tell this story, so let me try to break it down for the people in less than a minute. So, apparently his mom and his dad split up when he was a young boy. His dad then went off and had another child by another woman. His mom, being who she was, didn't want him to know he had another brother, so they didn't really interact again. This was 19 years ago. Fast forward. He finds his brother on TikTok. Him and his brother interact, and they get to know each other. And somehow they end up in California at the Grandmama house. He get to the Grandmama house, and the grandmama say, this will can stay, but you can't stay. I don't know what he did for him not to be able to stay with his grandma, but therefore, another video. So anywho, they end up camping out in the car. He say they were sober, but also in the same breath, he say that one of them thought that they was god and one of thought that they were Jesus. Uh, so I would think they weren't sober, cause he did then say they was on mushrooms and all. I Would say, today to them was some hell of a mushrooms. And he said, fast forward. A week later, the little brother said, oh, I think we should be together. And then at this point, I don't know if they were still in California, cause this sound like something they do in West Virginia. I'm sorry. Let's get back to the story. In the older brother tells the younger brother that, oh no, we can't be together. Well, apparently what he meant by that was no strings attached, because the next week, he slept with his little brother. And now they don't talk. Kinda like most people when you break up with your ex. But this ex just so happened to be his little brother. There you go.",

I shouldn't have to play a game where all I say is hi and the whole game is thrown and I'm in hell for the next 40 minutes because men are being emotional about it. That is not normal and that's not how the old Cod days were. Because I promise you, as a man, you have never had somebody throw on the basis of your gender. That doesn't happen. You can say it happens. You're lying. I'm sorry. I don't know why that's such a common thing in the comments of my videos. You guys wanna be oppressed so bad that you look at a man calling me a telling me he's gonna tell me to get back in the kitchen and say it's not a woman thing and say that that happens to you too. It doesn't. There's a reason that historically male dominated spaces are known for being toxic and unsafe. That goes for gaming, that goes for sports. Any male dominated space is a bad one. That's not me being sexist. That is me saying there is an inherent issue with the way that you guys have your locker room talk that makes everybody else feel unsafe. I don't know how you could possibly find it fun to make other people feel unsafe. No woman is Asking men to make gaming a safe space with sunshine and rainbows and everything. But could you please be normal? Because I wanna be able to enjoy playing the game without my life being threatened, without my body being threatened. Because I'm existing as a woman and men are the ones making it unsafe. I do not care if you feel targeted by me saying men, or if you feel attacked by me saying men, you are part of the problem. If you feel attacked by that, you're part of the problem. If you say, just mute them, you're part of the problem. If you sit there and let them say that me and you don't intervene, you are part of the problem. Because I have a lot of male friends, a normal male friends who don't say slurs and don't threaten people and just play like normal. I understand it is not all men. But if you are not one of the men doing this, it is entirely on you to help stop the men who are. If you don't understand that, and you don't understand power imbalances and gender hierarchy, it's not my place to teach you. I'm not your mother, I'm not your teacher. Close the game for five minutes and educate yourself. But stop making this a bad experience for everybody else who's just trying to play the game.",

Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me.

Becoming a star, all while having no parental guidance, no familial guidance, no nothing. Early 20s is already a difficult time for most people. She went through her transitional years in front of the world, in the midst of accomplishing her life's dream, which is again something that most people don't get to do so young. While going through legal battles with her label, graduating college, falling out with friends, falling out with your icons, having difficulty dating, turning to alcohol because you feel like the weight of the world is on you, and then being assaulted and not just getting shot, but having people questioning your story, your integrity, everything. And in the midst of having your so called partner cheat on you. Like watching this girl succeed and make it on her first tour and having people singing her songs word for word, I just know that has to feel amazing and feel like she is just on cloud nine. And I love that for her because I feel like she deserves"

The report states: \u201cIt is important that schools take a cautious approach to teaching about this sensitive topic, and do not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum\". Many have already compared the new guidance to Section 28, the anti-LGBTQ law introduced by Margaret Thatcher in 1988 which banned local authorities and schools from \"promoting homosexuality\", which wasn't repealed in the UK until 2003. At the time, it was the first piece of anti-gay legislation to be introduced in the UK for 100 years and was a direct response to calls for greater equality from LGBTQ+ activists. Thatcher encapsulated the sinister intentions behind this law in her infamous 1987 Conservative Party conference speech. She said: \"Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay\u2026 All of those children are being cheated out of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated.\u201d Amnesty UK have published a statement condemning the new guidance, writing: \"A whole generation of LGBTI children and young people were left scarred by Section 28 - we should strive not to make the same mistakes again.\" #rishisunak #margaretthatcher #section28 #transrights #lgbtq #conservatives ",

I got a wand and a rabbit \ud83e\udd2d\u201d thats a crazy line song it's like her newest song I gotta turn this down thats really loud there's one in particular where like once she says the title of the song I just love the little like the squeakiness of the falsetto and the melody or so it's so fragile and cool it's so cool I like I remember like hearing it for the first time turned at the radio I was like gorsh what's up  what's up Chap hats off to you Chap I wanna get a drink with Chappell Roan man, based solely off of her ridiculous sense of style and her cheesy fun pop lyrics I'd I imagine she'd be a lot of fun to party with so Chap if you see this just let me know is that cool can I call ya Chap is that fine? chap? yeah okay chap right"

If you didn't know, Peru is located in South America and it's a beautiful country. But people on social media, activists even are upset that Peru decided to label um trans and people who identify as non binary or use they them as mentally ill. From what I'm reading on some locals that's been commenting on the responses, they stated that this is just how they see things. No one, like no outside source, can change their mind or change their laws. This is what they're implementing. But that hasn't stopped people from stating that if you now travel to Peru, you will be seen as going against, you know, the other side. But you do have Americans that, you know, know the laws and stated that. Can't nobody change what Peru put? That's their country, that's their laws. We cannot stop that. What do you guys think about this? I'm not going to Peru and stop anything, but what do you guys think about the situation?",

    "voice_to_text": "Become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Holemaker. In case you were wondering how the crowd reacted to that statement. Then he goes on to say that Isabelle, his wife, has no regrets about giving up her dream of having a career. Isabel's dream of having a career might not have come true, but if you ask her today if she has any regrets on her decision, she would laugh out loud. Now, his wife is truly happy with that decision. I absolutely support her. I think being a wife and mother are beautiful things. I think addressing women specifically and saying, this is your purpose is really unfortunate, to put it mildly. You know, she is happy and healthy. They have a great marriage, great family. Then I'm all for it. For them. I fear that may not be the case, but I. I pray that I'm wrong. Also, by the way, this is his company, MD Keller, for which he is a co founder, and the college where he gave this commencement speech. It is listed as an organization that his company fully endorses. Now, there is something he said that I actually agree with. It has to do with men being absent from their homes. But I'm sure we have different thoughts on why that is. Here's that clip. Absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other Countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the. He also spends quite a bit of time arguing for traditional Latin Masses. And I understand he's talking at a Catholic church. Seems a little odd to me. Why is he arguing so hard for this, like at a college graduation? It just seems kind of out of place. I don't know. Just like, a little odd. Last clip about cost of living is extremely important that you actually think about the places you are moving to. Who is the bishop? What kind of parishes are there? Do they offer the TLM and have priests who embrace their priestly vocation? Cost of living must not be the only arbiter of your choice. That's pretty rich coming from a multi millionaire. It doesn't have to worry about the cost of living all that much. Anyways, just wanna share some clips with y'all.",

Because I've seen women do it. Would you like me to answer the question? Go ahead. Okay. Because biologically, we. Our bodies change over time. They'll naturally gain and lose weight in different circumstances. And your worth as a spouse, whether you are a husband or a wife, is not derived by your weight. That's just a shallow thing. Now, I think that both husbands and wives. But it's your job to be attractive. It's your job to be attractive. I think husbands and wives should both maintain attractiveness. But why do you always like. Why do you always have to bring it back? Cause right now. Right now. Right now. Right now. Because we're asking about the deal for men. So I'm looking at this from the man's point of view. What does the man get out of it? Is this a good deal? He gets. He gets. He gets a woman for an in shape wife. He gets a woman. He can't even say 120 pounds. Can I. Can I. Can I answer the question? I'm asking. I'm asking. He gets a woman who's promised to stay with him even though statistically, He'll gain 30 or 40 pounds. And that cause that women's job has far more of a job to be beautiful than men. You know, men's job is to protect and provide. What is wrong with a man asking that she says a certain way? Cause it's. Cause it's shallow. It's fine to ask someone to be healthy. And it's fine to encourage your spouse to maintain attractiveness, not to just let yourself go. But that's the same for husbands and wives. Neither should just let themselves go. But at the same time, each one should. Each one should be merciful, knowing that time and age come for all of us.",

Or man, where has this been my whole life? High speed rail, affordable healthcare, nice infrastructure. The reality is, this is how life should be. This is how our tax dollars should be spent. As tax paying citizens, we deserve the best public services at least. Hmm, I wonder where all the money is going. But anyway, it's 2025. Upgrades to daily public services should be a right, not a luxury. It is almost as if they care more about upgrading our phones versus upgrading daily essentials. It was just the other day when we realized that none of these third world countries outside of the US are in the future. Their government just knows how to put tax dollars to use in a different way. Could you imagine how the USA would look if they positively innovated technology? It is definitely not normal to see people struggling or homeless. A lot of the things that people think are normal in the US definitely are not. Once you step out of the comfort zone and travel, you really begin to understand what is supposed to Be normal and how public systems are supposed to be.",

You're literally at a graduation where the sole purpose of the ceremony is to celebrate what a woman or a man has done over the course of four or five years to obtain a specific degree in which they're going to utilize as a career. And while I didn't listen to the whole thing, it did sound a bit self indulgent. It was a diatribe of his political beliefs and really came from an utter place of privilege and the Assumption of what he thinks women should be excited about. And so, no, I don't think it's appropriate at a college graduation to share those viewpoints. I don't care if he's Catholic, I don't care what kind of a college it is. The idea that a woman's worth is tied to her homemaking status or her ability to be a wife is like it's stuck in the stone ages.",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him."

Every gay man don't wear dresses and heels. And if it is gonna be displayed to a kid, cause you have young kids who already know what they like. If that is the case, that's not what the whole gay world is built upon. Nails, heels, dresses, wigs and gowns. That's first and foremost not for a kid. So when I say it's the time and the place, you. He could have wore that dress that he was anywhere else. Why he couldn't put on his suit inside? For a kid's cartoon, it's not that motherfucking important. That's the part charge failing to realize. It ain't got nothing to do with nobody accepting you or not accepting you. It's not for a kid. What grown ass man is even comfortable walking around some kids with some heels on? The community. I'mma say it since ain't nobody else gonna say it. It's so many boys walking around with dresses, heels, makeup and skirts on. That that's why a lot of people have a hard time respecting the transgender community. Because you have so many clowns walking around, people cannot identify what's trans and what's not. And you have people that have put blood, sweat and tears, mental and everything. And today and today, transition and shit like that. And it goes out the window. Because you have so many men with beards and mustaches and nails on. That is made of mockery out of people life who live this shit every motherfucking day. It's a lot of the boys from the community that fucks it up for our trans women. Because you got so many of y'all walking around in skirts and shirts. Bitch, nobody knows what real trans is anymore."

    "voice_to_text": "this is a great question that I get asked all the time so I thought I'd do a little video to explain because my way of getting an agent wasn't necessarily the usual um usual way so basically when you go to musical theatre college or like a drama school acting school whatever the usual way is that your college will put on a um showcase a performance a show at the end of your third year where\u00a0they'll\u00a0invite\u00a0loads\u00a0of\u00a0agents agents come along your informations there for agents to contact you they watch the show they say I like them you contact you Merry Christmas you get yourself an agent because I went to for whatever reason I actually don't know I think things have changed now that but we didn't have any agent showcase we didn't have um Agent you know a musical that they can come and watch we didn't have a showcase we had a summer show that the whole college was involved in and the agents would come and watch but you know they might see someone they really like and they'd be like first year so they weren't available to them and it wasn't specifically for agents it was just so happened like if agents happened to buy tickets and come and watch they could so really weirdly we had to kind of go like the underground back route to get agents and it was kind of a thing where it wasn't really discussed because you weren't really allowed to contact agents even though everyone did and I'm sure the staff all knew the people contacted agents but we weren't really allowed to discuss it I don't know why it was so weird but basically what happened was is that um agents were either coming and you would either hear from friends at so and so and tonight because they've maybe emailed them but you could email but we would email ahead to say hi by college during this summer show and I've got feature or whatever like please come and watch so I contacted a few agents and then I also had um someone I knew who had graduated that college a couple years before me and their agent came to watch and they messaged me and said hey my agent watch the show um she'd love to have a meeting with you can I put you in contact and I said yes and that's actually the agent I ended up with um but also other um like third years of the time so by the time I got to 3rd year people who were in my 3rd year who were with agents their agents would come and watch and then use them to contact us so I get messages from people being like hey my agent came to watch um the show the other day they'd love to have a meeting with you can I put you in contact that way um and then the other agents that I met with were just people that I'd reached out to and they said yeah would love a meeting and then you have your meetings and like some agencies were really keen to have a meeting with me and then I went for a meeting thought it went all well and then they didn't offer me representation I think it really just depends on like your vibe like if the agent feels like they're gonna get on with you if you feel like you're gonna get on your agent and yeah I went to a meeting with my current agent while I was in third year sat down with her and had a coffee and we just had a chat and really really got on with her and I was like yeah this is gonna work really well and it has um and she actually approached me because I had a solo to open the college summer show which is another whole story within itself so maybe I'll tell that story here sometimes it's quite funny story um but yeah she was like really keen to meet with me and yeah it all went really well so that's how we got ages at our college it was a bit of a different way so if you go to a university or college or whatever musical theatre college that don't allow you access to agents in the like um conventional way it's not impossible and also if you don't end up going to a college and training in musical theatre and doing it that way it's also not impossible to get agents and there are always ways in"

But recently, I got into gardening again because I've had friends come over, they bring over their gardening tools, and I'm like, well, you're not gonna garden by yourself, babe. Which got me thinking, I can't only be gardening when you come over. I have to be able to garden by myself. So I had this crazy little idea since I got my little gardening tools. Now, what if I set a timer on my phone for every five minutes? And every time the timer goes off, I have to garden. we're gonna figure out how many times I can garden every five minutes before I tap out. What do you say? I knew you'd be into it. Let's get it. First thing, let me set a timer. Now, let's take the first one so I can start this timer. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight was cash. I'm making a new one. And I'm also going to make it two every five minutes, because I feel like I'm not challenging myself. And that was eight and nine, 10 and 11, 12 and 13, 14, 15. Holy shit. 16, 17, 18, 19. I need to hit one more. It was cashed. Okay. Twenty and a half, if you count the cashed. I just, like, got up and walked around for a second to, like, stretch my legs and stuff. And, um, I forgot why I was telling you that. So, after harvesting 20 gardens, um. Yeah. Yep. Side note, I just realized how still my hands are. These fuckers are rock solid. I ain't moving. Jesus Christ, man. You don't understand. I have anxiety really, really bad. I shake like a Chihuahua. Dude, I ain't moving is nice."

You might have heard of him. You actually, you probably haven't, cause we've seen your hair in a hospital bed. As if he just went through the pains of labor and is in some form of recovery. The poor child is screaming and crying out for a mother that it will never know. Tell me you know nothing about newborns without saying you know nothing about newborns. I mean, I don't know if you know this, but when they come out, they, um, they cry. It's pretty natural. It's natural thing. There is no excuse for this crap to be legal. There's no socially redemptive value. And a deranged lunatic man purchasing a child and taking them and intentionally depriving them of a much needed mother in their life. Do you fact check anything? Anything at all? This guy's pretty well known and his surrogacy journey was everywhere. He didn't buy a baby. His sister carried a baby for him and his partner in a loving and caring way. And this whole painting that a trans person bought a baby and then held it like they were pretending to be a woman is just Bullshit. And this. This is the hate speech that we have going on where we could just change the narrative of a picture, and people believe it. People are commenting all over the place that we allow people with mental health issues to have a baby, which clearly there is nothing that shows in this picture that anybody has any mental health issues. Trans community does not have mental health issues to where they cannot care for a baby. Gay community does not have mental issue mental health issues where they cannot care for a baby.

Because I can tell you, if the kids don't turn out in any way, shape or form that he pleases, he will probably just throw them on the street and make them somebody else's problem. Yep.",

    "voice_to_text": "Outfits inspired by Mask Lesbians, part 2. Guys, I'm brand new to this. My stylist friend Corey Carter just took me shopping, like, a couple weeks ago. I'm standing on the handsomely broad shoulders of 1,005 six masks. I'm clay in the Potter's hands. I'm but a wee babe cradled in the strong yet tender arms of lesbian love. And I thank you for it. Now, you guys ask for more outfits, and for my ex Mormon friends in the comments, you shall receive it through the veil of TikTok. Let's go. But before we get started, we got to remember where we came from. This is a picture of me before the mask fashion algorithm snatched me out of obscurity. This outfit is white noise in more ways than one. If this was a sound, I'd be asleep. My hair looks like you could surf on it. But we're in post algorithm times. Let's see the looks. There he is. This guy looks like he probably drinks IPAs and avoids going fishing with his Republican uncle, but he looks damn good doing it. We got the high tops with the green shorts and the hat. And glasses, cause you guys asked for more glasses. Historically, I've struggled with brown clothes, but we're leaning in. We're finding our way. We got a crop tee. We're back with the pearls. A little Easter egg art for you last of us fans. Lastly, we got this gym. I have not had the Confidence to wear this out in public. So I'll just share it with millions of people on TikTok. Cause that totally makes sense. We got the dangly pearl earring, the high waisted trousers, and we got a little fake nose ring because you guys wouldn't leave me alone about it. But this outfit is a perfect example of, like, a masculine look with just a little feminine. Just you. Just a little spice, just a little something. Shout out again to the, uh, mask lesbians on my algorithm for bringing me to the light and teaching me your ways.",

Since the cast and the journey, we have to go back in 2017. Twice upon a time, the show has been hit with these comments left and right. But what if I said. And hold on, maybe it's always been that way. Let's start with the casting of an openly gay man as an openly gay, or at least boy character. And everyone loves him. He's a fan favourite. What about openly gay characters like Bill parts? Or, hell, even boy ones like River Song? Look, there she is. There she is. But you get my point? That there has always been this kind of representation in doctor who. Now, I'm not saying that this new era, you know, isn't kinda pushing it with certain little scenes. Like, I completely agree. That is pushing the boat out a little bit too much. I don't know, maybe it's just me. What do you guys think is doctor who to work now? Let me know.",

She would pick one girl up, take her to see Dune, share a bucket of popcorn with her, take her ice skating, buy her a hot chocolate, tell her how pretty her eyes were on the way home. The next day, she would pick the other girl up, take her to see Dune, the same movie, share a bucket of popcorn with her, take her to the same ice skating rink, buy her hot chocolate, and tell her how pretty her eyes were on their way home. Like some kind of social experiment. Truman shows situationship situation. It was. I've never heard anything like it. And they both kept dating her."

    "voice_to_text": "Here's a tip on how to look less insecure in public. I'll just stand up so I can show you. Okay, so the main thing is don't look pussy with the mannerisms in the shit that you do. One thing, I used to do a lot of nervous tick fuck with my shirt when I felt uncomfortable in public where I just felt weird. I would like do this and try to hide my stomach cause I just felt off and it was a nervous take of mine. So the way to counter that and not make it look insecure is just look down at it. So if you notice that you're like, visioning with your shit, just stop and look at it. Fix your shirt, get it situated. If you got a piece of lint on it, grab it, pull it off. Be intentional with the action. Don't do the whole pussy thing and like, be so scared and timid. And the other thing with fidgeting, like if you wear jewelry and stuff. A lot of people wear jewelry to have something to fidget with, but it can make you look insecure as fuck. The same thing applies if you're fidgeting and you feel uncomfortable or you feel like your bracelet has flipped or moved around and you're trying to just like, silently flip it, look down at it, whatever is flipped, just fix it and you're done. When you try not to pull attention to something is when It draws more attention. So if you're gonna fix your shirt, fix the motherfucker. If you're gonna fix your bracelets, fix them. And stop doing the little scared, timid eyes. This is just a little tip. Something physical to help you. But if you have anything mental you wanna know about confidence to leave in the comments. Ask away. Let's start a series of this shit."

For life. This will be a simple but very important evolution as we seek to ensure that everyone feels welcome in Scouting.\u201d The change is expected to come into effect by February 2025 on the organisation\u2019s 115th anniversary, according to the Boy Scouts of America. Girls aged seven to 10 years have been able to join the scouting organisation\u2019s program since at least 2018, with girls aged 11 to 17 being permitted to join a year later. Boy Scouts of America wrote at the time that the decision was requested by families for years to help consolidate programs for their children, according to CNN. The decision to change its name to best acclimate who is allows to participate in Boy Scouts of America programs has, predictably, been heavily criticised by right-wing organisations which have called the decision \u201cwoke.\u201d The infamous right-wing social media account, Libs of TikTok, said the decision was \u201cunreal\u201d in a post complaining about the Boy Scouts of America making itself more welcoming. \u201cWhy do they have to ruin everything,\u201d the account\u2019s owner, Chaya Raichik, wrote. Despite the backlash, Krone has insisted that the future of the organisation remains bright, saying to the Associated Press: \u201cIn the next 100 years we want any youth in America to feel very, very welcome to come into our programs.\u201d \u201cPart of my job is to reduce all the barriers I possible can for people to accept us as an organisation and to join,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt sends a really strong message to everyone in America that they can come to this program.\u201d More than 1 million under-18s are currently enrolled in Boy Scouts of America programs across the US, including 176,234 girls and young women. 6,000 of those girls are believed to have earned their Eagle Scout rank \u2013 the highest rank attainable in a BSA program for participants who have earned a minimum of 21 merit badges and been a Life Scout for at least six months. Boy Scouts of America alumni include former presidents, including Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford, astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Stars Wars actor Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg. #boyscouts #boyscoutsofamerica #tedcruz #libsoftiktok #usnews #republicans #ComfortSegredos ",

See, now, when we told y'all it was people that are just starting to manifest, including artist, musical artists that are on big platforms, just starting to manifest right in front of our face. And you have to ask yourself, why are they letting them on big musical platforms? Interesting enough how they'll blow up people like this, but won't blow up godly artist. The video with this woman calling herself a witch was from Eurovision. And you think to yourself, how do these people get on these platforms? Because the world is being ran by wickedness. Are y'all starting to open up and see it yet? Because we've been talking about it with a lot of different American artists. There's been too many people going to concerts that are demonic. How do you call yourself a person of god? How do you call yourself a Christian and still listen to these people and still watch these people? I said it before, and it's happening now even more. The veil is being lifted. And you have a choice whether you wanna go with the world or whether you wanna go with god. And if you are still watching these people, if you are still listening to these people, you are going with the world. It's time to wake up, my brothers and sisters, because this is only gonna Get worse. And your mind is either going to be sealed in the world in a beast consciousness, or your mind is going to be sealed with the name of God, Jorhe vavhe, meaning you'll be in God's character and function. But if it's sealed with the world, you will be in the world's character and function. But that choice will ultimately be up to you. Now is the cutoff time. Make it happen before it's too late. God bless. Shalom."

So, um, that was only reason I would do that shit. So then I dmed him, like, he had posted some of his story afterwards, and so I put hard eyes on that. I thought I was like, okay, we. You don't have to. We do it that. Like, this man screenshotted that shit, posted it was like, oh, I'm gonna beat this man up tomorrow. What, you're gonna beat me up? Like, my guts or. Or like, what do you mean? Um, this is the day he, like, he posted it. Cause I'm like, boy, what the fuck? Like, you posted, you comment your heart eyes on my picture. Like, he was like, no, this. This boy playing in my mother. What? I have to screenshot? Like, do you want me to embarrass you? Like, you really do it a lot. Next day, right past them, you didn't be nothing. Not even the guts. I was kind of sad actually, cause, like, hmm. You know, I'm saying. But come to find out now that, like, graduated and all that shit. Hmm. Guess who I, like, saw on Tinder the Gay Part. Hmm. Hmm."

Yesterday was a great day. My Chipotle bowl was full. The sun is out. Let me get out some compliments. I was telling the girls gays and days, they look amazing. Giving them their flowers. I'm walking home at night and this girl had a bomb outfit on. I'm talking dress to the nines. Wherever she was coming from, she tore that down. I was feeling myself walking home, but I had to stop and say, girl, you look good. When I tell you, the look on her face gags me. Curse, clutch, eyes wide. One girl was genuinely scared, which honestly kind of saddens me. I could tell she was scrambling for her words, but the first thing that came up was, oh, I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. One thing about me. I'mma make sure the girls feel comfortable. Had to clear my voice and I said, oh, baby, you look so good. And the gayest voice I could. Right when I did that, my girl unclench her purse, eyes relax until she was so relieved. It's all for a little bit. Afterwards, I said, girl, what you choose a right. When I said that, she said, the bear."

Hedman, 64, pulled out of the Denmark Open when set to play defending champion 27-year-old Noa-Lynn van Leuven in the quarter finals, Fox News reported. Although it was initially reported that she had pulled out due to illness, Hedman confirmed on Twitter/X that she refused to play Van Leuven. \u201cNo fake illness, I said I wouldn\u2019t play a man in a women\u2019s event,\u201d she wrote, misgendering Van Leuven. \u201cThis subject [is] causing much angst in the sport I love. People can be whoever they want in life, but I don\u2019t think biological-born men should compete in women\u2019s sport.\u201d Van Leuven went on to lose to Beau Greaves in the semi-finals.  Former US college swimmer Riley Gaines, who has made a name for herself by campaigning against trans women competing in women\u2019s sports, offered to pay Hedman\u2019s lost prize money. The winner of the Denmark Open receives 12,000 Krona (approximately \u00a31,400).  \u201cThank you for your kind offer,\u201d Hedman replied. \u201cDenmark Darts paid me out in full for the event.\u201d Matthew Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation, has previously spoken out in support of Van Leuven, explaining that she complies with the organisation\u2019s transgender participation policy. In an interview with Online Darts, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our policy in darts, it\u2019s a policy we are very comfortable with.

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

Let me say, I started these three weeks ago, so, you know, when that booking came in, I couldn't wait to do his first retwist because he has, like, literally the perfect texture for locks. Then he showed up with that mush that I see in the beginning. I don't give a damn. One thing I'm gonna do is eat up some short locks. So, you know, I had to wash his hair. So I put it in a little ponytails and wash them. This was after the wash. So as I get to cut afterwards, I see his hair is longer than I thought. Or his hair grew quick as hell in him. 3 weeks. Either way I went, I'm like, I think I might be able to do a style. If I do one, are you gonna want it? Cause he's under the pressure. He's not gonna get a style because my job, he only booked for retwists. So I used to retwist that real quick and I'm thinking, already straight back for barrels, but the ones in the front wasn't going. So I tried to do the first one and I just stopped in the middle of my. Let me just do the back first and see how I come out. Gray said, take that shit down, and I took that shit down. Psych now. Yeah, that was me who didn't like It. And I'm never gonna get something that I wouldn't even walk out the doorway. So I'm always check with shot first. We decided to go with this. Yeah. I just love doing third locks. But come back in 3 weeks for an update.",

    "voice_to_text": "Familia, quick question. How do you all feel about the images that I'm showing you all on screen? This is from a parade that happened in the east side of San Jose during Cinco de Mayo. The person that posted the original video called them drag Queens. Although I am unsure, because as far as I know, drag Queens tend to be very exaggerated. And this is pretty mellow. So I love for somebody to educate me here. But now let's listen to the original commentary. Dude, they had drag Queens at the Cinco de Mayo. Pray for East San Jose. It wasn't on the flyer announced. Um, nothing wrong with drag Queens. Nothing wrong with gay people. I have a gay uncle, we have a. I have a trans nephew. The thing is, not everybody raises their sons to be feminized. And you know, not everyone raises their sons, uh, to wear dresses. Matter of fact, a lot of, lot of fathers be like, dude, guys don't wear dresses. And if he grows up to wanna wear dresses, is fine. But us, his fathers and parents, um, some of us are, you know, very, very, how do you say, careful about what's planted in our kids minds at a very influential young age. They don't got drag Queens in the Portuguese festivals. They don't got drag Queens with the Vietnamese celebrating their stuff. The Indian community don't have drag Queens. The Pacific honors don't got drag Queens. Not wrong. With drag Queens. But how come? It was the gay parade, we got the drag Queens, and now guess who has drag Queens now? The East Side Saturday Cinco de Mayo parade. I'm just. Maybe I'm tripping. Let's ask community. The account is that East Side San Jose at times. Keeps calling himself the news but seems a little biased to be honest. He has his comments limited so it's really hard to have a discourse unless you're already following him. But I feel some type of way about his commentary here, so I wanna start this conversation. Despite him saying over and over again that he doesn't have a problem with it, it sure sounds like he does. I'll make a part two. I'll fully dive into what I think about this for some foreshadowing though. I think our community needs to continue to evolve in mind. Says that the one that he's pushing forward here only hold us back. The folks in that video you later on Laugh At are members of our community, are freely expressing themselves, and they're not harming anyone. I think it's a wonderful message for you to learn to express themselves freely as well, but for media. I'll make a long video about this. For now, just let me know what do you all think.",

    "voice_to_text": "is it okay if I touch you during our conversation and my pronouns are she they if you wanted to share yours she her perfect what would you like to do with your hair today that's a really good question I'm looking for a big change so more please so I'm kind of thinking that like I said I kind of watched a little bit everything you've ever posted I'm kind of just wanting to see what you think because I don't wanna go too crazy short I don't want straight across bangs and other than that I'm pretty open okay so I have like naturally like wavy hair and it kind of like gets real curly up in here and I kind of just want to enhance that I want like volume I wanted to be fun like this is very different cause I've always had just long hair and like that was a vibe for a while but it just I don't think it fits me anymore so sure sure sure got it well we can definitely make big changes and maintain length at the same time I'm not super attached to the length okay so let's start with the overall hanging length down through here first could you point where you would be open to trimming it to I'd say probably like here okay so what I'm getting from you is you're okay with taking length off yes but then I want to clarify do you still want it to fall below your shoulders then I mean I'm okay either way if it's a little bit above that's fine a little bit below that's fine okay but you're looking to take off length yes yes a significant amount I think a significant amount and you could still have it fall below your shoulders okay and that's still going to feel like a change because we're going to be doing um other stuff in the haircuts make it look different as well but taking this amount off would be fantastic for you okay getting that just like brought up oh yeah really beautiful yeah on you okay so then let's talk about the stuff around the face here so this stuff around the face you're saying I want to kind of enhance what's going on yeah there are some pretty curly curly yeah but as of right now it's all kind of one length so the way that we could change it is we could do some face framing layers okay a bang situation um did you have any ideas for the stuff that was around your face so if you have any pictures so I have a couple I'm just kind of like not super like set really I guess on anything cause I think for me it's hard to like like I look at a haircut on somebody else and I'm like oh yeah that's super cute but I can't envision it on myself sure if that makes sense maybe just cause it's been pretty much my whole life that it's look the same way and I'm like it's just kinda boring right see what do we got I love the name of your board can I share it with everyone yeah cool gay aunt hair that's the goal that's the goal okay yes the pictures help the pictures help slowly yeah and see that's why I'm not like that yeah and I feel like that would work I feel like really well with my natural waves yes I love that one can we scroll down a little bit more yeah is that it these are the ones yeah okay which one's your favorite though I like this one yep and I also like this one I just like how it's voluminous it's fun like there's something happening lots of texture layers stuff like that so okay these two haircuts are very similar they they do still kind of fall a little bit below the shoulders this one here is cut shorter around the face so like if she pushes this back it's above the shoulders I just love that one yeah I think I think I do like how it's like shorter up here and longer in the back I think when I put it up to you that'll look really cute absolutely okay so I'm gonna talk more about what I see in that photo okay um in addition to taking off the link which we already talked about we've moved on to the front part which in this photo is shorter it's not a full bang but it's certainly significantly shorter than what you have going on it's cut shorter in the middle to something longer so that you can like push it up and off your face if you would like I think that would look fantastic I love that idea yes so like in the picture it's probably like cheekbone length maybe okay just kissing the sides of the eyebrows so are you comfortable when I hold this stuff up here it just makes me a little bit nervous with the like curliness right here so we could leave it a little bit longer okay let's do that first and we'll see what happens with the curls and then we can make game time decision if you wanna take it shorter okay but I think leaving it you know like cheekbone length will have enough length on it if it does spring up it's not gonna look crazy and you'll have enough length that if you need to use a blow dryer to like style it a little bit it won't be hard okay I'm just worried that they're gonna go yeah so I get that well what we'll do is we will be conservative okay so that it doesn't spring up okay you can certainly have shorter pieces around your face I understand that concern we will definitely talk through that look at this little teeny bit yeah they just I don't know they just do whatever they just do what they do yeah I can't wait to get them wet and see what happens okay so this through here is also significantly different and in the photo what I see is a lot more layering and I see the layers also being shorter but cut in such a way that there isn't a bunch of fullness taken away from the end so it's not cut so that it like tapers and gets really skinny around the bottom you still see a lot of fullness down through the bottom and then there are also shorter pieces okay brought up through here so we bring up the length here and then this is all cut shorter too I think that's gonna be fantastic absolutely you can use your imagination when I yep and this oh my gosh I'm so excited for this yes okay so we're popping up the length we are doing some layering around the face fully aware we're nervous about how the curls gonna be so we're gonna do it conservatively and slowly to see what happens and then what we're going to do is significantly layer the hair after we pop up the length but we aren't going to layer it in a way that makes it like really skinny and tapered around the bottom there's a lot of fullness a lot of movement and a lot of peaceiness through this okay I think that's fantastic yes yes yes let's do it",

Life is just getting a little easier and easier and easier and oh that's great it's wonderful but it's not. I think when we force ourselves into tough situations, that's what the human creatures supposed to do. They're not supposed to have wheels on their suitcases. They're not supposed to have lawn mowers with engines that pull them along. It's a convenience no question, but it just makes things easier. Now with AI you can literally put your brain in the pickle jar and have that machine do it. So, I cherish these moments, I cherish hard work even though I hate it.

Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough",

So apparently, Jake Paul has gone on to talk badly about Tyson's deceased daughter. Wrong move, dude. Anybody remember this guy? Remember him? So soon as this all happened? I mean, this was weeks ago, but as soon as all this happened, Tyson was like, ha! No more exhibition. Went straight to the commissioner in Texas and said, this will be a real fight now. What does this mean? This means it will go on the record, okay? It will not be for fun and giggles. I like to think of Mike Tyson as, like, a domesticated wolf. You know how some people have those. You know, those half wolves have this whatever, and. And they're just, like, so pretty, but they're big, and they're just, like, kind of. Huh. But what people don't realize is their wild animals. And Mike Tyson, my friends, is a wild animal. So Jake better enjoy how your face looks now, bro, because ain't gonna look like that afterwards.",

Um, so I didn't grow up with. Up to who? Cause I'm from the Netherlands and we don't have like a dog, so um, but I got into it later and it really helped me through a tough time. Um, and as you know, I've made myself alone so after it. Yeah. Brilliant. Um, anyway, I wanted to ask about like maybe your relationship with like, um, like gender and like expression, like masculinity and femininity. Cause I've always noticed even before you and Georgia became more like vocal but trans rights that you're always like, not afraid to show like femininity. And that inspires me to embrace it, to, you know, a bit traumatized by it cause I'm trans. Um, I'm only like, how is that changed over the years if, if changed at all? Cause I remember also reading something about like you in the 90s also being like not afraid to be called gay or something. Yeah, and that as well. So like, I wonder, um, like in now this environment with like more transparency and stuff like, has that for you personally changed at all? Don't know. This changes with this. I've hopefully learnt as that as that community has found ways of defining itself and and and and has provided a Sort of, you know, when I was a kid, the idea of. Of being non binary wasn't something that existed. It wasn't a concept. Uh, and. And. And I've. I've seen that emerge and people able to express themselves through that, and I only ever seems positive, as far as I can see. And I think the. The. The kind of. The weaponization of trans rights, gay rights, actually. Well, actually, when I was a teenager, I remember gay rights being weaponized politically, and that always felt ugly and nasty. And now we look back on that 30 years later, and those people are clearly on the wrong side of history. And now there's a sort of similar weaponization of these topics being taken by mostly the right wing or a certain section of society with trying to create fraction and conflict and division where it need be, where it is just about people being themselves and not, you know, need to. You don't need to be bothered about it. Just fuck off and let me move in. And that. That's the best, you know, that's, you know, it's just. It's that sense of just wanting people to be allowed to exist. And I think that there are, you know, that there are no ways of expressing gender identity, sexuality that are more nuanced than they once were. And that only seems to be positive if that helps people to know who they are and see who they are and Communicate to the world who they are. So why. I mean, that. That. My sense of that is just that we have to be in the world. That. That's. It's just common sense, baby. And. And, uh. I just. I think that's a very ugly, uh, use of. Use of these. Some people are being very, um. What am I trying to say? Uh.",

Now, if you don't understand what this creator is trying to insinuate, they're basically insinuating that female to male trans people only exist because of SA trauma that happened early on in life. But they're also being a prime example of god giving someone as much sense as they gave a rock and as much audacity as he gave a peacock. Because my original post was talking about essay performed against men, predominantly by men, and kept quiet due to the action or in action of other men. And this man decided to center his own opinion out of left field. And because it was out of a field about trans people, it tells me that more than likely he has secret desire that he is ashamed of. Because hate is very close to horniness. Say it with me now. If opinion requires facts to be valid, and it does not have facts, it is therefore not valid. And opinions are not peni. The little dangling that he is ashamed of. Not everybody needs to see it or hear it. But in the comment section of my video talking about my own essay, do you know the people that were ridiculing the most? Who are they? Men. And it is men like that creator and other men like the ones ridiculing me up and Down my original post. Are the reason why men are less likely, significantly so, to come forward about the essay. Did you know it is currently estimated that one in six men are victims and survivors of essay? And it's only an estimate. Because men do not come forward about it less they be deemed weak, ridiculed by their peers, and get no support by their peers when they come forward. Now, for reference, the essay in question I was talking about there happened when I was five, when I was five, and it was performed by 14 age men. And that was the first incident. Other incidents that happened later on in my life were performed by much older men. Now, I know it is not my fault. I know I did nothing wrong, honey. I know that. I have worked through it. I have spoken on stage about this, in advocacy, I have talked about this in articles. And that is why people are choosing the bear, because more often, they're the ones perpetrating the assault or they're the reason why the assault doesn't get reported or believed. And no, I'm not tagging the creator here, because that's what they want. They want the attention, because they have no talent in any other way of life other than spouting this turf nonsense that they are proudly a part of. This is for the Men SA survivors, okay? You did not deserve any of that. You are not to Blame for it. You are still worthy of love. And you are wonderful. And I'm so sorry that that happened to you, my darling."

By the department of justice for creating things to make it seem like the consumer has no choice but to use apple products with apple products, basically monopolizing their products and making it very hard for androids to interact with iPhone products and not be treated like it's a different brand. Examples of this include when you get pictures from androids, and they always look a little dusty, but when you get a. A picture from an iPhone, it's always clear. I thought that was just a technology in the mechanics. No, no. Another example of this is, like I mentioned earlier, when you get a text message from Android, it could be blue, but apple was like, now be gonna make it green, so they be feeling icky and gross when they text Android. You see, it's all marketing. That's crazy. IPhone was. Android is literally a marketing scheme, a marketing tactic. Because, in fact, I worked in phones, and iPhones and androids literally have the same exact qualities. Everything. Sometimes androids have more advanced technology, if you will, and iPhone will get it years later. This, that, and third, they make each Other's parts. Another example of this is when you transfer data from an iPhone iPhone, it's a seamless and flawless experience. Ask me how I know this. I sold phones for years before I got into marketing, but from iPhone to iPhone is a seamless transition. From Android to iPhone, you can have all type of difficulties, all type of things not working and everything not transferring over. So it was all literally making sense. for years I knew androids and iPhones were no better than one another, but what I didn't know was apple was doing it on purpose. They're literally doing it on purpose. So for the whole. Which one is better, iPhone or Android? They the same. Different brand, same purpose, same thing."

Right? That's the dynamic you guys are thinking, and that would be the norm. If you were to look up, like, intimate videos or whatever, and on the internet, then that's what you're gonna find a lot of the times is like that dynamic, specifically in heteronormative relationship. Sorry, not even heteronormative heterosexual relationship. But that's not necessarily how that works. In lesbian community and lesbian community, there isn't a norm of how intimate times work. You know what I mean? That's why we come up with terms to get an idea of what is it that you're into. That's why I'm so sick and tired of people like you. And this is a joke. I'm just tired of people who demonize pillow princes, cause this is what they think it means, and that's not what that means. Like, I love pillow princes. You have.

    "voice_to_text": "Y'all. So they trying to ban the New Testament of the Bible. I don't know if y'all seen that, but, like, let's talk about it, cause i'mma use my platform for this, because why would I not? They're trying to say that the New Testament is a hate speech toward a certain religious group, and I'm not gonna say the name on here cause y'all ain't gonna be trying to take my TikTok down. They're trying to say that the New Testament is a hate speech. And I read the whole Bill, and pretty much they're trying to provoke people on college campuses from talking about the war and, you know, watermelon versus Israel. That's what they're trying to do right now. Um, so with that being said, they're passing a Bill that is going to cause people not to be able to talk about the people of Israel, the certain religious background of Israel. I'm just not saying the name cause they gonna try to take my video down. They ended up bringing the Bible up into this, saying that if they pass this Bill, it's going to have an effect on the Bible. And saying that if they pass the Bill is pretty much, you know, like, the Bible correlates exactly with the Bill. So that means that we're not gonna be able to read the Bible. Like, we can't talk about the Bible or nothing like that. Well, in particular, the New Testament, but it's just like, All the things in the world we got going on, y'all always trying to bash Christianity, always trying to take Jesus down, which you'll never do, because one thing I know about Christians, we stand 10 toes for Jesus. Like, you're not gonna tell me I can't read a Bible. I'm sorry. Wear the handcuffs, wear the handcuffs. Wear the handcuffs, baby on. Wear the handcuffs, cause I'm gonna have to go to jail. Like, you're not gonna tell me I cannot read a Bible or pray to god or Jesus. Every time I see somebody try to say that Christianity isn't real, think of these moments when they, like, go out their way to make sure that they pick on the Bible. Make sure you remember this. Remember all the times they pick on Christians, they try to ban the Bible. They ban the Bible in Utah and schools saying that it was, you know, violent and all these other things. I mean, okay, so, yeah, I just wanted to come on here and talk about that. You know, for a second I felt scared, but then I'm like, at the end of the day, prophecy has to be fulfilled. But I really don't personally think they're gonna pass this law because it's gonna be too much outrage, y'all. Like, it's gonna be an outrage if they do that. Like, that's just that.",

Time lapse. Oh, familiar. Gosh dang. This was a great cheese. The whole thing is coated in this super sweet blueberry sauce and mixed with the creamy butteriness of this goat cheese. It was like I was eating a cheesecake. It was like a blueberry cheesecake or it. It kinda tasted like Chobani. I never got Chobani flip as a kid growing up cause my mom thought it was kind of a waste of money, and she's kinda right cause I would never buy. I think the vanilla is mixed in with the cheese, which really brings out that rich flavor of the goat cheese. This is like the Pinnacle of sweet cheeses. I could eat this whole thing, but I'm not gonna cause I'm out of Lactaid. I'm going to Isonok in like a second here. I'll just save it for when I'm back. Overall, this was a great cheese. Probably the best sweet cheese I've had so far. I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10 bonus round green apple. I recently said in a video that I was colorblind. Some of you guys in the comments were like, oh, so that's why you always look at the. The name instead of the color. And you're right. Most of the Time with this lighting specifically, I can't tell the difference between a green apple and a cherry.",

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

    "voice_to_text": "How to know if white cock or black cock is right for you? Let's talk about it. It's important to know that both will get the job done. But depending on your needs and what you need to fill, one is definitely better than the other. In my case, I will be choosing the black cock for the front. If you are working with a large gap or a hole, you will see that this is going to work beautifully. Now for the back door, my preferences? A white cock. As you can see here, the slit that I need to fill is much smaller. I know some of you may be thinking it's a little excessive to have two different cocks to get the job done, but I am all about the max efficiency and the shortest amount of time. It's also important to have the right size tip for the hole that you need to fill. Even if your cock is well used and pretty beat up like this one, don't worry, it will still work. Now the black cock is fairly new to me, but I did decide to go with a larger tip due to the size of the hole that I am working with today. You're gonna wanna hold it firmly and apply light pressure to the tip and then gently rub it into the crease or hole that you are wanting to fill. It can be a little nerve wracking at first, but don't Be afraid to really get in there and really work it into the area, as any excess mess can be cleaned up at a later time. Once you have filled the hole, you're gonna wanna take your finger and gently rub along everywhere you have put the caulk. I advise that you use a glove for Protection. Fortunately, I didn't have one handy and I was eager to get the job done, so I went ahead and went without. Not afraid. I think this gives a very smooth finish. Pro tip you're always gonna wanna keep a rag around if you're not using a glove, just to clean the excess mess off of your hands. Sometimes it gets a little sticky when it gets hard. Now that it is hard, I am very satisfied with the result.",

What do you do when that little boy that has seen you kiss a man in the mouth and hold his hand and do all that cuddle lovey dovey shit?

When are y'all bitches don't get it through your head that it's just not okay and it's the time and the place? That doesn't make me a self hating gay, that does not make me not love myself.

However, when a man tells me, oh, whatever you're doing isn't gonna get you a boyfriend, can I lie and say I'm a lesbian so that I can win the argument so that I can get the last word? Would you guys be okay with me lying and saying I'm lesbian so I can get the last word in an argument discussing whether or not I can get a boyfriend? Thanks."

So we're not just adding beer to mead, but we're actually combining their ingredients and letting them ferment together. For beer, that's malt extract, and for mead, it's just honey. So I'm no expert on beer making, and if you are, I could use some tips. But from what I can find, this malt needs to be added to boiled water, and this just helps kill off any bacteria and also makes it super easy to mix in. And I ended up using one full pound of malt, which will be combined with two pounds of honey. This ratio was honestly kind of a shot in the dark. For most meter recipes, I'll use three pounds of honey, but malt extract actually has a lot of fermentable sugar, and so we don't need as much. With the warm malt, the honey dissolved super easily, but I want to let it cool down to room temperature before adding the rest of the ingredients. Once cooled, I hydrated the yeast and added that to the mix along with a few grams of yeast nutrient. Honestly, I have no clue how the yeast will handle this combination of sugar, but if all the sugars converted, this should get close to 16% ABV, which would be crazy. Luckily the yeast didn't mine cause they started fermenting the next Day. It was actually way more foamy than it usually is. Is that typical with beer? So now we'll come back once this is finished and see how it turns out. So stay tuned."

She's like, you know, I, I, I get why. You know, a lot of men, when they get married, their wives kind of start to, you know, channel, you know, what they're doing or, you know, influencer decisions. It's like any, any group when you get married. And so I, thinking that I'm making a funny little joke, say, well, mom, at least you don't have to worry about that happening with me.

Like, I was deceptive in my teenage years for not being. Not coming out, and I'm like, well, you've shown that you would have taken it so freaking well. But, yeah, um, if you and your family have.

Especially if it's not, like, the worst, because if it's the worst, I get cutting it out and cutting them out 1,000%. But also when it's not like they fully accept or they're embracing, it's just weird. It's just weird to navigate. And, um. Yeah, I don't know what the answer is, but. I see you. I feel you.

Doesn't mean you have to hate something that isn't normal.

That gay relationships are exactly the same and as normal as a mum, a dad and kids. I believe I want my children to be taught that the normal thing in Britain, in society across the world, is a mother, a father and a family. I want them to be taught that there are gay people in the world. And that they must be treated with respect and affection. As I treat my own gay friends and colleagues with respect and affection. But I don't want my children to be taught that these things are equal. Cause I don't believe them to be equal. Apart from anything else. The human race would no longer exist if. If it was normal, uh.

If you don't already know, there's a lot of controversy right now between a learning skull and Kaya. Kaya basically shaded every trans bitch on the goddamn market, basically saying that, like, oh, any bitch that was a gay man before her transition, she's not a trans woman. That's a man. Now, if y'all don't know who Kai is, is this bitch right here. Now, does she not look familiar? Maybe I'm part of the same community that we all are in. Amen. But what I don't stand for is bullying other trans bitches because you think that. You eating, baby, this plate is still full, so I'm about to eat that ass up real quick. Amen. Last time I checked, you were on Musically going by a totally different name. We're not gonna use it. But you are by a totally different name, doing shit like this as if we all weren't. Okay. But you were a gay man, if I'm not mistaken. If I'm not mistaken, I was here before your transition, babe. Yeah, I was. Oh, trying to clock another bitches T or whatever the fuck I wanna use. Whatever the fuck I wanna say is crazy to me. A lot of trans girls were gay men before they transitioned. Amen. I have not seen, not One trans bitch be a straight man before she transition. I have yet to see that. The day that I see that, i'mma be flabbergasted. But as of right now, that's not something I have seen. That doesn't mean they don't exist. It just means I haven't seen it yet. Amen. Amen. So before you decide to clock another bitch basically saying she was a man beforehand, baby, you sure the fuck was too. Amen. You were gay before. Amen. I'm just saying because. And if y'all gonna talk y'all shit, baby, please add a bitch. Please add everybody. I wasn't added. I was just putting my two cents in. That was it. Because I'm like, bitch, ain't no way. One trans girl telling another trans girl that she was a man, a gay man beforehand.

I get made fun of in the comments all the time based off of my appearance and the fact that people think that I look and sound Manish. I post on TikTok because being transgender is fun, and people need to learn that. It's important that other people are communicated to, that being a part of this community is fun and enriching and nice, and it makes you happy. Tomorrow I'm in a Shakespeare performance where I'm playing two characters, and one of them is a man and one of them is a woman. And I couldn't be happier that I got to explore my artistic life in this way, where I can explore different genders of performance. My transgender friends are all super nice to me and inviting and, like, the sweetest people you'll ever meet in your life, because they know what it's like for people to hate them because of who they are, so they make sure that you feel accepted with them. As much as I wish that I was born female, like, it's so enriching to have transform throughout the course of my life into this beautiful woman. Even if my glasses fall out whenever I swing my hair. Like, look at me! I got to see this person grow in a way that cisgender people will never be able to experience, and that's something so beautiful. Being trans Is fun and beautiful, and that's why I post on here. Trans joy is real and it's important."

I've even had people call me a self hating gay because of my response from this. But to answer that question, I will be devastated. And you wanna know why I would be devastated? It's because I live in this world every day where I'm not accepted. I walk in rooms and people still turn their face up at me. I have me and who still won't shake my hand or judge me because of what they feel like I do in the privacy of my own bedroom. So when you ask the question of how would I feel about it? I would be devastated because I would never want my kid to live and go through what it is that I have experienced and went through. Then secondly, you get those people out there who automatically feel like he's gonna be gay because he's being raised in a gay household. Well, let's. Let's clear that up really quick. What I do in my bedroom does not make me or disqualify me from being a parent. My kid don't see to me and kissing and to me and holding hands and to me and laid up, because that's not the reality of what I want him to do. I'm not raising him to think that what I do and how I live my life is okay. Me and date women and reproduce is what I'm guiding him to be. I never am raising a kid to think that LGBT is the way to go. Or the fact that he's a boy, he should date boys. No, you're a boy, you should date a woman. And I monitor the things that he see. My son don't see to me. And kissing in the mouth, he don't see to me. And holding hands, he don't see to me. And later, he don't see to me. And humping, he don't see me dancing and bogging. I have lost a lot of gay friends in this present day because a lot of them feel like I act funny or I don't involve them in my real lifestyle. And you wanna know what the real answer to that is? I am acting funny and I don't involve them. Because at the end of the day, I am raising a son who needs to see a certain type of protocol. My lifestyle, the LGBT, what I do, that's grown up business, okay? And as far as women, a lot of women been sucking each other's pussies for a long motherfucking time, and they don't take them away from being a mother. So why the fuck me want to get fucked by a man? Takes away from me being a man and a father. That's because a lot of y'all bitches don't know grown UPS and bedroom business. Your kids should know what The fuck you doing in your bedroom? Your kids should know what grown folks do. Yokia should know what game means at such a young age. Because you are in control of the things that they see. You feel me? So yeah, bitch, I'll be devastated cause y'all bitches are still so judgmental and cruel.",

We're celebrating wicked, ungodly lifestyles. They're not really lifestyle, they're deaf styles. Because if everybody practiced it, it would mean the extinction of the human race in less than 100 years. Everybody went homosexual, everybody went lesbian. If ever. If all women turn to women. If all men turn to men and there was no in vitro fertilization and no false ways to make babies, it would mean the extinction, uh, the extinction of the human race in less than 100 years, we would be gone. Why do you think my brother's god said it is not good that the man, the male should be alone in something when it come to procreation? If you got 10,000 males, we're still alone. You got a million men, there's a million men want to become the procreation. We're still alone. We don't get a partner until a lady show up. And if that was a island where there was 10,000 men and one woman, I tell you what would happen. A short period of time, that be 10,000 dead men go. We kill each other trying to get to that one woman."

    "voice_to_text": "Have you ever heard of white torture? It's something far more sinister than you might expect. White torture is a type of psychological torture technique aimed at complete sensory deprivation and isolation. A prisoner is held in a cell that deprives them of all senses and identity. It is particularly used in Iran. However, there is also evidence of its use by Venezuela and United States intelligence services. The prisoner is deprived of all color. Their cell is completely white, the walls, floor, and ceiling, as well as their clothes and food. Neon tubes are positioned above the occupant in such a way that no shadows appear. The cell is soundproof and void of any sound, voices, or social interaction. Guards stand in silence, dressed in all white, wearing padded shoes to avoid making any noise. Prisoners cannot hear anything but themselves in terms of taste and smell. The prisoner is fed white food, classically unseasoned rice, to deprive them of these senses. Further, all surfaces are smooth, robbing them of the variability of touch sensations. Detainees are often held for months or even years. The effects of white torture are well documented in a number of testimonials. Typically, prisoners will become depersonalized by losing personal identity for extended periods of isolation. Other effects can include hallucinations or psychosis. It was documented in the case of Amir Fakravar, who was arrested in his native Iran and subjected to white torture for eight months in 2004. While the physical pain of sensory Deprivation is minimal compared to other torture techniques. The psychological damage is beyond compare. Vakravar was quoted as saying when he was released, he was not a normal person anymore and could no longer remember even the faces of his parents."

And if we being honest, if they asked us would we rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or woman, I probably be stuck in the woods with a bear because I never seen a mama bear pick her kids up on Friday and drop them off at her grandma house and don't pick them up until Sunday night. I never seen a mama bear wake up one day and just decide that she's unhappy so the whole house has to be unhappy and she leaves her marriage and her kids. I never seen a mama bear put her babies in a microwave and turn it off for an excess amount of time to ultimately kill her child because of postpartum. I never heard a mama bear saying that her youngest kid was getting bullied by her two older kids, so she killed her two older kids and kept them in the freezer for years while people were searching for her kids. I never once, like, had these type of things come from a mama bear. So I'm pretty much skeptical of dealing with a woman in the woods. I'm sorry. I'm just putting it out there.",

But I remember in, like, 2015, 2016, when all of these men drag Queens and men became, like, sort of the face of the makeup community. Now, the thing is, men are doing their makeup to appear like women, to kind of cosplay as women. That's literally what drag is, right? It's men cosplaying as women. So naturally, like, when a man is cosplaying as a woman, they're doing all this, like, heavy, heavy contouring and structuring and this, like, thick, thick makeup to try to, you know, raise your cheekbones, chisel your cheekbones, lift your face, cover your beard. And then they became the ones teaching these young girls had to do their makeup. I remember doing my first book tour, and one of the moms was like, just so much highlighter. And look into the line of people waiting to meet me, and there was so much highlighter. You know, they say that Gen Z is, like, aging more quickly. I'm gonna go ahead and blame that. Like, all of these products, all of this makeup, we didn't really have that. The thing that's, like, really triggering this in me is I just used my foundation as my concealer, and I was like, this is the whole point of, like, a buildable foundation, right, is you can put a Little bit more in places that you need a little bit more. But at some point, all foundation became, like, we need full, full coverage. And that became, like, the standard is, like, we don't need all that. Do you have, like, severe, severe acne? Okay. Then you might need, like, very full coverage. Do you have relatively clear skin with, like, some blemishes or circles under your eyes? Then you don't need a full coverage foundation. And I'm. I'm glad that, like, this, like, clean girl aesthetic is coming back, because I think it's healthier for women. I think it's more natural for women. And, like, listen, I'm really not trying to be the girl who's, like, makeup shaming, you know what I mean? Like, that's not me. But when we're talking about, like, these beauty standards, of these expectations of women and what we should be doing, a lot of women feel like they have to have this super full coverage look in order to be pretty. And if you like the full coverage look, that's wonderful."

The people of York are proper grafters, but what UK city has the laziest people? Coming in at number five, it's Manchester with 6.4% of the city's population on unemployment benefits. At number four, we move next door to Oldham with 6.6% of people on the dole. Making it into the top three, it's your favourite city? It's Bradford. Bradford currently has 6.9% of its residents claiming benefits. At number two we have the city of Wolverhampton with a whopping 7.3% of its residents unemployed. But is anyone surprised? There can't be many jobs to work in Wolverhampton. And finally at number one and crown, the UK's Dole Dossa capital with a staggering 8.9% of its population claiming unemployment benefits, it's Birmingham.",

Every time we hear a big alpha man complain about how there's no good women, we're actually hearing him telling himself about his lack of masculinity. When a man steps up and puts the work in, he naturally attracts good women. Women feel safe to be around him, and he has the opportunity to catch the woman of his dreams. One of my favorite videos on the internet is a loving husband saying that he had to earn the love of his wife and earn her femininity. It is on men to earn the goodness of a woman. You don't just pick up a woman at an adoption center like she's a pet and say, oh, you better be a good woman. It is on a man to earn that. Men used to jump through hoops to even be in the presence of a woman. Even a lot of our own grandfathers went through unimaginal lengths to get the affection and attention of our grandmothers. But now women are supposed to settle for men who make TikTok videos, slamming them in their womanhood and having the audacity to say, there's no good women. No, sir. They're just out in the world avoiding men like you and waiting on real men who put the work in to earn them.",

The stems in the undersides of the leaves are covered with tiny hairs called tricombs. They'll stick into your skin like a needle and inject chemicals, including histamine. It doesn't feel too good, but they're one of the most nutritious plants on earth. I like to cut the top half of the plant. And early spring is the best time to pick them. They won't taste as bitter as they will later on in the year, and they'll be more nutritious. Now I'll rinse them off in the stream. And I'll have to deactivate the sting by cooking them. I'll put a little water in my pot, not too much, and I'll let it come to a boil. Sometimes I boil them or just saute them. But today I'm gonna steam them. The heat will deactivate the sting. So after my water comes to a boil, I'll stuff a bunch of them into the pot. I usually steam them for around seven to 10 minutes. Still covered in hairs, but they don't sting anymore. I've read that these are even more nutritious than spinach or kale. They're even high in protein. It tastes just like spinach with maybe more of a nutty flavor. Kind of like walnuts. Very good.",

Because they didn't really have a, um, you know, a cure for it, and everybody was passing away. So I advocated for the gay community. I did fundraisers for the HIV projects. And I look at the community today and how entitled and how they label everybody and they judge everybody, and they say they're diminished and oppressed, and it's. I don't even recognize anymore. I did all that hard work, and all I wanted to do was be accepted. I didn't want to push my lifestyle on anybody. I didn't want to screw myself.

Now, I never even called a woman out of her fucking name. Not to her face. I think all that is terrible and wrong, but y'all acting like men are scarier than bears. You ain't watch enough nature documentaries, baby. Oh, watch the one where they trying to get the pictures of that big ass bear any. And the light from the flash scares them and. And a startled bear.

    "voice_to_text": "Let's do trashy recession era makeup. Going quite orange and cakey with the foundation. To research this look, I watched a bunch of makeup tutorials from, like, 2,000 nine, 2,010, and I was amazed at how low budget content was back then. Like, these creators had a webcam and a dream. Brows for this look are quite arched and squared off. A black pencil in the water line is essential. I'm applying a black base all over the lid. Now, using a cream base was really popular back then because powder eyeshadows weren't as good, so you needed something tacky for them to stick to. Buffing that out, I actually have a wet and wild eyeshadow trio from around this time, and you can see that the shade still says brow bone in it. This one was presumably for the crease and lid, so I'm not gonna use this exact product, but we're gonna create a similar silvery smoky eye using the Juvia's Place Magic palette. I'm taking one of the silver shades on my finger and just tapping that into the black base. Next, I'm packing a black eyeshadow into the outer V, smoking out the lower lash line, adding an ultra bright shimmer highlight to the inner corner and the brow bone, adding some glitter winged liner mascara. Modern nude lipsticks are a lot deeper than they were back then, so instead, I'm gonna start off with my foundation. Yikes. Okay. Mixing in a bright pink lipstick, I Caved and added a darker lip liner. I know it's not authentic, but the pale lip was not looking good. Now let's add some big lashes. And this is the final recession core makeup. I feel like I'm ready to pop bottles in the club. How did you dress during the recession? Let us know in the comments. Until next time. Bye.",

And I can pinpoint which character is one into which. Vani Toss is Dazai mixed with Rompo. And no way is Atsushi mixed with Kunikita. How this Vani Toss would meet his end? By my own hand, of course. That's how this episode ends. This like how 90% of all Wattpad stories and their first chapter. His baby blue eyes were so piercing, so enthralling. And soon they would be completely lifeless.

    "voice_to_text": "To my lesbians, that's in a healthy relationship. What has been the hardest thing for y'all? Being in a healthy relationship? I'll go first. One thing that I noticed real quick was that I was actually more toxic than I thought, and I was so quick to yell and go off. I didn't even give myself time enough to just process stuff before just yelling in and go off. And when I got with my girlfriend, I knew she was not going for none of that. Like, she set the tone very quickly that we were gonna talk to each other and not yell. When you're so used to acting a certain way, it is so hard to unlearn toxic behaviors, and that has been the hardest thing for me. But I was able to do it. On top of thriving in chaos. I was so used to drama going on in my relationship, arguing, fighting, not talking to each other, giving each other the silent treatment, that once I transition to a healthy relationship, it was like, hmm, do she like me? Like, it's kind of, like, boring, but the whole time, this is what a normal relationship supposed to feel like. You not supposed to be getting to it with your partner all the time, cussing them out all the time to feel like it's love. Love is peaceful. Love has been really peaceful. When you unlearn those toxic traits and really work on yourself, for yourself and For your partner. So I wanna hear y'all",

Yeah, I, like, had an idea of how I would want it to be shot and then ended up directing it myself. But, like, I'm not a director. Okay, but you directed this video and some, uh, fans of, uh, of, uh, um, Jack's banner, a little upset cause he's barely in the video. I gave him a cameo. So is your husband's band, and you're in the entire video, and then he, at the very end, he turns up. Yes, yes. Are you obviously must have been okay with that if he signed. Yeah, he was fine. Okay. Yeah. And my, my, I may. I came up with the plot, which was that he would Watch me dance for basically the entire duration of the song. And at the end, I'd be like, there he is! Ha ha!",

    "voice_to_text": "first things first I'm sorry if I seem off in this video but usually when I film I pretend like I'm talking to a close friend or a loved one or even like I'm presenting but I realized that I don't have anyone that I consistently talk to about what I'm gonna talk about here so I'm just kind of free balling it I'm just a little nervous because it's something I'm going through right now and it's not easy to talk about so quite frankly I don't want to talk about it but especially given recent events I think it's important to talk about these things openly in case anyone can learn from it or just feel seen and heard now for the thing that I'm going through I'm a first year medical student and last Friday we all had our first cardiology exam on the heart and stuff and it was a pretty hard exam quite frankly but fortunately the class average was an 80% unfortunately however I got a 53.5 like I don't know what to say after that out of 166 students that took the exam I ranked 165th .9th percentile I think like 0.9th and while I'm definitely not happy to admit that I already did all the math for the grades I need to get for the rest of the year to pass the course and all that jazz like I'll actually be fine academically that's not the problem here the real problem that upsets me is actually the same one that caused me to do poorly in the first place and it's just the knowledge that I don't have anyone that I personally know that I can talk to about this period don't get me wrong I've been blessed with friends and family that most of the time I tell most things to and I am very grateful for them but with stuff like this from experience I can tell you it does not go well if I bring it to them and that is no fault of their own or my own I say it's not on my end because I've spent the past two to three years in therapy learning how to open up about such things one on one with another person plus the whole reason I created this page was so I could journal and open up about my thoughts while also teaching other people how to do the same and it's worked so far so I know I can consistently communicate my emotions in a healthy manner and I say it's not my friends and family's fault because it's nothing that they actively do and nothing unique to them it's simply because they view me as a quote unquote \u201ccalm and collected\u201d man and I put that label in quotes because it's not one that I gave to myself and quite frankly it's not how I view myself it's just the label that I haven't been able to shake for like years now and I only know it exists because a weird number of people have just walked up to me and said something along those lines for most people that label or that of a \u201creal man\u201d is associated with the personality type of someone who is mentally tough a problem solver a leader so on and so forth like the person that you go to to solve your problems not the one that comes to you and says I feel like I let myself down on that exam and I'm sad about it so when I as a man bring up such problems to said people I give them cognitive dissonance specifically between three concepts in their mind 1 their labeling of me as a man 2 their understanding of how valid and serious my emotions and problems are and 3 their understanding of what a man is and what masculinity means and because of like how your brain resolves cognitive dissonance one of these things has to go so their brain can work and these things can agree now number three is not being touched their understanding of what a man is and what masculinity means no one is changing that unless they really want to because that is one of like their base views of life many people view male female masculinity femininity as like the binary code to life so that get that out of the way that\u2019s staying with this one safe and sound that means we have to get rid of either the value of your emotions as a man or the fact that you are an adult man in the first place this is the part that's about to get very real for all the guys watching when we get rid of this one that's when we get people like not really caring about your problems or kind of getting that glazed look when you tell them about the thing that they asked about and they're just like oh my god that that sucks bro but you're you're good though right and you go yeah and then they just go about their day as if you didn't tell them anything when you get rid of the man title in my experience best case scenario they have a panic attack like they can't handle what's going on with you and they think that like you're not gonna be able to handle it on your own so they need to freak out and you end up having to use your personal emotional energy to calm them down and then go and handle whatever you needed to handle on your own with less energy than you had before as if you were spending all this energy just to stay afloat and tread water and you tell someone you care about that like you're tired and you don't wanna deal with this anymore and they freak out so much that they jump in with you start drowning make you save them jump out and then you have to just continue as you were here's the kicker all of that will happen in any flavor person like irregardless of gender or where they're from or whatever and on top of that it is completely independent of who you are as a man what your relationship is to them how good you are at communicating your emotions like it just happens when you're facing that while you're already going through something on your own and kind of just expected to carry it on your own it is by far one of the most emotionally isolating feelings there is and as great as things like therapy and doing the work and healing are they can't help you here because this is something not only outside of yourself but it's not even on an individual level it's a societal and cultural problem I think the worst part is that many people see this opinion as controversial or inflammatory even though it's not actually pointing the finger at anyone and it's more so just talking about a common experience that way too many men resonate with and I think anytime that many people feel such a feeling there has to be validity behind it",

La homosexualidad es 1 opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s dentro de la sexualidad y que cada cual pues debe llevar la sexualidad que le apetezca. No estoy ni a favor ni en contra, cada 1 es muy libre de hacer aquello que que que su cuerpo le pida. Vamos, las que son lesbianas son lesbianas, los que son 1 forma m\u00e1s de sexualidad, simplemente me parece que es 1 estilo de vida que cada quien escoge. No estoy, no la critico porque no soy nadie para criticarla, pero no la comparto tampoco. Yo soy part\u00edcipe de toda libertad sexual, vamos bueno, es 1 opci\u00f3n enormemente respetable, como cualquier otra opci\u00f3n sexual que puedan tener todas las personas.

Just rub me the wrong way to where by the time you get to the second or third season, you're not watching this show for her. Let's be real. Reason everyone watches the show is because of these four right here. Next is gotta be Peyton from one Tree Hill. Listen, I am a one Tree Hill stand. I am a 90s kid. But Peyton, I'm Team Brooke all the way. We get it, you're the emo girl. You hate everything about the world cause your mom tragically passed away. But that makes no excuse that she is easily the worst friend of all time. She's constantly me, me, me. Doesn't give a shit about any of her friends. Team Brooke all the way. And last, but certainly not least is Ted Mosby from how I met your mother. This man, throughout the entire of the show, claims that he just wants to find true love. But at every turn during the show, just constantly makes excuses and whines about every last thing. So by the time you get to the end of the show, you don't give a fuck how we found love.

Seals can be naturally curious and love checking out swimmers and divers. However, they can be aggressive. Once you've determined that the seal is just curious and doesn't mind you being in their territory, you can just relax and enjoy the encounter. The seal is nicknamed Onyx, and he loves to check out my knees. You can see a sharp claws poking my legs there. On this day, Onyx kept checking out my fins and my legs. It's important to remember that even though these are harbor seals and they're pretty docile, they still can buy it if they want to. I dug down to the bottom to see what else was down there. I slowly turned around, and I thought that Onyx had left, but then I looked up and realized that he was looking down at me the whole time. Onyx was one of the first seals to ever grab my leg and play with my fins, so I always love seeing him in the water. Sometimes he'll also check out my camera. He's also very elegant when he swims, watch how he soars underneath the kelp canopy and comes back to me. He likes to use his for flippers, like little airplane wings, before he grabs onto my leg. I didn't have a wetsuit on this day, so I could feel his sharp claws. On my bare skin. Then he twirled away and I waved goodbye. Thanks for watching my videos, and I'll see you on the next one.",

On high. The solid metal turned to liquid, and I even added more chunks to the mix so that I could get a huge pool of liquid metal in the pan. After a while, all the solid bismuth melted into liquid. At that point, I skimmed the top for impurities, and the molten bismuth shimmered like a mirror. Once melted, I had to let the bismuth slowly solidify on low. When the top it hardened, I punched a hole in there, and then I poured out the liquid core to expose the crystals inside. To visualize the crystals, I busted out the top, and what I had was a big homemade geode. I got fragments of crystal, and these things were all sorts of geometric designs and colors. Some of the crystals actually look like cityscapes."

I would not ask men about this because they're very strong on opinions, but they don't have a say when it comes to this. Okay. Strictly for the girls. I personally grew up in Hawaii, so, like, I grew up with girls wearing little bikini bottoms, like, literally strings. And I feel like back home, no one judges. Girls post about it all the time. I'm like, we live on a beach. What do you expect? Like, full coverage just doesn't do it all the time. And I get when we're younger. Like, when I was younger, my parents never allowed me to, but now I wear cheekier bottoms. Like, super cheeky bottoms. But then when I first came to the mainland or, like, Arizona, I felt like I was getting judged and stared at, and I wore the bikini bottoms I had because those are the only things I had. Like, I never had full coverage bottoms except for my surf ones. Like, even when I went surfing, I would wear cheeky bottoms. But, like, when I moved here, it was just, like, I felt like I was getting judged so hard. And, yeah, I've seen college girls wear cheeky bottoms, but, like, I'm talking strings. Like, I'm talking, what do we think about them? Because, like, I don't know. Like, I feel like it's such a Controversial topic. Like, some people love cheeky. Cheeky bikini bottom, some people are against it, like, fully. So, like, what. What's the deal? Clearly, I have no problem with cheeky bikini bottoms. Like, I just ordered one recently, and, like, I'm literally gonna show you guys. Like, this is the back. This is the back. Like, it's basically a string, covers basically nothing. But, like, I'm perfectly fine with wearing it, but, like, when I wear it on in public, I feel like I'm getting so judged. So, like, what do we think?"

Video of the Yale incident shows a person wearing a keffiyeh around their face and head, which disguised their identity, climbing on the menorah and placing a Palestinian flag on it, while four others can be seen heading to the menorah and are heard telling the person to get down. The flag was immediately removed, according to Jake Dressler, an attorney who was at the event with a friend who took the video and shared it with CNN. The incident took place in a public space that is off the Yale campus during a demonstration sponsored by several groups in Connecticut, according to the school. #cnn #hanukkah #menorah #isreal ",

Yale condemned the action and called it a desecration of the Menor. The university says it has asked police to investigate the incident. Event organizers say that the person was not affiliated with the group's present. They condemn the anti Semitic action and said they were appalled by this behavior.",

You feel confused, you don't understand how you could have reacted that way because you've never seen yourself act like that before and you don't even feel like yourself. You end up feeling guilty about the way that you reacted and ashamed of your behavior. You end up feeling doubtful of whether or not you're the abuser in the relationship because of how extreme and out of character your reaction was. Partner collects some type of evidence like a video of your reaction to try to use against you and create fear in you that everyone's gonna think that you are the narcissist or the abuser. Reaction came out of self defense, meaning you didn't initiate this interaction. If you can relate to some or all of these, you may have experienced reactive abuse where the narcissist pushes you and pushes you and pushes you until you snap and then tries to use your reaction against you to deflect from the fact that they're actually the abuser.",

I don't think I'm done crying for the next few, I don't know, undetermined amount of hours, but we just gonna ride these waves as they come along and think about heaven later. As of recently, I don't like. Me, personally, I don't like to share when I've experienced a transition with certain relationships in my lives where they cease to exist. If I don't want to get bombarded with the cliche bullshit of, I'm sorry for your lost, my condolences. Hey, this woman must be in. Oh, I. I really. I hate it. I hate it, which is why I've decided to just not say anything. However, the other thing that irritates me about it is this entire time, we haven't come up with anything more heartfelt or personal or just not cliche that would make someone feel like you're being disingenuous. Why? Because we, you know, we just don't know what else to say. Well, I got you. I have something that you can say now, all right? In the light that someone has. And the reason I'm not calling and the reason I'm not saying. A loss. First of all, I can't lose anything that didn't belong to me, okay? What I was able to do was experience someone. That experience was unique to us, and it was amazing, and it fulfilled me, and it made me feel seen, it made me feel supported, it made me feel loved. And so, Now that experience has now come to an end, and so that is not a loss. That is actually a gain. So instead of losing, because I didn't lose anything, you can just say, congratulations. Congratulate me for having such an amazing experience with another human being. Congratulate me for being able to feel love in a unique way. Congratulate me for having discernment about who's in my space, because this person have my back. This person embraced me. Fuck acceptance. They embraced me. So congratulate me. I was able to experience something beautiful like that. No more losses, no more condolences. Congratulate. Congratulate me. Congratulations. It must have been so beautiful. It was. Must have been hilarious. It was. It was a hoot, a holler and a howl I I",

Which means she's out of the poke up. And I don't have a co pilot. It wasn't an accident. Bianca behind it. How do you know? Doesn't matter. You and I are going to take her down tomorrow. Wait, you're joining the Black Cats for me? I want to humiliate Bianca so badly that the bitter taste of defeat burns in her throat. Yeah, but mostly you're doing it because we're friends, right? Tell me how she keeps swimming. It's a real brain cramp. The past 2 years, no other boat has made it across the lake and back without sinking. Sounds like sabotage. There are no rules in the Po Cup. And she is a Siren, which makes her master of the water. Then we just need to beat her at her own game. Omg, you look perfect. Only thing, where are your whiskers? Ask again and you'll be down to 8 lives. Focus. What do we have here? The rest of the litter. For the record, I don't believe I'm better than everyone else. Just that I'm better than you. I want to welcome you all to the Edgar Allan Po Cup. This is one of Neville greatest annual traditions, stating back 125 years. Each team must row across the Raven Island, pull a flag from crackstone's Crypt and hustle back without sinking or being sunk. First team to cross a finish line with their flag wins the cup and bragging rights for a year, as well as some special privileges. Let the Pole Cup begin!",
