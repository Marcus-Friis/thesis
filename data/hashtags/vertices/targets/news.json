black person in America it is so dehumanizing to get on my phone every single day and just scroll scroll scroll and don't get me wrong I don't see I don't scroll past a single atrocity that comes across my for you page every single one gets some kind of engagement from me it'll never fit whether it be Kongo Sudan Palestine t grey you name it I'm giving it my attention of some capacity someone I'm going to be putting my energy into it nothing gets past me without me trying to engage with it with that being said the amount of time and energy I have to put into seeking out African content versus Palestinian content exclusively right now upsetting dehumanizing even even more so when like I probably for like maybe every five Palestinian videos I see I might see the DRC and then I'll maybe every like every five Palestinian videos three DRC videos I might see one 2 damn video and then every once in a while I'll see something about like Cameroon t grey some other place that's experiencing atrocity I see more about Palestine than I see about cop cities here in America and we've been talking about Cop City for years now like I just don't know like y'all can't expect respectfully you cannot expect black people to be wanting to stay this committed to global liberation specifically in the case of Palestine and then you can't even turn around and give a a reshare and a comment and a follow to people that are talking about what's going on in African countries or black Americans cause for some reason when are we often talk about the fact we don't talk about black America like I don't know why everybody suddenly thought black America was okay as if we're not still suffering we are silently suffering and I'm and I'm gonna say silently because like it is pretty much silent y'all have isolated us on our own communities you give us no media attention you give us no actual like ability to amplify our own voices when we do go outside we're pepper sprayed we're arrested we're detained what are we to do you know and then when we claim complain about it y'all say racism is over or you say you have Dei now why are you still talking please eat your scraps and shut up before I put you in a cage again like I don't know what we're supposed to do but it's disingenuous to believe that black people are gonna stay committed like for the long haul to advocating for Palestinian people and non black people atrocities when y'all don't even give a fraction of the attention to black people and their suffering you have black neighbours who are going through nonsense and like struggle on a daily basis and you're scared to even engage with them but you can spend hours and hours posting videos of you standing in front of a video playing a sound that's dedicated to Palestine or you can repost a bunch of things or you can put a little watermelon next to your name on all of your social media platforms but you can't you can't do anything to talk about the DRC meanwhile the DRC gives you the lifestyle that you choose to live on a daily basis you can't talk about Sudan like we this whole like we always say everything is connected but y'all aren't y'all aren't marinating with that and it's bothering me and I know I know for white people it's like to come to terms with it and recognise that like you are complicit and like the silence means you're also perpetuating the silence and the harm but as sometimes you gotta move past it like black people like the black people that are genuinely doing the work and fighting the good fight and trying to like educate and liberate people they I promise you I know you think that we're all gonna be angry at you because you've taken so long to wake up but we're not I promise we we are not worried about that at that point we are not trying to stay mad at people for eternity on end we have so many better things to be talking about you why would I care to be mad at you why what do I gain from being mad at you and holding animosity towards you cause you decided to take 22 years decide to start talking about black struggle what does that gain what what does that do for the conversation like I just think I think that like y'all genuinely just think black people are just waiting for y'all to mess up so we can like jump on you and attack you but it's the polar opposite the most we want is for you to speak up and say something and maybe it is something that's like a little ignorant a little like baseless but then we can at least call you in and maybe you've had bad experiences with people you have said something stupid or you said something that is ignorant or just like not factual and then you've had a black person or a person of colour call you racist and maybe that put you back in your shell but I promise being racist is the least of your worries it is like being labeled a racist only serves your white comfort because the only person that you're worried about being the only reason you're worried about being called a racist sorry my nose is so running the only reason you're worried about being called a racist is because you don't want other people to you don't want other white people to hear you being called a racist by a person of color or a black person or an indigenous person cause guess what if a black person calls you racist and then another black person hears it they're not like damn they're like that tracks very likely moving on how do we change this how do we like improve the situation anyway like we don't care like most of us are most of us that have most of us that have a good heart it's gonna be it's gonna this is gonna gonna sound very like mind boggling but most black people that have empathy and are actually about global liberation we already are with the notion that you are racist and we're just simply tryna have you unlearn that most of us aren't waiting for you to do a racist thing the presumption is that you are racist is and if you're not outwardly racist racist we are assuming you're racist because you're probably complicit and you're silence and you're probably leaning into your comfort and you think that you being pro Palestine or you bring pro anything that's not somebody black you think that that alleviates you from needing to do any other work elsewhere but it's like no you still have to you still have to go the extra mile and just because Palestinians aren't saying bring up black voices doesn't mean you still shouldn't connect the two situations just because people here in the United States are still talking about Cop City doesn't mean are saying like hey you should also like just because they're not saying go talk about the d R C doesn't mean you still shouldn't like these things do still all matter just because just because queer people are saying like talk about queer rights doesn't mean that isn't them also saying don't talk about black people like all these things black people are integral to every movement every single one sorry this is such a long video but I'm I'm getting genuinely exhausted I'm getting exhausted from not seeing my people and I know my people are hurting loudly and it's not a silent genocide it's not like a silent anything like it might be suppressed we might be silenced you got the reference you get my point",

So what you're looking at is actually sixth house that is collapsed here in the verdante community in North Carolina just over the last four years. We're also told this is just about 10% of the total debris from that house collapse last night. And we're told the debris from this latest house collapse stretches miles here along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There are roughly 45 National Park Service staff. They're helping clean up the debris along the beaches. But here is where the dilemma is. Insurance companies will cover the cost of the house if it is destroyed because it falls into the ocean, but they will not proactively cover the cost of moving the house away from the ocean before it sinks in. But as you could see here along Ocean Drive in Redanthe, there were still other houses with the same problem and they are not going away.",

I am not affected by your booze because I've seen what makes you cheer me. To take your criticism to heart, I'd first have to value your opinion. And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions. So if you wanna be mad at me, be mad at me. But if you want me to care, be somebody I respect first. Oh, and for all you haters keep jumping in my comments and giving me that algorithm boost."

And just as we're recovering from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine drove up everyone's energy bills, grappling with inflation. And it was a really tough time for everyone. But I'm determined to make sure that people feel when the election comes that the future is better, that we have turned a corner. And I think at the start of this year you can see that that is beginning to happen. Inflation is fallen from 11% to just over 3%. The other week. Taxes are being cut by \u00a3900 for an average worker. Kicking into people's pay slips. Next week, energy bills are falling. And we can get a sense that the future is gonna be brighter for people and their families. They can have that piece of mind and that confidence. And that's what I've worked incredibly hard to deliver. Rishi Sunak discusses the challenges faced by the British people, including the pandemic, Ukraine war and rising energy bills. They emphasize the importance of delivering a better future for the British people, highlighting the recent decrease in inflation, tax cuts and energy bills. What do you think about it?

On Saturday morning, a man was struck and killed by another vehicle while changing his tire in the service road of the Katy Freeway near Highway 6. The other driver remained at the scene and police are investigating the accident. On Saturday night around ten forty five PM, a shooting left a juvenile grazed by a bullet at the Missionary Village Apartments in south east Houston. Police say a vehicle pulled up and an argument took place. The argument turned physical which then turned into a shootout. Several people were also injured in the chaos by debris and broken glass. Across town in southwest Houston, a five year old girl was also grazed by a bullet after a fight broke out outside of a party hall around midnight. She is expected to be okay as well. Today. Another shooting took place outside of a Waffle House in northwest Harris County around 4:00am. One person was transported to a local hospital. At 5:00am, a fatal accident occurred in the northbound lanes of the Southwest Freeway just before the 6:10 split. One person was pronounced deceased at the scene."

You also brought up that teachers leaving the profession as if it's the children's fault for not respecting them, when in reality the majority of teachers who are leaving the professional leaving it because it's been underfunded by nearly 5 billion pound every single year consistently since 2,010. Which is LED to larger class sizes, less individual help, less subject choices and a real time pay cut for teachers with unmanageable workloads. Also, being a teacher now isn't just teaching. These days in the primary teachers are going in to children who haven't eaten. The force not to be social workers, psychologists, SN needs, professionals and all that. Well going to a school that is literally falling apart with no equipment to even teach the children with. If you want kids to respect people is quite simple. Make sure that 30% of them aren't living in poverty. Make sure all children have the right to free meals a day. You want kids to be respectful? Be respectful to them.

    "voice_to_text": "It has not going away. We still dealing with this every day. As the migrant crisis continues, New York City leaders will not stop evictions for adult migrants who've reached their 30 or 60 day shelter limit. Critics have called the policy inhumane. People said it's inhumane to put people out during the wintertime. So now it says inhumane to do it in the summertime, is inhumane to do in the springtime, is inhumane to do in the falltime. It's always inhumane to have to not be able to house 198,000 people. 250 migrants are expected to be evicted this week if they haven't proven they face extenuating circumstances to find new housing. The tightening of this policy comes after a court settlement surrounding New York City's right to shelter law. The rule does not apply to migrant families with children. City officials say they have done their part to help migrants figure out their next steps after their time at the shelter expires, including reticketing asylum seekers to other cities. We are giving them information, we are connecting them to resources, and we are talking to them about what those next steps are. Are going to be. If we would not have done anything, we would have had 198,000 people stealing our care instead of 65,000.",

The PLO called the news a historic moment and that recognition of a Palestinian state is the path to stability, security and peace in the region.

The king has granted this request and we will have a general election on the fourth of July. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the Cold War. Putin's Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds, that war is also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead in technology, and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children? Now, I cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right. No government should. But I am proud of what we have achieved together, the bold actions we have taken, and I'm confident about what we can do in the future.",

The king has granted this request and we will have a general election on the fourth of July. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the Cold War. Putin's Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds, that war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead. And technology and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to charter course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan. Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children?",

There's a tremendous amount of pessimism among young adults today. We usually think of young adults as being very optimistic and forward looking. That is really not true today. More Gen Z young adults say that they. You don't have any hope for the world, that their expectations for their own lives are much lower. You're mentioning political polarization egged on by social media. Absolutely in there. There's another element here, too, though, which is Gen Z is a lot more likely to be depressed than previous generations at the same age. And depression isn't just about emotions. It's also about cognition. It's about how you see the world. And when you're sad, when you're depressed, you see the world in a negative light."

He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today.",

A flight heading from London to Singapore has just been hit by turbulence so bad. So bad that one man has died and 31 other people have had to be rushed to hospital. Now, I'm gonna show you a couple of visuals from it. Um, but I've gotta be careful because it gets kind of bad. But check this out. So this was caused by someone's head smashing into that. Um, this is the chaos on the ground, all of the food. Wow. Just quickly skip through that. Look at this. I mean, she is having a very bad day. And if you go over here, look at this. Let me play this from the beginning for you. Look at the ceiling. That would have been from these. Those heavy ass food bins smashing into the ceiling there. Just think about how bad it would have been to have caused this chaos. Ah, one of the. This is what the passenger said. They said that it's. The plane started tilting upwards slowly and. And shaking, and then it dropped really dramatically. So everyone not wearing their seatbelts just smashed into the ceiling. Hot coffee splashed over everyone. People started praying. And when they did make it through, eventually they had to quickly land in Thailand so that they can get medical attention for everyone that was hurt. Uh, So, yeah, seat belt. Kinda useless if you crash, but very useful for when you get hit by that target. So I'm gonna be doing that from now on, I think.",

It is not normal for those videos to have references to Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler. Trump campaign tells us this morning that this was a video that was shared by a staffer while the former president was in court, saying that staffer missed the reference, but as of this morning, that video has not been taken down. Former President Donald Trump sparking backlash this morning after a video posted to his social media account seemingly suggests there will be a unified Reich if he wins the 2024 election. Donald Trump wins what's next for America? Those words are largely associated with Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, another name for his Nazi regime. The 30 second video features hypothetical newspaper articles of Trump celebrating a victory in November, that phrase appearing three times, including under the headline what's next for America? It includes references to World War One signing, German industrial strength, and peace through strength, another headline suggesting Trump would reject globalist, the phrase often used by the far right as an anti Semitic slur.",

They are absolutely in defense contracting. The 1950s, they pivoted hard and started making satellites. They were like, hey, we're so good at canned peaches, we should try war. You know what? They don't make fucking jars. They got out of the jar business. They're too busy in aerospace. And then I went down this crazy rabbit hole of all these different companies where they're like, yeah, we make a thing you've heard of, but our true passion is war machines. AMF makes bowling alley equipment and funny, aggressive animations. They also make nuclear power plants and missile launch systems, which means some of their animations were not that far off. Honey. Well, home security, air conditioning. Also the autopilot system that we use to drop the bomb. Singer made typewriters and sewing machines and pew pew. Texas Instruments makes calculators and also big pew pew. General Electric has made toasters and fighter planes. And I know they're general, but I didn't know they were at general. And just a couple years ago, John Deere and the Roomba company joined forces to make an automated robot that patrols around Military bases. No matter what you manufacture in this country, at some point the government is gonna show up and be like, hey, we loved your work on bowling pins. How would you like to kill",

The crimes include starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, willfully causing great suffering, serious injury to body or health or cruel treatment, willful killing or murder and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population. As well as crimes against humanity of extermination and or murder, persecution and allegations of crimes of committing other inhuman acts. It's alleged that these crimes were committed in the context of the ongoing ARM conflict and as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza pursuant to a state policy. Unfortunately, these crimes continue to this day. My office submits that these individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. We have reached that conclusion based upon interviews with survivors, many eyewitnesses, experts from satellite imagery, statements from Israeli officials, including the two individuals subject to the present application.",

Video started circulating seconds ago on the Iranian News Telegram of rescuers stating that there are no survivors. This was also just now stated seconds ago on El Jazeera. Earlier today, a helicopter containing Iran's president along with Iran's foreign minister suffered what was considered a hard landing near the Azerbaijan border. Here's a map of the crash site. When it crashed, signals were detected by the armed forces of the helicopter and a cell phone from somebody on the flight crew. Turkey then sent 32 mountain specialists to help. On top of that, Russia went ahead and sent 47. Most analysts believe the reason it crashed was due to the bad weather. While all of this was going on, Republican Senator Rick Scott from Florida said, frosty said, the world is now a safer and better place. That evil man was a tyrant and tea. He was not loved or respected, and he will be missed by no one. He's gone. I truly hope that Iranian people have the chance to take their country back from murderous dictators. Turkey also sent a drone that has a live feed going. The drone then detected a source of heat from the crash site. The Gulf Cooperation Council has expressed their solidarity with Iran and the Iranian people. Now Iran's Vice President Muhammad Mubarak will be taking on the role of president until An election is held within a maximum of 50 days.",

I'm an American who's been backpacking around the country and here the three necessary steps that you have to take to be able to safely visit the country. Step one, get the visa. Once the government switched, most Afghan embassies closed. However, there are a few Taliban consulates. I've listed them on screen. The most expensive visas are upwards of $300, which are issued in European consulates, and the cheapest is just $100 in Peshawar, Pakistan. Step 2 enter the country. You can fly into Kabul from all the major airports listed on the screen, or you can cross a land border. I came in from Pakistan via the Torkham border, which is one of the most legendary border crossings in the world, and I highly recommend it. Step three 3. Get your permits. This is arguably the most crucial step, because if you're walking around Afghanistan without permits, you could even be jailed. First, you'll have to head to the Ministry of information and culture, which is located at the coordinates listed on the screen. Here. You'll drop the letter with the Taliban officials declaring where you intend to visit. And then secondly, head to the directory of tourism listed at the coordinates on screen, where they'll issue you your permits. Congratulations, you're now registered with the Taliban and fully authorized to explore all of Afghanistan. Follow for more travel content from legitimately every corner of the globe. Ciao.",

It is being reported by local Iranian outlets and major outlets like Reuters and AP that a helicopter convoy containing the president of Iran has crashed. Um, apparently there were three helicopters, and in the eastern part of Iran there was bad weather. Two of the helicopters made it to their location successfully, but one of them has crashed, containing the president of Iran. Now, other than that, there's no confirmation on whether or not, um, he is not around anymore or how injured he is. All that everyone knows is that right now there is a massive search party going on, obviously, to find the president of Iran. Now, there's going to be a lot of questions out there like why did the other two helicopters just leave them behind? I mean, it's a helicopter, you can stop and go back. But other than that, again, it has been confirmed. I don't wanna speculate too much. Make sure you do follow this channel for more updates and news. But if he is not around anymore, this is going to be massive and this will change the shape of the Middle East. And we'll have to see what happens from there.

Any regrets about that kind of language, especially given that you were trying to make a point, frankly, about decorum in the hearing room? I have no regrets, and I'll tell you why. Because Marjorie Taylor Greene is the type of person that if you give her an inch, she'll take a mile. And the fact that they continue to allow her to break the rules of decorum over and over and over, whether it's the state of the union that the president is delivering and she's wearing a MAGA hat or otherwise. The reason that she didn't have committee assignments before was because she did not know how to conduct herself as a member of Congress. And so if I just sit there and say, oh, well, Marjorie said it about me, what's to stop her to continue to do it again and again? And at the end of the day, I was elected as a representative of Congress, but that doesn't mean that I'm supposed to be somebody's doormat. But Michelle Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. Are those days basically over? Um, I don't know that we can even call this a low. I mean, she goes to hell, and then I do my best to remind her as to why she should not cross me. So one of your colleagues, Jamie Raskin, actually suggested that some members might Have been drinking. Others have said that as well. Making that suggestion. That's a pretty serious allegation. Do you think that that played a factor here? I think when Marjorie Taylor Greene. It doesn't require alcohol for her to be unhinged. I'll be perfectly honest. I don't know. I don't have any facts to that, so, you know, I won't say and I won't participate in rumors when I don't have any facts behind it. So you also called Greene racist, what she said about you. Why is that? Yeah, because as I've received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress, a lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factful way, what they would try to do is say, oh, look at her hair, or look at her nails, or look at her lashes. And they would all then associate anything that I do as a form of beautification with being, quote, unquote ghetto. And so to me, she was just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there. Because I am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she's never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me. A black woman who sits On the committee. And then of course she went after AOC and called her unintelligent. A brown woman that sits on the",

The video was provided as evidence for that lawsuit that's going against them at the moment to prove Diddy is, um, the person that they say he is. I ain't gonna lie. I'm risking my IG to post this video. God know they might report it, so y'all better go over there, follow if you got to, because I might have to put it private. Too many people reported. But nah, ain't no coming back from this one, Diddy. Ain't. Ain't no coming back. Boy. Did. You got caught. 4K Ultra HD Chi. You got caught, boys. Not looking too good for you.

    "voice_to_text": "The footage shows a Ukrainian soldier with down syndrome named vokorov nearly causing the entire squad to perish due to a mortar operation mishap. According to Ukrainian media, Ukraine is currently facing shortages not only in ammunition, but also in qualified personnel. The video reveals that Volkarov, under the taunting of veteran soldiers, was instructed to operate a mortar. Unfortunately, he loaded the shell incorrectly, almost leading to a catastrophe. Afterward, unaware of his mistake, Volkarov was verbally and physically abused by the veterans, leaving him terrified and crying in the trench. War is brutal, and even for able bodied soldiers the survival rate on the front lines is low. For someone like Vokerov, who has down syndrome, escaping a tragic fate is even more unlikely. Sent to the front lines despite being unable to care for himself, Volkarov stands little chance of participating in combat and risks becoming cannon fodder. Rumors suggest that his comrades even considered using Volkarov to attract Russian drones, and one Ukrainian veteran reportedly wanted him to test for landmines. Vokorov's case has brought public attention and concern to the treatment of vulnerable soldiers within the Ukrainian military. Some Ukrainians hope that Russian forces will capture Vokorov, believing it might save him from further suffering.",

He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend.

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.",

Now this, friends, is reasonable. This is the idea of merging various agencies such as Border Force, the police, National Crime Agency into Border Command. And as I've told you more times than I can recall, as the policing maxim says, if in doubt, form a squad number four. Set up Great British Energy. How is that gonna help Mrs Jones in clapping with a gas Bill? What does that mean? Don't worry, don't worry. If you think it's rather expensive to turn the gas on, we're setting up Great British Energy. Great, another company I gotta pay for. Where's. Where's the impact of that 5 crackdown on anti social behaviour? For the love of god, what. What does that mean? Here's a number that you can hang your hat on. Recruit 6,500 new teachers. Well, again, and I note so often when I speak to conservative politicians and they start talking about how they're going to introduce this measure for the economy or that measure for health or this measure for law and order, you remind me that where are the 40 new hospitals? Where are the thousands of new police officers? All I had to say in that one. Actually, I think they are hitting their target. But that is what happens with these pledges.",

They definitely wouldn't give us bias news, would they? I'm sure it's no coincidence that they were seen together at the White House. But just wait. What are you doing? What are you doing in this picture with a selfie with this motherfucking piece of shit? Oh, but wait, there's more. What do you see wrong with this picture? Hey, let's get a close up. What do you see wrong with this picture? Oh, there's good old Harry who's known for spewing bullshit ass propaganda on this app. On. Here's another one of pro mania being so proud about being at the White House. Right? But what if I told you this gets much deeper than you'd like to think? For example, right here, this article paints it very well. Here's a statistic for you. A third of people ages 18 to 29 prefer to get their news supposedly from TikTok and other social media. So the White House is supposedly working on new ways to get its message out to these audiences. More than 20 people were. There were ring lights and audio equipment taking it all in. And it's supposedly part of a White House strategy to reach younger people where they are, which often is supposedly scrolling on a device with help from influencers. Influencers such as V from under the desk news, who says to be at the People's House having lemonade. Waiting for the president to speak is a very exciting moment. As you see, like it says here, that's V, host of under the Desk News, which provides minute long daily news wraps to 2.7 million TikTok followers. Oh, and there was supposedly a special briefing for V and other content creators ahead of the ceremony. I wonder what was discussed in that special briefing. Honestly, people can't realize that there's two motherfucking sides to the same motherfucking coin. At this point, you're just choosing to remain door minded. Truly a mindless little consumer that chooses to be an NPC. Not caring about who the fuck they're voting into the fucking house. Not giving a fuck about who they're voting for to lead us as the people. So I guess it's time to cancel V from under the desk news and Mr. Pro mania himself, right? Gotta love when people just sell themselves out for a bag, right?"

But people on social media, activists even are upset that Peru decided to label um trans and people who identify as non binary or use they them as mentally ill. From what I'm reading on some locals that's been commenting on the responses, they stated that this is just how they see things. No one, like no outside source, can change their mind or change their laws. This is what they're implementing. But that hasn't stopped people from stating that if you now travel to Peru, you will be seen as going against, you know, the other side. But you do have Americans that, you know, know the laws and stated that. Can't nobody change what Peru put? That's their country, that's their laws. We cannot stop that. What do you guys think about this? I'm not going to Peru and stop anything, but what do you guys think about the situation?"

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Holemaker. Who just really went in and told these women who have spent tens of thousands of dollars and Countless hours getting their degrees. That those degrees ain't shit, and they need to just wife up and push babies out. This man is a professional football player. He can afford to have his wife stay at home and not work. Going to a college class and telling them that, really, it was diabolical what was done to you. You've been bamboozled. You shouldn't have gotten this degree. Like, does the college and understand that if you're telling people they shouldn't enroll and they should just wife up, that they're all lose money. And the reason we are seeing birth rates decline is because most people can't afford to fucking live, let alone live on one income. Because most people aren't married to professional football players.",

Bruno Fernandes is considering a summer move after four and a half seasons and Manchester United. And if anything, he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies. This man has single handedly carried Manchester United. Goal contributions, you name it. Most chances created in Europe, breaking Frank Lampard's record twice even shows. Without Bruno, there's no Manchester United. We conceded five goals in two games and lost both of them without scoring any. Without this man, Bruno Fernandes, Crystal Palace and Arsenal is a pure example. No Bruno Fernandes, no Manchester United. And we're gonna need a big replacement. For me, as a Manchester United fan, Bruno Fernandes, if he does leave, I'm gonna be upset. Obviously he's my current favourite player, but he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies.

You might as well pass that trophy to Michel Arteta's fans and crown him that. What are you doing? If I was a Tottenham fan, oh, my god, I'll be cheering city on for 90 minutes. I'll be doing Poznam in the. In the crowd all games. It's mad, generally, that it's fallen like this. Two of the biggest rivals in country, one of them could stop the other winning the Premier League. I just think. And in the trophy to your biggest rival, you would never hit end of it, right? You would. You'd be on minus points in every group chat you're possibly in with every Arsenal fan. I just can't understand the mentality. I'm a Liverpool fan and I. I can. I'm preparing myself for not been able to get a word in entries of Arsenal fans because it's to be brought up if you are arguing who has the nicest stadium. The fact they won the Premier League in 2024. Be brought up by telling you now. Um, I'm. I just think it's absolutely backwards. And I think Tottenham have a massive chance, you know, bit of a bogey team, uh, of Man City is, in my opinion, uh, big games as well. Tough to beat. Son always has a fucking laugh at against city. Um, it's exciting. I was A Tottenham fan? I've been wanting fucking Vernon starting goal to be honest."

Menurut Agus, persoalan ini menjadi salah satu batu sandungan yang dihadapinya ketika baru menjabat Ketua KPK 2015-2019.  Berkaca dari situasi semacam itu, Agus berharap pimpinan KPK yang terpilih nantinya tidak ada perwakilan dari Kejaksaan maupun kepolisian.  #KPK #AgusRahardjo #KetuaKPK #JernihkanHarapan"

The fact that we pay taxes on everything, whether we selling some, buying some, getting paid, you take taxes out of the money that we earn, and we ain't got no shit like this. We can't even get a pothole filled in. And other countries got stuff like this. And shit like this is the reason why, like, when people get mad at folks for not tipping, it's like, do y'all not understand how weird that is, that you're mad at the consumer, the customer, for not tipping you instead of your employer?

If it's 29,000, does it make a difference? If it's 28,000, does it make a difference? Primarily, they are women and their children. You know, definitionly, inherently non combatants, not culpable, not. Not guilty of starting a war. They did not. And they did not. Hamas did. And Hamas leaders did. Elected. Since when? Hamas. That's the real world. Over. Over Gaza, the. Those people who are being killed to share a border with them. Israel has pulled out of that country. So you're saying it's okay that this has happened? It's not okay. There's just no good choice. That's. There's a better choice. There's a less, but bad choice. But they are sure that what you're suggesting is to leave Hamas in place. That's not. But then how do you do it? If you don't keep. People are going to die in a war. Either gonna prosecute this war or you're not gonna prosecute this war. I don't understand how you can square this circle. You're asking there. There are ways in which you can prosecute. Award. It does not have to be the complete destruction. you know, that's better than the Israeli defense of an entire country. Well. Well, listen, um. It's. It's the Israeli Defense Force. It's the prime minister of what? Who allowed this to happen in the first Place who are pursuing something right now that I think is actually going to make Israel weaker in the long term. I maybe care about the country. I don't think this is the right way. To ensure other safety and security. I guess I. I gonna have to end this. But I just tell you one thing.

And I hope some much more popular people than me blow this up cause that is very not okay. I've just extremely not okay. Just for reference, that's just for codes. It's not for like sponsors. It's just to get a game code, man. Wow, so they want you to sign a non disparagement just to get a game code? You know, there's a word for that. It's actually two words. It's called access journalism. Hopefully, uh, some more people talk about this. Just how ridiculous it is. They ask you to be professional about the game. Nothing wrong with that. It says you are not allowed to give a negative review professional about the game. Bro, that is not being professional. Being professional is whenever you tell them they're good professional. That is the opposite. It's definitely like Marvel or someone big Korpa is going crazy. And that's not even a sponsor. Yeah, that's insane. Yeah, I think he has every Right. To be annoyed about it. And also, I don't think that he should stop streaming the game. I think stream the game and shit on the game if you think that there's something wrong with it. And if they shut you down, you are a martyr. And you're gonna get so much attention, everybody's gonna support you. Cause they're not gonna execute on this, and it's just gonna make you look good if this happens. And I understand, like, this is kind of like a bad way of. Of going about things, but, um, I'm just being realistic. Right. Like, this is kind of like. This is what my vibe of the game is, is like, this game just looks like Overwatch. Point 5. It doesn't piss with this way until they see my red box. It looks like. Yeah, there you go. You know what it looks like? It looks like if Nexon made an Overwatch clone. That's what it looks like. It's like a phone game company makes the phone game or PC game version of Overwatch. Like the game. It just looks cheap. So, yeah, Seagulls totally right about this. Makes sense now why lyric and shroud says they don't have access to the Alpha. I don't know what they expected from mobile game developer. It is textbook access journalism. There's nothing good about it. What a surprise. It looks like kind of a terrible game too. So, uh. Yeah, that's what you get."

    "voice_to_text": "I, I can't take it. I'm gonna say something potentially offensive, but that is just a dumb, dumb talking point. Every battle is between two sides who hate each other. If the Turks sent to the Armenians, well, you guys still hate us. And they did. They did. They hated us. You know why they hated us? Because we occupied them. Because we were an empire and we did not give them rights. And we said, we are in charge and you are not, and you should know your rule. Turks rule over armies. If we said, I can't believe they hate us, I can't believe they attacked us, we have every right to murder them to no end, that would be absurd, and that's called a genocide. And the fact that the Armenians hated us does not justify anything. You do a peace deal with the people who hate you. You don't do it with the people who love you. So this lunatic standard of, I will not do a peace deal until the Palestinians love me, it's just total bullshit. It's not about them loving you. It's about you have. The way that you do peace deals is by eliminating their will to fight. That is how a peace deal is done. If they still want to fight. Murder. Destiny. How many died in World War 2? How many Soviet citizens were killed by the Germans? How many Nazis were killed? How many German citizens were killed by the Dresden bombings. How many Japanese people were killed in the Tokyo bombings? No, you want your. You're talking about. You just said it. Okay, I wanna murder no Israelis. Never. None. Okay, so in World War. In World War 2. In World War 2. In. In world. Okay. In world. In World War 2, you would have negotiated peace with Nazi Germany? Is that what you would have wanted to do? That. It's total apples and oranges, okay? No, there is no. Hold on. We hate each other. You don't negotiate peace with people. You like to negotiate people. Who said so? The Nazi Germany. Yes. So? Yes. So we really hate the Nazis. Would you negotiate peace with Nazi Germany? And World War 2 instead of going to war? So, destiny. This is your favorite stupid announcement? I'm gonna ask the exact. Go ahead, do it. I'm gonna ask the same question when you finish your rant, though. I'm gonna ask you, would you negotiate peace with Nazi Germany? Go ahead. So the Nazis were in the middle. Were in the middle of murdering 6 million Jews and 13 million innocent people, let alone the millions that were died in the war. So if in the middle of their murder, somebody said, hey, let's give them what they want, that would have been dumb. October 7th happened months and months ago. And every day you've been killing thousands and thousands or hundreds and hundreds of Palestinians, and you say, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough. Kill more, kill more! Kill more! You're the guilty one!",

Like, who has the time to go around blocking celebrities who haven't spoken up enough about Israel and Palestine and putting pressure on them and bullying them into, like, not going to the Met Gala and, like, not doing something that is literally part of their job? Also, why are we putting more pressure on celebrities rather than, like, elected officials and politicians? Like, celebrities don't have the knowledge to be speaking up about these issues and spreading notions that will change people's minds and solving conflicts. Like, no, they did not sign up for that. That is not their job. These are just such uneffective tactics that are so brutal. And hatred and animosity and jealousy. Like, since what is spreading hate and turning against people and blocking them and trying to, like, ruin their careers, which obviously are not able to do, but, like, attempting to do so, how is that going to help solve a really complex, decades long, actually centuries long conflict in the Middle East? Like, make that make sense."

And they are calling all black men, specifically immigrants, um, to come and impregnate their women so that they can save their dying population. Now, I don't understand, because, you know, blackmail were once and still is, on the inner side, um, side of the line, which means their lives. I mean, what.

The United States is responsible for what's going on over there in Japan. Why should we be held responsible? And get this. They ain't even paying. No, please, please, black men, immigrants, please come have babies. Without women, they can't have babies. Now, here's the thing. We gonna need to run some tests, because it could be from what happened years ago as to why their population is down. You know what I'm saying? That stuff still in the soil, it's still in the air. You already know what I'm talking about. What's his name? Open heart hammer or open hammer. What's that? White man. Name that thought it was a genius idea to create the biggest bullet in the world. Um. Oklahoma. Yeah. This is nice. So why is it that, you know, y'all call them this, y'all call them that is hating it did this, and now you ain't calling for white man. You ain't calling for. You calling for to come save your community.",

    "voice_to_text": "Major breaking news this evening. NOAH has confirmed that the United States is experiencing a level 5 out of 5 geomagnetic storm right now. The weather agency labeled this a quote, extreme storm, the first of its kind since October 2003. Previously, the agency predicted a storm at level 4 out of five. Now it has upgraded to five out of five, and the storm reached these conditions at around seven PM Eastern Standard Time. Now, as I said before, the impacts of the storm could be anything from impacting GPS to radio to other high frequencies really across the country. And people as far south as Alabama this evening could potentially see the Aurora borealis. And probably one of the biggest potential impacts is the possibility of a power grid failure in various areas. Throughout history, we have seen power grid failures in Canada and elsewhere during these geomagnetic storm. And the earth is experiencing the strongest possible geomagnetic storm right now. As always, I'm gonna provide you updates throughout the night as we learn more, so be sure to stay tuned to be the first to know all the news you need to know."

Welcome to day 4 of trying to get Chipotle to change their outrageously small portion sizes. We're sick of it. First and foremost, keep the one star reviews coming. We're starting to cause a fucking ruckus here. Okay, I don't know if it's directly because of your guys's reviews and, like, these videos in general, but Keith Lee just made a video reviewing Chipotle and talking about how bad the portion sizes are. He never does that shit. But now it's time for Phase 2. We have phase 1. The reviews. We're still gonna do that, but phase 2 requires a little bit more effort. If you are willing to go to your nearest Chipotle, order your normal stuff, and if the portion sizes aren't top tier, walk out mid fucking burrito. Just walk out. Do you understand how funny it would be to see a whole mob of people doing this on the internet? If you do this or see somebody who is doing this, send it to me immediately. People are saying we should just stop going there and boycott it. What's the fun in that",

So, a couple days ago, Ben Crump started doing media interviews about this case that happened in Florida involving a 23 year old airman who was killed by police. And Ben Crump said three very specific things about the case that made the police look bad. Number one, he said that the police were at the wrong apartment. Number two, he said that the police knocked but did not announce who they were. And three, he said that police officers forced entry into the apartment. Right after I saw those media interviews, I put up a story on TikTok and I said, you know, without evidence, we just cannot trust Ben Crump. He lies too often. Alright, there was recently an officer involved shooting in Florida. And Ben Crump, This evening, he came out swinging. He's alleging that police officers went to the wrong apartment and killed an innocent man. And he better have some evidence to back this up. And earlier today, one of our sources sent us body camera video from the involved officer. And police Law News was the first to publish it. The body camera footage clearly showed that the officer was at the right apartment. The officer identified himself as a police officer and Mr. Fortson opened the door. There was no forced entry. And to be Clear this officer involved shooting is legal."

So on May 3rd, 2000, twenty four police officials in the state of Florida were called to an apartment complex to investigate a disturbance, right? So they're here to investigate this disturbance. They go and they knock on this door without telling who's on the other side, that they are the police. They begin to knock more aggressively, right? So the person on the other side of the door. Let's talk about them for a second. The man's name is Roger Fortson. He's a US airman, right? And he's in his apartment that is off base. He's a US airman, right? He's on Facetime with this woman, and he hears a knock at the door. So he hears a knock at the door. So what does he say? He says, who is it? No answer. Right? So then they begin to knock more aggressively. He gets up and he goes to retrieve his legal, legal weapon, right? So he picks it up, and as he's walking back through his living room, the police charging through his door, they see that he has a gun, and they shoot him six times. And he dies at the hospital. Ben Crumb, the same attorney that handled Brianna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tyree Nichols and Trayvon Martin. He's also investigating this case. Nobody's talking about it. Why not? Why is nobody talking about Roger Fortson? Why? Why? Why? This man was in his own Home. There's nobody can footage yet, by the way. Isn't that strange? That's not strange to nobody."

Anybody who is teaching, uh, in a university, or anyone who is, uh, putting content on social media should be held responsible for what they include and what they exclude. And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East, is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted. Pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there."

    "voice_to_text": "Family of a Florida airman is demanding justice today after he was shot and killed by police in his own home. Twenty three year old Senior Airman Roger Fortson was alone in his apartment Friday when Oklahoma County Sheriff's deputies burst through the door and shot him six times. The sheriff's office says deputies were responding to a disturbance call at the apartment complex and acted in self defense when they noticed Forston was armed. However, Fortson's family says the gun was legally owned and family attorney Benjamin Crump says Fortson heard aggressive knocks outside and asked who was there but got no response and that is when they say he grabbed his gun. Now Crump says deputies had the wrong apartment. He is calling for the body cam footage to be released. It's more to the story than the news is actually telling you because what actually happened is that he was actually on the phone with a young lady. They knocked on the door. The first time you went to the door, nobody was at the door. Right? Few minutes later another, another person knocked on the door more aggressively. Goes to the door, looks through the people, there's nobody there. That's when he proceeds to go get the weapon. Right? They never identified themselves. They never gave, um, proper notes of them being law enforcement at all. They just bursted through the door, they saw him have the weapon and then they chose to. Basically modern day Execution. Um, and the young lady was on the phone as he was, um, slowly transitioning, you know, saying. He said, I can't breathe. They took him to the hospital, but unfortunately, he transitioned. I don't like the fact that law enforcement gets away with doing their job so poorly, but this is not new. This is something that they do every single day, unfortunately. To say you get Intel, you go to the wrong house, you see someone have a weapon, and instead of calming the situation down and analyzing what's going on, you shoot first and ask questions later. Now, look at the situation. Everybody in that whole entire operation, from the officers that was there to the person that signed off on the warrant, all the situation, that whole entire operation needs to be fireplace under investigation and charge. I don't care what none. Nobody else says. This is nasty work.",

Can't say that about them. That's derogatory. And that was a great opening segment. Lots of things to talk about there. Oh, and I agree with many, many things you said during. In fact, probably more than than most other candidates, um, when you're running for president. But I still would not have voted for you, um, because you're an Indian. We'll get back to that. Um, and Coulter told me flat out to my face that she couldn't vote for me, quote, because you're an Indian. Even though she agrees with me. The most other candidates, I disagree with her, but respect that she had the guts to speak her mind. Republican presidential candidates are completely lights on. No one's home.

Create own landscapes, create own quests, make the best boss fights ever. Like, you can spawn deadlift five times if you want to. It's basically the modding tool CD Project Red used to create the Witcher 3. Well, back then, it wasn't the modding tool, it was the development tool, the engine, red engine.

Here's a phone number on here for DMV, so we'll give her a ticket for the suspended driver's. Okay. All right. Hope you have a good night. Okay.

And it ain't about they got to be behind you anymore. Nah, shit is everywhere. They might get it boned in now they got face recognition, so fuck all that. Just your plate recognition is enough. See, watch. You can just ride by Boo boo boo. But it gets you from behind, too. You ride behind them, he can get you. That's the fucked up part. I'm making this video cause I was hit with this. And I was thinking like, how the hell this motherfucker knew? Or, you know, when we. We usually don't want the police behind us, right? This motherfucker was Pointed this way. So I said, let me make a quick left. But he turned around and still came for me. And I'm figuring out, like, is this camera picking up, um, any and everything around me? Then I came to see, and I started doing my research when I got home. Like, bro, they got cameras everywhere. And is doing that, and it getting the entail through them. Right now, you in a world where the police is always following you. So if you out there riding bowl plates and anything like wrong plates on this caution, they know now, bro. See, before they had to make it into law, they was trying to pass in law only to State Patrol can do it. Not all of this was going to play eight to 10 years ago. Think about it. Like I said today, they should not only reads plates and read faces. That's what I'm on. I'm gonna post my next video. They're gonna be meeting face. Y'all know. I'mma put y'all on to the game, cause now you don't have really no freedom. Talking about. They as nosy as they could be. Nosy, bro, that we already knew.

Everybody come together and we drop the Intel of the hood. What they think they slick. Now we know all of it. Y'all drop the new stuff. Y'all are below, man. Maybe give me some more stuff.

Now, that is one year later than forecast last year, and at that time the fund would only be able to pay out about 83% of benefits. On the Medicare side, there's a slightly better outlook. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that covers hospital stays will be able to pay 100% of benefits until 2036. That's five years longer than previous estimates. Now, the Treasury Department says that these upward adjustments are mostly due to a stronger than expected economy as compared to last year's forecast. More Americans are working and they're earning more money, and they're therefore contributing more money through their taxes to these programs. Surgery is also assuming a lower long term disability rate in these programs, so both increased revenue and reduce cost here are helping extend these timelines. Despite the improvement from last year, though, it's still clear that these programs will have to start paying less than full benefits out to about 70 million recipients in just over a decade unless Congress makes some sort of a change before then."

On that mixtape. Which Court Chapman. I ain't a lot. Certified little boy. That. That's. That's easy. Certified little boy can go. He. You know, it's cool, but I like the old. Give me the old Drake. Give me. I'll take the old Drake back. Hey, man, it was cool, but is it? Maybe. I haven't been to in a long time, but that's not a he. That's the most cuttable one to me. Certified level boy can go. Cause thank me later was a classic album. It bought fancy. It bought. Miss me. It was a lot of classes on that album, so it was really hard to decide, but I say certified level. The scorpion, um. Scorpion was God's plan non stop. Yeah. Um. Santos Rose. Yeah, yeah. Yes. My shit. I ain't gonna lie. Probably not really cutting it. Okay. Worst. Worst behavior. Now probably cutting out worst behavior. I'm probably cutting out so you couldn't. Yeah, I'm probably cutting out so you couldn't know. What's the saying",

I know I'm giving the Zionist exactly what they want, so, Zionist, please take a minute to be super excited that a pro Palestine Palestinian person is crying right now. I'm so glad I could make your day. Yesterday was so bad, and I don't know why it's, like, hitting me now. And I don't know if other people are having these reactions to what happened at UCLA. I don't think they are, but I don't know what other Palestinians are feeling like this if they were there, but holy fuck, it was so bad. And I'm not even upset about, like, what the police did, because they did the same thing to us during the BLM protest, and it did not hit me like this. I think what it was was watching, like, thousands and thousands of people cheering on the police. Like, yes, shoot them with the rubber bullets, deploy the tear gas, get them! Like, oh, my god, I don't feel safe in America 1 and 2. It's, like, so crazy to stand for something so hard and then the opposition, like, actually be so disgusting. Like, I have to remind myself constantly. Like, people were counter protesting the civil rights movement. People were standing out of Ruby Bridges School screaming, I hope you die! When she was 5 years old, 6 years old, people were literally shooting civil rights leaders for protesting for black rights. Like, I have To remember that historically, there will always be people who are on the wrong side and that. Who truly believe in their own deception and lies. I feel so close to the people who are, like, experienced the BLM movement as a black person, because it's like, holy shit. I'm literally fighting for my human rights. And people are like. And people are like, you're. You're fucking stupid for doing that. You're disgusting. You're not doing anything for the cause. Like, I really don't know why I made this video. I'm not making this for you to feel bad for me. I'm making this so if any other Palestinian is fucking losing it right now, this is what it's like. And I understand, and I'm sorry.",

No dude, are you serious? Well, consent is manufactured, everybody. Right before your eyes, The LA Times change their article title again after violent night at you CLA. Another title change from LA Times. I love checking back in periodically with the Los Angeles Times to see like how how much worse it can get in the next 24 hour period.

Dramatic video showed heavily geared officers using a ladder truck and climbing through a window to access the historic hall, known for its role in an anti-Vietnam War protest decades ago, where protesters had barricaded themselves after smashing windows and doors to break in less than 24 hours before. Police used \"flash bangs,\" or distraction devices, to quell any potential response by the protesters as they moved in. They said tear gas was not used.",
    "voice_to_text": "There is a movement to radicalize young people, and I'm not going to wait until it's done and all of a sudden acknowledge the existence of it. This is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals and radicalizing our children, and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the city of New York. Hundreds of protesters were arrested Tuesday night after the NYPD officers in riogear entered Columbia University to clear the lawn and previously occupied campus hall at the request of the university president. 300 arrests remain, with preliminary charges range from trespass to criminal mischief to burglary. At this point, we will let the criminal justice system play out. Officers used a ladder truck to enter the hall, which is known for its role in the anti Vietnam protests back in 1968. Try to lock us out, but the NYPD and the people of the city of New York will never be locked out, and we will always work together to keep our city safe. The school has asked police to remain on campus through May 17th, with graduation set for May 15th."

You need to go heal to go to go do something. The fact that you don't wanna give birth to a boy, it's blowing my mind. Oh, I don't wanna raise a potential abuser. Like, it's just in a man's nature to be abusive. It's all about who raised them. If you're not a bad person, then you shouldn't have nothing to worry about.

    "voice_to_text": "By now you probably know that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Is running as an independent candidate for president of the United States. But you probably have heard him spoken about like this. Spoiler candidate. A spoiler spoiler called Kennedy a spoiler spoiler. But is this really true? I mean, is Bobby really a spoiler in this election? We looked into it, and now we have the answers. Now, the preface here is that most polls are conducted by mainstream media outlets, and typically they have 1,000 to 3,000 or so respondents per poll. And most of those polls have about a plus or minus 3% margin of error. While we conducted a nationwide poll of over 25,000 respondents, our margin of error was point six %. That makes it by far the most accurate predictor of the 2024 election that we have thus far. All right, let's dive into the maps. This is the head to head matchup between Biden and Trump. Trump with 2 94 and Biden with two 44. Trump wins by 50 electoral votes, and if you're a political nerd like myself, you know that that is not very close. And with Bobby as a third party candidate, Biden only picks up two additional states, so he still loses to Trump. Alright, now here is where it gets very interesting. In a head to head matchup, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Wins 367 electoral votes versus Joe Biden's 1 71. Now that is what we call a landslide. And what's even Crazier about these numbers is when you look at the ad spend of these two campaigns. Biden has spent over $36 million in advertising since October 1st, and we have spent a little over two. the next head to head matchup that we pulled was Bobby versus Trump. Obviously, this is a very close election, but Bobby still wins. All right, so to recap, Biden cannot beat Trump in a head to head race, and it is not close. Biden cannot beat Trump in a Three Way race, and it's still not very close. Bobby wins in a landslide against Biden head to head, and Bobby beats Trump head to head. So, wait, who is actually the spoiler here? Because a spoiler is a non winning candidate whose presence on the ballot affects which candidate wins. A non winning candidate affecting a possible winning candidate. So if you do not wanna see Donald Trump become the next president of the United States, there is only one candidate running who has the power to beat him, and it is Robert F. Kennedy junior.",

We would have been on the right side of history's critical pivot points. We like to credit ourselves with that. Well, let me tell you folks, you got an opportunity right here, right now to be on the right side. History, and it rhymes with all of those previous pivot points. Are human beings yours to buy and sell? Are they? Can you answer that question? Yeah, I see the smirks from over there, the vile twisting of facial expressions. It offends you, doesn't it? To be faced with what you're standing for, I bet. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care how you feel about whether or not human beings should be bought or sold. I care about whether or not that's moral or immoral. I care about whether or not that's right or wrong. And if I were the last human being on earth to say it's wrong, I would stand with pride against everyone. But what makes me proud is the fact that I'm not standing alone. I might be in the minority in this chamber, but I'm on the right side of history. I'm in the majority of folks outside these walls. Who believe that we should not buy and sell human life. This is really simple right now. In a few minutes. In a few moments, that board is gonna light up, and the green dots next to the names, for history, for perpetuity until the end of time, are gonna be recorded as those who thought it was okay to buy and sell people in 2024, not in 1964, not in 1932, not in 1864. But today, the people who are for the buying and selling of people are gonna have green dots next to their names up there. In a few minutes. Yeah, I love the laughs, the smiles, the casual disregard for the importance of what it is you're about to do. History is going to record it, and you're going to answer for it in eternity.

Let me just take you through some of the definitions within the law. They banned our website, including anything that has the option of entering or accessing the website, even passwords that are needed, um, whether they're paid or not, and whether it's stored on Israeli servers or outside of Israel. The website is now inaccessible. Uh, they're also banning any device used for providing content. That includes my mobile phone. If I use that, uh, to do any kind of news gathering, then the Israelis can simply confiscate it. Our internet access provider, the guy that simply hosts, uh, Al jazeera.net, uh, is also in danger of being find if they host the website. The Al Jazeera TV channel completely banned. Transmission by any kind of content provider is also banned and holding offices or operating them in the territory of Israel by the channel. Also, once again, any devices used to provide content for the channel can be taken away by the Israelis. It's a wide ranging ban. We don't know how long it will be in place for, but it does cover this territory of the state of Israel. Imran Khan, Al Jazeera, occupied Easter Islam.",

If you haven't heard about this yet, there's over 16,000 pounds of ground beef sold at Walmart that's recalled over a E. Coli risk, which is crazy. They're saying that the contaminated beef was produced on April 26th and April 27th and they were distributed to Walmart stores throughout the entire eastern US. Saying that this ground beef was sold at Walmart locations in Connecticut, Washington DC, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York. This is the list of the products that are recalled. So you can pause and read and check yours. This is the first part. Then here's the rest of the list you can pause and read. The USDA is advising consumers to throw away or return the contaminated products to the place of purchase. Obviously, everybody should know that you can get a full refund if you just return these. Obviously do not eat them. I have no idea why there are literally so many different recalls on meat from Walmart, but obviously check your stuff. I give you these daily news runups every day.

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

Like a riddle for three year old. Put that back up on the. I need to analyze this. Okay, so what he does is he poses a question, where's Sleepy Joe? And then we have to go through a process like, what does he mean, where's Sleepy Joe? We saw the president yesterday. Is he missing? Now, why is he asking this? I thought it was hunter. He was always wairzing for, not Joe. And why is a person over the last three weeks has fallen asleep in public more times than a tree sloth calling anyone other than himself sleepy?

Man, I love when Jimmy Kimmel goes after Donald Trump falling asleep more than a tree sloth. Whoever wrote that needs a raise. But like, seriously, Donald Trump can't call anybody Sleepy Joe. Biden is out there giving speeches, meeting world leaders, traveling around the country, doing stuff for us. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is sitting In criminal court, facing 34 felony charges, and he's falling asleep every day. Sleepy Donald. Look, I've said it before and I'll say it again. If Donald Trump can't even stay awake in court, how do we expect him to be able to take that 3:00am phone call as president, to go down to the situation Room and take care of whatever's happening around the world? Certainly don't have confidence in his ability to do that. And as Jimmy Kimmel said, it's like a riddle for three year olds. That's how Donald Trump speaks.

And number three, it's not true. Let me explain. So first, obviously, these are not peaceful protesters. They threaten, they scream. They're pushing and shoving. They're smashing windows with hammers. They're attacking Jewish students. They're taking over buildings and hijacking campuses and preventing higher education in America. Not peaceful. Number two, this is not a grassroots movement. These are well organized, well coordinated, well funded campus infiltrations by outside groups. Some of these people showing up on campuses have been convicted with connections to terrorism financing. A lot of them are not students. These are grown adults with no connection to the campuses they are on. They are outside educators. And number three, they're wrong. They are just wrong. Some of these actual student demonstrators don't understand that they have been brainwashed by TikTok to believe that Israel's actually committing a genocide. They have been brainwashed to believe that Israel doesn't provide humanitarian aid. When hundreds of trucks of aid get into Gaza a day, which country provides humanitarian aid to the side that attacked her? And they have been brainwashed to believe that Zionism, in and of itself is a movement that necessitates the genocide of Palestinians. They truly believe all these lies. And because they do, they are hell bent on taking down the single consistent democracy in the entire Middle East. And why do we say this movement is anti Semitic? Because these privileged kids who are culturally appropriating a kafia and a rocket with a crop top, which they can't wear anywhere else in the Middle East other than in Israel, are not outraged by any actual atrocity happening in the world right now. None. But who do they target? The world. Single Jewish state. The only country. The chairs are values. They say we're not against Jews, we are against Zionists. They're so brainwashed they don't understand what Zionism is. That it literally just means Israel has the right to exist. And instead they chant jihadi slogans like globalize the intifada. And like good jihadi's do, they promise to take down Israel with blood and soul. Here's the thing. If for your revolution you draw your fashion inspiration from a terrorist from the 80s, you are thrilled by the concept of violence against Jews, and you're praised by the Ayatollah of Iran, you might wanna take a look in the mirror and rethink that movement of yours."

Students have set up encampments and issued demands that schools divest from Israel. On many campuses, police have been called in to respond to violence and property destruction.   \u201cDestroying property is not a peaceful protest \u2014 it\u2019s against the law,\u201d he said. \u201cVandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduations \u2014 none of this is a peaceful protest.\u201d   President Biden said \u201cdissent is essential to democracy\u201d but that dissent must not turn in lawlessness or bigotry.   \u201cThere should be no place on any campus, no place in America, for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind whether it\u2019s antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans. It\u2019s simply wrong.\u201d   Responding to reporters\u2019 questions, the president said the protests have not made him reconsider any policies with respect to the war in Gaza.   He also said \u201cno\u201d when asked whether the National Guard should be deployed to campuses to quell the demonstrations.\u201d #potus #joebiden #protests #gazawar #israelhamaswar #cspan ",

    "voice_to_text": "We've all seen images and they put to the test to fundamental American principles. Excuse me? The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make their voices heard. The second is the rule of law. Both must be upheld. We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash descent. American people are heard. In fact, peaceful protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues. But. But neither are we a lawless country. We are a civil society, and order must prevail. Throughout our history, we've often faced moments like this because we are a big, diverse, free thinking and freedom loving nation. And moments like this are always those who rush into score political points. But this isn't a moment for politics. It's a moment for clarity. So let me be clear. Peaceful protest. In America, violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is. It's against the law, and violence occurs. Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations, none of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling, fairing people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. Descent is essential to democracy. But descent must never lead to disorder or to deny the rights of others. So students can finish the semester and their college education. Look, it's basically a matter of fairness. It's A matter of what's right. There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos. People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked. Let's be clear about this as well. There should be no place on any campus, no place in America, for anti semitism or threats of violence against Jewish students. There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's anti semitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans. It's simply wrong. There's no place for racism in America. It's all wrong. It's on American. I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions in America. We respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn't mean anything goes. It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law, you know, make no mistake. As president, I will always defend free speech. And I will always be just as strong as standing up for the rule of law. That's my responsibility to you, the American people, my obligation of the Constitution. Thank you very much.",

Blinken arrived in Israel on Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials following visits to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, his seventh trip to the region since the beginning of Israel\u2019s offensive on Gaza. Speaking jointly to reporters during the visit, Israeli President Isaac Herzog urged Israel\u2019s \"allies and friends\" to reject efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) taken against the country for its war on Gaza. Herzog characterised the reported ICC investigation into Israeli leaders as a \"clear and present danger to democracies and to free and peace-loving nations, who pursue the norms of international law\". Recently, several senior Israeli officials have voiced concern over the ICC's investigation into Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Reports suggest that the court could issue arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders. Israel\u2019s war on Gaza has killed over 34,500 Palestinians since 7 October 2023, the majority being women and children.",

    "voice_to_text": "Sky 5 was overhead as a woman frantically scales offense, trying desperately to avoid some very agitated and apparently dangerous dogs on the ground below her. They have already killed her boyfriend, whose ravaged body is just feet away. The deadly Pitbull attack happened at a home on North Thorson Avenue in Compton. Investigators say the woman discovered the gruesome scene Friday morning in the backyard and called 9 1 1. There is surveillance footage of the incident or, or, you know, surrounding the property. And it was discovered that as our victim was in the backyard, apparently feeding them, it sounds like they attacked him. And ultimately he succumbed to his injuries. Law enforcement personnel, firefighters and LA County Animal Control officers quickly converged at the location. First responders say the initial challenge was to corral the dogs into a neighboring yard to gain access to the victim. The graphic footage, which we will not be revealing, shows the dogs ripped off most of the 35 year old man's clothes, in addition to fatally biting and mauling him. Neighbors and animal advocates are stunned. People need to take very care of their dogs. People need to understand that, um, these dogs can't kill somebody and hurt people. It should have never happened. This time it happened to the owner of the dogs, but normally it happens to children, elderly, defenseless people. And somebody definitely needs to be held accountable for this. There has to be some kind of law. And order here. Animal control officers removed 13 pit bulls from the property, male and female five adults, eight puppies. Investigators are collecting DNA swabs and forensic evidence, trying to determine which dogs actually attacked and killed the victim. Experts will be examining the dog's general health and behavior and aggression. If any animal is determined to be unsafe for human interaction, it will be euthanized.",

What we've been seeing from local reports, now multiple Iranian reports, official and semi official, is explosions near the city of Esfahan, which is in central western central Iran. One more thing, uh. That the US official told me is that it is not believed to be against a nuclear facility. We've been talking about the city of Esfahan. It is one of Iran's most important. There is a significant nuclear facility there. My understanding from speaking uh. With now multiple US officials is that, uh. The targets that Israel had indicated that they would be going after in a counter strike would not be nuclear. One senior US official also telling me that the targets would not be civilian. As we were just saying moments ago, Abby, the US was expecting Israel to carry Out a strike that was limited in scope, uh, perhaps against military targets, but something that would be visible, so as to tell the world, this is Israel, uh, hitting back against Iran.",

A growing memorial outside the Spencer Street Apartments where three year old JL Guardado Prodensio was found dead Sunday morning. His mother is now charged in his death. Jennifer Perdencio emotional in court today as prosecutors alleged that she left the toddler in the care of his seven and eight year old siblings even though she knew he was sick, suffering from a seizure disorder and was vomiting blood. The defendant went out that night to a bar in Revere where she drank alcohol for a number of hours and then she slept at a friend's home, a boyfriend's home in Somerville. The prosecutor says Perdencio had taken her son for medical treatment twice in the past week but still left him overnight even as his brother sounded the alarm. At some point during the night, the eight year old brother of the alleged victim sent a text to the defendant, their mother, expressing concern for the well being of his brother, the three year old, and actually attaching a video. But the 25 year old did not return home until 10 the next morning to find her youngest son had died. Prodancio's defense attorney says his client is severely distraught over the loss of her child and is cooperating with police. Neighbors at the apartment building are stunned by the Tragedy. I remember the little boy because he was so cute. Very sad because he's only 3 years old now. Perdancio is being held on $100,000 bail. She is due back in court for a probable cause hearing on May 2nd. We are live in Chelsea tonight. I marry Slatna. WCB New Center fire.",

    "voice_to_text": "Dexter Reed was pulled over for what's being reported as a seatbelt violation in a residential area of Chicago. He was pulled over by unmarked vehicles with four plane closed police officers who had their guns drawn on him. When they arrived at his vehicle, the officers fired 96 rounds in 41 seconds. According to the reports the officers gave, they arrived in an unmarked car and stopped read for not wearing a seatbelt. But things devolved quickly as he appeared to refuse the officers commands and didn't immediately leave the SUV. Dexter Reed had a firearm, and according to their report, when the four plain closed police officers walked up to his car, yelling and demanding him to get out with their guns drawn, Reed shot first. And I don't know anyone that would blame him. Here's a steal from the body cam footage. Here is one officer directly in front of me with a firearm. There's another one at the door wearing a winter jacket and a baseball hat, with one hand on his door and another pointing a gun at him. And there's another one on the passenger side window. If anyone is in Dexter Reed's position here, you likely think these people are trying to steal your car at gunpoint, because again, they're in plain clothes, none of them are wearing uniforms. The four officers fired 96 shots in 41 seconds, including and after we'd exited, the vehicle fell to the ground and laid motionless. One Of the four officers fired 50 shots. Now, these plain clothes officers and unmarked cars are part of some sort of tactical or expert or elite unit, whatever they wanna call it. But experts are asking why these officers of this particular unit in plain clothes would bother to stop someone for a seatbelt violation. And additionally, if the windows of Reed's vehicle were tinted, it would have been incredibly difficult for them to see whether or not he had a seatbelt on. I'll admit that I'm not an expert in police process, but what seems odd to me is that if this was a seatbelt violation, that four plane closed officers all swarmed his vehicle with their guns drawn. And in a very predictable turn of events, these officers are on a 30 day administrative leave during investigations. State's Attorney Kim Fox said her office was investigating the possibility of criminal charges. And I must say, I hope all of them face criminal charges and end up in prison where people who murder people belong.",

But Kris Jenner has been on audio tapes. But this what they got Kim for. Hold on, y'all watch this. Closing in on Kim Kardashian. The FBI investigation, initially a tremor threatening her carefully constructed image, has morphed into a full blown earthquake threatening to engulf her entire empire. Leaked information paints a picture of a woman who allegedly used a seductive facade to mask a ruthless ambition. Wielding stolen documents and secrets like weapons. Kim Kardashian has found herself at the center of a sensational scandal. With federal authorities uncovering a shocking plot allegedly orchestrated by the reality TV star. The Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI has disclosed disturbing details accusing Kardashian of a scheme involving drugging high profile men in order. Yes, you heard that right. Kim Kardashian is caught in a plot of drugging high professional men. Okay. For documents and other blackmail. But it keeps going. Dashing. Of a scheme involving drugging high profile men in order to pilfer crucial documents for personal enrichment and blackmail purposes. The saga unfolded when federal agents executed a dramatic raid on the residence of Music Mobile Diddy, revealing a cache of incriminating video footage. This footage purportedly captures Kardashian engaged in activities that have sent shockwaves through the entertainment and legal worlds alike. In a turn of events that has both Stunned and captivated the public, the FBI claims that Kardashian, known for her glamorous image and celebrity status, was not only involved in the theft of vital information, but also used it as leverage to further her own interests. The gravity of these allegations has sent ripples through Hollywood, where Kardashian has long been a prominent figure. The revelation of these purported misdeeds has not only tarnished Kardashians once impeccable public persona, but has also raised questions about the lengths to which some may go in pursuit of power and wealth. The answer, it's a fucking. It's a wrap. It's a wrap. Like, everybody's going, watch how quick they take down. This before they even took down Trump, who has 67 pending felons. That's another conversation. But this. I know y'all been waiting for the Kardashians like there's a shoe. Kris Jenner is caught on audio tape. That woman is diabolical on the tapes. If the. If. I'm not even gonna throw it out there cause it's a ledge. But from the Scranton transcripts. Y'all grab your popcorn, keep watching this with me. Follow."

    "voice_to_text": "One thing that I hear a lot of women say is that if he doesn't want to be my boyfriend, then why does he keep me around? It keeps you around because you are resource. And I don't wanna tell you because if I just tell you that I'm not the guy, flat out, cause I know I'm not the guy. But if I tell you that, then you gonna leave. But if you leave, who gonna be cooking my meals? Who gonna be, um, picking up the laundry and washing the dishes? Who gonna be going out on dates with? And this is why I think that men who say that women should pick better men are disingenuous and that most of the time they're lying. And they know that they are. This man goes on and talk about how he pretends to be what she's looking for, even though he knows that he's not, because he doesn't wanna lose access to the resources that she has. I talked about it before, but I do believe that men do a bit of a cost benefit analysis when they make a determination. I'm gonna stay with her because whatever it is she's providing me with, I still need that. That's why they won't leave you until they got a new relationship all lined up. Somebody's gotta do that cooking and cleaning, cause he's not gonna do it for himself. Some of these men are resource suckers, labor diggers, It's not a coincidence that when he needed you to help him with the bills or help him with his career, that you all got along beautifully. But as soon as he got wherever it is he needed to be, not all y'all do was fight. It's not a coincidence. They'll act like women are crazy. When you said that he lied to me. He pretended that he was into me. He made me feel like I was the only one. They'll act like, how would you fall for that? But then they'll turn around and admit that they are amazing actors and that they fool women all the time who they can use."

    "voice_to_text": "This is what a streaming farm looks like, aka the black market of the music industry. It's how some musicians and labels distort reality to push their tracks to the top of the charts and earn more money. Streaming farms use bots to artificially play music on platforms like Spotify or Apple Music to drastically inflate the numbers of streams a song gets. In March, a man in Denmark was sentenced to 18 months in prison for getting music streaming services to pay him $290,000 in royalties for fake streams. But that rare case is just a glimpse into the scale of this fraud. In 2,019 Rolling Stone article, Hopeless Records founder Louis Posin claimed this illegal practice potentially steals $300 million a year from artists with legitimate streams from real fans, equaling 3 to 4% of all streams. But that estimate is much higher now. A 2023 analyst report from the Financial Times found that up to 10% of all music streams globally are fake. Matters because there's a pool of money that streaming platforms distribute to the rights holders of songs. So when an artist is faking those dreams, they're taking money out of that pool could go to artists with legitimate streams. The creation of streaming farms follows the decline of radio and the rise of its replacement streaming platforms. Major artists and labels historically paid radio DJs to play their music. But streaming platforms like Spotify are democratizing music, allowing independent artists a platform. But that means Larger artists and labels are struggling to stay on top of the charts, so they compete by buying streams. Streaming services like Spotify have recently tried to crack down on this by looking specifically for erratic behavior like a sudden jumping streams or song on repeat for hours. A Spotify spokesperson said that when they detect artificial streams, they withhold royalties and tell the labeler distributor. They can also choose to remove tracks from the platform and find labels in distributor, but some musicians say they're being targeted by bots and then unfairly punished as a result. Marketing agencies hired by the artist might be responsible though, going behind the backs of the artist to fulfill their promises. Apple Music has similarly been penalizing streaming fraud 2 since 2022, but somehow people are continuing to steal from the royalty pool, which is already too small and meant for artists with real fans. And with advancements in AI, who knows what the scale of this issue could actually be now and in the future.",

And as somebody who first ever girlfriend was white and I lost my virginity to a white girl, I think I know why, bro. That's all that's out there.

So that's all I really had available to me. Thank that. I didn't like black girls, I love black girls. It was just one other one in the whole school. One. And she was my cousin. I wanna say like I have a choice, but like that's all that was on the menu, you get what I'm saying? So when it started coming down all that who like who and all that, she was like, I like you.

Now, don't get me wrong, it's those ones that are like, oh, if it ain't snowing, I ain't going. And to me that is diabolical to even say out loud. Like if there's no white girls, you're not going like at all. You're just not gonna pop up cause there's no white girls. It's kind of crazy, gang.

Like, let's keep it a buck, y'all. All of them are annoying as fuck. Like, they all are. It just is what it is. No color of them is less annoying than another color, bro. That's just cap.

And what comes after is even more sad. Now, the family goes on to explain that Justin had a heart attack. He, he went into cardiac arrest and died. That was due to the fact that he suffers from sickle cell, so having that exertion on his body was too much. Like entirely too much. Now, after Justin's passing, the school had put out a statement, um, and they said that it was they're saddened by his passing. Justin was a 10th grade student. They go on to explain, we understand the circumstances around Justin's death have not been determined. However, there are social media reports that indicated that Justin was subjected to racial insensitivity from classmates. Please understand that these type of behaviours is not consistent with our core values. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They did state that they are cooperating with local law enforcement. Again, according to the police, uh, Justin was only 16 years old. The event happened around nine fifty five PM over the weekend and he had passed away from cardiac arrest. Justin's family does have a gofundme set up and their goal is rather small, so I'm hoping that individuals will be able to help with his burial expenses. Hopefully through the investigation that all of these boys implemented in what they did to Justin will be brought to justice. Because all He wanted to do was just fit in in his new high school."

    "voice_to_text": "Ali, they are now charged with murder. This is for killing a man that they say police wouldn't do anything about, despite already having warrants for his arrest. Are they cold blooded killers or were their actions justified? In defence of their little sister, Jonathan Martin making the case with attorney Charles Adams. Capital murder because, uh, quintania was kidnapped right when there he was taken in, um, in the back of the F ONE FIFTY and dropped off somewhere else. The story of two teen brothers in South Texas arrested for beating their stepfather to death for allegedly sexually abusing their half sister has a lot of people talking. They were apparently so enraged at their stepfather, Gabriel Cantonia, they, along with their friend, confronted him at a home, beat him before attacking him two more times at another location, reportedly with brass knuckles, then dumping his body in a field where he was found dead. Clearly a crime, but was it justified? And as in, if you are the defense attorney in the situation, what you're arguing is that there are these medicating circumstances. The rape of their very young small child little sister by their evil stepfather. Cantonea did have a warrant out for continual sexual abuse of another child. I asked attorney Charles Adams if that history could help a defense. That certainly it, it. It bolsters the perception that they were. That he was rightfully accused, right, cause it was a different victim. So now you have Two young children claiming that they were sexually assaulted by this man. Right. And if these two brothers and a friend were aware, I think it. It. It provides a. A rationale, a justification that a lot of people can understand. But the teens are facing serious charges, including murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. While some might understand their motivation, others argue killing someone in a situation like this is never okay. But what might a jury say? Charles says, while a long shot, a jury nullification argument might be the best option for defense. And where you, as lawyer, look at the jury and say, hey, we understand that this meets the elements, but we're asking you to find them not guilty anyway. Because no one. I don't think there's anyone in America that can't sympathize with two brothers acting the way they did in response to someone",

Narobi, which is the capital city of Kenya, is experiencing major flooding right now, but it's also other countries that's experiencing it. To Kenya, Burundi, Tanzania, Somalia, Uganda. Since March, there have been a reported of 76 deaths in Kenya. Monday, there was a report of 35 deaths Sunday. Today there have been a report of over 45 deaths. Over 130,000 people have been displaced, and over 150 schools have collapsed or are underwater right now. There have been reports that school is still going to be in session tomorrow. On Monday, they're saying that if it's looking like, you know, it's gonna be too bad for the students to go to school, you know, keep them at home. But the fact that they're still being told, you know, school is in session, um, kind of crazy, especially after they've experienced what they experienced. People have been reported stranded, people have been reported missing. There's a lot of injuries going on out there. There was a truck that was in transit during the downpour of rain, and people witnessed it getting swept away. This is all in Kenya. In Tanzania, there have been reports of over 155 deaths due to this, um, downpour of rain, and over 236 injuries. The Prime Minister of Tanzania have reported over 200,000 people that have been affected by this, and over 51,000 homes. Rundy, which is one of the World's most poorest countries has experienced over 96,000 displacements due to this violent rain that has been occurring for a couple of months and as early as April 17th, 2024. Their interior minister has been asking for combined efforts to help due to the destruction that has been occurring over there. Malia, another country in Africa, has experienced this violent rain as well. Over 124,000 people in Somalia have been affected by this rain and over 50 100 people have been displaced. India's government proposed 3.3 billion shillings, which equates to $24.5 million, for emergency response services that'll help with food aid, emergency housing, rebuilding of schools, stores, homes. There's a lot going on all over the world, but Africa is seriously going through as I just wanna bring as much attention as I possibly can. I personally didn't know about some of these events taking place, but it's been going on for a couple of weeks and some places it's been going on for a couple of months, so I just wanna bring as much attention to it as I can.",

So he pretends to keep drinking the coffee. Robbie told investigators he prepared his coffee every night, so all he needed to do in the morning was turn on the machine. But between the evening when Robbie would prep his coffee and the following morning, when he turned on the coffee maker, melody snuck in and poisoned the water. Here you can see it on video. Melody checks to make sure Robbie has already prepped the coffee maker and then grab something from under the sink before pouring it into the machine. Yeah, that's something that melody grabbed from under the sink was bleach. By June 2023, the family had returned to the United States, where Robbie was stationed at an Air Force base in Tucson, Arizona. He set up more cameras there, too, that capture melody in the act, pouring something into the coffee pot and looking over her shoulder to see if anyone's watching. Some of the cameras were disguised as fire alarms and placed in the laundry room and kitchen area. Melody is caught on camera multiple times appearing to pour bleach in the laundry room, walking into the next room, and then pouring it into the coffee maker. No, no. Put this in. Oh, it smells. I can smell it. I can smell it. Soapy. Watch this. Guaranteed you're Gonna see purple. Wow. Beyond just the chemical tests, Robbie shows how soapy the coffee maker becomes when water is added. Today is the strongest it's been. I've been missing out at least 7, 8 times. It's still very sexy, bubbly, soapy. She was off today. She didn't work. Today's the most that I'm having. Clean it. Whatever's in there is a lot of it. And on top of that, he says he could smell the bleach coming from the machine. Looks like the bleach has a new location. That purple is now over here. Let's see what it smells like. No smell. Doesn't smell like I do every day. I clean this thing out after I test it. This back is very slippery right now from after I rinsed it. Smells like bleach. Melody was arrested on July 18th and later incited by a grand jury for first degree attempted murder. This week, she pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Uh, that you intended to harm, um. Is it Robbie? Robbie Johnson, uh, by adding, um. Or Maybelline poison or chemical compounds or water to your drink. Have you plead guilty or not guilty? Guilty.",

They would not allow us to, uh, record it or, uh, did not provide us with any copies. But it did show the student running up to the victim from behind in a packed cafeteria and striking the victim several times on the head with a large Stanley Cup. It lasted only a few seconds before a security guard and another staff member intervened. The student's head was visibly bleeding. Police say the student will be charged. Kids are telling teachers, you'll see it in this video. This person has a hit list. This person says she gonna kill somebody. This person said they're gonna hurt people. The young girl warned the teachers, and the teacher say, oh, don't worry, nothing's gonna happen. A couple hours before that, she pretty much almost beat this other girl to death. It's really a boy trying, you know, identifying as girl. Almost beat another girl to death. Beat her with a Stanley Cup. You know how. You know how crazy that is? And they didn't do nothing to protect these kids. Wednesday morning, I, um, went to the guidance counselor and told her since I was second on the hit list, knowing that there was something going to happen cause there was a girl she was targeting every day at lunch. And they would go to the counter and tell them Every day that this is gonna happen. And Wednesday, I went with two others, and each of us filled out a whole paper full of what's going to happen and why it's going to happen. And then I went to course and I was told, watch your back. She. He is going to come for you and this other girl at lunch. And when I was at lunch, I was terrified. And I told Miss Vetori that that was happening. And she said, don't worry about it, it's not gonna happen. I'm telling you, if it was the other way around, and it the trans person was attacked, they will be to the end of the moon, it will be on TV right now. They'll be talking about this on the view, crying, why does this happen in our country? Young people who are trans get attacked all the time. But when a trans person shoot up a school, which happened not, not too long ago, they arrested another trans person because they were planning to shoot up a school. They had it. They want to mimic the other trans person. Then you got to transfer beating the brakes off with another little girl. That's why the beating was so bad, cause it was a boy really beating up a girl.

That somebody was allegedly this man, Solomon Galligan, a known sex offender. He went through the fencing around Black Forest Hills Elementary on Friday, approaching fifth graders during recess. Some kids began yelling stranger danger! As the man lunged towards Miranda's son. It was these kids who saved my son's wife. Several kids, she says, told adults that were supposed to be supervising recess about the strange man who took off, but says their fears seemingly fell on deaf ears. My son is saying that the TAs were on their phone. This is a big deal. The district says it's launched an investigation. Still, several parents are upset with the district and school for failing to secure the campus. The third graders went out right after this happened. The assailant was able to walk away. And not being more transparent with families about what happened. The people that know is only because our children were there and they witnessed it. And so that's why we know the truth. It is not because the truth was given by the leaders of Cherry Creek. The principal did meet with some families Monday morning and apologized, but many parents say that's not enough, saying it's clear safety is not A priority here. It's three days too late, and you still don't even have a plan. We have kids, lives at stake. This is professional incompetence. We want to get in front of the superintendent. I think that he needs to take accountability for how Cherry Creek school systems are being run. Now, we did make repeated requests for an interview with the school district, but instead we were sent a very short statement that said that they do take safety concerns very seriously, adding, quote, we are committed to being transparent and accountable to our community.

    "voice_to_text": "So if you haven't been paying attention, this Saturday afternoon, the house has passed multiple bills that give over multi billions of dollars in aid to everybody but you. And just after you filed and probably paid your taxes. $61 billion in aid to the Ukraine. Along with that build a band, TikTok, $26 billion in support of isn't real. And $8 billion for Taiwan and partners in the Indo Pacific. In total, that is $95 billion. And if that TikTok Ban Bill is actually signed, it would give TikTok 270 days to find a new owner. Meanwhile, they are finding ways to criminalize homelessness. They're still trying to collect these student loans from us. The cost of food is so high, none of us have McDonald's money. And also we still boycotting them, so y'all get my reference. The amount that I've heard people say that they pay for daycare is equivalent to rent. That's why I say we're not angry enough. Because there should be a collective don't nobody pay a cent of rent. Not a cent. Everybody can make a plan for at least 30 days. Not use Instagram at all. 30 days. Something drastic. Cause this goes beyond just playing in our faces. This is really them telling us we can, we will, and you're not gonna do anything about it.",

Someone just dropped a camera into a hole beneath Antarctica to make an incredible discovery. Basically, they dropped the camera down so deep that's technically 2.7 million year old ice that you're looking at. But Omg lol. So crazy. Government is officially denying that cloud seeding took place as two years worth of rain leaves Dubai underwater. Basically, if you haven't heard about this, Dubai has been getting so much rain for the past couple of days that they are flooding like crazy. Worrying reason why the deepest hole in the world was sealed off. I don't know, maybe so somebody doesn't fall in it. They're saying that the temperatures down at the bottom of this hole were so hot that they had to seal it off. Right? Literally don't know how to pronounce this word, but Pepsico just officially recalled their sugar free Shiba Pee Pees Ginger Ale for containing full sugar. The literal reason for this recall is because this is a zero sugar product that has actual full sugar in it. So good job, Pepsi. Scientists just had an official conversation with a humpback whale, which they hope to help mankind communicate with aliens. But what did he say? Tsunami alert has officially been issued after a volcano erupt in Indonesia with thousands told to evacuate, which is wild. This volcano is called the Ruang Volcano and it's had at Least five large interruptions in the last 24 hours alone give you these daily roundups every day.

    "voice_to_text": "Just when you thought flights this year couldn't get any crazier, a former Boeing employee who was giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company was found dead yesterday from a self inflicted wound. You see, John Barnett had worked as a quality manager for Boeing for 32 years, but after he retired in 2017, he embarked on long running legal action against the company, accusing them of many shocking things, but just some include cutting corners and rushing the construction of their planes and deliberately fitting sub standard pots that compromised safety. Have you been watching my channel at all all this year? You know that there are no shortages of faulty Boeing planes right now. Al Jazeera even made a documentary in 2014 where they got a Boeing employee to go undercover and ask his colleagues if they would fly on the planes that they were building. And out of 15 people, 10 said no. A lot of people don't realize that Boeing is not just an aeroplane manufacture. They also sell satellites, rockets and even weapons like missiles and military aircraft. Worldwide they are the 4th largest defense contractor in the world and they are the single largest exporter in the entire USA by dollar value. Protesters even tried to block Boeing facilities supplying weapons to Israel in November. Anyway, engine to side, John accused the company of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out. And then just last Week he gave a full normal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, and he had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday, but when he didn't turn up, inquiries were made and he was subsequently found dead in his truck in his hotel car park. Boeing commented, saying that it was sad and to hear of Mr Barnett's passing.",

During the Great Resignation, employer started paying more because employees had all the leverage. But now, through layoffs and return to office mandates, employers now have that leverage. And 48% had agreed that they lowered pay for certain roles. Back in 2022, the year of a year wage growth was 9.3% and now it is down to 3.6%. This is where some people will say that this is supply and demand and to get over it. But the thing about supply and demand is that it does not take into consideration human emotion. We also need to consider equity theory. Whereas people we feel that the outputs we receive should be equal or more than the inputs we give. So in 2022, wages were higher and remote work was available more. So that was driving down their cost. And then in 2023, we start to see layoffs, wage cuts, return to office mandates. But the work that they were doing did not change. So now this side is dropping while the other side stays exactly the same. And this inequity causes employees to feel incredibly disengaged. Which cost businesses $8.8 trillion a year. So I think is both consumers and employees. Let's just keep in mind the businesses that continue to treat their employees well, even in an employer market.",

Instead of helping humanity with some of this one $96 billion, he's gonna build a house with fire moats. The newest trend for the Uber rich is building underground shelters complete with 50 thousand dollar trap doors. Parking spaces for submarine. Parking spaces for submarines. There's a literal rendering of how it would work in case of an external attack. According to builders of these luxury bunkers. The buying frenzy began after meta founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he was constructing a hundred million dollar bunker in Hawaii. It got really busy and it seems like the phone has attacking him. World War 3 seems to be coming, Ron Hubbard, CEO of Atlas Survival Shelters, told The Hollywood Reporter. Entering show a state of the art medical room, complete with an MRI machine and top of the line equipment. Of course, a state of the art escape tunnel is a must. And so are bulletproof trap doors leading to secret passageways. With the pandemic, top of mine builders have also thought of decontamination rooms. The bunker somehow failed. An apocalypse. Parking spaces for extraction devices like super yachts, helicopters and submarines can also be thoughtfully implemented into the space. Why do they wanna live so bad? Number two, ask yourself who's going to be attacking them? Really answer that question. Who's gonna be attacking them? Us. That's who they are fighting against. Us. The people that they've made their money Off of. And we're all starving and dying. We're gonna attack, right? That's who they're fortifying the shelters from, is us. Do you guys not realize how biblical this is? How this is literally the book of revelation. These people are the faces from the book of revelation. We know how this book ends, don't we? We know this isn't gonna work for them.",

We always knew that he was a racist. It was just that he kind of had to mitigate things a bit. Now he knows he could literally commit a crime, go to, go to jail, get a mug shot. Everything he knows, he could go through all of that and still be. His fan base doesn't care. So you can be full out racist and it's a joke. It doesn't matter. It doesn't. It literally does not matter at this point. It does not matter. So I'm not surprised that Trump, like, we always knew he was a full out racist, but it's not like, oh, my god.

    "voice_to_text": "A Bill that would actually ban some Christian books is working its way through the California State Assembly. Sponsors of Assembly Bill 29 43 actually want to outlaw books that basically teach against homosexuality and gender identity. Save California dot com. Randy Thomas and joins us now for the latest on this legislation. Randy, thanks for joining us. Yes, so tell us more about this Bill. I mean, it sounds like a stretch, even for California. A Bill attacking free speech and freedom of religion. There's 8 homosexual legislators, Democrats, all of them, who are sponsoring this Bill. And AB 29 43 would start by saying, okay, nobody can get counseling to overcome same sex desires. Okay? So no help for adult children, adults who were molested as kids, and now they're adults, and they say, I want help to overcome these feelings. No help for you. But because the. The Bill is actually written in a part of the law that deals with consumer complaints, it actually says no goods or services can be sold, uh, for anything, any practice is very vague, very broad. Anything helping people overcome the same sex desires. So this is a pastor speaking. You pay a ticket to hear him speak. He speaks about overcoming same sex desires. Hey, that's. That could be outlawed. A church sells a book about overcoming same sex desires. Well, there's a sale. It's a transaction that could be banned. So this is very expansive, very tyrannical, and Absolutely. Squashing free speech, religious freedom and basic choice of people. This is an anti freedom, anti American Bill. Do you mind leading us in prayer for god's Kingdom to come and his will be done in California and across our nation? I'd be privileged. Let's pray. Father God, in the strong name of Yeshua Hamashiak, Jesus Christ, we pray to you by the blood of the Lamb. And first of all, Lord, we commit ourselves to vote wisely and vote according to your Scripture. Not vote according to any particular party, but according to your moral values and your word. Second, we pray for legislators, not only in California, but in other states in the United States, that they will be convicted by you to go against this bad agenda. And before true religious freedom and true free speech, to go against the perversity agenda which is harming people and causing a lot of diseases and tyranny against a people of faith. Lord God, we commit ourselves to fight for you and to shine your light and not be afraid of those who would oppose us. We need to be as strong as the Christians of the first and second centuries who would be willing to be tortured and die for the name of Jesus. We are suffering mere opposition. So, Lord, give us the faith and the conviction that we would do what's right in your sight, even when people disagree with us. Amen. Amen. Randy Thomason, Save California! Dot com. Thank you so much for your insights and for your powerful prayer today. Well, thank you. Visit our website, savethe California com for action steps, what you can do even more than what we talked about today. We certainly will. Thank you so much. Bye. Bye.",

The bill being discussed at the hearing, SB199, seeks to allow a person who received gender-affirming care as a minor to sue the medical professional who provided the care. It advanced through this committee and is expected to be presented to the Arkansas Senate in coming weeks.",

I do the one. Never said anything about genitalia. Oh. Everything okay? Tell you I'm not gonna answer that question. That's highly inappropriate. Again, that you can say that and that you're right. Okay, I'll help you treat me as such. I want to start off by saying that was quite upset, um, senator Mckee, that you asked my friend if she had a penis. And I would just like to tell you that even if you have a penis, it doesn't mean that you have honor or that you're a man.",
