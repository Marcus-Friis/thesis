    "voice_to_text": "So I made a video where I said Manchester United winning the FA Cup means that they'll have had a better season than Arsenal finishing in second, because second place isn't a trophy and all that really matters is winning trophies. Luke, a content creator, Spurs fan, stitch that video with some counter arguments to that point of view. And his main points were that there's more nuance in it. And Manchester United having a terrible league campaign, which we did. I'm not demanding that. And Arsenal having a great campaign and pushing for the title all the way was a much better position. That team should be judged on their progression in a league season over the trophies that they win. My point is that if you are a big club, if you're a traditional big six or even a top 10 club now, spending big money, you're doing that because you're trying to win trophies. Oh, of course everyone wants to win the Premier League, but not everyone's gonna do that. There are some major cup competitions that were all part of that you can also go and win. And the biggest in England is the FA Cup. But we can forgive him cause he is a Spurs fan. And I know they don't win many trophies, but they should also be going for these cup competitions, not trying to get a slightly better league position, not trying to aim for the Champions League. Because those moments like On Saturday are what we're in it for. As fans, watching Manchester United lift the FA Cup on Saturday was immense. Was the best feeling ever. And actually, I was stuck at a wedding at that game with a Spurs fan, and he said he wishes that they had a moment like that. So I think people can get stuck in the same point of view as Luke. Looking to just progress in the league a bit further. Let's try and go a bit further in the cup competition, but actually winning things is what we're all trying to progress towards. As Manchester United fan, I've always thought trophies are the only thing that matters. And maybe it's because I'm a Manchester United fan that I think that. But like the debate. And I'm glad you stitched it, mate.",

And I'm not messing when I say this same fella was absolutely screaming at me for taking pictures in my half and half scarf before the match. Like I don't understand if I walked in with a city Jersey or even a city scarf. But it's a half and half scarf for the biggest match of the season. You can clearly see I'm wearing a United Jersey so I don't understand. It's a section full of United fans and all you're trying to do is start fights. Anyway, disappointed I never got to see spades but if you ever fancy coming to Ireland hit me up on my girl for a leg of oil match in a spice bag with the balls."

    "voice_to_text": "Addressing trends at left winger. Because I am not advocating that he plays on the left wing. I just can't believe how much of this stuff is going on social media and I'm here to address it today. He's playing as a left wing back who comes inside with Foden and Bellingham in front. They can interchange. Just watch this. If I'm right footed and I'm playing left wing back, I get the ball in this area. My first touch is here with my right foot. With Trent's right foot, he's able to hit that dive to sack up. He's able to find Bowden with a little reverse ball into the pocket. And then you can drive into his path like that. Then you can dictate the game from there. So people saying left wing, he's not playing left wing, because if he comes inside Foden, we've seen him play left wing for Man City. He can drift outside as a left wing back. I start high, Trent comes in. Yes! With his right foot. It could be there. He's looking that way. Set, set! Max Foden! Max Foden, left wing. Now where's Trent playing? He's not playing left wing, is he? He's able to dictate the play with his stronger right foot. So if Trent has the ball on the left side of the pitch, looking at Curtis Jones with Trent, ability to cut in on his right foot, play the pass, go into the pass. Yes. And as Trent gets the ball with his left foot, able to play this right foot, Curtis Jones continue around there. We've seen Curtis Jones also drift out to the left when he's playing for Liverpool. Then that allows Trent and Maynard and Bellingham and Foden to dictate the game in the middle with Curtis Jones on the left. That freedom, that fluidity. So when I said Curtis Jones on the pyramid and I was being laughed at, his ability is more than capable of pretending to play that and then he'll just do a little spin. He's well capable of doing it. And looking at England's overall ability in the middle, I don't see any other player being able to dictate the game. I'm concerned. And may you would",

It's just bad. They know something, it's just gonna be an absolute low light. For me, it's Michael Bisping. I don't know what it is, but every time I watch, like, a UFC or MMA compilation highlight reel, it's always him on the bad side of things. It's always him getting absolutely killed in the ring, ragdolling. And the thing is, he's not even bad. I mean, you could see he's a champion. He's 30 and 9, too. Like, it's just like his nine losses are so bad, it makes him seem really bad. And then for the longest time, the other one was Baker Mayfield, but that was before he joined the Bucks. Yeah, before that. Every time I watch Baker Mayfield play, uh, it was. It was bad. It was not good. I wanna hear what your guys opinion is, though, and I wanna hear what you say, because there, I swear, there's always that one athlete that you watch, and he's just garbage every single time you turn on the TV to watch him."

Hundred and two points Galatas today. Pure record in Turkish football. It's been incredible. And this is the Galatasta side that wrapped up the league. Some very very familiar names in European football in the Premier League as well. But genuinely the squad itself is actually very good. And this is a Galatasta side without Zaha, without Zia. And when you lose one of your best players in Sasha Bay to buy Munich for a great fee. Don't get me wrong, it was a great transfer for him. Is very difficult. And yet still Galatas and Okanbuluk have kept the level up. And our recruitment has been fantastic. In terms of consistent good value signings that have contributed to the squad, it's been good. And some of the names are not even here. For example Zaha was a free transfer. Zanyola is another one who's currently out on loan to Villa. Does he stay, does he go? I'm not too fuss cause both ways is fantastic. We'll get a good fee or we'll keep him. He's great. And the point is Galatasay that recruitment keeps up and at this level can be a good side in Europe.",

I've seen a more lively atmosphere at a funeral than this. Just watch this. Oh, man. You can spend all the money buying all the new players. You can't buy fans. This is what happens when you grow a club inorganically. Everybody can see you're a fake, plastic club. And the truth is, the Man City don't deserve Pet Guardiola. Just watch this. Thank you, Pep. Thank you very much, everybody. Give it up, Pep Guardiola. And this Real Madrid fans come to a perfectly. When Madrid knocked city out of the Champions League. They know what big clubs really like. They don't deserve this amazing thing. But the supporter, they cannot be like that. They cannot be like that. You give this team to United and you see how excited they will be to see this kind of guys playing every single weekend. They do you realize why they. They. They are not a big team as Real Madrid was. Manchester United as well. Or Bay of the moon. It's a Juventus. Or even Barcelona as well.",

    "voice_to_text": "Now, this might sound a bit dramatic, but I think Kevin De Bruyne is finished at the top, top level of football. I think he's passed his peak now. And this season we are seeing a real change into the guard, where I think Phil Foden's now become Man City's most important attacking player. Yesterday against United, it was god awful and got substitute. It is meant to be city's best player, their main man, their catalyst. It is getting substituted in the biggest game of their season. Other than that, you know, the league games. Near the end of it, in the Champions League final against Inter Milan, it was dog shit and got hooked then because he was injured. He always picks up injuries in big games. Quite weird that, isn't it? I just don't think he has it anymore. He's getting a lot more injuries than he used to. I just think he's over. I don't. I don't think he needs to leave city or go to Saudi like he could be doing this summer, but I don't think he's gonna be at that top, top level ever again. And I think throughout his career is bottle big games. He's been poor in big games. No one ever calls him out on it because he's one of these players that's just protected by his aura and his reputation. It's just one of these players that can stink the gaff up and you'll never hear about it, but It's a Bruno Fernandez, a sacker, a Rashford. The narrative online is very different and within the world of punditry too. And I just think this season when I've seen him play he hasn't really been that great. Yes, he's obviously had some good games still, but whenever push comes to shove in big, big games recently he's been fucking bobbing. And this lad is the one that I've always called upon. And the Manchester Derby's in the title winning games over week as well. He's always the one to drive them forward, he's always a catalyst for him and he's becoming their main man. But I think people just need to realise a bit with Kevin De Bruyne that he's not the big gameplay that people think he is 99% of the time. And this season has been poor and it's not been cold out because no one gives a shit about Manchester City really. No one really cares that much and he's massively overprotected. As is pretty much every one of their players. Very different narrative. Foden was shit yesterday, Harlem was shit, De Bruyne was shit. You see none of that online. Imagine that's Rashford, Bruno or Manu or Anthony or something like that. It'd be fucking well different one. And I just think he's finished at this top level. I don't think he's gonna be set his main man ever again. So maybe take that big contract off from Saudi where he can still get it. To boobies",

It better be, cause I mean, look at the teams in this. Don't get me wrong, there's some teams you recognise, but like Elf Bar, Phil, Jaguar, the new Saints. That sounds like a Pez name for Southampton. Ha ha. Look at this. Look where we are. They like, look what? Look at what you've done. We weren't even in Europe last year. But then when you look at the coefficient point, we've got more than double the next best. This is where we are against Raquel. Cause that's skeptical. Ridgerka. Bran. We got Bran flakes. Fucking Borac. Very nice. Wait. Don't get me wrong, I am looking at these and thinking like, nice. A ways in Greece, even go Napa and play Nicosia in splits. But it's lovely. Expensive, but lovely. It's a lot of fun potential, but you better win it. That should be like, okay, trophy. Done. Trophy in top 4 next season. Especially getting rid of Poch. You made your bed. I'll point in elite gaffer and you're gonna walk with this. Add Audubasi Selge. What is this competition",

And Manchester United win the FA Cup, meaning that Newcastle United will not be playing European football next season. Written in the stars. Honestly, Newcastle United have got to be the most cursed club in the history of world football. How on earth does the best team in the world play that bad? Top, top players like Holland, Ford and debris were absolutely shocking a day. If that was against the Castle, you just know we're getting beat five now. And for Manchester United, don't even get me started. Two of the luckiest goals you will see in your life. And from minute one, by the way, defending to save the life. We even had the Conference League projected potty. I mean we were getting ourselves hyped up in your custody and it's name is literally right there. And it's all for absolutely nothing. We don't have European football next season. I've seen a fair few people say well no, European football actually benefits us cause we can concentrate on the Premier League. Lads, we need Europe. It's a set in stone. The exposure, the commercial reasons and of course can play with youngsters in the tournament and most of all win a trophy. No. European football is also very decisive on the future of two of these players who are arguably two of the best players in the Premier League. Cool as A mug, I think, this day. But they're not gonna be very happy either. At all."

    "voice_to_text": "The largest yacht at this year's Monaco Grand Prix is a 200 million dollar super yacht name faith. It probably cost over a million dollars to bring the boat there for the weekend, but you guys are gonna be shocked who actually owns it. So this is faith. It's a 316 foot boat that rents out for $1.5 million each week. The bedrooms have panoramic views. The interior is amazing with a gym, a pool, and a sauna. But my favorite part is probably the front of the boat, which has a heli pad in a garage for your helicopter when you aren't using it. And then when you store that helicopter away, it actually turns into a basketball court too. But the business behind a yacht like this is even more fascinating. Faith is that boat right there with the dot on it. That's a prime spot in Port Hercules and Monaco, and it probably cost the owner of $100,000 to park there this week. And when you use the general rule of thumb that an owner should expect to spend around 10% of the boat's value annually on operating cost, that includes fuel, crew, salaries, maintenance, insurance, stockage fees, and everything else. He probably spent over $1 million to bring the boat to Monaco this week. So whoever.",

There's an old 80s vibe that's trying to creep back in now of hooliganism and foolishness is another word. Say foolishness. People want to try and recreate this, so we're tough. It's disappointing that it's actually a young person who I would have thought to be a bit more. More informed at how society is moving. Like I wouldn't want my apple cart to be poisoned by one apple as such. Unfortunately as humans we're tribal and as soon as you're with the same type of people that are like you, you. You change. And that always brings out the worst people. In men's football, sometimes people hide behind. Oh, I feel really passionate there for a behave like that nonsense. I think the men's gave me to learn to deal with people quickly. We give too many people chances to fail. We all know the rules, we all know what your credit card say and if you choose to do that, cause that's your prerogative. And then you get. You don't get slapped on the wrist of it, you get a proper ban. Also makes the people around you go Oh, do you remember John who used to sit there? He don't sit there now because he did that.

I actually want Manchester United to win the FA Cup today and I tweeted it and it's getting some backlash by people saying oh United fans were twerking for city so I want city to win and the main one is oh but if city wins it means nothing. How long? Genuinely genuine question how long do we all sit here walking around like this going my if city wins it means nothing? I want city to win cause it means nothing if they win it. What happens once they've broken all of the records in English football? They've been found not guilty of their charges because the state that backs them have put enough pressure on our government that they get away with it and none of their titles get stripped and they are the most successful team in England. Do we all just sit here and continue saying well it means nothing if city win? Cause I do think it means something. And it doesn't just mean that city have won, it means that none of us have won. At what point do we look back and go as United Liverpool Arsenal fans? We look back and go over the last decade, none of us have really won much at all. City of one 0 does it mean something then? I'm so bored of This. And the best example is this right? This guy quoted me, Arsenal fan quoted me after watching United fans twerk so hard for city to win the league. Fuck off, I'm gonna be rooting for city like my life depends on it. A month after he was complaining about the hundred and fifteen charges winning another Premier League title. And this is the problem. We're just going round in circles hating against each other when we should all be having one common enemy, which is the team that's winning things with 115 charges against them. I don't get it. And actually to be honest, most United fans I've met in real life wanted Arsenal to win. This is a massively social media thing with people who aren't from England, let alone Manchester, that don't really care about the rivalry between city and United. Most? Most United fans I met wanted Arsenal to win anyway. I just think it's an absolute shambles.",

Doesn't mean they can't have a good program. If you call a 9 and 3 or 8 and 4 with the occasional 10 and 2 football program a good program. Uh, he would go on to say that if you missed a minute in this sport, you have fell behind. And this guy has missed three years. He is way behind. And here's the hammer. He's not catching up. That's right. Paul 5 bomb has gone about basically firing, uh, Dabo Sweeney within the quote, next two to three years, he says, dabble will not be at Clemson. And this is not only noteworthy because it's Paul 5 bomb saying it. This is noteworthy cause Paul 5 bomb apparently talk to some of his friends that are Clemson boosters. Hmm. I mean, it's. It's funny because. Yeah, I think he lays it out more effectively than most people have. Most people, it's just, oh, well, he doesn't use a transporter, so Dabo's cooked. Whereas he's like, well, this has been a culmination of what has been going on for the previous three years. And now that. That, to me, means over the next three years, like, there's no other option than for Dabo to be gone out of Clemson."

The FAA are alleging that Pacqueta was deliberately booked in top flight matches against Leicester, Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth so that either he and or his friends could profit from bets placed on him being carded.

And Isaac, Stratford Town defender, was given a 10 year ban for basically doing what Poqueta is accused of. Isaac was given a 10 year ban after it was alleged that he was deliberately booked as part of a betting scheme with friends. He did it once and was banned for 10 years for it. Lucas Paqueta has been accused of doing it four times. That's how serious this is. All of those four games, it was specifically the one against Aston Villa that raised alarm bells. He got a booking in that game for going through the back of John Mcginn. It was actually the second time in the game that he went straight through the back of a Villa player. And it was. It was. It looks like he was just clearly trying to get booked. There was no reason for it. And coincidentally, on this tiny little island called paquetta, where he's from, a load of bets had been put on that day. Many punters who bet the maximum stake permitted on the yellow card, which most operators cap at around 200, with some at around 1,000. Um, it's just, it was, you know, they all got flagged. Every alarm bell basically got flagged as. This is odd, the lots of people from the same place are all putting the maximum amount on a new account on Paquette to getting booked. And then he does. And so, look, if he's found guilty, and doing it once is a 10 year ban, what does that mean for him",

Good evening ladies and gentlemen and member of the press. I would just like to make my clear intentions known that I will be standing for Prime Minister and hopefully to bring the football party to power. Now my key pledges in a manifesto. We are gonna make football accessible for everyone. Bring it back to the rest your TV. A scandal surprises, I charge. We're also going to have a far up review into these dodgy owners of football clubs. Get them out. We don't want them ruining football clubs anymore. We also gonna be working with the clubs to reduce prices of tickets. People work hard all week, very difficult to afford. We are also going to build more football pictures so the great British public can enjoy playing this wonderful sport. We are also going to have a overhaul and review of the terrible standard of refereeing and suspend bar until right jokers at FIFA and the FA can get their house in order. And I'm also gonna make a new ministerial post. The minister of Affairs, John Terry will be your new minister of Affairs. Yes, I will. Takes one to know one. I will stop these MPs having affairs. I can sniff an affair out at 100 million miles anyway. I'll be having affairs of all the married Women in power to start with. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I hope I can count on your vote.",

You've watched this guy play max two games in the Europa League. Don't. Don't lie to me, bro. His first goal is unbelievable. He receives the ball and makes the fuck out of that Arsenal reject Shaka, Bro. Makes the fuck out of him, cuts in and shoots the ball. And of course the ball goes bottom right corner. Oh my god, bro, this guy is smooth on the ball and he can shoot. But yo, he can shoot bangers with his left foot too, bro. This third goal was class. This guy right here, I guess his name is SA Sakamaka. I'm not 100% sure. He holds the ball, the defenders drag and shift his way, and in the last moment possible, he passes the ball out to Lookman. Lookman receives the ball, runs at the right back and does a step over, cuts to the left, and with his left foot, his weak foot, he smashes the ball top right corner. Just making sure with his right. He can shoot with his left. He's good at dribbling. Who is this guy? How come I'm now only hearing about this guy? So these are Look, man, stats for this season. Five goals in the Europa League. Obviously you just scored a hat trick, one assist, 11 matches. And then in the Serie A. Look at that. Nine goals, six assists and 29 matches. Pretty good, man. Good stats. But yo, honestly, this guy could be a superstar, bro. I mean, just. Just off of what I watched today, this guy could end up becoming a superstar. And bro, look how cold this picture is. Bro, this is savage. The unbeing run is completely finished. It's done and over. But still, GOTTA give it to Xabi Alonso. I mean, he won the Bundesliga and he won it undefeated. That's crazy. I think he's still a legend, obviously. And this buyer Liverpool team is still a legendary team."

No emotion, no feelings, no nothing. Absolute facts. There was more coverage on Arsenal finishing second than Man City winning their fourth title in a row. Things would have been different if a bigger club have won it. I agree. A bigger club would have done four in a row. It would have made bigger news, more people would have been talking about it, more people would have been giving it. The football world doesn't write rigged success, as you can see it. And I totally agree. Man City broke record. They won a treble last year, they're probably doing a double this year. Four Premier League titles in a row and there's hardly any emotion. Is that because their fanbase just isn't as big as other big clubs? That's what I think, but I also agree with Patrice. Nobody really cares when Man City win it, nobody gives a fuck.",

    "voice_to_text": "I really don't think this Colts offense is going to get the respect they deserve until they go out and hang 30 on Houston week 1. This offense is about to go nuclear and it is so beyond obvious. I don't understand how it's a hot take to say they can win the AFC South. They are closer to being the third best team in the entire AFC than the third best team in the AFC South. We watch this offense walk into Houston last year Week 2 minus JT and drop 28 first half points and still go on to win 31 to twenty. We have yet to see what was the eighth best offense in all of football last year operate with their two best players healthy at the same time. The difference in offensive talent between Gardner, Minshew and Zach Moss to Anthony Richardson and Jonathan Taylor is gargantuan. It cannot be understated how big of a gap there is. The idea that the offense was better under Gardner is so far fetched it's not even worth entertaining. And whoever truly believes that is in for a root awakening in Vegas this year. And there is the ground threat of AR and JT. The predicament created that is trying to simultaneously stop a receiving core of Michael Pitman, Josh Downs, and AD Mitchell is almost inconceivable when all of them are LED by a game caller of Shane Stikens caliber. Like it is just crazy to me. How? By every account, every poll, every odds book, this team is seen as the second or third best team in the division, while the Texans are put on this pedestal despite having been a bad ball from Gardner Mitchell away from losing to this same Colts team that didn't have AR, didn't have AD Mitchell, and didn't have latte. The Texans added Stefan Diggs and Joe Mixon, with all due respect to both, in the year 2024. Their defensive additions were much more important than both of them. This division is going to be a lot closer than almost everyone outside of Indianapolis has it. And if anyone's going to run away with the division, it won't be the team in Houston.",

The funniest part about this off season to me is usually whenever, like, the Bears have drafted a quarterback before people find ways to say that he's gonna be a bust, they go and pull bad highlights of him from college. They point out why he wouldn't make it in the NFL. But the thing with Caleb Williams is the only thing that people say is that A, he either paints his nails or B, he's gonna be toxic in the locker room. Nothing actually football related whatsoever. The only people, like, really shitting on him saying that he's gonna actually be bad are NFC North fans. That's it. The rest of the league actually understands. Like, shit. The Bears actually set themselves up for once and didn't just leave a quarterback out there to die. And I seriously love it. I can't wait for the season to start. Bear down!",

And at first glance you might think that this squad is good enough to win the competition, but then you look at the forwards and you see that he's dropped Marcus Rashford. Same Marcus Rashford, who is arguably England's best player at the last major competition. And it's not just four from over a year ago. England's recent record. They've only won two of their last five games. And guess what? The only other goal scorer apart from Harry Kane in those two games was Marcus Rashford. But that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is that Gareth picked Jack Grealish ahead of Marcus, a man that is known for pulling whales out of the ocean and being one of the lads. Being picked ahead of a man who literally fed his entire country when kids were going starving, and this is how the country want to repay him? Southgate wants to say he's picked players on form, when I've already proven Rashford's England form is better for him. Rashford even has more than double the goals and assists of Grealish this season. Rashford's a better man than I, he still wishes Gareth and the boys the best for the tournament. But I want England to crash and burn out of the competition.",

Coming in fourth, I got Liverpool. I think they're gonna drop off a little bit after losing Irgen Klopp, but I don't think it's gonna be too crazy. There was like a 14 point gap between third and fourth this season, and I think they're still gonna be well within that range to get a Champions League spot. I got Arsenal coming in third, and I actually think they could improve next season, but the club that I got coming in second, I just think is gonna improve more than anybody else because they've been on a tear to close out the season. Shockingly, I got Chelsea coming in second. They finished off the season stronger than anybody thought they were gonna. They were the fourth best team in the Premier League in the second half, and I just think they are going to continue to improve. This season was a learning experience, and next year we're gonna see what they got. Unfortunately, I think 115 Chargers FC Manchester City are gonna win again next season. I could see this being Pepportiola's last season at Manchester City, and I just think they're gonna go out with a bang.

I'd say so because they've win, they're winning trophies as well, they're winning cup tournaments and also broken a dominance of Bayern Munich. Yeah, whereas Arsenal were an amazing team, but they were probably favourites that year. Oh, getting a comment you lot. Is that invincible season for Bayern Munich more impressive than the arsenals? It's gotta be cause they're winning trophies as well as the league and they've toppled by Munich. They wouldn't been favourites. Um, but then again it's a weaker league. But then again it wasn't that strong when Arsenal won it. But that's the difference as well. They've stuck it out in Europe, Cup competitions at home. I mean it's 50 odd games now. Yeah, Arsenal. Yeah, they stayed unbeaten in the league, which obviously they've done as well, but they've gone the whole thing. And they've got the cup final against Kaiser Slowton and the Europa. Yeah, in fairness, they only played 34 games, don't they? In the German league. But they've won 28, drew six, played 34, Arsenal, drew 12, 1 28, drew six, LED accusing. For me. That's incredible what they've done. They deserve a lot more hype. I know a lot of people talking about it. They deserve it. Hey, and we talk about the league. Bayern Munich and Dortmund both in the Champions League semi finals. By the way. Dortmund in the Final? Oh, that's right. Finished third. Stuck that, came second.

But if we come out with the FA Cup, only Liverpool and city have had better seasons than us. Liverpool because they have won the League Cup but qualified for Champions League as well. And city obviously won the league and they're in the Champions League. Does everyone agree with that or do people look at Champions League qualification as a trophy nowadays? I don't, I'm old school, but some people might do. What do you think? And obviously Manchester United still have to go and win the FA Cup, which is a big effort at this point.

    "voice_to_text": "So this clip of Rodri's doing the rounds, uh, yesterday after they won the league, saying Arsenal did an unbelievable season, but the difference was mentality. When they came here, they didn't want to beat us. They just wanted to draw. And this is not the first time Roderick has made this sort of comment. Back when Real Madrid knocked them out of the Champions League, uh, he got bitter with them. I only saw one team. It's worse to try and find an explanation. They scored their only chance. Football doesn't pay attention to Merritt. It's only about putting the ball in the net. We did not expect them to be so. So deep in their setup. Yada, yada, yada. Same thing when Scotland beat Spain. Accused Scotland of playing rubbish football. Very bitter with them. And it's because in Rodri's head, there's only one way to play football. And everyone should play Man City at their own game and should just be completely wide open when they play against Man City or against anyone. And I don't know if that's something that he's Learned from Pep Guardiola or whatever, but there's more than one way to win a football match. And it wasn't a bad mentality to go to the Etihad and try and draw. And by the way, I don't even think we tried to draw. We tried to beat them by setting up defensively and catching them on the counter. A better ball from Leandro Trossard, To find Martinelli there in the 85th minute we probably win the game. If Gabrielle Jesus had made a better times run, I think we'd have probably won the game. So the idea that we just went and completely shut up shop and wanted to draw is wrong. But even if it's right, the draw wasn't what cost us the league. Losing to Aston Villa after it was. If we haven't lost to Aston Villa, that draw would have helped us to win the league. We'd be looking back on it going Man City really should have tried to beat Arsenal at the Etihad. But they didn't cause they played for a nil nil draw. So I just think he's wrong on this.",

    "voice_to_text": "When are you going to admit that our Tetra is not the one to take us to the next level? Not today. I find it remarkable that there are some Arsenal fans that genuinely think our Tetra is not the guy to take us to success. Points tally's under our Tetra, obviously. The season he joined halfway through 56, then it was 61, then it was 69, then it was 84, then it was 89. Progression year on year. I just wanna talk about this for a minute because I think it's interesting that uh, progression is seen as a good thing despite nothing really coming out of it. Because let's first, supporters, we have been bashed over the head with this in the last 10 years minimum, that you've had all this like progression on the Pochettino. You had all that progression but you had nothing to show for it. Cause do we remember the, the, the uh, the piss that got taken out of us for um, being pushed, pushing Chelsea all the way or pushing Leicester all the way to then finish 3rd in a two horse race? Because yeah, this rhetoric is not new. Um, we faced it as well. If you have nothing to show for it, then all it's gonna be is this. Let's circle back to the Pochettino era, um, as Spurs manager, just to show you a comparison. Because quite honestly, I think um, whilst it's admirable to look at this as A positive from Arsenal fans. Um, if there's nothing to show for it and also have a bad season next year, the Arteta era will be seen as a, a worthless and a failure really, because when we compare it to the Pochettino era, slightly different, obviously, but he came in and got his fifth with 64 points. The next four seasons, we didn't finish out of the top four, so we didn't have less than, uh, 70 points for four seasons. And for Spurs, that was huge progression. We got to two League Cup finals and a Champions League final, but we had nothing to show for it. Now, you could say the FA Cup that Arteta won in his first half season was an achievement, but that wasn't really necessarily all about Arteta, was it? Cause. Cause he got the. He got the squad that he inherited. So it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily an Arteta achievement. Whilst it was good, you can't really say that in the Arteta era, uh, it was deemed to success. If he is, is failure next season. And he only, well, won an FA Cup in that half season he started. So my question really is, what is gonna be a success for next season? Personally, I think, um, the way that Arsenal going, there's a good chance that they could win the league. As much as it pains me, I look at the progression and I think as long as they do Well, in the transfer market. And they don't fall off next season like Spurs did. Is every chance that they could win the league. Because they challenge Man City all the way. They didn't bottle the league this season."

Is it because we finished two points behind them? Is it because we took the best team in the world down to the last game of the season? Is it because we dropped five points in 2024? Is it because we've lost one game since January? Is it because Liverpool blew it with eight games remaining even though they had the easiest running? Is it because Tottenham won the league in October only to finish fifth? And by the way fellas, 63 years and counting. Is it because Chelsea spent 80% of the season in 10th? Is it because Manchester United have finished eighth which could mean no European football next season? Calling our Arsenal bottle jobs won't make the clubs that you support any better. And we both know which two teams are gonna be challenging for the title again next season. Cause city and Arsenal by some distance are the two best sides in the league. See you in August fellas.",

I mean, I'm not sure if Arsenal didn't win the league, but still, the West Ham fans were not particularly supportive of Arsenal trying to win the league. Still, fans are, for the third season in a row, uh, proud. We're really proud. We're so proud, lads. You, you, you bottled top four. You bottled the league, and then you lost the league. Like, you seem to be very proud for a team that keeps failing to achieve what it wants. Man City, you're absolutely fantastic. They just stop a team that I actually care about from winning things. It's fantastic. A lot of people say that Arsenal bottled the league. I don't think they bottled the league. Right. They were very, very good this year. Credit where it's due, this game is where I think they lost the league. Paper and a draw at the Seattle is a fantastic result, but in reality, all that happened is that they parked to the bus and played for the draw, and had they won that game, would have won the league. It's not you. From Arteta to think Arsenal could just cruise straight to the title. You've Got to beat the best to be the best. You can't park the bus against the best and expect to win the title."

Because whatever you think about Man City, they've just exploited a gap in the market, that's what they've done. Some say Chelsea are doing it with their mega long contracts. But the Premier League has failed. The Premier League should not be in this position it is in today, where we've got one team turning it into the French league because they're winning every year.

It was the excitement at the moment. It was a chance to go into Wembley, as there was some older people on the pitch as well. So maybe they wanted to go on a pitch because that's something they wanted to do when they was teenagers. Not everyone gets a chance to, uh, do a pitch invasion. So all the people think it was Tim Park. Just think about how they felt at the time, with the excitement and the atmosphere in the crowd. It was a great night.

    "voice_to_text": "Manchester United could win the Premier League on Sunday despite being in eighth place with one game left. Let me explain. To pass Newcastle. It's simple. If you look at the points, all that needs to happen is Newcastle loses, we win, we get 60 points, we pass them. See you later, Newcastle. To pass Chelsea, we would need a higher goal differential, which is 16 point gold differential. So all that needs to happen is Chelsea loses 5 nil, we be bright in 12 nil. Boom. We pass them. See you later, Chelsea. Now here, we're not only gonna pass Spurs, but we're also gonna pass city, because the Premier League is currently investigating son for purposely missing this shot after being bribed by Pep Guardiola. This conversation between them after the game was overheard by a ball boy. And the ball boy says in an interview that Pep said the following Sunday, 1 cash, app or sell. This will eliminate both Man City and Spurs from the title race, making this the new updated table. Now to pass Villa. We all know Article 29 says you can refuse to play Champions League. And we also know that Emory loves the Europa League. He has the most wins in that competition. Plays Europa League instead, he would remove himself from the top four, bringing Manchester United to third place. Now in terms of Liverpool club just came out in an interview reminiscing on the 2022 Champions League final and He says that Courtois had 12 hands and in that final. Now, this could be a racial slur, since we all know the Belgian spider, the Iran, is that the matatas, has 12 legs, which could be a reference to the 12 hand comment. If they confirm claps racist comments, they could deduct up to 20 points for that. And that would bring them to 59 points, bringing Manchester United to second place. Place. Now, how will we pass Arsenal? It's very simple. An article just came out saying an asteroid will hit north London this upcoming Sunday. And if you look at the main area of impact, down below is the exact coordinates of Emirates Stadium. But since the Emirates will be disintegrated, this disqualifies Arsenal, making Manchester United your 2020. Three 24 Premier League title champions. Let's go get it done, boys. This is easy.",

Look, okay, I'm not actually being serious when I say that, okay? Cole Palmer, at the end of the day, is a Manchester City product, okay? I love the guy. He goes by the name of Cole Palmer. I have a lot of respect for Cole Palmer, okay? He won this award, but how is the question when Phil Foden and Erling Haaland are also in the same league? Erling Haaland, top goal scorer, is gonna win back to back Golden Boot and is literally, you know, gonna break another Premier League goal scoring record. But for some reason he missed out on the ward. Phil Foden has had an absolutely amazing season, and I think that Phil Foden is personally gonna win the Premier League player of the year. But why does that mean that he doesn't win the Young Player of the year as well? Surely scoops up both trophies then. You guys need to help me make sense of all of this nonsense, man. For real.",

    "voice_to_text": "Save this video. Remember I said this. From 2026 onwards, USA are gonna dominate international football. Let's have it right. Out of 341 million US citizens, most of them know absolutely jackshit about football, or shall I say soccer. To them, it's slow, repetitive and plain boring. But that is simply because of the American culture. Past generations have traditionally been raised to watch high scoring, fast paced sport with constant action and clear statistical outcomes. But now all of that is changing and it's changing quickly. Since USA's admirable efforts at the 2,014 World Cup in Brazil, there's been a monumental increase in investment for football facility. One of the biggest being the construction of the US Soccer National Training Center in Atlanta, Georgia, which is valued at $200 million. In addition to that, there's been considerable investment in smaller scale facilities all across the country. Companies like WSP Sport have been pivotal in designing and building hundreds of football centers catering to both indoor and outdoor. As of 2,019, football was the most popular team sport amongst children aged six to 12 with nearly three million participants, near enough the exact same as England. The main reason for the rise in participants is of course, the international influence. In recent years, the US has welcomed the handful of superstars to the sport, including the GOAT himself. Think about it. The greatest basketballers of all time, American. The greatest golfer of all time, American. The greatest boxers of all time, American. The greatest swimmer of all time. American wonder kids are starting to spawn out of nowhere. Fourteen year old Kevin Sullivan has already agreed to join Man City in 2,027. Not to mention the biggest and most prestigious tournament on the planet is coming to the States in two years, which will further inspire this generation to take up football rather than the traditional American sports. Americans are dominators, freak athletes and with money, influence and freedom to grow, football supremacy is only a matter of time.",

We got a prop one this time. Pick fitting goal. He's been epic all season. Really, really fantastic. And he's just so good for England. Left back Luke Shaw. I hope he's fit for the euros cause he's our best option. We really don't have many options at left back. First centre back Harry Maguire. I don't care what you say, he's fantastic for England. And he said an underrated season. He's really, really good in tournament football. And then John Stones next to him. World class centre back. Get him in. I hope you fit lad. Right back it's Reece James. I don't care he hasn't played much this season and I don't care that you got sending off recently. He is, when fit, England's best right back. And he is fit. And he has a month to get even fitter, so he's in there. End of discussion. Uh, defensive mid, you're gonna have Declan Rice. Sensational, unbelievable player. Just absolutely incredible. And he's matching perfectly well. Second centre mid Connor Gallagher. We've seen him. What? Fantastically. Kaisado in kind of double pivot. He'll do that with Declan Rice. He's meant for international football and he'll do all the dirty work and running for the rest of the team. Attacking midfielder we have Jude Bellingham. Sensational season. For Real Madrid. And Gallagher will help him just explode up front and hopefully get us a lot of goals in this, um, campaign. Left wing, we got Phil Foden. Phil Foden is gonna be floating around the left wing. Him and Bellingham can switch. Bellingham does play occasionally on the left in throughout his career. Striker, of course, is Harry Kane. He's just gonna be Harry Kane and be fantastic for us. He's gonna have a son and Kane type relationship with our right winger, which is Bakaya Saka. I really hope he steps up this euros. And he's gonna be fantastic if he's just at that elite level that teams win the euros. Hit follow if you watch till the end.",

That's you 6 manager talking about the fact that he does not seem to be happy about the actual ring at all. And he's gonna legit call it off if that is the case. Man, this is absolutely ridiculous. Now, we've been waiting so long for this damn fight to happen, and if they go ahead and cancel it now, what the hell is going on with the boxing world? This is legit a simple thing to just go and resolve and everything should be bang on for tomorrow. But this might be as well. Mind games from you. Sick trying To play with Tyson Fury's head, whatever. Just to make him feel uneasy about the fight. Or he might well just be a fucking pussy and he's obviously not wanting to fight at all. In which case, literally, you might as well just give the belts now over to Fury. What do you guys think? Let me know.",

I mean, yeah, you're approaching the point. And that's literally the point I'm making. If the English Premier League were to adopt a playoff system similar to what American sports leagues have, it could rival the UEFA Champions League for viewership and revenue, but it would go exclusively to English teams. So it would essentially make you by far the most successful soccer league in the entire world. And it would beat all of your competition, making the Premier League similar to what the NBA is currently to basketball. But you guys don't wanna do that. You're scared of actually beating the rest of your competition. But fortunately, Americans don't have that problem. Which is why in the future, the MLS likely will become the one and only top league in the world. Because we're not afraid of setting ourselves up. Be bigger than the UEFA Champions League or the Club World Cup. We could make it to where the MLS essentially functions as the Super Bowl for world soccer. And once that happens, your Premier League, Champions League, everything else just become background noise and most people won't even pay attention to it.",

That's the team Taylor Swift's boyfriend plays on. And the kicker, that's the guy who does a light jog onto the field and kicks the ball. So he gave a commencement at a Catholic college over the weekend, and it is sparking outrage because in it, he goes after women, LGBTQ community, the president, IVF, take your pick. Excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make the sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. Even the NFL. The NFL had to say his remarks were personal. They do not represent us. What has people the most fired up is when he talks about the diabolical lies that women have been told. And what he's likely referring to is the idea that women can have it all and not honor our chosen vocation to be homemakers, to serve our husbands, the gift to be wives and mothers. Because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of You are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world, by the way. I will say, personally, is a gift. I absolutely love it, but I certainly don't think it is my chosen vocation. It wasn't Harrison's mom, who is a known physicist from Emory University. We have not yet heard from Travis Kelsey. I'm guessing we might because he takes a stab at Taylor. We have not yet heard from Patrick Mahomes, who we might, because his wife has certainly become a power woman. My personal thought, I don't know. All those fantastic female stalker stars we've been talking about lately, many of them are free this fall. Maybe they wanna try out to be the new kicker for the Chiefs. Maybe they'll be an opening.",

You don't get a 15 second rest. And that's the first part of the first set. Now, when your 15 second rest is done, you run all the way from the halfway line, down to the goal line, back to the 18 yard line and back to the goal line again. Try get on the 15 seconds.

Speaking of approving, how the fuck did the NFL approve for Netflix to buy the rights to those games? NFL fans now have to pay over $1,000 if they want to watch every game of the season. On top of that, you have to sit through hours of sports betting ads. The NFL absolutely fucked us over. Speaking of fucking someone over, they fucked over the Pittsburgh Steelers with that last 8 game stretch. Facing the Ravens on a Saturday only to get your ass kicked on a Wednesday by the Super Bowl champs is outrageous. Certainly a Christmas treat. The NFL is going to be fucking great this year."

When the only Me Too movement was one woman saying she's ready to have her fourth child and another woman agreeing, ladies, we have them all wrong. He's not a misogynistic man that thinks that women are just baby factories whose only purpose in life is to serve men and their children and wait on them hand and foot. No, he wanted to go back to a better time. But better time for who? When women didn't have the right to vote? When women didn't have bank accounts? When women couldn't buy houses on their own? When women were dependent on men and the only way they would have a decent life is if they married into one? That they couldn't create or establish one on their own. This man really curled his lips to say, when women had more babies than thoughts. Your physicist mother must be so proud. And your wife to think that all she is to you is a quiet baby factory."

I'm just talking factually. It doesn't impact my day to day life. I'm saying it without emotion. Yeah, I don't really care so I'm just talking from a detached point of view. It clearly is bad for English football. They clearly are there because of the money. And when it keeps saying dumb things. Ah, Arsenal Vale spent them in the last year. Yeah yeah, yeah. Okay, but you already had that billion pound squad before the last few years, didn't you? So you only had to add to it slightly. So let's not use these, uh, twisted logic concepts to validate your argument. But yeah, let me just clarify that my butt is not hurt.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is giving me pure joy. I've never been a fan of Wolves all my life until now. I might start supporting if you've not seen. Wolves wanna scrap VR which I'm glad about but majority of Premier League teams are against it and wanna keep it. Obviously like majority of these sides. I got a backbone between them and obviously the Premier League itself are gonna wanna keep their and went like being undermined. So that's probably why a lot of these teams have said no the shit bed because they don't wanna go against Premier League and the almighty gods that be above them. So it's. It's to be expected because of how pathetic majority of these teams are but it's just sad. Wolves argument and the reason is well put together, it's well fought and I agree with all impact on goal celebrations hundred percent. I've been to about 5 games that I've had VR involved. 2 2 with Bowser probably. And you didn't celebrate anything? The joy is just completely taken away from me cause you're waiting for R2D2 to tell you it's been disallowed. The stupid amount of time it takes to make decisions. Completely agree. Over reach of VR's original purpose to correct clear and obvious mistakes. I couldn't agree with that more like VR. It was supposed to be brought in to change very obvious things. Like when Gordon should have got a penalty last night against Man United which they still got Wrong by the way. But that the game over everything that they don't need to and it takes a complete piss. Which then leads to diminishing the accountability on field rest. On field rest might as well not be there. It's pointless. They still get countless things wrong. There's so many apologies to clubs. There were one last night where they gain a blatant decision wrong way. About a minute worth of time and 15 different replays. I feel like wolves especially are just accepting the fact that referees in this country is shit with or without VAR. So what's point? Just get rid of it and go back to what it want because this is just so boring. Bring semi automatic of sides in and scrap VAR. I think that is the the perfect thing. But obviously it won't happen because primarily do what they want and consult no one so.",

Well, this morning I made a video on Rafa Varane and Anthony Martial leaving Manchester United and being completely baffled while I'm watching United content creators make dedication videos for them where they're speaking and saying it's sad to see them go and it's emotional. I, I, I can't understand that. Why? Because neither of them have contributed anywhere near on a level that qualifies. That kind of post for runs on \u00a3340,000 a week in three years is played just over 60 games. Marshall's been at United eight and nine years. What has he done in that time to basically, uh, attract the admiration of Manchester United fans? Nothing. So therefore, in that moment, I'm like, why are people sad about these two leaving? I'd be happy, get them off the wage Bill, create more room for hungry people to come in and take the place. But here Sam the man and another person have got on that video and reference Tiago. What has that got to do with anything? I haven't made a video about Thiago saying it's sad he's leaving, and I haven't seen another Liverpool football content creator do that either. And if you have, by the way, please tag me in it, cause I have something to say. Thiago is a great footballer, but he hasn't contributed anywhere near enough at Liverpool over his time there to justify me saying It's sad that he's leaving. He's on \u00a3250,000 a week. There's been moments where he's been mustered, but way too much as he been injured and way too much as he not been present when Liverpool have been in really good moments, in my opinion. So when Tiago leaves in the summer, I might turn around and go, good luck. But you'll be getting no. Oh, it's sad that he's going. Hmm. If only they see phone. It's as simple as that. We support football clubs where we should recognise people's contribution, effort, desire and presence throughout their time at a club. That's when they deserve that emotional send off. So I don't know where you're going with the Tiago thing, but you're way off. And look, if you want my evidence, I can tag people in and you can look on their page and you can see their little dedications to Marshall and Varane. Can you do the same? If you can, please do it now. Now, look, I appreciate everyone who interacts with me and I like bringing you into the fold, but sometimes, sometimes, just maybe, when I make videos, I might be right on a few of them. Just put that in your mind and ponder it. Have a great day."

And I just have to say this here is the slippery slope of wanting all famous people and entertainers to be local about their political opinions. I think sometimes we forget that the lot of these bitches are kind of dumb. And I just kind of don't wanna hear it. Like, for example, let's dial it back a bit here. You, sir, are a football player. Why am I hearing you speak? And not just speak, but giving an advice speech to a graduating college class? Your job is to get hit in the head or. I'm sorry, you're a kicker. Your job is to show up and kick a ball, like, three times. You get paid millions of dollars to do that. These are the same men who will be telling other people they need to get real jobs, by the way. And listen, Republicans, and I'm gonna hold your hand while I say this. Not everybody needs to have goddamn kids. And look, I'm saying this as a person who loves kids. I wanna have kids in my own someday. Shit, I work at a daycare. Not everybody is cut out for this type of lifestyle. And if you listen closely to that speech that harius butt crack gives, and he's talking about How great kids are and everybody should have them. You can faintly hear a loud ass baby at the back of the auditorium just hooping and hollering, crying, presumably about how fucking stupid this speech is. Not everybody is equipped to deal with this. And even if you wanted to give a good faith speech about how great it is to be a parent, there is a time and place for everything. And that time and place is not at a fucking college graduation. These people did not go to school for four years to learn how to get pounded raw. Sir, you really should have just stood there on your Mark and kick the goddamn ball like you get paid the millions of dollars to do. Cause look at what you done now. Now all these motherfuckers want you out of here. You're gonna show up to your first game in August and they're gonna have Lucy from Charlie Brown waiting on the field for you. Good luck, Mr. Butt crack. By the way, if you have some change to spare, head to my bio and help out my homegirl Salam here. She's trying to get her family out of Gaza.",

Who can replace Harrison Bucker in the NFL after his crazy, misogynist to awful speech? I'm Coach Jackie, and I talk everything woman sports, and we don't talk about the women who play football enough. They're so cool. Option No. 1. Maya Turner. She's a kicker at the university of Manitoba. She's the first woman to score in a regular season U Sports football game. But she score. She kicked a game winning field goal in overtime. And there was just a short documentary about her where her coach said that she's kicking. As far as the guys that have D1 opportunities, we love Maya. Next we have Leilani Armenta, who's the kicker for Jackson State. She's the first woman to kick for an HBCU D1 school. This is her in high school right now. She says she's practicing up to the 46 yard line. And before I get people being like, that's fun to know for the NFL, she's a freshman in college. That's very impressive. Just better cook. Next we've got Mccall Bennett, who kicks for Valdosta State in South Georgia. She is the first woman to ever score points for their football team in the history of their football team. That's just three. Not to mention all the ones who have come before them, all the ones that will keep coming. All the women who play In the Football League. But after the way that he talked about women in this commencement speech, I think the Chiefs could do to look into some permanent changes.",

    "voice_to_text": "The NFL released a statement after Harrison Butt Licker's graduation speech went viral. Jonathan Bean, who is the NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, provided a written statement to People Magazine. Harrison Butt Licker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization. The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger. Making a statement is the least that they could do. I'm curious to see if there's gonna be any other actions taken, because I feel like a lot of shit goes down in the NFL and they just kind of brush it under the rug. Hopefully his contract is not renewed, and if there's enough heat on him, hopefully he'll just bow out. I see a lot of people saying, oh, this is gonna blow over. By the time the season starts, nobody's gonna be talking about this. You do understand now that you don't just have regular NFL fans, now you have Swifties, and they are ruthless. The fact that he referred to Taylor as his teammates girlfriend and quoted her, huh. I'd say god be with him, but I don't care what happens to him."

    "voice_to_text": "I think if you were one of those fans that wanted us to lose, you're just a pathetic plastic fan. And it shows to me that you're not a proper Tottenham Hotspur fan. Amount of pain we have, like, for example, me, as Tottenham fans, are to put up with. And now you're wanting your own team to lose to benefit another team. Like, it doesn't make any fucking sense. So just let me, let me get this right. So you wanted Spurs to win regardless, no matter what, you wanted Spurs to win last night because god forbid. There's a bit of nuance to this. Now, I can understand your position if you're looking at Jamie O'hara and the ridiculousness of ridiculousness of that man. He's got. He's got two brain cells in there, I'm sure of it. Cause he wore a Man City shirt and he was celebrating when Harlan scored. You wanna call those fans brainless, whatever, fine. But if you're talking about the majority of first fans who would rather sacrifice the game last night in order for our local rivals not to be successful, because all this is telling me, man, is that you just don't have enough people close by you, family and friends who are also supporters. Because believe you me, coming from someone who's got friends and family who are staunch Arsenal supporters, if we had gifted Arsenal the league, that would have been 100 times worse. You are not thinking straight, About this, because, like in war, sometimes strategically, you have to sacrifice a boat in order to win the war. And if you don't take the rivalry seriously, then you don't take how important that rivalry is to Spurs and Arsenal fans. You know, it says to me, it says that you live perpetually online and you don't interact with football fans outside of TikTok. Because if you were anything like me, for example, if we had get given Gifted Arsenal the title, my life would have been fucking hell forever. So I get you a bit pissed off because to you, you're looking at it and going, why would you want Spurs to lose? But there is more to it than just wanting Spurs to lose. I did not celebrate the goals. Many people in the stadium did not celebrate the goals. There were a few stragglers, but the majority of people didn't. This was a gut wrenching experience because we were kinda like, we don't wanna give Arsenal the title for a win that probably means nothing. You need to rain it in a little bit, Matt, because it sounds like you just got a black and white perspective on this when it's so much more than that.",

    "voice_to_text": "The first half of Man United versus Newcastle and the first half of Brighton versus Chelsea perfectly illustrates why VAR is not the problem. The morons using it are. First half of Man United versus Newcastle, Amrobat studs down the Achilles of Anthony Gordon Casimiro, comes and wins the ball. But I'm about never wins the ball. That's not even referred to the monitor. VAR looks at that repeatedly, doesn't even refer the VAR to the monitor, no penalty is given. But equally in the Brighton Chelsea game, this initially was given as a penalty. It's a brilliant tackle, absolutely brilliant tackle. Wins the ball, referee gives the penalty, VAR intervenes, sends the referee to the monitor, the decision is overturned. The correct decision is reached, perfectly demonstrating that when VAR, the system is used correctly, the correct decisions are made. The issue we have is we can't rely on the people using the system to get it correct. And so when it comes to voting whether or not to scrap VAR, the answer is scrap the people operating it.",

No. 3 Rodrigo Benzema is the goona. No. 4 City fans are bored of winning the Premier League. They can't even be bothered to celebrate properly anymore. No. 5 Human Song has lost it. Fuck sake. If there's anyone in the world I would back to finish this, it's him. Or it was him. No. 6 Ange Postacoglou has officially discovered just how impossible the Tottenham job really is. The mentality, the culture, the history. You simply cannot succeed. Put yourself in his shoes for a second. A manager who's already under pressure and his so called supporters were desperate to see him and his men embarrassed last night. I feel for it, genuinely. No. 7 Tottenham's mentality is a disgrace. you can see the club's captain laughing with the opposition manager after missing a one on one that ruined his club's chances of playing Champions League football. No.8 Man City are the Bollocks. They just are. They all play for each other. They're machines. They don't ever get tired, they hardly ever make mistakes. They always find a way to win. And you gotta take your hat off and say fair fucking play.",

Not only does she have a degree in chemistry, she has a masters in medical physics, and she works at Emory's Cancer Institute as a physicist in the department of Radiation Oncology. I wonder how she would have felt to hear this speech at either her undergraduate degree or her master's degree ceremony. I wonder if her husband is the type of man who would tell her that she should stay at home and she shouldn't have career aspirations. This woman is literally helping cure people of cancer. I feel like this woman deserves better than her son saying that women should be primarily homemakers and aspire to have children and get married when she clearly focused on her career and focused on her accomplishments throughout her life. We see you, Elizabeth Keller Butker. You've been killing it not only as a wife and a mother, but also as a cancer researcher and physicist.",

Well, you saw that, and it's hard to believe it's true, but it is. That's Kansas City chief kicker Harrison biker dressing college graduates, women in the crowd telling them, you've been fed a lie. That degree you have means nothing. There's only two things that matter in this world. Being an adoring, attentive wife and a mother. Those are the only things that will make you happy. Taking care of your husband and raising those children. And this is the definition of toxic masculinity. This is a terrible, destructive message to women, and once again, unbelievable. That this college invited him to speak to women about to graduate, telling them this college is fed you a lie.

Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world. But I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Holemaker. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. The gentlemen here today, part of what plagues our society is this lie that has been told to you that men are not necessary in the home or in our communities. As Men, we set the tone of the culture, and when that is absent, disorder, dysfunction and chaos set in. This absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the US, and a correlation could be made in their drastically lower violence rates as well. Be unapologetic in your masculinity, fighting against the cultural emasculation of men. Do hard things. Never settle for what is easy. You might have a talent that you don't necessarily enjoy, but if it glorifies god, maybe you should lean into that over something that you might think suits you better. I speak from experience as an introvert who now finds myself as an amateur public speaker and an entrepreneur. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity, and inclusion. I'm certain the reporters at the AP could not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places in people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him right here in a little town in Kansas.",

I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

Let's say that today is your college graduation day, and you are in your cap and gown, and you're sitting there, you're so excited. You're thinking back on all the years and the effort and the studying and the tests and the sacrifices that you have put in to get to this day, to finally receive your degree. And just before they start calling names to hand out degrees, this is the speech that you hear for the ladies present today. Congratulations on an amazing accomplishment. You should be proud of all that you have achieved to this point in your young lives. I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her location as a wife. And as a mother, I'm on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school. What? Converts to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Hole maker. Translation. Hey, ladies. Congratulations on all your hard work. You can come up here and grab your degree, but the kitchen and the man that you're supposed to make a sandwich for is back that way. You've made a bad decision. What was that? And how were people not stopping him? Oh, by the way, he is an NFL kicker. He kicks footballs for a living. Yeah. Would that make you upset, or is it just me?",

That those degrees ain't shit, and they need to just wife up and push babies out. This man is a professional football player. He can afford to have his wife stay at home and not work. Going to a college class and telling them that, really, it was diabolical what was done to you. You've been bamboozled. You shouldn't have gotten this degree. Like, does the college and understand that if you're telling people they shouldn't enroll and they should just wife up, that they're all lose money. And the reason we are seeing birth rates decline is because most people can't afford to fucking live, let alone live on one income. Because most people aren't married to professional football players.",

The thought of beating city to hand Arsenal the title makes me feel physically ill. Ew. And any Arsenal fan saying that small club mentality, get fucked. You would do the exact same. It weren't too many years ago your mob were willing to lose Europa League when something were in the Champions League final. So get fucked. And also. And just annoy me a little bit. I know. He can't come out and say, yeah, we want to lose. Just say he understands the fans, alright? Don't start slating the fans. If you cared that much, we wouldn't have gone for unbeaten and been in this situation where we need city to beat us. Ridiculous. Anyway, ran over. I've gone full Rishi Sunak on the trainers today and they're blistering the fuck out my heels, so that's hurting me. But I've now got going to a full day of work, so catch up at 5 for the match day vlog. You know I mentioned about the blister. Well, these were the only plasters that I could find in Tesco Barbie. Have to do it. Work is done and I am fucking shitting it. If there's ever a day for Tottenham to turn up, you know it's gonna be today. Not the last five games. Not when we went to Stanford Bridge and lost. Not when we went up To Newcastle. Lost. Not when we went to Liverpool. Lost. Not when them fuckers Arsenal came to our turf and we lost. It's gonna be today. You just know it is. And look, I'm only really taking the piss today. I obviously hate seeing Tottenham lose more than anyone, but there's a time and a place. And the time in that we've had is just been shite. I just can't stand Arsenal winning the league. The fans are unbearable. They've overtaken the scalches of being the most unbearable fans in the league. We've made it last for the last time this season. There she is, in all her glory. There's the boys. Alright, lads. Got the teams out. And for ages I've been saying, play Dragacin, move Mickey out on the left. We haven't done it. We've been playing Emma somewhere out there. What does he decide to do today? Exactly that. For the final time this season. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e first 25 we've looked frustratingly good not as frustrating as we've looked good it's just where the fuck was this the last five games first half nil nil even barely scored by this point this is the best I've seen us play in a long time which is so frustrating because where was this fight over the last five games just for Australian it's so toxic for you oh no fuck it's one new city fuck two new city Harlem penalty it's done",

In fact, as a matter of fact, before they got the second goal, Pep almost disappeared. The guy was everywhere. Oh my God. It's an interesting game. It's an interesting game, but I want to ask a question. Son, how did you miss this glorious chance? How did you miss this glorious chance? I am beginning to think spouse sold that game. I'm really beginning to think because I don't understand how a player of this caliber, son, will miss this kind of chance. Anyways, I was. I was thinking the. The kudos to this keeper, man, this keeper was. Was impressive. He had 2 good saves in that game. And anyways, Manchester City is already top of the table and as assistance right now. Assistance right now? They are favorited to win the league. Assistance right now because West Ham doesn't look like that team that can stop Manchester City at This point in time. Manchester City look unstoppable right now. West Ham is in their shambles right now, and they cannot stop this Manchester City team. They cannot. I, I just think man Arsenal should just give it up and hope for nursing. They might win the league. Nursing, but then they should also get ready that other teams will be coming up and that is it.

    "voice_to_text": "I talk about this often with sports parents in youth athletic development. Puberty is the ultimate X factor. It can take athletes that excelled and bring them back to the pack. It can also take athletes that did not have much success at the youth level and take them to the elite status. Because the modern sports parent is completely obsessed with skill building. You'll see these little 6, 7, 8 year old prodigy with perfect throwing mechanics or perfect fielding mechanics or kicking mechanics or fill in the blank. But what happens is when you hit puberty, that's when everything changed. Puberty could be good to you or could really put you behind the path. One of the best youth players I ever played with on the football field. We are 11 years old. He used to completely dominate. I mean 3 4 touchdowns a game because he developed before all of us. But the guy ended up not even starting as a senior in high school. So athletes and parents, be patient. Until puberty hits, you don't know what you have."

It has just been confirmed that Bruno Fernandes wants to leave Manchester United this summer after four and a half years. He even recently, last month, did an interview where he said he's not sure if he will stay at Manchester United after the euros. Bruno Fernandes is considering a summer move after four and a half seasons and Manchester United. And if anything, he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies. This man has single handedly carried Manchester United. Goal contributions, you name it. Most chances created in Europe, breaking Frank Lampard's record twice even shows. Without Bruno, there's no Manchester United. We conceded five goals in two games and lost both of them without scoring any. Without this man, Bruno Fernandes, Crystal Palace and Arsenal is a pure example. No Bruno Fernandes, no Manchester United. And we're gonna need a big replacement. For me, as a Manchester United fan, Bruno Fernandes, if he does leave, I'm gonna be upset. Obviously he's my current favourite player, but he deserves to leave. He deserves trophies.

And then Netflix is coming in for Christmas Day games. Somebody put this all together. $506 for the year, and then you have to add $350 for Sunday ticket. $855 per season.

Yes, he was trying to throw Ronaldo in. Ronaldo? Why are you throwing Ronaldo in? Ronaldo in that he's all scoring records exactly the same as Messi. I mean, no, we talk about Messi, he's talking about to watch. The reason is, is because football now is completely changed. It's less about individual like brilliance, more about teams. I just don't think you'll see the goal. Yeah, cheers, Jeff. It's actually true, so. Cheers, Jeff. Like, I don't know why. You're forcing it too much. You know it, obviously. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, he wasn't as fun to watch as Messi. He's more fun to watch. He was what? What are you talking about? Only cause you used to wank over his materials in hair gel. Oh, Ronaldo, you're so fit! Oh my god! Let's see Messi. Oh, he passed the bottom corner. Or should we see a basket? Yeah, after taking on five players. We get it now. You fancy him. No. That's what you like Ronaldo? No, cause you think he's fit? No, I'd say. Why can't you just. Oh, do you think. Who do you think is better to watch? Uh, Neymar or Ronaldo? Neymar. Okay, fair enough. But then you want a bit Messi, then you get Ronaldo's Better than Messi to watch that you're just about who you like cause you love Neymar as well. Messi doesn't really fit skills. What? He does the same little weird step over thing he does, which Chris took a year to learn. No, it's a weird name. I use a messy user's body as well. He's cooked you there, Chris. Yes, he knows it's true when his name are just rainbow flakes. We don't do rainbow flakes. Oh my god, no. That's crazy. Look at you. You sound like a 13 year old on Twitter. Just a little meek. Do you think about this? Better to watch than that. He's doing skills, man. You think Mbappe is better to watch the Messi? He's way more excited. Mbappe. It's a. It's a. There's a reason I said that. It's just whoever he likes. It's whoever he likes. It's the bell. Oh, let's just film. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's better to watch the Messi. More exciting. Probably, yeah.

    "voice_to_text": "Nicholas Jackson is the flop of the season Hoylands clear Haverst is clear this is all I've been seeing and hearing for most of the season and I just don't get it you've got to start putting respect on Nicholas Jackson after Nicholas Jackson's goal against Nottingham Forest of the weekend that now puts him on 14 Premier League goals in his first season all of which are non penalty goals which for a lot of people that seems to make a difference when you compare him to all the players that are considered clear of Jackson this season let's look at the numbers Jackson cost 32 million and he scored 14 Premier League goals all of which are non penalty goals Haberts 65 million 12 Premier League goals Nunez 85 million 11 Premier League goals and it's not his debut season and he also got Hoyland 72 million for eight Premier League goals when you look at it stats don't lie I yes I watch football with my eyes and he is Jackson is very wasteful in front of goal but as the season's gone on his finishing has got better and his other rounds of play has been great it's been a good standard link up play running the channels being a nuisance in the defence he's finishing which is that last key thing and if he's terrible at finishing now and he's still bagging 14 Premier League goals imagine what he's gonna be like when he's finishing in proves for all the Chelsea fans are still on the fence about Nicholas Jackson Nicholas Jackson has now scored more goals in his debut season for Chelsea than Diddy 8 Drogba did now I remember when we first signed Diddy 8 Drogba and people were having similar conversations oh his link up plays great he holds the ball up well actually to be fair with Robert there was a bit of a moan at the he used to dive a lot and you can see that and he had to really improve on that side of his game and not go down so much cause the guy was built like a fridge right but just for the Chelsea fans are still on the fence Jackson has scored more than our best ever striker in his debut season now that doesn't mean that Jackson is going to be better than drop Ross not what I'm saying okay so don't don't get it twisted all I am saying is Jackson's had a very good return in his debut season and he just can't be considered flop of a season you have to put respect on his name now I'm not gonna sit here and pretend that I'm perfect and say that I haven't said any bad words about Jackson because I'm extremely frustrated with the chances he's missed across this season some of them have been very very vital some of them you can see is just because he's young and inexperienced and he's learning on the job however I think people are way too quick to judge when it comes to players and I may be guilty of that I don't know off the top of my head if there's anything I've made that's a rash decision but I'm sure people will let me know if I have but I just feel like you have to judge someone at the end of the season when the season's done and it's complete and you can look at all the stats and the numbers and actually have a full season to review on all I'm saying is Jackson has had a very good return on his debut season at the young age of 22 his first full season really in professional football like a full season full run out but what do you think do you think Jackson's flop of the season or do you think he's had a very good return let me know in the comments and if you are new around here make sure you hit the follow button"

To have represented a club like this for so much history and tradition has been an absolute honour. So above all else, I'd like to say thank you for making this chapter of my life so memorable. And Midamar's got forward in the middle. Oh, she didn't need it! And Vivian Midamar makes WSL history! In football, you never quite know how long you'll be somewhere. You've got to enjoy each moment as it comes. But early on at Arsenal, I knew that this was the place for me to grow and challenge myself as a player and as a person, too. It didn't take long for me to win my first piece of silver with the club. And the following season, it felt like everything just clicked into place at once. What a goal! Arsenal are going to win the title and they are doing it in style. Playing at Amateur Stadium is something I dreamed of as a young girl, but it's the connection we've created with our supporters that's made it so special. Breaking records along the way. I've never cared much about personal accolades, but being able to help the team and scoring goals in an Arsenal shirt has always been something I'm very proud of. It's another for Midamar, and that is 10 of The best for Arsenal. For Midamar in a good position. Here she is. This time she's played a brilliant pass. Black Stenius for 1 1. She's done it! And take a bow, Vivian Minamar. It's a brilliant assist. What a pass! That is absolutely perfect. She's not even had to break stride. The last two seasons have been tough for me with injury and missing two cup finals. But this is a team sport and we've all got our own roles to play. I've been lucky enough to have the amazing support of my teammates and friends. And out of all my goals are Arsenal. My first one back against Liverpool stands out for that very reason. Freedom arm. I have a pop. Brilliant! We'll be able to meet them all with a moment of quality. It's always been an honor to represent the Arsenal, and it's been a pleasure to play with many talented players, ex teammates and fellow Dutchies. Without all these amazing teammates and of course, you, the fans, my story here wouldn't have been as special as it was. So thank you for everything, Arsenal.",

Tottenham done the deed. They beat Manchester. CEO of West Ham done it themselves. Man City drop points but we lose the league because we couldn't be Everton at home. Wallahi I can see it. This is such an Arsenal thing to do. This will be genuine torch. If that happens, I don't know what I do with myself. I think I change sports. I don't use any more Arsenal fans ever again.

Now that I've somewhat gotten the hang of keepy uppies, I've taken a recommendation in my comments and I'm trying to learn the around the world. From looking at some tutorials I realised that step 1 is the footstool, which I haven't mastered. So this is what I'm trying to do here. This part was actually much harder than I was anticipating and I was trying to just get the hang of what it felt like by placing the football on my foot in the right position as well and then moving up to rolling it onto my foot. It also quickly became clear that having size 4 feet was not an advantage here. There just wasn't that much room on my foot to hold the ball against my shin, so it really was a balancing game at this point. I was then practicing the main part of the around the world and it wasn't actually as bad as I thought to get my foot the whole way around the ball. The real difficulty was catching it again on the other side and not just kicking it off into the middle distance. I'll admit as well, I'm not doing the whole skill here as I've just placed it onto my foot. I figured I'd do the two skills separately and then put them together at the end. This is One of my better attempts, where I got my foot the whole way around, nearly caught it. Not quite. Some of them didn't go quite as well. Of course, I was getting really tired as well by this point. I was really standing on one leg for quite a while. Clearly, I was proud of the one I just attempted. Turns out this requires a lot of mini one leg squats, which was tiring. But to be honest, this went more successfully than I thought it would. As my first day of attempting this skill, I'm absolutely not ready to start integrating it into the juggling itself, but I was at least attempting to link the two together. So here we go. Rolling it onto my foot and then going for the around the world. That might have actually been my best attempt, although I tried again here, and I think this one goes okay as well. Yeah, I was, um. I mean, as long as you ignore the fact I use my hands to catch the ball, it's fine. Next step, of course, will be to try and continue juggling it after I've got my foot the whole way around. Um, but we're not quite there yet. So let me know how you think I did on my first attempt at this. And if there's any other skills that you think I should try and learn or any hints for this one, please let me know in the comments."

Oh, Kai Havertz reborn under Arteta and Jackson, someone that can't finish, just got 14 Premier League goals this season. Stop putting some respect on his name. He's coming and he's doing a job. He's 22 years of age. Um, he's fed up with seeing a criticism and, yeah, he's frustrating and he's gonna miss chances, but he knows where the back of the net is. 14 Premier League goals, the fucking decent return. So I think we should start putting some respect on his name to be. To be perfectly honest. But, I mean, yeah, I'm just. I'm just delighted, mate, you know, that we've managed to win an away game and. Ha ha ha ha! That we've managed to win an away game. It's been a while and we showed some fights and spirits and passion. And we're now level on points of Newcastle in seventh. And we could be going on a fucking European tour next season. You know, the frustrating thing is, right, you know, could have been so much easier for us, you know, four more points today and I don't think we're a million miles behind Spurs, you know, it's those missed opportunities to drop points at Sheffield, the drop points at Burnley. You're thinking, today, Newcastle have drawn. It's a chance to close up two points and then go level on points. And you're looking at us 2 1 down, you're thinking, how many times we not gonna take advantage of our opportunities? But actually, do you know what, mate? We. We did today and now we're level on points. We got two games left. And momentum and confidence is massive in football. And you can just feel that this team has got a never say diatitude about it, as a fight about this team. And that's. That's something that is. Is really good to see.",

We can't have Man United win the FA Cup. That's absolute shit all over us that we need Man City to win it because then Europa League goes to fifth and sixth.

He's clearly the best player in Chelsea's team, but we are still talking about a team that has kinda struggled. If you took Palmer's penalties away from his stats, he'd have 10 goals. That's pretty good. If you added the penalties onto Nicholas Jackson, who people say has failed this season, he'd be on 24 goals. That's the way that it can distort things. Even though there are penalties and that all that, I do still think without Cole Palmer, Chelsea I like. There's nothing there. Brentford bro. Yeah, Brentford. Let's talk Cole Palmer. 21 Premier League goals, first season at Chelsea. Still a very young player so good future prospect. He's dragged a team that's been pretty poor this season. Now maybe they might finish fifth or sixth. Havertz going into a team as good as Arsenal, anyone can score goals up front for them. It's not hard. I mean, hey, Zeus can't do it, so then everyone can! So that you admitting that Kai Havertz is good? I want to pay him a really high compliment here because you know how much I rate Bobby Firmino. I think Kai Havertz is like a target man. Bobby Firmino. He wins every duel up there. It gives Arsenal so much more than just the goals. It's great when you make a signing who doesn't turn up Till January. That's good, isn't it? Do you know what it is? I reckon it comes down to if Arsenal win the league, then it's Chi. What's the recent match Palmer didn't play. Wasn't that Arsenal away? Yeah. Look how poor they were that day. Where's posh? You know, it was good that day. It was good that day. Kai Havers"

I don't even think that's a really good D1 school, but like this just shows you how much like there's a difference between these levels.

Let me tell you, we only lost by five or six, but he had almost forty. And this was just off easy buckets. This wasn't like a take over the game like 35 like, this was just steady buckets. Like he was just giving us buckets. The funniest part about this is this kid gets on a fast break, he's like, mind you, he's 6 8, he's athletic. And we're like alright, he's about to do like some East Bay or something. No, he didn't do that. But he jumped damn near from the free throw line and he punched it.

    "voice_to_text": "First one, F1. Like they just racing. First of all, never ever, ever talk bad about one of the greatest sports on the planet, Formula 1. I know you are not rattled that much that you made two videos on me. Let's see what he has to say. Because when do you see someone walk out of a crash like this? This is Roman Groton and he walked out of fire. Yes. Okay, like what does the man walking out of fire have to do with the sport? I said I like football more and you're here talking about this guy walking out of fire. That's kinda cool I guess. How does that make a better football? In football, Neymar gets tapped, rolls down the whole pitch and has to get carried away on a stretcher. What about the people that break bones? What about people whose hearts have stopped on the football pitch? Cause that's actually happened before. What about them? Hmm. Another point. We do not race around in circle. For example, this is one of my favourite traps. Spa fungus shot. And how is this a circle? Obviously it's not a circle. I was joking. Damn. But you know what I mean. Like a circle is a one sided shape. That shape whatever is also one sided. Therefore circle. Another point. Formula 1 travels around the entire world. From Australia, Spain, America, Canada, Singapore. The only time when football goes around the world is when they're in A World Cup. But they're not only in that one country. You're right. If only like teams from all across like Europe could be in one competition and play to the not the World Cup. And you may be saying, well, that's just Europe. This tournament since South America, Africa and Asia. So I think football may maybe international. I think. I think this is probably one of the best title fights in the modern era. 2021. First of all, don't say title fights. We're not doing UFC. Second of all, you think Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton was a bigger rivalry than these two? I'm telling you now, I'm not even joking. Not even a speck close to these two. This rivalry. Not even close. And yes, in football, you might have the last minute goal, you might have the bit that wins the game in penalties, but they do not get as close as 2021. When Max Verstappen had to overtake Lewis Hamilton to win on the very last lap. You think we're stopping taking over Hamilton is more impressive than the Aguero last minute goal to win the league? One of the most legendary games of football history. You think that's more impressive than the legendary boss who come back against PSG? You think that was crazy? Than Argentina versus France World Cup finals. One of the greatest games I've ever seen in my life. And I'm not even gonna talk about the numbers and the viewership between The two sports? Cause that's not even a question. You made two videos on me. And I hope this is enough to. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Football is better, bro",

Roma are going to put that in the end. And not just that, Roma are going to destroy home when embarrassed by levikusen out of the Europa League. That is not a prediction, that is a spoiler. And you come from delulu land if you don't agree. By levikusen will not do. No miracle come back today. It's over. Shabby. Alonzo's shabby. Your streak is coming to an end. That 48 invincible run that could have been better than arsenals. If they won the whole Europa League. If they won the whole treble. But no, no, It seems like they might only win the double. Or just the Bundesliga that they've won. Roma are not joking about their form. From the minute 0 from the game started, Roma's form has been superb. This ain't gonna be easy for them to come back.",

They bring David Moise in, he saves them from relegation. The next season, I think he finishes them sick. Qualifies them for European football then. Okay. Yeah, alright. He has a little bit of an underwhelming season domestically, but you get some to semi finals. Semi finals. And actually they didn't. I think they finished one spot below in 7th. Semi finals. Away days. Memories. Those fans will never, ever have had. A lot of them in their lifetime. What's he do the next season? What's he do? He follows it up with a European trophy. That trophy is getting a little bit more prestige as the years go on. We understand with the money that's coming to football, the level is, you know, it spreads further down the table. So you do get guys in those European trophies that are decent, decent level. What happens this season? They lose their best player, who, by the way, most people would agree is possibly signing of the season. They're still sat ninth in the league. And let's be honest, that's where they're gonna finish. They're not gonna go lower, they're not gonna get higher. And what have they done this season? Quarter finals against Bayer Leverkus and a team that have gone invincible. And you're sacking him at the end of that? And it makes me ask a question. How could the West Ham fans think it's gonna get. Do you think Lopertaggy is gonna finish higher than David Moyes next season? Do I think if Lopertaggy did four seasons at West Ham, yeah, he would have better numbers in terms of league finishes and where they got to in cup competitions? No, I don't. I don't. I agree completely. I don't think they're gonna be as high as they are this year with Lobotachi. Next season, they're gonna drop off.",

NFL is the one sport where you don't have to play college and you can be a hall of Famer. Antonio Gates A lot of it is strength brutality. Anthony Edwards could play running back or safety. I am certain of it. Young LeBron would be the greatest tight end in NFL history. Westbrook could play in the NFL. I'm not sure the position. Josh Hart I think can be a wide receiver just based on his rebounding this playoffs."

I know, obviously he's not won a trophy, but he's obviously played for England, he's. He's had many more experiences, and he's like one of the best players in the world, he would argue. So I would like. I would prefer that status of being one of the best players in the world. Yeah. Harry Kane. Oh, we're gonna go down. So interesting.

I've loved Jokic, but at this point, it's just getting weird, man. This is what he said about winning the MVP. I don't really think about the MVP award. Like, zero interest. Like, what? Like, bro, just. Just show a bit of happiness. Like, just show a bit. Like, oh, yeah, I'm honored. I, I love being able to help my teammates, like, at least, like, something like that. It all started with this, man. When is The parade? No, I need to go home. I need to see my horses. Like. And this. This post blew up. This is from June 13th, 2023. And ever since, this. Man, it is just. It's just non stop. Just peak nonchalantness from this guy. I can't tell if he's just doing this because people think it's hilarious, and he knows it would get a lot of media coverage. I don't even think he cares about media coverage. I mean, I feel like he made that very obvious. But, like, playing in the NBA and you being so good at playing basketball is the reason you can buy all your horses. It's the reason you can support your family, it's the reason you can fly back to Serbia. So I feel like it's not asking for a lot to show a little bit of gratitude to the game, but I don't know. I love Jokic. I love the way he plays. I love the Nuggets. I just think this is a bit weird. Please let me know if I'm the only one who thinks like this, because I. I really hope I'm not.",

In gold, there's plenty of options, but I'm gonna take Pickford here. He second in the race for the Golden Glove behind David Raya, which is pretty good considering where Everton are in the table. Full backs I'm gonna use my Spurs pick here and put Pedro Porro right back. And we're staying in London for the next one. Fulham's Anthony Robinson is my left back. Completing the back four, Virgil van Dijk has to get one of these spots. He's been pretty much back to his best this season and will be so key to Liverpool's transition to Arnie slot in the summer partnering him. This one was tricky, but I'm giving it to Sinesi from Bournemouth. The midfield of this team is so, so strong and I'm starting with Rodri. I could have used my Man City pick to select Foden or Harlan, but this guy is by far the most important player for me. Next to him is probably the signing of the season, it's Deckham Rice. If Arsenal can win the title in the next few weeks, a lot of that will be down to the difference he's made. Completing the midfield there might be a little bit of recency bias here, but I'm giving it to as a right wing slot. Was only ever gonna go To one player, and that's Cole Palmer. 30 goal involvements in the Premier League this season. We all knew he was good, but no one expected this level of output down the middle. I've kept my Aston Villa pick for now to select Ollie Watkins and to finish the squad. He surely gotta go to the euros this summer. It's Anthony Gordon."

Facts are all out there and their owners are getting scared what's coming. This is Red Army. I'll be talking on my podcast about the season desist letter, and I'll have the letter for you on the podcast on Tuesday. So for anybody's interested in that, Tuesday's podcast, uh, normally would be tomorrow, but it's bank holiday. So I'll have the letter. I'll, I'll, I'll, you know, I'm not scared. And at the end of the day, if it's the end of. That's football, it's the end of. That's football. But I will read the letter out and I will tell you what, it's all. So what is the cease and desist letter? Well, basically ceases, stop, desist, don't do it again. So it's a. It's a warning shot from Manchester City saying, stop doing this and don't do it again. And this is now where I'm gonna speculate in terms of what that means. Now, I would assume they've basically found moments where Mark Goldbridge has gone beyond talking about hundred and fifteen charges and assumed guilt. Everyone is completely entitled to say, there are a hundred and fifteen charges against Man City. What you can't do is assume that they are guilty of those hundred and fifteen charges. You can't say that they pay rest you Can't say they're corrupt. And I would assume they found instances where Mark Goldbridge does that. Now, someone a few days ago said that he'd been sent a cease and desist, and he quoted it with 115. Right, you can say 115. Um, what will he have to do? I would imagine he'll have to take down videos where he says that and not do it again. I would be highly surprised if the vast football channel would just have to disappear completely. But in terms of Man City's lawyers doing that, I mean, you know, silencing people, does that assume. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how I feel about going out in silence. In silence in the critics, but, um. Look, Mark Goldbridge is the biggest creator, and the fact that they've hit him with a cease and desist is pretty scary.",

When the first time you saw him, did you think, wow, this kid special? No, not. Not in training, not until, I think he played left wing or right wing in a game. One of us had a Mids. I think it will happen at Stoke. I think it was a cock and in law. He's having a bit of a beast. So he got dragged off at half time and he put in Golo and sent a mid. And if not second half, everyone was like, oh my God, uh, who's this? So. So when he came to the club, he wasn't bought as a midfielder? No, he was bought as a midfielder, but after that of a game he put him on. Oh, I see. Right. Yeah, he just happened. He just pushed him out, thinking he's probably too small to be, you know, playing in the centre mid in the Premier League. He went into centre mid and it was like he found his home. It was this. I've never seen anyone win the ball back so consistently and so well ever in world football. He. He is an absolute phenomenon. Hmm. Is he quiet? He's quiet, yeah. Unassuming, very shy. What cars he drive? Yeah, he's got a mini honey. Ha ha. But you know what I Love about it. That probably looks massive to him. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You know what I love about him? Obviously, you would have seen him, obviously, with more trophies with Chelsea and obviously France. And he's too. He doesn't even wanna hold the trophy. Doesn't. It's like he gets shy, like he's scared to, you know, mess it up. Isn't the World Cup someone to push him at the front? Take on. You've won it, go and hold the World Cup. Why is he like that? It's just who he is. And, you know, I love him, you know? Sure. Obviously Lester fans love him. Chelsea fans love him. So many is. Is one of the greatest ever, right in that position. He's the best ball. Is the best ball winning midfielder I've ever seen. Yeah.",

And see his terrible decision making. Like on this play where he just threw the ball up into double coverage even though there was no pass rush and he had a wide open man in the flat on first and goal. Everyone talks about his arm and his crazy deep ball, but he only throws it long when his receiver is wide open, while when bro sees tight coverage he often short arms it. Which is why you see his receivers come back to the ball on a bunch of his touchdowns. And this also results in a ton of interceptions which will only get worse in the NFL. There are way too many times where bro has completely clean pocket and Caleb just starts seeing goes and throws the ball for no reason. While he is horrible at reading the middle of the field on short to intermediate throws like this, he has terrible footwork inside the pocket which results in a bunch of Aaron throws while outside the pocket he almost never sets his feet when he is thrown down field, so he has a ton of inaccurate passes like this that get intercepted. He makes early career Josh Allen like decisions when he gets just throwing balls up there on the run. They get picked off every time. And he Has straight up horrible pocket awareness so he got hit all the time on throws, while he also had terrible ball security every time he got touched by a college defender. So he could easily have 20 fumbles this year behind the Bears offensive line.",

That's an argument. Agree? Yeah, how the. How can you. Yeah, exactly. At least. At least we all agree. Yeah, blow me. I mean, yes, Jamie Vardy's won a Premier League, but I mean come on, that's not even. That's not even a comparison. At the end of the day it's only a trophy thing. Cause if we're talking like that we were the same. Minamino's better than Gerrard cause he's won a Prem. You know what I mean? It's not. It's not a logic haha. That's the worst comparison. No no, Minamino. Minamino. You compare two different positions. No no, what I'm saying is Minamino has won the Premier League, right? Yeah, Gerald hasn't. And by the logic of Varley's won it and Kane hasn't, Varley's better. That would mean Minamino. Yeah but Varley scored over like 200 goals. Yeah I know, but by the logic of Troy, I give up.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think United should bring Ollie back. I genuinely do. That's where I'm at right now. We have never, and I'm gonna talk about Ollie's time at United. We've never had a manager be that close to making us be great or show anything through sustain period of time like we had under him. And I just wanna feel something again. I just wanna see attacking football. I wanna see our team score goals, be solid at the back, be in the Champions League places, be challenging Pep City side. Not challenging them, but being at least in the next best. The best of the red. It's time at the club until it went south, was better than any other managers we've had by a distance. I mean just look at this. This is a created and allowed fret from Man United in last like 4 5 seasons or so. The yellows are created fret, the purple ones are allowed fret. Look at that at 10 arc. Look at Ollie's for the two seasons that he's at the at at the club. Second most wins, fewest losses, second most goals scored, second fewest goals conceded, second most points. In the 18 month spell at United when it was going well and the only team we were second to was pepcity side. Every team in the Premier League before and since the past six or seven years has been second to pretty much every part of every single season he played. Good football. He had the fans on side. He had people loving the club and enjoying going to games again, being proud to support Manchester United. And he wasn't trusted. He wasn't interested with the budget that Erich Andersen had, or interested with signing the players that he wanted to sign, because the vast majority of the players that he signed personally were great for us. And he had this fantastic talent idea. He had Kira Mckenna, he had Michael Carrick at the club as coaches who were now some of the best coaches in the championship. And Mckenna's getting sought after for their Brighton job about two years later. And I know this is fucking bad, I know this is how bad it's got the club, where I'm asking for a little comeback, because when managers come back to the club, that usually almost never work. But I honestly reckon if we kept only in that job, giving the money you wanted, sign the players that you wanted, kept the coaches on board, we'd be challenging for the title, up there with city and Arsenal now, and might even have won it this season. And I think over then, if you're getting maybe a Thomas Tuchel, who's a guaranteed serial winner, still at the peak of his powers, Ollie is the best man to bring in. He's genuinely the next best option for me.",

They beat my new home and away this season for Ross Clark. No, but let's talk about the elephant in the room. Blood Casimiro blood boss man Casimiro. A absolutely atrocious performance. Blood Casimiro was awful. Casimiro. There I say it is. Finished. MLS, Saudi league, whatever league. Bro. This guy is finished at the top level. Bro. The only way he stays at United you must just use him as like a. As a striker. Literally bring him on as a striker cause to to his defense he was the only threat going forward from set pieces he got his head on everything. Had two goals this allowed but um defensively the has no legs. I mean the way he kept losing possession, the way the um, Olesi or Ezi would just skip him past him like he weren't there was absolute, absolutely ridiculous man. And as in Alicia. These boys man. Probably the two most exciting duo on the wing. Blood in the Premier League. These like two mates in a park. Just having a laugh mate. Literally. These man will just. Just cook in United blood, you understand? Even Jean Philippe my tattoo up front. These guys had a underrated season as a striker. The numbers are very good I think. What's that 13 or 14 league goals? Bro ez and Olese they remind me Of like, um, two guys in NBA terms, the Celtics, they've got, um, Jaylen Brown and they got Jason Tatum. Like, sometimes Tatum is seen as like, the best player in the team, but brown is just behind him. And at times brown looks like the best in the team. And that's what I think of when I watch Elise and, um. And as a man, like I said, at times one looks like the best, at times the other looks like the best. But one thing is, both of them cook together, man. And. And love to see a man united on the other hand, man. I mean, there's no point even going through the team. Obviously Bruno Fernandes, um, missed out today, wasn't in the squad looking for injury. And then they had. They got. They got injuries all over the defense, bro. Obviously, even Maguire is not there. He's injured as well. You're playing with literally two old, finished center backs. You got no chance of winning games. But you understand? But yeah, man. In the middle as well, you got Eriksen, he's got no legs. Kobe Maynard now is just. The hype has kinda died down. Hasn't. Hasn't performed in the last few games for United. Got natural, did nothing. Hoyland again, ghosted, um, Anthony did nothing. Literally all round poor. Um. 10 hog. This. This guy's got a lot of issues to deal with, man. You understand this guy? I mean, it's not looking good. For him, his resume at United looks quite awful. Blood last year, that trophy, the Carabao Cup, you know, gave him a little leeway. But this season, I know there's injuries and everything, but it's a manager that looks like he's lost to change room as well, man"

Even though I like Bruno, I'll definitely start Bruno, but I'd give it a watch today how midfield plays and how mount plays. He'll probably stick to that midfield position like all the other kinda attacking midfielders in the league. But Bruno already does that because obviously, I don't know, he's trying to help the team. Obviously he does help us 100%. But watch on midfield today. I generally think mount will bring more of a balance to midfield and it'll be more structured, but we'll see.",

The greatest coach of all time and the greatest football player of all time. And people took shots at them for three and a half hours. But I did think there's been a lot of tension around Bella. Check. And Brady. And there's just tension all around the room. And you throw craft in there. I thought some of it was broken last night. A little bit lightened up last night. And I get it.

I could not care less about the top of this division. It's not exciting at all. Whenever you see like, even a goal at one competition from it ten years ago. We're not even going that far back. People's going screamers constantly, people doing stupid tricks all over the place. This now is like watching chess. A thousand passes a game, side to side. I've not seen a winger take the man on. I feel like in years. Is so, so boring. Like, I generally struggle to stay awake sometimes watching the top level teams in this league. It, it, it's crap. Title race don't exist. It's boring. The three teams that all went up are all coming straight back down. They're all crap. The only reason four from bottom stayed up is because they've cheated. They spent 300 million quid in two years. You know that the three teams that are gonna get promoted this season are probably all gonna come back down again. You know that the teams at top of this league are gonna be same next year. I am lost. The, I only Watch these games because I have to. If Hull versus Watford run at same time as West Ham manual I'll be watching. All for just for entertainment value.

Because we had a squad of it, 15 players. Nobody got injured because we're scared. Because if you got injured, you went on Monday. So listen, I've got a better sort of ankle candy train, right?

Whatever injury you had, and if it wasn't happy with injury, you go doing at night, you send you doing at night, 7:00 and it's snowing. You got your Sonny Walkman on your thing and you're freezing cause the waves are coming in past your knees. Missy Strachan's in defeat 1, 2, 7.

In that video I said Santo completed 13 dribbles against PSG, but Messi had previously completed 16 dribbles against Man United since 2,008. This one said Neymar complete more dribble 15. This one now said I beg it's Ronaldo 20 in a game according to according to L. Dominico. You know that these ones are the ones the algebra love brainwashed. You know the way they use brush and split to clean foam panel? That is the same way algebra love use brush and split and clean this one's brain panel. I don't know which match Ronaldo completed the 20 trivals. I don't know who counted it. Was it you or was it Bajibala? And in which match against who? Was it against Mamelodi Sandam? Or was it against Ramo FC? But tell us now! Or was it against or was it against Falcons? Hello! So let us know my fellow Ronaldo fans, when it comes to scoring goals, all type of goals, goal starts and goals records, types of goals, head at goal, shots, uh, flying goals, jumping goals, swimming goals. Yes, bring Ronaldo into it hundred percent. He will dominate when it comes to playmaking, dribbles, passes, touches, ball control. Please leave Cristiano Ronaldo out of that conversation. Please. If not, you will only be setting him up for A mockery. Think about it. Alright, Goodnight.",

Both in the draft. A double dipping early rounds. Troy Fou Tanu, who's a tackle, slash guard. Zach Frazier, the center. You've heard me praise this draft pick, but this has been a work in progress for a few years now. The approach they take into the offensive line, recognizing that that's what's really key to their rushing success. They both success for me.",

Summer's world class. Jordan was saying that he feel like he's overrated and I think one of the things he pointed out was that he's died. I, I don't think he's as good as people make him out to be. I do think he's a diver. Name me one top player that hasn't died for a free kick or penalty. So that narrative is, for me, it, it don't make no sense. Listen, I know there's no debate on his goal scoring, but they said in big games they don't see him. So for me, is probably one of the definition of big game players. As in his stats and goals change games. So for me, and um, it may be, I may be biased because I'm a local supporter and it's maybe a bit dramatic that I've got salary in the background, but I think he redefined the wide forward. I mean, what do you want from a wide player? He scores goals, he dribbles, he's strong, you know what I'm saying? He assists. I don't understand that. I think at this time at Liverpool he would have been able to get into any team in the world. For me, ain't that the definition of world class",

Um, you can make the case JJ McCarthy as a top 10 quarterback could be in the best situation a rookie quarterbacks walked into when it comes to. He has the best receiver in football, arguably. He's got a really good No. 2 receiver. He's got a top. Probably six or eight tight end. They've got a top 10 offensive line. Aaron Jones is one of the best dual threat backs in the league. But then the next level, and really a separator for me is Kevin O'connell as the play caller in the scheme that he runs, this scheme that comes from college. And Mike Shanahan, Gary Kubak always elevates quarterbacks. They always play better, maybe than their physical talent should allow them to. And then you have a. One of the better play callers in the NFL. So I just think that the situation that JJ walks into, you know, I've said I. He would be and Caleb are neck and neck for front runners for Offensive Rookie of the year right now. As far as who would place your. You would place your bets on, I think Caleb walks into a fantastic situation. But as far as the quarterback and just strictly the offense, the one that JJ walks into is one of the best for a top 10 guy that I could remember."

Cogley was doing a pre match press conference for the next game that Tottenham have against Chelsea tonight and he is still being asked about Ben White's antics in that game. You've got articles in the times asking are Ben White set piece antics legal? How the team stop him? This by the way, in the very same game was Vicario at the end of the game trying to do exactly the same to David Rayer and David Rayer just pushed him out of the way. So this isn't just a Ben White thing, it's an incredibly normal thing that happens in pretty much every game. And I don't know about you, but I don't remember this goal being spoken about when Ramsdale was literally pinned to his line and the ball went in. At this point, by the way, Ramsdale's literally being held and obstructed from getting the ball. Ben White is nowhere near the car. About time the ball goes in. And I don't remember when we got knocked out the Carabao Cup this year when Ramsdale shirt was being pulled like that as the ball came in. I don't remember anyone asking if that was illegal. I remember when we lost to Brentford on their first game in the Premier League and Leno was being pinned down like this when the ball came In I. I don't remember if anyone was asking if it was legal then. It's just a bit odd, the hyperfixation. And it's now Thursday. Get over it.",

After leaving Dortmund in 2021, Sancho should have went back to Menzie. Hear me out for a second. I know you're gonna say, oh, he probably left on bad terms or whatever, but let's just forget all of that for a second. Strictly as a footballer and the team that suits him the most. Bro is Manchester City. When you talk about little combinations between the players, him linking up with Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, KDB. That is Sancho's game, bro. Them quick combinations between his teammates, that's what Santo loves. We've already seen his link up with Harlan Ozaw. We already see what these two on the same team. Bro is cash money the role that Jack Greedish has been given at Manchester City? Hug that touchline, beat your man, but also combine with your teammates. Get balls into the box to Holland. That is perfect for central bro. He's much better 1 v 1 player than Grealish as well. Moving to Grealish now and he should have joined Manchester United. Now hear me out guys. Grealish at Aston Villa. This is a guy that had freedom, bro. Could roam anywhere on the pitch and a manager wouldn't say anything to him. Fast forward to see now. And he just has to hug the wing. And for Me, bro, that's. That's not his game. But if he was at no rules United, Manchester United. Listen, these. But have no structure. He would cook in that cell. Don't forget, this guy is a bull carrier, bro. This guy is a bull carrier. Ha! And imagine him on the old traffic pitch, just baiting players to come into him. And then the players get drawn in, slipping in. Bruno hits it from outside the box or even feeds in. Rashford. Listen, I'm telling you guys, the vision."

This is so impressive. You know, those of you that are not Ronaldo fans, I don't know how you enjoy football. I don't know. But then, Cristiano Ronaldo has taken Anassa to the finals.

Favorite Number One get Sub of in the UCL semifinal in the seventy Third Minute, Favorit Nummer two literally Ghosting the Whole UCL Season and Do Not be full by those two Goals against Barcelona and Favorit Nummer three will er even worse Ghosting Performance against Real Madrid. I remember Messi getting fifth in die Ballon d'Or Voting because he didn't Play good World Cup Heil having the most Goals, Most Assist in Europe and having One the Double and now das is enough to Score two or three tempens to win the Ballon d'Or. I'm being serious huch des 1. Ballon d'Or WHO should Win It with this that's Five years ago he wouldn't have been in the Top Ten of the Ballon d'Or and now it's enough to win It. remember two thousand fifteen Griezmann having twenty two Lee Golds which wasn in half of Messis Golds was behind Ronaldo. I mean how crazy war These Times and this Season no One has even Scott twenty Goals. this Generation is in my Opinion Not even half as good as the previous One Like Modric, Iniesta, chavi, Messi and Ronaldo of course.",

One million quidditch cost Leicester and goal contribution every other game. Won the championship with them 10 years ago which is mental. And he's still there now scoring goals to send them up once again. It's ridiculous. It's absolutely mental for a 37 year old who rely on his pace massively. It's mental that you still be able to do this even in the second tier of English football. And it's got to be looked upon of that as an icon of the English game at least surely. And everything that is achieved, winning the Premier League will. Leicester PFA Player of the Year, Premier League Golden Boot and going down unless they're coming straight back up again. And the level of loyalty showed them when he could have moved to Arsenal, could have gone away, could have got a loads of other clubs. Just fucking sick to say cause you don't really see many players like that in today's game. And I mean just how he is as well. If you've not seen it, go and watch your second goal against Preston yesterday. To get his brace two yards out and literally twats it over the line like he's hitting it from 40 yards out. Is it shit house? Is it? Likable bloke. He's also got The streak for the most goals scored inconsecutively in Premier League games when he got 11 and broke Rude Van Nistelroy's record that stood for like 10, 15 years at that point as well. Just a proper throwback, a shithouse, quick loyalty that you show into his club as well. And I'm glad that he's coming back up to the Premier League with less than next season for potentially his last one ever, and he's spending it in a Premier League because he really deserves it.",

I would love to, like, watch a game and commentate it from my perspective of what the quarterbacks is looking for so everybody sees. I would be so interested to see how Tom Brady commentates. That'd be something interesting. But Tony Romo, all those things that he says on TV, Watch for the run, watch for, oh, they're definitely running right now. That's the typical one high, two high check. Like, too high. The box is not as loaded as a one high look. So of course, the easy check is, hey, kill, I'm checking into a run. We got numbers. But some of the things that he does a great job with commentating and giving a understanding, a watered down understanding of the game. And I would love to do it on my terms.

Up of the season. We haven't really had any bad signings from last summer, so I am gonna say Cody Gakpo. Showed a lot of promise towards the end of last season and he's been really poor this season for me. Most improved player Joe Gomez. He's had a really good season. I think. Um. His versatility, especially his caiman. Clutch filling in for injured players throughout the season. Unsung hero Harvey Elliot. I think he's had a good season, especially the impact he's made coming off the bench. And signing of the season is Alexis Mcallister.",

And I disagree with that. I, I disagree with that. Um, Cristiano left Real Madrid and they went on to win A U C L. And made 2 semi finals, right? Without him, he went to Juve. He couldn't even play in a semifiner. He went to Manuel, played in Europa, now he's in Saudi league, you know, bottled every trophy on offer. But one man, here's this man, Tony Cruz, he is the difference. He is the one that brought the 3 P T U C L. To Madrid, and he continues to deliver both domestically as well as, um, in Europe. So for all of those who think Cristiano Ronaldo carried Real Madrid, this is the guy that carried Real Madrid, and he continues to do so, right? All of those passes that he was giving for Pendu to score those goals, similar to what he did for Vini last night, right? Penalto was just at the end of those. Of finishing those goals. That's it. But all the work was done by this man. Modric, Benzema and Bale. Cristiano was just there, you know, to, to, to finish the, you know, at the finishing touches and score the goals.

Messi   scored   497   goals   after   playing   Laliga   for   18   seasons Note that, 18 seasons.   that   18   seasons Cristiano Ronaldo played for just nine seasons   Ronaldo   played   for   just   nine   seasons and he scored 311 goals in 291 appearances.   he   scored   311   goals   in   291   appearances Who has a better goals to give ratio?   has   a   better   goals   to   give   ratio Meaning Cristiano Ronaldo   Cristiano   Ronaldo has played almost 200 more games than Cristiano Ronaldo in La Liga.   played   almost   200   more   games   than   Cristiano   Ronaldo   in   La Liga That's why he was able to score more than Cristiano Ronaldo.   why   he   was   able   to   score   more   than   Cristiano   Ronaldo Think about it. Some of you people like Manos,   about   it   Some   of   you   people   like   Manos but I don't know what you guys find so intriguing about the guy,   I   don't   know   what   you   guys   find   so   intriguing   about   the   guy because those are people who just come   those   are   people   who   just   come and they speak with a very low tune   they   speak   with   a   very   low   tune and they expect you to just believe everything they tell you.   they   expect   you   to   just   believe   everything   they   tell   you when this year's football content creators tell you something,   this   year's   football   content   creators   tell   you   something make sure you just do a little bit research on your own and find out.   sure   you   just   do   a   little   bit   research   on   your   own   and   find   out Yes, because Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest goal scorer,   because   Cristiano   Ronaldo   is   the   greatest   goal   scorer but he played 100 more games than Lionel Messi.   he   played   100   more   games   than   Lionel   Messi Lionel Messi has played over 200 more games than Cristiano Ronaldo   Messi   has   played   over   200   more   games   than   Cristiano   Ronaldo in La Liga. But yet,   La Liga   But   yet so just imagine if Cristiano Ronaldo also plays 520 games   just   imagine   if   Cristiano   Ronaldo   also   plays   520   games like Ronaldo Messi in La Liga,   Ronaldo   Messi   in   La Liga Ronaldo would have scored by now at least 800 goals and that's a fact.   would   have   scored   by   now   at   least   800   goals   and   that's   a   fact That's a fact. You would have scored at least 800.   a   fact   You   would   have   scored   at   least   800 So who is the better goal scorer in La Liga?   who   is   the   better   goal   scorer   in   La Liga It's definitely Cristiano Ronaldo   definitely   Cristiano   Ronaldo because his goals out outperform his number of games.   his   goals   out   outperform   his   number   of   games He played 292 games and scored 311 goals.   played   292   games   and   scored   311   goals Your name is.

Yeah, you man used to be gods. He used to instill fear in our opponents and in our players. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah. Wow. We don't have that anymore. Wow, bro. Ah, brother, down my hair. Rashford's fucking as well. At least he didn't sign off the pitch. Cause he's doing nothing on the pitch. He's not. A season. The only save it. The only two bangers he scored.

    "voice_to_text": "How can a player with this much talent be on the verge of falling out of football all together? That is the curious case of Tongai and Dumbale. A player who was once heralded as the future of Francis midfield is now stinking up in Turkey in what should be his prime years. Dumbledore's talent is undeniable. He turned heads at Leon with his dazzling close control and dribbling ability. Then partner that with impressive upper body strength and remarkable vision and you've got the blueprints to a truly special midfielder. Spurs recognised this potential and in 2019 they parted with a club record \u20ac62 million to bring and dumbbelle to London, seeing him as the long term successor to fan favourite Musa Dembele. And still gets it back on dumbbelle. How's that for a way of making your Mark on your debut? But now, five years and three loan moves later, it looks like they won't be getting any return on their investment. That is simply incredible. Tonky on Dembele with a moment of inspiration. So where did it all go wrong? Well, there's always been questions surrounding Tang Guy's commitment to football. He was released from Ganggump at age 17 due to weight and fitness related issues. And although it looked for a few years as if he had put these problems behind him, it's always been a concern he struggles with injuries throughout his career often point back to his lack of dedication and desire to get fit. And play. And now fans have rightfully been expressing concerns for Ndombale after footage of the French midfielder shows him once again looking out of shape playing for Galatasaray. You have to wonder if problems outside of football have ultimately caused Ndombale's downfall. It's a sad thing to see. Galatasaray have rejected the opportunity to sign Tangai on a permanent and with just one year remaining on his Spurs contract, it's hard to see where he goes from here. Still just 27 years old and dumbbell a should be a world superstar right now. Instead it seems he is destined to join that long line of players whose careers promised so much more.",

A laughable coach the last three seasons. His weapons were always injured and he's even battle with his own injuries. I think people forget this guy had 40 3 hundred yards and 30+ touchdowns as a rookie and in his second season he had 5000+ passing yards and over 40 touchdowns. And number four. I have Matthew Stafford. What we're hoping that CJ Stroud and Jordan Love can turn into is what Matthew Stafford is right now. Arguably the best overall arm tower in the entire league. And he's controlling. We did now to the top two wide receiver seasons ever and the best rookie wide receiver season. Not to mention being by far the toughest quarterback in the NFL and No. 3. I have Aaron Rodgers. It feels weird to put him here after Achilles tear, but I simply have to. I don't think it will affect his game that much, but I think people forget how good he really was before that terror since we haven't really seen him play in like two seasons. But I expect him to be an MVP frontrunner with this stacked Jets team this season. And 2 in one should be pretty obvious. I have Josh Allen at two. Best arm in the league, highest ceiling out of any player on the NFL. But his floor is significantly lower than Mahomes, so he just can't be higher than him. And he is one hell of a playoff performer. He has rarely been the problem in the postseason. But No. 1 is Patrick Mahomes and I don't think it's that close. I think he has maybe a slightly lower ceiling than Josh Allen, but his floor is so much higher and he is just consistently elite week in and week out that he has to be here.",

    "voice_to_text": "I have some questions about the Sean Payton draft process. First off, admitting he baited Minnesota, forcing them to trade up for JJ McCarthy. What sense does that make? Dude, why would that matter to you whether or not Minnesota gives up a couple of day 3 picks? That seems like a total waste of time, and I question whether or not it's true in the first place. I mean, did you actually try to trade up? You didn't pull it off, and now you're worried that stories are gonna come out that, hey, maybe he didn't pull off a trade up, and bow next isn't really who he wanted. So this is you getting out ahead of it? I don't know. Could be. Regardless, there's a story that came out about how the Falcons, the Vikings in the Broncos landed on which quarterback they wanted to take at the top of the first. Here's a Broncos section. What's in your backpack? Sean Payton asked. Next, reach inside and grab the roll of tape that he explained he needed for his ankles if you were going to train. He also pulled out a spare pair of football cleats and a cross ball that he'd use for rolling out his back. What wasn't in the bag was just a significant. Everything was football related. All of it. Look, I'm not saying if you're a Broncos fan, you can't defend the bow next pick. You take a quarterback that high, you're going Through no matter what. Trust me, I get it. But knowing that part of the process was Sean Payton Soy facing after Bonex pulled a football out of his bag. Which is great cause he's a football player. Can't inspire confidence. This wasn't his entire process, obviously, but I listened to a lot of what else he said after they picked them and it didn't move me. And really, it's just thinking that this means anything at all to me is crazy. I give him credit for the Franklin pick in the fourth. I thought that was very good. But I'm wondering if maybe there's some Mike McCarthy allegations that Peyton needs to beat if this doesn't work out. Cause right now I'm just not there with the process.",

    "voice_to_text": "Adam Walton was the January signing that got away for Spurs and I can't believe it's taking people this long to realise that. He probably should be on the plane to the euros in the summer. Colby Reynolds had an outstanding season at Manchester United, has really burst onto the scene. Looks so impressive, looks so comfortable for the most part in that midfield and in an England shirt as well. But Adam Walton is an excellent. He's more of that profile that England need. England don't really have that successor to that come rice ready yet in that No. 6 position. Someone who come in and step in and look composed on the ball just like rice does if rice was to get injured. Rice isn't a Sardinian's best player, but he's England's most irreplaceable in my opinion. But Adam Walton could step up to that mantle and probably should be on the plane in the summer. There's were a number of big clubs that were linked with Walton's signature in January, but he chose to move to Crystal Palace and it's been brilliant for him. Glasgow ball is perfect for someone like Adam Walton. He looks so comfortable in that midfield and he's shining at just 20 years of age. I genuinely think we're looking at a generational talent here in midfield. England are blessed with so much talent in that area. But Walton for me should squeeze into that squad over the likes of Gallagher, potentially over The likes of Henderson. We've got a 26 man squad, let's use it and give this man the opportunity deserves. Hate to make it about Walton versus Manu cause they're actually quite different profiles. Manu's more of that ball playing No. 8 and Adam Walton is very comfortable on the ball but he's more depth of playing that No. 6 position. He's averaging over double the amount of successful tackles per 90 in the Premier League, blocks per 90 as well. Clearances per 90. He's been excellent so far for Crystal Palace. Played less minutes naturally than minor in the Premier League but you can see his expected assist to hires create more chances. And for me this lad has got to be on the plane. I'm gutted Spurs didn't pick up the option to sign him in January because he was the one that got away. Especially when you consider how many struggles we're having in that position at the moment. Let me know in the comments if you had to take one of Walter Hermione to the euros, which one would you take? And as always if you enjoy the video, drop it like for me and follow for more daily football content. Nice one!",

    "voice_to_text": "So Matt spawn our put out a tweet and a subsequent video where he asked the question, is it unfair to say that this is a make or break year for Bryce Young? He thinks it is, and I agree. And my reasoning for that it it starts with the class of 2021. So sometime in like, the 1970s, for the first time ever, quarterbacks were taken 1, 2, 3 in the draft. It proceeded to not happen again until 1999, and then not again until 2021. But then only two short years later, we see quarterbacks go 1, 2, 4. And the team that picked third, it's the same team that picked second. And then this year, they go 1, 2, 3 again. Why is that, you ask? Well, to me, it's because when you look at the teams that picked quarterbacks in 2021, they all worked out. At this point in the NFL, it seems like within two years, you know whether or not you have a guy at quarterback. In Trevor Lawrence's case, he took the Jags to the playoffs in Year 2. Zach Wilson, two years in, major bust pause. But the roster is good, so they go and get a veteran. Trey Lance barely got playing time, but the Niners decided they didn't wanna wait anymore. Look later in the first round, the Patriots draft Mac Jones and they trade him away. The Bears draft Justin Fields. He's traded. Different year, but are any 22 Quarterbacks still on the team that picked them. Starting quarterbacks in the NFL are younger than they've been in 60 years. Teams are basically comfortable saying, we think we can surround you with enough weapons to know whether or not you are good by your third season. Boring injury or bad process. If you're good, like these three guys right here, they'll keep you. But if you're bad, you're gone. Think of the Jets, the Falcons. They'll just get a veteran. The worst thing a team can do is not know by year three or four. Get the Titans. Look at what they're surrounding Will Lewis with right now. They want an answer. The Giants are a good example of not knowing what you're working with and then paying a bit too much money as a result. If you draft a quarterback top three and they're not very good by Year 3, you're probably stuck with them for the rest of that contract. But they might be cooked. They could take longer. It's just. It's a bit unusual. So. For Bryce Young, I'm not saying he has to lead the league in passing. Wouldn't mind like a Josh Allen Year 2 scenario where it's a bit messy, but there's upside. I think the situation is definitely good enough. I'm rooting for him, to be clear. I like Dave Canalis. I like that supporting cast. I do think he will have a pretty good season, but if it looked like last Year. I wouldn't really blame the Panthers and Panthers fans for, you know, deciding they're out on him."

One is almost a billionaire and dating Travis Kelsey. The other one was dating Tori. I created the Stallion Challenge. Haha, I'm so sorry. It's not funny, because if you actually look at those two different paradigms, that is actually insane. If you take Taylor Swift and then you take Megan Stallion as two different paradise. I asked all them a question. I said, do you guys buy your girl expensive bags, expensive clothes and shoes? You guys have crazy and ideals like I know them. Crazy and ideals or crazy NFL contracts? He said, bro, my girl likes Lululemon, and it's cool with a Tory Burch or Michael Kors. Your girl wants a Chanel bag and 100 roses with $100 I sent you. They asked me, yo, goody, you were dating a girl, she was black. How many times did you send her money for her nails? I'm a good guy. I told them, I definitely did it at least 10 to 15 times. They said, you wanna know how many times I did it? Three. Said, fuck. Hey, I don't give a fuck. Though I still want a black woman. I can't relate to a white woman. That's just me.

The Falcons, who just dropped 180 million on a quarterback, chose another QB with their eight overall pick. And their nine figure man ain't happy about it. Atlanta decided Kirk Cousins was their guy and signed him to a four year deal worth 45 mill a season. That kind of cash should buy a man a little job security. But it didn't, because when the eighth pick came around, Atlanta shocked everyone by picking quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Even cousins was stunned, and you can understand why. He was only signed six weeks before the draft and his new team already named his replacement. Not only did the Falcons not need a QB, but Penix is coming off two ACL surgeries and injuries to both shoulders and college. And now your QB one is ticked off before he even throws a single pass. Well done, Atlanta.",

Simicus, I don't want to say nothing disrespectful about the players, but you understand what I'm saying? That. That performance. Wow, man. It's like he was playing right wing for Atlanta. But like he was. There was no defending, especially in transition, was not there? This right to. To the bottom left. You see? You see this name here? Harvey Elliot. Why did he come off? What?

Maybe the sports scientist of said sign, I don't know. But based on actual performance, who. Who won that pitch? Of the 11 that started and the what five? Who came off the bench? Whoever came, however many came off the bench, but can anyone say they played better than Elliot? The 4. The 45 minutes that he gave us the first half? Elliot was arguably the best player on the pitch. Endo didn't have a good game today. Jones didn't play that great. Nunez was not very good overall. I love Nunez, but that Was not a great Nunez game. Sim cast was poor. Virgil didn't do anything wrong really, can I say? Was kind of a bit wayward for the second goal, but it's not too deep. The space between him and Gomez was kind of crazy for that, but I didn't know it's Gomez play. Overly bad. Mccallister didn't have one of his best games, but it was kind of like a 5.5 out of ten. Gakpo played one of his better games in the past couple of months. No one played better than Elliot off the bench. Robertson had a good appearance off the bench. No one else really made a difference. I can't fathom why Elliot came off. I understand seller comes on, but based off of the last couple of games from suburbs like to come on off the bench. He was not good against United. Respectfully, I don't want to rag on these players too tough because they're all human and we all make mistakes, but like suburbs lie against United does not warrant him coming off the bench to make a difference today. Because the only difference he made in that game was negative with the decision making and we saw it again today. The third goal. The only player on that pitch you can actually be that third goal for Atlanta to is suburbs lie. Terrible, terrible pass back to. Can I say. Completely gives the ball away and then doesn't really sprint back in transition. And then is late to react to the rebound, which then causes to go like there. There was like 2 or 3 different times he could have avoided that goal and that was kinda him. I can't imagine what Elliot came off the sub would have been. Jones off, Salah on, push Elliot into midfield, put him on the right, leap, put my callister on the left and we vibe like that. I don't know why he came off.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'd actually like to report a crime. The EFL award nominations are out and take a look at this. So Mckenna, who is left? He's already won it, we don't really need to debate that he's won it. But Farker, I can agree with this. Rosinia's in there. Manager of the season. A team that should be comfortably within that top six in my opinion. They're gonna miss the playoffs. You could have even given it to Maresca, you know. Leicester probably gonna go in the league after that bit of a shake. But the one that's missed out, and it is fucking criminal, is Marty Sithwenters. The job he's done at QPR is nothing short of fucking phenomenal. It wouldn't have won it because it's gonna be Mckenna, and deservedly so, but Marty Sifwensis should be on that list over Liam Rosinia. Nothing you can say changes my mind. I don't think you can massively argue with any of these smodics. Has to win it. A couple of options who could have been included. I think Jack Clark's had a good year, 15 goals. I think he's got um. Just some land have been shit out. That's probably what's taking him out of it, but. So Blackburn and then Leaf, Davis, Ipswich. Really, really good year. He's not nearly. Something like 20 assists or something like mad. It might not be that high, but it's really high. Uh, smart Excel for me. Has to win player of the year. Somerville will go play in the Premier League next year even if Leeds don't. And Jews Brighols been massive for Leicester so can't really argue with that. Now this. To be fair you can probably rule out the two on the right hand side. What Archie Grey has done this season is nothing short of phenomenal. The lad is 17. At the start of the year he was barely 17 I think. But what he has done this season, looking as accomplished and as assured and everything that he has looked, he is going right to the very top. He will be in the England squad within the next 2 years and if Leeds don't go up they could see some serious money come from in the summer. He's gonna be a fucking top player. If there's anyone that you think should be up for these awards let me know in the comments.",

Young kids out there have no idea how much Blue Mountain State was like a phenomenon, a staple in the 2010. So much so the people were upset it only got three seasons. It was raunchy, it was over the top, and a hell of a lot of fun. Alan Richardson's kind of a big deal nowadays for his role in the hit show Reacher and his most recent role in Fast X. But the real ones know him as playing one of the greatest characters in TV history in Thad Castle. And the fact that this man is said to reprise his role makes me so fucking happy. Let me see the condom you plan on putting on my quarterback's weenie. I'm sorry. Oh, my god. Yes! Holy shit. Just put a baby in me, please. Oh, I don't know. I'm in love with you. Oh, good.

Your cop, in an interview this morning, has said that he is going to leave Liverpool at the end of the season, saying he doesn't have the energy to keep on going year after year after year. I'm gutted. I am absolutely gutted. You know what we're building at the moment. I thought he would be here for another couple of years, the way the team is going. After everything that happened last season, people are saying he doesn't have it anymore. He's shown the season that he has, but for him, this is the end of the roads. And I. I'm worried about where. Where this goes now. I really am. I'm so worried about where this goes. Um, dear, again, thank you so much for absolutely everything. Ah, that's enough. This is fucked. Ah!",

It looks something like this. This is all wrong. I shouldn't be here. I should be at work slaving away for my retirement and paying my bills. How dare you rob me from getting old! The illnesses I accommodated over the years, my utility bills and everything else. You've stolen my dreams of growing old in the nursing home. And now I don't have to run young and healthy until I'm 15 years old. But I only planned for 75. And I've planned everything out. I even have at least of diseases ready. You've already invited everyone. This is your creative society. I hear about it from every TikTok account. I'm lucky. I am conscious individual. But others are not. They want everything the Creative Society offers. And people like me, they understand what we're going to lose. Crisis, power. See? Wars and violence and boring life. Mark my words, Creative Society advocates. All our eyes will be on you and your actions. And if you go through with your plans, they will never forgive you.

That means nothing if you can't shoot the ball. In our league I think we have a better chance. Imagine if Braun was in the NFL. Who the is stopping Braun? You might stop him in the NFL. Imagine Russ.

Make sure you have your graduating year in your bio. Little things when you send messages to coaches, I used to get them all the time with, like, spelling errors. My name wasn't in them. They'd say the wrong school. Have some attention to detail to you, and make sure you're doing things the right way. If you're trying to get recruited, make sure that you're putting yourself out there, reaching out to coaches. I mean, I really did find recruits from kids Dming. I mean, from kids messaging me on Instagram or Twitter and saying, coach, here's my film. I have offers from these schools. What do you think? Would like to talk?

And I think things are only gonna get better for the next couple of weeks because we have 1ft in Wembley and we are 2 games away from the Premier League. I'm actually cannot believe it. If he's don't know someone and Lou. And are both significantly better away from home than they are at home. And we have managed to win at home, which basically means we should go through now. A lot of people said if someone wins at home, they've done it. We have one at home. Wait, I thought there's nothing stopping us now. We're actually a game away from the player final. 2 from the Premier League. But my god, what an atmosphere. Party, atmosphere from minute one. Absolute limbs. And if you don't know, I broke my arm only a couple weeks ago and it took a batter in a day. It was actually in an arm wrestle, exactly the way Tom Garrett did it. And I've had an operation, but I was in agony after that first goal. I cannot lie up. Accidentally punched down and my arm, honestly. But it was worth it, every second of it. I'm Just so excited. But my god, some of the players on that pitch. If he's watching a Pierre in the midfield it is the reincarnation of Ya ya Tori. I'm a DLO. One of the best players I've ever seen in the Sunland Show. Patti Roberts genuinely could be 100 men and score. He is. I'm just so excited, as you can tell. I don't really know what else to say. I can't really analyze this game very much cause the only thing I can think of is with one. And we're going to Kennelworth Road with the 2 one lead. There is nothing stopping us now.
