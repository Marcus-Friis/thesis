Like, yeah, we'd love to have a look at you. Come down. It was like a little exit trial type of thing. They invited loads of, like, ex academy players to kind of do this little trial thing to see if they could get into the first team. Whatever, bro. I played 45 minutes the first 10 minutes. I turned to ref, like, your ref, like, how long? He turns around now. We just started what? I was gonna cry. I was gonna cry on that pitch. The way I looked over to refers like, what? We just started like, what? It's only been 10 minutes. He's like, yeah, we still got number 35+ at the time. What? Plus at the time. Bro, I'm not gonna lie to you. This is why I told Amanda, once you stop playing football for a little bit, don't care if you're the fittest guy, you stop for one month. Especially me, you know, obviously, Mom's going out, party, whatever. Whatever. But when I hear preseason around the corner, my heart starts palpitating. Cause I know. The bleed test, oh my gosh. The bleed test, oh my gosh. Niggas know when preseason comes. All of them. Box runs, box to box, full filled runs. Flipping bleed test. Your heart, you can't handle it. You can't handle it.

Another way of increasing your range of motion and your mobility within your body. And last but not least, gym work.

Quarterback had no idea I was on his blind side, man. I was full sprint. I was running as fast as I could. I lit that boy up, and he forgot to fall. He just didn't move. We just stood kind of like. Eventually he came to the ground, but it was, like, two or three check. It was enough for me to be, like, only liked it. I'm gonna get him. And then you're like, oh, why is he standing still? I'm. He's supposed to be down. Um. But we learn, we grow. We become flag football state champions.",

    "voice_to_text": "Trust me bros, you don't need to learn. I'll give you my reason. Here's a couple of reasons why I wouldn't want Joao Felix. Reason No. 1. We should sell Mason Greenwood for multiple reasons, which I'm not gonna go into, and use that money on position that we need to cover, like center backs. Also, Zhuang Felix has a history of, you know, not getting well with managers. And if Eric Turnhardt is to stay, we don't need another guy that's gonna give him problems, in my personal opinion. Also, this brother's wages are crazy. 2:50. And he hasn't been great in the last two to 3 years. Let's be real. Since Zhuang left beifika, he hasn't been the player that they bought him for. I don't think he suits acclaim Madrid system very well. I do see him suiting more of a Barca style. Where is that one touch football? So I feel it's a little bit like Jaden Sancho. And I don't think we need that at the club. If you're a stats guy, his stats has been okay over the years. It's been. It's been alright, as you can see if you're a stats person. Over the last three years in Portuguese. I think this guy needs to sort out his career, cause it's just all over the place. And I think going to Manchester United will be a wrong move for him and for us. So for me, it's a no.",

    "voice_to_text": "Fair play to Vincent company. Went from managing Burnley and getting relegated to. Yeah, fair play to him indeed. I mean I don't understand how on what world that make sense for a manager to get his team sacked. Because he was so stubborn to change the way he plays to suit his team to keep him in the league. Yeah, though like Vincent company went wrong because he didn't. He didn't decide to switch up his tactics, he carried on persistently try to get his team to play how they did in championship. When you one of the best teams in the league as means Man City know you'll get away with it. But when you're promoted into the Premier League, you've kinda gotta adapt. You've kinda gotta realise that mighty my players and my team isn't strong enough to play that way in the Premier League and get results. So me as a western fan, I was annoyed that Moyes didn't adapt to certain games. He just played the same way over and over again. It's clear that Vincent Company does the same thing. And yeah, I can't see, I can't see anything but Leverkusen or another German team pipping Bayern Munich to the title again. But yeah, that's my opinion. I don't. Yeah, it is a bit of a weird one because although I think what he did with Burnley in the championship was great, how he coached them, it's all well and good to doing that With one of the best teams in the league. But when you're. When you're up against it and you've got use your head and try and change tactics to try and get the best result for the team at that time. Yeah, company kinda proved that he. He couldn't do that. He couldn't change how his team played. So I don't think it's gonna be much of a success forum in any way of form. And won't be surprised if Dortmund Salzburg is Salzburg. No, Leipzig. It's one or the other. Dortmund, Frankfurt, even. UM. Leverkusen. One of them. One of them. Pippin. Um. Bayern Munich. To start all again. But yeah. Let me know your thoughts in the comments please. Like, share all that shit. But yeah, commonly wise.",

Okay, so the last time I stitched this video, I was talking about fast food prices and how they're ridiculous, but check this out. This is awesome stadium. That's section 11, where I like to sit. These are the ticket prices for the Ohio State game, just for reference. This is Section 11, the view from it. And I paid about 250 bucks a piece for these seats last year against the Cougs, the last time we were ever gonna play them in conference play. So a pretty big deal. And it wasn't $755.

    "voice_to_text": "Addressing trends at left winger. Because I am not advocating that he plays on the left winger. I just can't believe. One thing I find disappointing on social media is a large amount of people are just so desperate to see the demise of a content creator. And I, I don't know who this guy is, I don't know if anybody else, uh, does. I've only recently come across his videos. His, his football coach who just produces harmless videos from kind of a tactical perspective of football. And he's built up a following quite quickly. And I think fair play to him, right? You can clearly see he has a passion for football coaching. And he's come under fire a little bit stick recently for suggesting how England could line up, that you wrote 2024. And whether you agree or not, fair play to him for putting himself out there to just get people talking, to perhaps suggest how a team could set up differently, how players could express themselves differently. That's what football's all about. And I'm all for that kind of content creation over someone. Some rage baiting video which is just clamoring for controversy to. To real people in like, it clearly works hard. And I think until you play football at decent level, or you've played throughout your life, or still playing, or you've coached or managed, I think it's easy to criticise. But when you're living that on a daily basis, of course you've Got that passion to come out with all different. Different ideas and different perspectives, and I'm all for it. It gets people engaged, insensible conversations. So, yeah. Anyway, like I said, have you come across this guy? What? What your thoughts? Um, but for me, from my perspective, let's not suppress content creators creativity, and let's get involved in a conversation."

    "voice_to_text": "There is something so wrong about this video and also a similar video that this influencer has posted and it's really pissing me off. Us women who are into sports, who love watching football, who love watching racing, F1, all of that. Us women, we have gotten so many comments thrown at us the last couple of years and even before that of oh, it's a male dominated sports, it's only for men, you only watch for the hot drivers or the hot players and everything. We have been getting those kinds of comments from men for years. Just because we like a sport, just because we like watching football, we like watching racing. And sure, there are probably some girls or women out there who only watch because of the hard men that are doing the sport, but the majority of the industry of women in motorsport, women in football, we watch it because we love watching the sport. And in both sports, we have just gone to a point where it has been more accepted and more generalize for women to also be able to love the sports for the sport, more women getting opportunities in like women's football or F1 academy in the engineering part of F1. So for an influencer who got invited to watch the football, to watch the racing, make a video saying the contrary that oh, she's only there to watch the hot player, she's only there to watch the hot drivers because She's an influencer making these videos. She's gonna have people generalize her videos to the wider community of women in motorsport and women in football, women in sports in general. And that is gonna set us back massively, as we've just gone to a point where it's been more normalized. Watching those videos really made me angry. I just had to say something about it.",

And if you go back and watch it, they did score from it. I guess the team that plays in sort of green and white hoops kit, a little bit like that. Um, I'm the, the manager. Uh, I. I can't run that. I'm too large to run most of the time, so I shout from the bench. Um, we were told they train twice a week. Um, had six preseason games. We turned up to our first game against them, where we only lost 2 1. Um, half our team was hungover. We'd never trained before, we'd never met our left winger before. We had. We've never even spoken to our left winger before. And we weren't wanna look against this tactical, incredible. Sunday League can plan any pitch. And we got tired and lost. Um, they weren't good. They. They didn't do anything tactically. Um, I. I do like some of the stuff he says. The. The many that I've stitched has got some good content, but this is. This is my Parish FC top. And, uh, if you're claiming your corner routine is. Is fantastic because you scored a goal against Parish, join the club. We've conceded about 40 set pieces this season. It nothing to do with a corner tactic, I promise you that.",

I don't think the Premier League is turning into a Farmers League at all. I think it's actually the most competitive it's been for a while. So this season Man City won the league by two points on the last game of the season. Pretty sure that's not what you call a Farmers League. They didn't run away over even slightly the year before that in 2022 23 they went by five points. That's mainly cause Arsenal bottled it towards the end of the season, but still they pushed Man City pretty much all the way up until about what, three or four games to go? The year before that Liverpool literally missed out on the title by one point. I think Aston Villa went two nil up and Man City had to come back 3 2 to win the title. In 2021, yeah it did change. It was I think. I think it's a 12 point difference. Man United came second, so yeah, Man City won it comfortably in that one scene. The year before that in 1920, Liverpool actually won the title, so yeah, definitely not Man City steamrolling the league there. And the year before that in 2018 2019, Man City again won by one point on the last game of the season. So in the last six seasons Man City have only run away With the title once, and we've had another winner in that time as well in Liverpool. So yeah, definitely not a Farmers League. It's actually really competitive. It was a three horse race this year until Liverpool decided to drop out with about seven or eight games to go. So yeah, not a farmers league. I can only see it getting better. And even so, when Pep maybe leaves the end of next year, it'll be even tighter cause I don't think Man City will dominate at all."

    "voice_to_text": "A call of every footballer's career starts and ends in Europe. I agree 100%. I agree. Well not 100%, but I agree to an extent. The only place I have issues where is time mentioning goes. And then you made a statement that if a player moves to another club outside of Europe then his achievement there is somewhat insignificant. But my main question is why is this the stats that you pulled out? Why is it this statistics? Because they're trying to tell me that this is the only significant statistics for Messi and Ronaldo. Because I looked and I was seeing all club stats for European clubs excluding friendly. So I'm not seeing any international statistics here. So are you trying to tell me that the international statistics are somewhat insignificant as well? Because personally that is where I would disagree. I don't believe their international statistics is is insignificant because I feel like it is also the Pinnacle of football. Yeah but there is this start here that says all time start without USA and without Saudi. That is the insignificant ones. Yeah because based on your videos these are the 2 insignificant ones, the USA and the Saudi Pro League. But it also contains the international statistics. We are Ronaldo has more goals. So personally I feel like their international statistics is also very significant and is also the Pinnacle of football. So it is important to include their international performances as well, not just their Club performances in Europe includes their international performances because it is very significant. if you say the international statistics and achievement is irrelevant, that's your opinion. But personally I disagree. Now for the people who may still get this video twisted, even though I know you, no matter what I say, they will still get it twisted. I came here for the goals and the goals alone. Have a good day.",

Having 12 draws is the greatest achievement. I can't understand why sides like Fennebach and Galatasha I don't wanna be great like the invincible. Like surely that's the only achievement you would try and replicate, right? Why play for the win and try get maximum points when you could have the invincible? Truth. They just drawn 12 of their game. They could have had Gold Air, Galatasra. I could have won gold air is far better than winning the the title in Turkey, Feder Bach and Galatasra. So just relax and let other team win as many games as possible. Because the real winners is whatever team goes invincible, right? Not the team which ends up with the most points at the end of the day. Getting 90 points, but going invincible is a far better achievement you know. Then get a hundred and two point, cause it doesn't matter if 102 points guarantees you the league title, you were beaten so you're just not as good. What were Fennebatch you think? Trying to win the league when they could have just been the greatest side in Turkish league history anyway? Yeah, the Invincibles were overrated. Thank you. Thank you.",

Um, I've seen that clip, what. What I'm stitching now, uh, a few times now, and it. I'm still baffled that, um, the club have allowed him to go on, you know, something with. That should have been Celtic, uh, and camel Gob and the other one that Steven Olsen is a complete. Anyway. But for city to allow Kyle to go on, on stuff like that. Listen, I love Kyle Walker. I've. I've actually backed him. Um, I've had arguments with city fans this season because, you know, they've been slaughtering Kyle Walker. He's had a poor season like that. Yeah, and I. I backed him hundred percent and I always will. Any. Any city player, anybody pulls a city shirt on, I will back. I just don't like the. The ways he's going on stuff like this now. He's coming out with comments. Uh, after the FA Cup final, um, he was going on about, you know, his friendship with United players and stuff like that. About, um, you know, getting in the England squad, you know, cause through his friends that. That. That's all well and good, Kyle, but we've just lost an FA Cup final and you're going on about United players and stuff like that. It doesn't. You're not doing yourself any favours, mate. Um, but Your personal stuff the club have backed you with, even. You even got a new contract through it. So I think at least. At least a bare minimum, you don't do stuff like this because I know it's getting a lot of city fans tits at the moment. Um, I still can't understand why. Why you doing stuff like that, but, um. Maybe it's because, you know, you're going in the summer. You going to Saudi? Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? But yeah, it's getting a little bit tiresome now with the stuff what. What is coming out with. And obviously we're gonna get various comments in the comments, but listen, is. What is it? I'd like to know all the fans opinions as well. You think that it should be just concentrating on the. On the job in hand, uh, which is his club who pays his wages? Or do you think he's got the right to go on shows like, uh. And. And they're not like big shows. It's not if it's Sky Sports or anything. It's just no beds like that. Stephen Elson and third in hand and whoever else they called. So, yeah, I. I just. It just doesn't sit well with me. I don't know what you. You think",

Why is nobody talking about this? You tried to get me banned off TikTok last time and I did a stitch. Uh, a stitch with you? Um, just shows you. You give it but you can't take it. Um, so. But in my opinion, you're a buffoon. You're an absolute buffoon in. In. In fairness. Um. So run along to TikTok again. Report me again. Um, yeah, you know, can't give a shiny shit. Enjoy the rest of your bank holiday, you know, cause why is nobody talking about this?",

Cause there's a lot of Arsenal fans right, that need their egos to be pushed right down here. Because you guys are acting like Arteta is like some amazing genius manager that's like gonna be so much higher than Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola. Can I just remind you, 5 years he's been in charge and he's won one FA Cup. One FA Cup, two Community Shields, but no one even cares about that or even bothers to acknowledge the Community Shields. But one FA Cup in five years of management, 20 years, Arsenal have gone without winning a Premier League trophy and you still not won a European trophy. And you're saying that we want the next Michel Arteta? Yeah, I really don't think we want that at all.",

Please watch the full clip, then send a context of the conversation that we're about to have. So this man, who's been married to this woman for a while now, you believe that you've had three children with this woman, and it turned out to be all three children are not yours. He did a DNA test, and all three children turned out to be not his. And their supposedly biological father is the pastor of the church that his wife goes to, and he exposes her in front of her, um, YouTube IG Live while she was doing a ministry sermon with her peoples, and basically exposed her for being basically a daddy. Daddy, daddy, daddy. Um, this is my thing. I know that a lot of women find it very offensive to ask for a DNA test at birth. I think a lot of men are very worried, some, because at the end of the day, the mother is without doubt on who the mother is. The father is always the possible deniability. We don't know who, because it could be anybody at that. At that moment. I just feel like, as if they need to be a middle ground. Of a place where men can acts for a DNA test at an early stage of that childhood development, prior to you already spending five, six, seven, eight, 11 years Of not knowing, and then find out that these children are not yours. And to me, women who fight back towards that initiative, y'all be the ones that make people side you. About wanting to commit into long term relationships. Is because y'all be so prideful and find it disrespectful, or, oh, I'm gonna give him the voice paper. Soon as he gets asked for a DNA test. Why are you in your feelings about that? Why? Because if that was your brother, your uncle, your nephew, you'd want him to get DNA test to be sure. But your man, quote unquote, the one that's supposed to be a biological father, your children can't ask you for a DNA test. And you, you ready to fight? You ready to. To blow your whole family up? Because you know damn well you was out here in the streets, and that's sad. That's sad. Like, share and comment."

He spent half, more than half the season out injured and was it four goals and 10 assists in 18 games? And he's saying he's finished? Kevin De Bruyne finished. Oh my god. And the worst part is, you're a Man United fan with Casamero in the middle. Please, God, you've. You've got to be deluded to think Kevin De Bruyne is anywhere near finished. Like, seriously, you. You gonna tell me that Kobe Maynard. Maynard is better than him? Or, you know, Bruno Fernandez got more, more goals in his system this season. But of course he has, because he was out for five, five or six months injured, is come back from injury and still done better than nearly three quarters of the midfielders in the Premier League.

It's full on pathetic. Am I surprised? Not really. Was it expected? Absolutely. Manchester United yesterday won the FA Cup off the back of their worst ever season since the Premier League begun. But for some reason you'll always get that small pocket of United fans who have to jump on social media and just somehow make it about Arsenal. No mention of Liverpool, who fine, won the Carabao Cup, but you could argue that the FA Cup is more prestigious. No mention of Spurs? No mention of Chelsea, Villa, Newcastle? All teams that achieved a better league position than them. Because unfortunately you still have United fans that live in 2,004 with a rivalry between the two clubs was absolutely huge. It's time to get over it fellas. It's time to drop it. Just grow up a bit. This rivalry is not the same as it was two decades ago. And just for a little bit of context, we achieved identical seasons back in 2020. Arsenal finished eighth, won the FA Cup, United finished second and won nothing. And there was no mention of Arsenal having the better season. Put it this way, there isn't a single Arsenal fan in the world that would swap seasons. In fact, I don't think there's many fans out There at all. That would swap seasons. One FA Cup does not gloss over the fact that this is the worst United side I've ever seen in my life.",

So guys, if you watch that video, Coach Raffa is basically responding to my stitch, um, and kinda comments that I made about this line up behind me, which I thought was rubbish. And I just wanna say, Coach Raffa, you as a person, I've got nothing against you, you know, you're doing good things, being a good, uh, creator in the game. But I'm allowed to have an opinion about the opinion that you shared in that video, and I still think it was absolute rubbish. Bro, I'm. I'm. I'm so sorry to say, but. But that's just my opinion about that video. Um, particularly, you know, I thought rice at central centre back was a pretty bad shout. Maybe not the worst in the world, but not great. But the trend at left wing I still think is awful. When you're looking at my comment where I said that it would have been better if Trent was at least inverted. I'm talking about him playing as an inverted full back. So if we're talking about this 3 2 4 1 in possession shape, him being one of the players in the base, Trent left wing is still terrible. The fact that he's coming inside at times in the shape that you wanna adopt doesn't mean much to me. He's still way too advanced and The fact that at times, Trent is gonna have to hold whip and play as a left winger. Bro, I'm sorry, nothing you say, it just cut out, but for a second, but, yeah, nothing you say will make that logical in my mind. And I don't think it will make it logical in a lot of people's minds, bro. Like, trend. Like, where did the left wing come from? Like, right wing would have been odd anyway, but left wing. I'm sorry, man, it's. It's still. It's still just rubbish. Uh, to. To me, I just don't feel that that's some of your best work, mate. Um, sorry if it upsets you, but I've just got to be honest with you, man. Uh, that's my opinion.",

Now, I'm sure most of you have seen this clip, but I can't believe they've got someone actually showing ex professionals. The most out of context clip I've ever seen. So. Cause people are a bit stupid up there, they don't understand he was completely taking the piss out of Madrid fans. The fact they're taking a small clip that just makes it so out of context just sums up media really. But if you haven't seen that clip, he's mocking Madrid fans because they were giving it the whole game and they've scored and he's taking the piss out the gestures that they were throwing. Now it's just football. I understand it when people do stuff seriously like that. It's like you can say what you want, but the end of the day it's really not that deep and it makes it quite funny. And the fact that they've shown ex professionals this and they're all like, oh, this is embarrassing and stuff and questioning fans. Oh, I know for a fact he follows city over Europe home and away every week. It's, you know, you can't knock it. And they're trying to make him seem less of a fan, cause then out of context clip is pathetic. But yeah, anyway, it's just embarrassing. It just Sums up media and how they're saying this is hooliganism. It's just laughable. Um, but yeah, it is what it is. It is what it is. But yeah it's just hilarious the fact that they are actually trying to say that is hooliganism and making him seem less less of a fan. Uh, it just sums up media and ex footballers. They ain't really got a clue. Um, but yeah I'll tag him below. Don't you know, give him stick for anything? Cause it's really not that deep. It's. It's quite funny to be honest. Um, I'm not tagging him below to embarrass him, but he follows. See him in a way. As I said, he post some pretty sick stuff. That's good to see. Uh, from an actual proper city fans point of view for all of you that say they got no fans. Um, and no I'm not fucking ass licking him. Um, but I respect fans that go home and away and city gets stick more than anyone so yeah. The fact that he's had this made about him just makes me laugh. But feel free to give him a follow. And yeah, fuck the media.",

I don't think anyone see anyone say that. And also some people say you should start from England. No, there's a minor. There's some West Ham fans that say again is a bit of a joke but I think people saying he should be in the squad which 100% he should be in the squad but no one says we started like he is ridiculous. Bowen is not overrated. He is unreal and he's getting better every year and the numbers back it up if you just watch him as well.",

    "voice_to_text": "But who the fuck is this guy? Look man, how come I've only now heard of it? Look, man has been a player for a very long time. I mean, he's one of the top players in Europe. If you watch the last AFCOM, he was the main key player for the Nigerian team. The problem with you people is that when people shining, that is when you wanna come out to claim that you wanna praise a person, you understand? Look, man has been play for Atlanta as long as he's been in that club. So I don't understand why you saying that. Where has this guy been? I mean, how come you just know about him? He's been there, he's been playing. That's one thing about you people. You just think that when these players are Africans, they are not useful until they start scoring goals or until they start making names for themselves. That's what you people know. Luke Man has been in the game. And the last AFCOM, Ruth, Luke man has been there. He played wonderfully for Nigeria. One of the greatest player of all time. And now he's just made history. The greatest of all. The only player that has ever scored a hat trick in the Europe League final. And I say you can't take that away from him. So the history is there. So if you don't know about look man, that's your business as far as I'm concerned. Look, man has Been there. He's been playing for Atlanta. He's been playing for Nigeria, and he's doing very well. So whether you know about him now or you've never heard about him, that's your business. That's it."

You couldn't write it? I don't wanna look when we're at hat trick. You really could not write it. Trey Grey calls as well. Absolutely stolen Liverpool's. And what's next for Atlanta? I really don't know. But most importantly, what's next for Liverpool's? And where does this have been? Some of the players gonna leave them now. We never know.

    "voice_to_text": "Her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. Holy shit. I mean, I knew this guy was a Christian freak, but, oh, my god, the absolute gall and arrogance you have to have to go up on a stage at a college and say this, albeit it's been addicting, is just. That's so insane. Yeah, I, uh. I haven't fully seen the speech until, like, an hour ago. Yeah, it's. It's worse than I ever could imagine. Oh, my god. As someone who lives in Missouri, uh, if you couldn't tell. Yeah, I'm not surprised at all. Not surprised at all that he said this when you gave him a microphone. Now, I could just sit here, like a lot of people are doing, and just clown on this guy, which there's nothing wrong with that. It's. It's really, really easy and really fun to make fun of. But I've noticed that when regarding this situation with Harrison Bucker. I mean, I've seen something. I mean, obviously there's general consensus of, hey, fuck this guy. But something I've noticed, and it's turned into a question, is why is Benedictine asking this guy to speak? Like, Harrison Booker didn't go to Benedictine. He's not from this area. He went to school in Georgia. The only thing. The only connection to this area is that I see is that he plays for the Chiefs, who are in the same area as Benedictine. And His faith, which I. I have no problem with him having his faith. Like, that's. I don't have an issue with that. Now, I do not for one second want to ever construct that Benedictine or really any other people who practices faith agrees with what he's saying or think what he's saying is okay. What I do have an issue with is that when he uses his faith to say things like this that are not okay, and then the school allows him to have an opportunity to say things like this in front of so many people. Quick sidebar, but why is a professional athlete, especially a kicker? Not saying that a kicker isn't difficult, very hard. But why is a kicker speaking at a college graduation, a school he didn't go to, in an area he's not from? It just doesn't really make any sense. It's also been something that really gets me angry is when people use their faith. And again, I don't think anyone who practices Harrison Bucker's faith agrees with this, but it gets me annoyed when people say things like this, and then when people get mad at them, they use excuse of, oh, well, it's what I believe, it's my faith. Like, that's bullshit, right? Like, someone can't say, oh, I think a certain demographic of people will die, and then when asked about why that's bad, they say, oh, well, it's because my faith of Scientology believes that. No, that's not Okay. But, yeah. Guys are douche. He deserves all the shit he's getting. He should know better than to say that. Will he be caught? I don't know. We'll just see."

But if you wanna go just on the league itself, how many games has Arsenal drew in that year? Was it like 12? Something like that. How many games have Lavacruzin drew? It's not even a debate mate, the Invincibles is overrated anyway. Fantastic achievement but forest was invincible, Preston was invincible, Arsenal went the first and Hannah not the last. It's like as always, Arsenal fans can't have that someone else done something better than their team. Levy cruising hands down better Invincibles. End of.",

Um, yeah, he's an Everton fan. He obviously values brown flight quite highly. Um, and the report in the. The report is talking about, says that United are prepared to offer 55 million for brown flight, uh, as he's one of our main targets this season. So in the video, basically, um, if I remember rightly, he goes on to say that maybe 80 million is probably more, uh. More what the value should be. Um, and for me, that feels high for someone like Brown Fay. Um, he's. He's good, he's promising, he's young, he's. There's obviously a talent there. Um, but how much is a fair, um. A fair value for a player like that? Um, I mean, if you. If you slap on 80 million, hundred million for someone like him, then you're gonna go, let's just say, uh, Saliba, Arsenal. If Branford's 80 million, Saliba's what, hundred and fifty million, then you. You kinda setting them the. The markets getting skewed then, because players are getting massively over, uh, overvalued. I mean, I've seen a lot of talk of why would Bramford leave Everton? Uh, why would he, uh, downgrade to go to Man United? It's crazy. Um, the facts of the matter is, if United can call in with the money that Everton can be happy with. Branford will 110% sign on the dotted line for United in the same way that Rooney did in German. If. If we want a Nona, if we. If we give Everton the money that they want for a Nona, a Nona will come to United. Because we are Man United. It is. That is just when United come calling, there'll be very few players, especially at that level. I mean, neither Nirvana or Branford are at the sort of top tier players at the moment, so I think at that level, I think they will come to United in a heartbeat. But yeah, I found it interesting the. The values of players, um, as I thought it was a little high, what he said, about 80, hundred million sort of thing. For brown fight. But yeah, get in the comments, guys. Let, let me know what you think. Um, how much you think brown fights worth? How much you think, uh, it may take to. To get the deal done for United? As I say, he's. He's apparently one of our main targets this summer with Michael Elise from Palace. So yeah, get in the comments, let me know what you think about this one.",

    "voice_to_text": "Did our top 10 quarterbacks. Here is the top five. At No. 5 I have Justin Herbert. The hypothetical. There is nothing more that pisses me off than I mean, one horrendous takes, but two when people's arguments are double sided. And a lot of his arguments were extremely double sided and horrendous. So. I mean, if you didn't see the list, I'll break it down for you. He had Patrick Mahomes 1. Josh Allen 2 3. Aaron Rodgers 4. Stafford 5. Justin Herbert 6. Stroud 7. Jordan Love 8. Dak Prescott 9. Joe Burrow and 10. Lamar Jackson and his reason for Lamar being that low is that he had the most overrated any pieces and he's ever seen. And also can't stay healthy, mind you. He had Justin Herbert at 5 and he said that he wasn't able to show his true talent because he's dealt with injuries his career and his weapons have also been injured. But the thing on the more was he can't stay healthy. See where I'm getting at then? He also said the MVP this year should have went to Josh Allen. Mind you. He threw 19 interceptions this year. He threw more interceptions than there were games played. Turnover machine. And then Joe Burrow for being No. 9. He said that he had one of the most overrated playoff runs and Joe Burrow does nothing special outside of his accuracy. And then put Dak Prescott above burrow. And Dak hasn't won a Playoff game since 2022 against the Buccaneers. Since COVID, the Cowboys have literally won one playoff game. Other than that, they've been first round exits. And he also said Joe Burrow has a lot of talent and can't do anything with it. Dak Prescott had prime Zeke, Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup when he was still producing, CD Lamb, Dalton Schultz, Zach Martin when he was younger, and Tyron Smith when he was younger. Talk about a loaded roster to only win what, like 2 3 playoff game and then. I mean, Herbert at 5? I don't hate it, but he is hasn't won a playoff game since he's been in the league. Stafford's also been unhealthy and he put him at 4. I. I just. I. I don't understand it."

    "voice_to_text": "Was an achievement. But that wasn't really necessarily all about Arteta, was it? Cause. Cause he. You fuck this up royally and you know it. Because you brought up Pochi's little points tallies, then you slipped in Arteta's FA Cup, then you started to stumble, because according to you, that can't be considered his achievement. Okay, okay, cool. By Leverkusen made nine signings at the start of the season, seven permanent, two loans. They've just gone on to win the Bundesliga. They could win the treble. Going unbeating throughout an entire season. Are we just gonna say that isn't Alonzo's achievement? Because you have a. 17 players in the squad are not his. Ten. Hag made six signings in his first year at United. Two loans, one backup goalkeeper free permanent. We just gonna say that the League Cup isn't his achievement because the other 20 players in the squad weren't his one. Absolute load of nonsense. If you manage a club from the start of a competition and win it, it's your achievement. It doesn't matter whether the players were yours or not. It's got absolutely nothing to do with it. And we beat Chelsea and city at the time with a mid table squad, which is actually quite impressive. And just for the record, I'll tell one more in six months than your last five managers combined. Like you guys would love a Community Shield. You can call it a Tim Pot friendly competition. At the start of The season. I can't even remember the last time you won that. It's probably before me and you were born. Have a nice day, fella.",

It's just a friendly, an exhibition match, you know, for kind of entertainment slash commercial reasons. Is it ideal? Maybe not, uh, but the players have played their last game. They shoot straight off, no interruption. Play the friendly, get back. Those who are on international duty in the champion European Championships will then start to prep. Those who haven't got international responsibilities will just go off on their holidays. And this. Would it have occurred if Tottenham had been in Europe this season? Not this time. And I don't think it would have probably been safe for pre season instead of post season. But it is what it is. People gloss over and club's desire to compete commercially and have to generate as much revenue as possible. And in this instance, Tottenham won a. Capitalised on a market share in Australia with Postacoglow in charge. Um, and well, light in Australia. So that's just how it is. Um, most teams in some degree that the top. They have this desire for an appeal overseas through some of their. Their players. Um, but that's. That's football. It's really not that deep. As for the fixture congestion suggestion. Oh, it's elite wordplay there. It's the end of the season, alright? Season's done. Um, the problem with fixture congestions is when you're competing in all France, in Europe domestically, uh, and you're getting Rearranged fixtures, um, weeknights, you're playing two or three games in a week. Things like that with. With squads at nowadays just struggle to cope with these demands. That's. That's the problem. Not a low intensity end of the season game where players with international responsibilities aren't gonna pay 90 minutes or. Or to any intensity whatsoever. That the flying is not ideal, but it is what it is. They're paid handsomely. It's part of the job to go and do these commercial things for your club. Um, and. And from a football fan perspective, it. It just gives fans across the globe something to, um, to watch, to support their team.",

Let me give you one player that's only got, what, a couple of caps for England that should definitely be going to the euros. That man, Abreccia Ezza. He's absolutely car. I've been saying it on here for quite a while now. I saw him when he was playing at QPR in the championship and I quite liked him, but it's very difficult because championships. The championship. He's doing it in the Premier League. I won't give you a long list of his assists and his stats and his passing statistics and his goals because they're there for all to see. We've got somebody that feels comfortable in the ball against top opposition. He can assist players, he can score, he can shoot well with both feet, he's. He can dribble past players. His first touch is just immaculate. I would try and compare him to players of previous generations, but there isn't really anybody because he isn't like a Lampard or a Gerard or a skulls. He isn't like a Brian Robson or a Paul Gascoyne. He's just a very silky player that beats players, can go with either foot, can score goals. And can assist. That's what we need in the euros.

Preferably, like, in an empty field so if he trips, he doesn't flatten the entire Tri state air. But I was like, even if they did, sketch and jinxie combined, they're still not taking him down. And so I volunteer as Tribute. K so weighs, like, an even one. 60 pound. I'm like a nice one. Fifty nine. So he's got a pound on me. But it's all about technique. And look, I may not have millions of followers like you guys, but I got heart. A heart that's, like, borderline deep fried. But this is an official call out video to queso. Everybody tag queso, jinx, and sketch in the comments. Let's make this happen. Preferably in an empty field or stadium. Maybe the Cardinal Stadium in my hometown. That way, if Keso and I following each other, we don't have massive casualties. And Keso, if you win, I'll buy you Wendy's on me. Let's do it, man. Keso better not win. I'm gonna go bankrupt.",

Because we've been following Palace yet a scene that their form has been an accident since new manager and just playing Chef United. Results would have went your way. Why would we want Champions League football? I'm speechless at that one if I'm being honest. Oh, the result was out of our hands. Yeah, you threw it out of your hands with fucking results like that. Oh, we'd rather give up Europe to stop Arsenal winning the league. And spot Scott news bang on what he's saying. I'm just saying this here now, the one year club isn't as successful as it should be. These are a big club, but with one of the smallest of small club mentality I've ever fucking seen. Great job. The history of the Tottenham is a fucking bottlers bottle jobs. Deal with it."

Now I was at a club here for preseason. One of the teams had to jog around the entirety of the pitch and the others were doing keep ball and then it switched and he was jogging around the outside of the pitch. Now doing 5 k would help you with this because it's long distance running mixed in with your football. So I would suggest you do both the intervals and the 5 K's. Don't just toss off the 5 K's this summer, cause when your team has you running crazy miles, you're gonna wish that you did it. KB's video is 100% correct in terms of match fitness, but make sure you're doing your 5 K's this preseason."

You're going to the playoff final, Wembley, and you got teenagers there and you got people that are well buzzing and happy about their team, they're gonna pitch invade. There's nothing wrong with pitch invading in that situation. Our outcome from last season where we pitch invaded for the ownership is a wrong thing to pitch invade, but it had to be done. So we wanted to go right out of our club. We got. We're getting them out of our club because that pitch invasion, um, as well as Millwall's. Millwall's the biggest team, pop. One out of all of it.

I've come across your content too many times now and I wanted to let it slide, but you really are doing my adding as a city fan. You're just one of those city fans that don't represent as well on social media. You look for views, you don't mean anything. You say all about this pen merch and what are you, two years of age? Throw flowers where flowers are meant to be thrown. Cole Palmer, let's be honest, has been one of the best youngsters this season in a Chelsea side that are not performing well. Foden, of course, could have won both, but you've got to look at it both ways. Foden is the player of the year. Deserved, but young player of the year. I won't mind it going to Parma, which it has done, because Parma has been great and shown that. So would you just tone it down a bit and stop looking for views and be honest and real about what you say? Cause you really aren't man. And I'm speaking hopefully for a blue saying that you aren't honest what you say and you are chatting out of your head."

Um, this West Ham fan absolutely speaks sense now that there ain't that much anymore secrets from West Ham. And I thought it's a big, strong London Derby. The rivalry between Arsenal and Spurs is obviously a lot higher level in terms of rivalry, but then I think West Ham are pretty much the same with Spurs. Might be wrong. So I appreciate this post, but it's, uh, this. This creator. Now, my background is I'm still Charleston and my mum's side, so is West Ham. So I will get behind West Ham whenever it's not Arsenal or the casual level. But they can do us a huge favour. Do the Liga favour and stop the city from dominating again for another year.

Up until last year, this was common knowledge that 99% of players in the portal weren't very good. Well, for some reason. Well, we all know the reason people think that. Oh, you can build a team off the portal. No, the portal is full of players who aren't good enough to play on their own team. Yes, you're gonna have the Joe Burrows, the Jane Daniels, the elite players. Like, there's only a handful of them. Every year they go from one team to another for whatever reason, which that's gonna happen. But this idea that you're gonna build an elite team from the portal is just fucking stupid. Because again, there's maybe a handful of players every year who are really good who wanna switch teams for whatever reason they want to, which is fun, but 99% of players, the reason why they switch teams because they're not good enough to start. So they're hoping that they go to a team that isn't as good they can get playing time, which happens every now and then. But again, most of these players aren't very good. If you're thinking about building a legit team from the portal. Not gonna happen. And if you don't believe me, look it up. Look at the teams who are top recruiting every year and look at the teams who are top In the transporter every year there's a big difference for a reason"

    "voice_to_text": "FIFA tweeted this on X app about Cristiano Ronaldo. See, this tweet was obviously, obviously not about Cristiano Ronaldo at all. But here we have a Ronaldo fan trying to force something that is not there. Shocking. First of all, look at the caption. Retiring as a legend. Has Ronaldo retired? So why would they caption it retiring as a legend if it was about Cristiano Ronaldo? And you saw how he conveniently blocked out Sony Chatri from the video so that he can deceive people that wants to be deceived. But I for one, I'm genuinely curious about the thought process towards making that video. Like you saw FIFA seed retiring as a legend, you thought it was Cristiano Ronaldo. You saw first, second and third and you think that this is the third best player after Ronaldo and Messi. This is the 3rd best player. The third good. Ha ha ha ha. Like you blocked out the person that he tweet was even about. Anyways, you can see in the caption here FIFA said soon in Chatri, the world's third highest active international goal scorer, will play his final game for India in the next month's FIFA World Cup qualifiers. He's about to retire. Legend by the way. Legend in India because he has the third most goals in active international football behind Lionel Messi. And that is actually an impressive fit. But of course, telling lies is always sweeter if you truly believe that Cristiano Ronaldo is The goat? Why do you have to lie to make him look like the goat? But sincerely speaking from the bottom of my heart. If there is any one person out there that watched this video and believed what this guy said in this video. You need deliverance, Wallahi. You need deliverance.",

I think maybe you need to take a break from social media, maybe get some sleep, because what you've just said is weird. Now, under Pochettino, you had your golden generation. For five or six seasons, an excellent Tottenham side. Certainly the best Tottenham team I've watched. There was a lot of excitement surrounding that squad. Expectations went through the roof, and rightfully so, because we all thought, myself included, that this Tottenham side was capable of finally breaking that curse and winning a major trophy. They were good enough to win the Premier League, a Champions League and FA Cup. But when that era come to an end, and it was all said and done, that absolutely nothing to show for it. Where is this Arsenal side are just starting. So you can't really call us hypocritical at this moment in time. And you can be proud of that Tottenham team, for the journey they took you on, for the moments they gave you. And it's something that you'll remember for the rest of your life, because that was probably the best years you've had, following that club, supporting that club. And it's great for yourself to remember that for yourself, because nobody really talks about that sort of thing. Like you wouldn't hear a Newcastle fan saying how proud they were of The side that nearly won the Prem in the mid nineties. Because nobody remembers second place, nobody remembers runners up. Great teams are ultimately judged on the trophies they win. And I would be generally shocked if this Arsenal side doesn't win the Premier League in the next two or three seasons. Like we're proud now. I'm a proud Arsenal fan right this moment for the improvement was shown, the fact that we've significantly closed the gap on Manchester City and we're competing. I'm proud now, but ask me again in three years if we haven't won anything in the next three years, I wouldn't be saying the same thing. Maybe we just have a different mindset. Maybe we just look at things a little bit differently. And I think deep down you know that this Arsenal side is very, very close to winning a Premier League. And you probably expect them to do something very impressive in the next couple of seasons. And I think that's why you're saying it. But to call us hypocritical at this moment in time, for me, it's. It's just a little bit premature.",

In 1 speech he was like F u and f u and f u like who let this man speak who approved his speech I know these things have to get approved what is going on and to Harrison butt kicker whatever your name is shut the frick up like ha ha ha ha I will never take a man's opinion seriously about my body so or like no offense anything really",

And I, I realize that I cannot speak for all Broncos fans up, but I'm just gonna say that I am okay with as many roughing the kicker penalties as y'all want to rack up this season when we play the Chiefs. Just nail his ass to the turf. I am fine with it. I'm good. Just. Just keep doing it. The entire line can just stomp his face into the fucking turf. I, I cannot with that, man.

It's not brave to be racist in a culture that relies and thrives on racism. So this man is not saying anything new. We've heard it all before. It's in a prettier packet, behind a lectern, dressed in a robe, speaking before a well dressed audience. But it's hate all the same, even if from his perspective, he wants to call it love. As I say, the Chiefs do decide to dismiss you, which they probably only do because of public pressure. You're still gonna have the millions you've already made. You'll probably still get paid the rest of your contract. You have plenty of conservative piggy banks waiting to scoop you up to prove their agenda. The agenda that you have apparently bought into. The only question is, I don't know if you know that it's intentional or if you really believe it. But back to my main point. There is no amount of sophistication, no amount of love, no amount of elegance, no amount of bravery that you can add to your hatred to make it no longer be hate. Grace and peace.",

But the problem is unless there's a massive overhaul in referee in the Premier League and the VAR officials, we're still gonna get these same mistakes. And I can't see how they're just gonna, I don't know, suck a load of people and go right, we need a load of new people in. Then you gotta wait for them to bed in. Or is it gonna work? It's a lot to change. This is why I feel we should just get rid of it. Because maybe come, maybe come back, maybe they re rethink it and whatever.

Love them to pieces, but they are. They know this, they don't agree with it, but at least they're aware of my feelings. The thing is with that city game, irrespective of what it meant for Arsenal, all the world's on had something to. To fight for. Some prior to the miracle of getting into a top four, playing Champions League football. Whatever people think about it, I wanted us to. To win because there's a misconception that us winning was giving Arsenal a title. Arsenal in a position to win the title with a game remaining. Right. Regardless of what we did, stay there and the right to be there at first as I don't think wanna hear that. That's not me being a do gooder, that's just a reality. Um, so for me, I'd rather concentrate on Spurs. And I've been open all along and saying that obviously I want what's best for Tottenham first and foremost, but if we did happen to lose that one off, that individual game, I wouldn't lose any sleep. And I think most sensible football fans that you speak to would be the same. I don't agree with all the celebrating city goals and the type of fan, or the fans voicing their, um, opinions on that, on. On throwing the game away in front of possible I'd. I'd. I'd. I think that's made a joke of us, but ultimately think people take social media too seriously sometimes and get a bit carried away. Most people you speak to on a terraces, um, or in the pubs, on the street, whatever, and normal people, and they just have the. Want the best for their club and there. There's. There's rivalry. Don't get me wrong, of course there is. I think social media just exacerbates it. Right. What a word. What a word that is. Um. And, yeah, get a bit too carried away. That's. That's.

Anytime I hear a man hate woman this much and cling to some kind of religion, I just know they're gay. Did your wife, with her computer science degree, choose that tie for you? Not only did she say in an interview back in 2022 that she was a very independent person, they were high school sweetheart. So he spent years praying that she would convert Catholicism so that she could uphold this image of what a woman is supposed to be. Meanwhile, his mother holds advanced degrees as an actual physicist, and he has a younger sister. So he's surrounded by all these women with careers who could have careers, and yet he's here saying that they should be just wives and mothers. Time and time again. This has always been the case with DL men. And I don't wanna be that mean person accusing someone of their sexuality, but we've seen this over and over, that DL men just hate women so badly, they just use them as their beards.

And it won't surprise me if he left Tottenham now, obviously, in the summer, you're moaning at Daniel about Daniel Levy for winding up bringing the big players in because you missed out in Champions League. You have a chance to get in the Champions League, playing in the biggest club, biggest competition in Europe, and all you're more worried about is. But your rivals. Stopping your rivals by losing on purpose. It's ridiculous. It'd be funny, though. Man City draw her ass to win the last game because they'll win the title. So small club in town.",

Oh, this guy is so lucky he didn't make that speech at the Christian Brothers North Philly school I went to, because let me tell you how that would have played out. Um, I would have heard him drop the your purpose is to be a homemaker part. And then all of a sudden, I'm staying enough at this point, I'm ready to book towards the stage. But I guarantee you there's a bunch of women before me who are already up. They're probably already on the stage at this point, and then they're going after this guy, and there's gonna be so many women that security just couldn't hold them back. And then I'm up on the stage, and then the Christian Brothers, aka the priest, are like, yeah, we don't like this guy for what he said. These women worked hard to get to where they are at, and there's some of the smartest in our classroom. So now we got the priest on the stage, and the priest have our backs. And then security, because we're in North Philadelphia, security will definitely have our backs. So now we got security up there, and once we get the security, the priest, now the dudes are coming in, because let me tell you something. They're gonna have our backs. They are going to have our backs because of men at my University definitely always had our backs. So they're coming in. So now we got the whole university on this guy, and then you got the dads. Now the dads are down there. The dads ran down, and they're like, no way. This guy did not just say that to my daughter on her graduation day. Not a shot. So now we got the dads in there, and then the moms are also like, yeah, that's my baby girl. And how dare you? How dare you tell her that on her graduation? So now we have the moms, the dads, the priest, the guys, the security guards, and then this guy has about thousands of people just hounding him. He's not walking out of there, bro. God, he's done. NFL is like, Mindblown. NFL is just, like, about to sue the school. And then we're posting the video, like, how dare this guy? And then it feels like, yeah, you right, you right. This guy's bad news. We're done with him. Done with him. His only purpose was to kick balls. But, you know, there's so much other talent out there. So we're gonna hire somebody else because he's misogynistic. He's bad luck on our organization. That's how that would have played out. That guy would have never walked out of that school. He would have never walked off our campus. He would have been done for. Done for, period. And this speech is incredibly disgraceful and misogynistic.",

The team mentality was to go for it. I think this is gonna come down to the fact that, unfortunately, like you said, like you said before the game. I have TV. Spurs ain't good enough to beat city. Fair enough. They gave it a good enough go, but they just weren't good enough at the end of the day. And then city did what city does, and then they just turned up again and they just turn them over. But San is deliberate. What, just to stop you winning the league? No. No, you did that when you went to the Etihad for a draw, when if you're meant to be as good as them, why don't you come out and play and try and beat them?

And this really is a dumb conversation because I know, you know, sports talk, you know, needs something to talk about. But the idea of that one pro from one sport could just walk in and be a pro at another sport, it's just really fucking stupid. Oh, the athletic ability, the height, the size, none of that shit fucking matters, because at the end of the day, you have to have the skill set. It doesn't matter your size, strength, any of that shit. You have to have the skill set. You take any NBA player you want to. I can grab a bunch of college football players, and they'll be more athletic than them. The idea that you're more athletic because you're a pro in one sport, that's just stupid. Just because you're a pro in one sport doesn't mean you're so much better athletic than everybody else. You're pro in that sport because you have the skill set necessary to be a professional. It's not their athletic ability that makes you a pro, it's your skill set. So let's say NBA player did try to play in the NFL. What position would they play? Quarterback? No way in hell. Offensive? Defensive line? They're not big enough. And again, they don't have the skill set. Defensive end. You know, they had the size, but again, they don't have the skill Set. If you don't have the skill set to get off blocks and the strength to get off blocks, you never gonna play tied in or receiver. That's the one everyone keeps talking about. They just say oh yeah, those are the most likely positions they could play, but again, they would need to. Skill set. If you don't know how to get off blocks, if you don't know how to get open. If you don't have the speed or acceleration to get separation, you're not gonna play Corner. DB, same thing. You don't have the skill set and it doesn't transfer over. Your skill. Your speed or acceleration on the basketball court isn't the same as in NFL. So again, don't have the skill set. And I've heard a few people say linebacker, and the biggest part of that with again is the skill set. Play recognition. Because you don't have the skill set of knowing what plays look like and haven't practiced it and kind of know what you're looking at. Even if you can tackle, even if you have the speed, if you don't have the muscle memory to look at, to look at the plays and know what plays developing and be able to act fast enough on that play, you're never gonna play. Because no matter how big or strong or fast you are, if you don't have the skill set to dissect the play and make the play fast enough, you're not gonna play So again, no. No NBA player could just walk in and be in the NFL.",

And 2, just having some bimbo sits out on the third page of a paper. That's all they're fucking known for. It was recently is January. The school mags are making up false stories for a bend over ill fan. This is during Baltimore versus Cheltenham's game in January. Ah, ill fan was in Purslow. A 71 year old fan who sadly had a cardiac arrest the game and didn't make it. Fuck the scum. They don't deserve to be used as any form of credible source.

Because if we get into the Champions League and we beat Man City because of that, we're not gonna win it, are we? Let's be honest, not with this current squad. We don't look good enough to win the Champions League next year. We might make a few good signings, but realistically, it's not gonna get us very far. So, look, if we're gonna be object failures, then we're gonna bring you down with us. Cause if we beat city tonight, and then we beat Sheffield United and somehow Villa lose to Palace and we get Champions League football, it's gonna feel empty.

    "voice_to_text": "50% nearly of Tottenham fans would rather beat city and hand the trophy to Arsenal. Tottenham are not handing the trophy to Arsenal if they get a draw or win tonight. How they handing it to him? There's 38 games in a season. So Man City helped Arsenal then, that's what you're saying? Because Man City got one point against Arsenal in two games. So Man City handed it to him today. Liverpool lost to him at the Emirates. Did Liverpool help him as well then? So all these other teams have helped us to win now that to win all them games fair and square. It's not Tottenham's problem. Tell them they're not handing it. It's a 38 game season. What do you think Ange and the players are gonna do? They're professionals. They cannot turn up and give the game away. It's unprofessional and it's match fixing which we don't want in the game. Alright, I'm not gonna moan at Ange or the players if they get a draw or win. I prefer Arsenal not to win it. But they're not handing them mate. They've won it fair and square. It's a 38 game season, not one match in north London on a Tuesday night. Now if city beat em fair and square, which I would suggest they will, cause everyone's got this Assumption that Spurs are just gonna rock up and get a draw or a win. I would assume that city is still gonna win after All this nonsense, but if they didn't after I haven't been handed it by Spurs. They've earned it over 38 games, so let's not get it twisted, alright? And for all the ones that want Spurs to win, that's up to them. They're Spurs fans and they want their team to win. They're entitled to do that when Spurs play and they're at the ground if they want Spurs to beat Man City because they paid their ticket and that's their team, they don't care about the repercussions. They just wanna watch their team win. And that's how is. You can't tell fans what to do. Do the polls now and cheer city goals. They can't do that. So they haven't handed them nothing. But like I say, the good chance is city gonna win 3 4 nil anyway and it'd be the end of it. But they haven't handed them nothing. If Spurs get a draw or a thing, that's just a load of nonsense.",

By the team, by the club, a business, to go and lose on purpose? So you realise, um, the metrics that antipostacle glue, um, is measured and judged by, by Daniel Levy is. Is winning and success. And yet you say it's a sackable offense for him to come out and say, why would we lose on purpose? We need to be winning every. Everything. In fact, the words he used are pretty much spot on. Because to a manager, bragging rights mean nothing. Bragging my rights being nothing to us, they mean something, but to the manager, it means nothing if he's doing his job properly. So I just think spur supporters are upset with Angie at the minute. Just grow up. Honestly. He's doing a job. His job is to win and be successful. If he's gonna force the game to lose, how does that look?",

    "voice_to_text": "I just thought of something that could happen in this tower race that would give us Arsenal fans a severe and deeply traumatic psychotic experience. I'm a Dortmund fan, and Bayern versus Leipzig last season was my version of Spurs versus city. Leipzig B Byron at the Allianz. And ensured that the title race was in Dortmund's hands going into the final day. All we had to do was beat minds at home who are fighting for nothing, and Dortmund would be champion. Not a result itself on the final day, of course, did a great deal of emotional damage to me and every Dortmund fan. But it was the days leading up to the final day where I think we felt the highest stress levels by far. And it was just because we all knew exactly what the team was capable of. We knew it was very plausible that we could just play well, win the game compatibly and win the title. Or it was plausible that we could just throw away the game completely, as we had done many times throughout that season, and lose the teams that we really should have beaten. If the outcome of the title race wasn't in our hands at the start of the final day, I think the stress levels would have been a lot less dangerous. Because at that point, it's just hope. Like, oh, maybe Byron, sleep up, you know, there we know they're not gonna, but who knows? Maybe They will. But because it was in our hands, I think every Dortmund fan can agree that the day is leading up to that final game, it felt like we're all in an insane asylum. And right now it's possible that Arsenal fans could be in that exact same position. So I will say to all Arsenal fans out there, if you are feeling stressed and you feel like you're going a bit mad, just wait and see if Spurs beat city, because then you will start to feel like you're actually going insane. And believe me, oh I get it, it's not fun. Like knowing that it's in your control, but also knowing that there's the juggernaut of the league lurking behind you, just waiting on your side to sleep up. And you know that if your team does the unmentionable, then you all will need therapy. I get it, it's not fun. I have lived it. So with that being said, Arsenal fans, you all should still hope that Spurs beat city tomorrow. But if it happens, get ready to experience the deep, dark inner workings of your psyche. You will celebrate a Tottenham victory if it happens, but it will be short lived, as you will soon after enter into the same insane asylum that we Dortmund fans were in the same time last season. Good luck. It's not fun.",

That would just seem so unrealistic to most people. At that time. We were literally heading to Kenilworth Road to the 2 1 lead and was about 16th. We finished 16th the next season. The championship is absolutely. It's just so disappointing and it's so sad cause we were all sun and fans were so excited and just so ready for what was to come. With all the Premier League was on the horizon and I still think it is. But realistically we've just had a nothing season. And it's just so sad to say. A lot of players who started that game, players like Pierre Eckworth, Patrick Roberts were unbelievable last season, especially towards the end. And this season haven't looked like footballers. I just don't know what's happened. Obviously we've lost. Lost players like Amadiyallo, who was obviously massively crucial last season, but what. It's just gone so wrong and it's so sad to say, but there's a lot of players in that team who are still at the club right now and who are Still unbelievably talented footballers. If we build correctly, bringing them right manager and if we re we actually invest our seals this season. Well, I have no doubt that we should be there again next season because it was. We're not far off. We've just had a terrible miss up of a season with no true manager. It's just been a shambles. But I'm excited to see what's coming next season.

But like, they'd meet him up leaving Arsenal. Like what? I guess there's a small part of me that isn't actually completely surprised. She's obviously had a really hard time coming back from her injury and we've seen what's like Sistina Laxenius and Alicia Russo can do together at front, but still. So it's just a lot to process. Um, as a lot of people saying that it might have been a mutual decision, and maybe it is. Maybe she does actually just want to take on a new challenge. But that leads me to my next point. On the next mind blowing news, there are now reports saying that she is going to go to Manchester City. Man City and Vivian Mitama. Can you just like, imagine the partnership of Vivian Mitama and Bunny Shaw up front? It's not even fair. I'm saying it right now, if city don't win the WSL title this year, if they make this happen, they're winning it next year. Calling it right now, Man City WSL title 2025."

    "voice_to_text": "14 Premier League goals for Nicholas Jackson, by the way. Stop putting respect on his name. Hundred percent. Nicholas Jackson deserves so much credit and praise. To come into this underperforming Chelsea team and score 14 Premier League goals in your debut season when predominantly, I don't think is a strikeout, is more of a winger, is really impressive. Has it been perfect? Far from it. But it gets far too much criticism because we've been underperforming. Boy, he. He shouldn't be the main man leading that line. We should already have a strike in place where he can learn from. He's been put in a deep end because the board have been neglected that position and we've had to use him. And there's times when we could have maybe benched him, but we can't cause we don't have no one else. So I wanna give him full credit to Nicholas Jackson. You know, he's got so much to learn in his game. He's only 22. He can improve, vastly improve on his finishing, which needs work on. But there's a player there and all I wanna say is credit to you, Nicholas Jackson. Keep it up, keep performing up the Chels",

Don't know why I'm biting to this cause this guy does it for views, but Kai Abbots and the rest of the Arsenal team and Arteta will be supporting Spurs on Tuesday. It's going to happen. And most of the Arsenal fanbase are gonna be supporting Tottenham on Tuesday. They want the title. It's as simple as that. They're not worried about fucking anything else other than winning the title because they want the Premier League title. So what if habits is said I'm supporting fucking. I'm gonna be a Spurs fan. Most of them are. You're not gonna sit there and go, it's hope Spurs get splattered, are you? You want Spurs to fucking get a draw or a win, surely? Or don't you want Arsenal win the title? And if Spurs don't win, you're not gonna support West Ham either? Of course you are. It's ridiculous. If it was the other way around, I'd want Arsenal to draw with city, wouldn't I? Of course I would. I'll be. Come on, Arsenal, you gotta do this, man. Of course I would. You shouldn't be expecting favours cause you blew it against Villa twice and. And Fulham. That's the way it goes. But in this predicament that you're in, of course you need a favour. And why wouldn't you ask for it? And why wouldn't you cheer on that team for one game? It's just ludicrous what you're saying, really. Unless you don't want Arsenal win the league, which you probably don't.",

Obviously had your Ryan Adams, your Dan Brown scoring all the goals, but manch dog, he was silky with it. He could put a ball in the top bins, he could make someone, he could lose the ball. Everything he did was perfect. And now he's out here. Look at him in his. In his grown man stages. Retired.

Firstly, Rory, every team at home do a lap of honour to say thank you to the fans. That's what they do. Not because they won something. They take their kids on the pictures you saw with Madison Romero, etcetera, etcetera. Kicking the ball in the goal and going round to the fans, signing a few autographs and that's it. You're saying, but they've got a game Tuesday night against city. Why are they not doing it then? It's quite obvious, isn't it? Because that was rearranged and it's midweek and a lot of the families won't be bringing their children along and their families when it's a late night midweek game. It was penciled in for this. The Man City game was rearranged so a lot of the fans and the players and staff won't be able to bring their kids at that time and night cause they probably got school or nursery in the morning. Do you sort of understand now? And they won't be doing a lap of honour at 10 o'clock at night cause a lot of the fans are gonna be home and up for the next day. Comprene date. So it's nothing to do with, oh, you got a game Tuesday, why you not doing the lap of honor? And it is penciled in for this game because it's in the afternoon and all the Kids and everyone else can go for the families. Alright? It's quite simple.",

    "voice_to_text": "And I hope this is enough to, you know I'm saying yeah, football's better bro. And yes, I'm back again. And you did say I did make two videos about you, which is true, but because you made two separate points about Formula 1, I chose to react to both of them in two separate video. And all the hate in the comment about not claiming me as an F1 fan. I've been an F1 fan for 16 years. If you don't claim me, I don't care. But let's get into the video. The first point you made was about the response into the Roman Gros on firecrash. And you did say about football players collapsing on the pitch. And in Formula 1 there have been many deaths. Two of the most famous ones is Ayrton Senna and Jos Bianca. And in Formula 1 you do get carried away on a stretcher. For example Joe Grande's crash in Silverstone. My second point was about Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen title fight. Now that is much better than the World Cup final or Guerrero's last minute goal just because of how much controversy there was in that vape. And if you still don't believe me then watch the race on YouTube because you can watch the highlights and you could probably find the full race online. Another point you made was about the international part of the sport. With F1 you travel continent to continent, country to country. And yes, there Is parts of the football, which are international. But if you are competing, you're only gonna be in that one continent, all that one country. For example, the World Cup was only held in Qatar. The UEFA Champions League is only part of Europe. And you did mention about the other leagues, but those are only part of the continent. The only time in football is across the entire world is the World Cup. That's only in one country, as I've just stated. Another point is about rivalries, and F1 has got better rivalries than football. Now hear me out. In F1 you are going toe to toe with your rival for the whole season, across the entire year. And the best rivalries within F1 is hunt versus Loudest, Center versus Post, Lewis Hamilton versus Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton versus Max Verstappen. And in football you do have the rivalries, the main one being Messi versus Ronaldo. But because they are not going against each other for the whole season or the whole year, it's not very good. It's still a good rivalry, but in my opinion it's not as good as Formula 1. And another point you made was about the circle. Now spa has got many sides to it. Circles only have one. Now I know it's a figure of speech, but it still annoys me. And I just wanna say we've got no beef between us. I messaged him, he messaged Me back. He likes football. I like 4 1 1. I like a bit of debate. So I don't really mind doing these videos, but if you're still watching, I wanna know your opinion. Comment. Which do you think is overall the better sport, F1 or football? And remember to follow for more and podium vibe in bio.",

The just always be a joke whatever the case may be. But they did certain things for Zach Wilson to try to help him. They went and drafted Gary Wilson. They drafted Breeze Hall. They went and. Excuse me, they went inside Corey Davis who was a top 10 pick as a receiver. And not to mention they have a way better coaching staff with Robin Solo versus what Adam Gates was with Sam Darnell. Breece Hall is literally three times the running back Levion Bill was. And Frank Gore at them points of their careers. I mean his No. 1 option was Robbie Anderson and I think Rashad Perry made his last season there. And to top it off he had a significantly worse defense. Yeah bro, it's not close. It's Sam Donald. It's not close.",

Pick up basketball and play professional basketball. Y'all are tripping, right? I'm not even a big NBA guy. Right? NFL football, college football. Football is my thing. Right. You know, I'm a college basketball fan, but NBA basketball, not my thing. That's neither here nor there. Basketballs, basketball rights about touch. It's a difficult sport. Y'all are tripping, man. It be so much more likely that you take somebody playing in the NBA. Right? There's a lot of positions to choose from in the NFL. You move them over, right? You find something, you take some of the bigger dudes in the NBA, you get something going. Right. Moving some dude over from NFL football to the NBA, right? You put a basketball in their hands would be utterly embarrassing. It probably wouldn't work. It'd be ugly. Right? I mean, what percentage of those dudes haven't touched the basketball since elementary school? And even that, right, you could take the multi talented dudes in the NFL that were playing basketball and football. Right? I mean, we're at the pro level of our career. Now so those dudes probably haven't touched a basketball and how long? Even if they're still playing pickup games in between the seasons, right? Bro, you put a basketball in their hand, send them to the NBA. Oh my god, it'd be ugly. Right? At least I know there's a few dudes in the NBA that potentially we can move over and put them tied in. Or do this, do that. So the answer is obvious. Stop the nonsense. Right, it is. Obviously it would be easier to find somebody in the NBA to move to the NFL. Right? Saying anything else is tripping. How is this such a divided question?",

    "voice_to_text": "And please don't kill me, please. First one's F1. Like they just racing. First of all, never, ever, ever talk bad about one of the greatest sports on the planet, Formula 1. Because when do you see someone walk out of a crash like this? This is Roman Groton, and he walked out of fire. Yes, he walked out of fire. And yes, I know they got protective equipment, bloody, bloody dark, but he walked out of fire. In football, Neymar gets tapped, rolls down the whole pitch and has to get carried away on a stretcher. Another point, we do not race around in circle. For example, this is one of my favourite tracks, Spa, Frankenshaw. And how is this a circle? Because this has got many corners and it's got many sides, and circles only have one. Another point. Formula 1 travels around the entire world. From Australia, Spain, America, Canada, Singapore. The only time when football goes around the world is when they're in a World Cup, but they're only in that one country. Formula 1 travels from one side of the world to another in three or four days. So Formula 1 is far more superior than football and, in my opinion, the best sports on the planet, because you do not get as many title fights like this. This is probably one of the best title fights in the modern era. 2021. And yes, in football, you might have the last minute goal, you might Have the bit that wins the game in penalties. But they do not get as close as 2021, when Max Verstappen had to overtake Lewis Hamilton to win on the very last lap. So if any of your friends or family or your dog, cat or goldfish talks bad about Formula 1, show them this video. Believe in the comments. Do you think Formula 1 is the best sport in the world?

    "voice_to_text": "It's easier to be a footballer than an F1 driver. I know that video, right? And yes, it is easier to become a footballer than a Formula 1 driver. And here's why. Now I'm not discrediting any other sports, going professional is easy. And this goes for Rugby, cricket, swimming, anything. But there are 130,000 professional footballers across the entire world. And there are only 20 Formula 1 drivers. And another reason why it's so difficult to become a formula one driver than a footballer is money. Because in a football season, you're only really gonna spend 300 pound max. That goes for football boots, shin pads and goalkeeper gloves if you are a goalkeeper. Well guys, if you wanna be a professional racing driver, you have to go to cars and that could easily cost a hundred thousand pound upward. Then you have other series like Formula 4, Formula 3, Formula 2. And those could easily cost a million plus. And yes, you will have sponsors, but I'm going out of own pocket. And you also said that you can become a professional Formula 1 driver in five years. And in my eyes that is complete bullshit. Because first of all, you're gonna start carting at a very young age. For example, Lewis Hamilton started at the age of eight. Second, of all, super licence points. You will not get the required amount of super licence points to even compete in probably Formula 3, let alone Formula 1. Third, Of all physical fitness. Because Lewis Hamilton said at the very first practice he competed in with Mclavin in 2,007, he said he wasn't able to even lift his head up after. So if you wanna do five years, good luck, because you probably won't even have a neck at the end of it. And yes, G forces are a real thing. For example, in Vadyon, you can experience up to 6 G force on the side of your neck. And at the bus stop chicane, you can experience up to 5G behind it. And that consecutively per lap for 44 laps is absolutely mental. So do me a favour, do some more research. But I want your opinion. What do you think is harder to go professional in it, Formula 1 or football? And also, what's more fun to watch, Formula 1 or football? So leave that in the comments. Follow for more.

Um, the fact that we're 18th in possession, I think in the Premier League right now. Um, we never have the ball, we don't want the ball. Um, we've just been done of Chelsea five nil. But if you go further than that, this season alone, we've been done by three goals more six times. Um, we were massively over performed in the start of first half the season. I think if anyone watched the the Monday Night Football, Jamie Carragher covered that, they'd know that. Um, we've considered the same amount of goals of as the ever ungrowned season when we got relegated. Uh, the only difference is this time is is we've. We've actually scored some goals in the first half season since January. It's relegation form. We've had two wins against Brentford and Everton. Um, as I said, I don't particularly needed Chelsea fans to try and educate me why we should keep him. Um, I think you should try and, you know, stick behind Poch and and go for his mid table finish. He's on about. He doesn't think we'll do anything better. Another lopitaggy. Lopitaggy isn't the man I want personally. And so I agree with That personally, I. I want that Amerin from Sporting Lisbon or Francesca. Um. But yeah, no, uh. Uh, yeah, I saw it and. And thought I might as well put my top tens in from a.

Let me tell you now, anyone that answered Jamie Vardy to that question, you are the problem with football today. People trying to say, oh, Jamie Vardy because he's won trophies. X, y, Z, bro, just shut up your mouth. Is it? If you really think that you'd rather have Jamie Vardy's career over Harry Kane just because Jamie Vardy's won trophies, you are the problem with football. This whole fixation on trophies, trophy, trophies. I don't know what you guys gonna say, oh, but trophies, that's what is all about. X, y, Z. Hold on. If you really, really, really understand football, one thing that you will understand is no one wins trophies by themselves. There's not one footballer ever, in the history of anything that has won a trophy by themselves. If I am a striker and I score 100 goals a game, as long as my defence concedes 101, I will not win trophies. Doesn't matter how many goals or assists I get, I can't win a trophy by myself. Football is very different to your tennis or your table tennis, whatever those single, those single player sports where if you're good at golf, and you're the best at golf, you win it. If you're good at tennis, you're the best at tennis, you win it. You can be an amazing, amazing. Look, Messi, Ronaldo, you can be so, so, So amazing. But because of your teammates, you may not win. It's simple as that. I'm trying to get this through people's brains is actually the most difficult thing in the world. Trophies is not the be or an end or of who's better. If you're comparing someone and you instantly go to trophies, I understand that you don't understand football straight off the bat. Like, I can't. I can't have the conversation with you. Harry Kane has had a way, way, way better career than Jamie Vardy. It's simple as playing at the top flight of football, playing for England, being in multiple competitions, it's easy. Scoring the most goals, his name will go down in records. It's simple as that. Like, the fact that that can't go through people's heads is crazy to me. No one wins a trophy by themselves. Like, simple as."

    "voice_to_text": "Way too many games this year where it came down to the last minute and they end up pulling out some lucky. I think it's a good question. How would this barrel of accusing team perform in the Premier League? Could they compete for the title? Do check out box to box this video if you haven't. I really do love their channel. But there are a few things that I have to say on this question. First and foremost is a part that I clipped about how many times this season buyer have pulled out a result like a win or a draw by scoring a lucky goal or two in stoppage time. So let me just say, in my lifetime I can recall another team who has scored this many game deciding goals in stoppage time over the course of a season and in all competitions. So we all know that look and fine margins are a very real part of football. And I know sometimes that things are said maybe a certain way to be a little bit controversial, which is fine. But if we say it's lucky for biolevoc using we have to keep that same energy, alright? And when another side does it in Madrid, we can't turn around and say well, it's just cause they're inevitable and it's in their blood. That shows who they are. The same has to apply for Liverpool and. And we should also remember that this Bayern Munich team Versus whom Real Madrid had to pull it out there behind in stoppage time, once again at home, is the same Baron Munich team who got clapped up and put into a split by a buyer, Leverkusen at home in what was a crucial, high stakes top of the table clash. So yeah, I do think it's an interesting question. When you look at their team, they really are playing devastating football. It is fast paced, super efficient and just high quality all around the pitch. And it's not just the 11 starters that are performing well. I mean, their main striker was out for months and they were still able to find ways to win games, including in Europe. Now, do they have the deepest squad in the world? No. Do I think that they could beat a team like Man City? Yeah, I think they could. Do I think the odds would be in their favor? Probably not. It really is tough to say. What is easy to say is that I am hyped, and we should all be hyped for a team coming off of what could be the greatest club season of all time, competing next season against the likes of Real Madrid and the likes of Arsenal and Man City, etc. It is a very exciting prospect. And as a quick last note, if you are somebody who has been keeping up with bio live accusing season but not really watching their games, I implore You start watching their matches, you will not regret it. The only thing you might regret is that you didn't start tuning in from earlier in the season. They are playing some of the most spectacular football we are seeing in Europe at the moment.",

It's been numerous games this season, last season, the season before, in the Premier League, in Europe and in fucking European competitions. I've seen numerous decisions that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. And afterwards they keep apologising they're not accountable. It is match fixing. It's corruption and there's bungs and people laughed at me. Year, year and a half ago when I come out with match fixing is loads of it going on. It's blatant. We're all seeing it with our eyes. And you see it tonight like everyone else see it tonight. There was no reason for him to raise that flag. There was no reason for the ref to blow as quick. He couldn't wait to blow the whistle. The ref soon as the flag, it was straight on it. It tells you something unfortunately. I know a lot of people think it's a wonderful game, but since Vals coming it's got even more corrupt. It was supposed to Ryan out all the decisions. The referee was supposed to be honest. It is disgraceful. I've seen so many decisions in the Premier League where you blatantly look at it and they go the other way. You like what they doing, you can clearly see this is wrong 100%. And yet they still go the other way. There can't be anything else. Other than corruption and greasing the palms with money. It's match fixing, isn't it? Is. That's what you're saying, and that's what I've been saying. I'm not saying every match is fixed, but quite a lot are, and a lot of them are getting away with it and it's ruining the sport. It's now not a sport, it's now a business and it's totally out of order."

    "voice_to_text": "Offensive line was bottom five in the NFL last year and they took a wide receiver at six and this might be one of the worst takes I've seen. Why would we have taken a tackle or any lineman at six? I think obviously O line is insanely valuable, but I do think there are situations where people way over value O line. It's not to say that. Oh, it's not valuable to get a guy who's great on your line, but why would we pick at six? Alignment. After failing with Evan Neal? After just only successfully being good with Andrew Thomas, who developed on his own with the position we're at right now? With the value we have with pick No. 6, why would we pick alignment? We have no weapons. You go for weapons first. Malik neighbors right now makes us better than what we would be with like any tackle or guard we pick right now. Not to mention the biggest issue with the Giants has been developing Oline talent. Bobby Johnson was not a great Oline coach whatsoever. We brought him Priscilla from the Raiders and he brought a tackle of his own from the Raiders as well. We signed Runion from the Packers. We have a line that can still at least manage to get something going. You saw how much better they looked with Tyrod Taylor and Tommy DeVito. Which tells you about the fact that the majority of their problems on the O line are O line, but there also is problems with pocket presence that make the O line look worse. I just can't understand people who are like, they should have taken a tackle at six. It was either quarterback or receiver. Taking tackle now would have been a dumb idea. Again, it's not to say that a guard or tackle wouldn't come in and be good, but you have to think of the value you have right now, what your roster looks like right now. If I had, like, a top four pick, I had no good assets or value on my team whatsoever. No quarterback, no nothing. And there's a bunch of options available. I'm not gonna go, give me that right guard, dude. No, I'm like, give me Drake may. Give me Malik Neighbors. Give me Marvin Harrison Jr, a guy that will make a massive impact offensively this exact second. Like I said, I think it's valuable to take alignment, but you have to understand what the giant situation is right now and where their biggest problem is. It's not just, oh, everyone on the team is bad, they can't develop an online. We gotta stop letting fantasy football people have takes. Like, I can't believe this.",

He has won the top division with Leicester City. With my club. He's won the FA Cup with also Leicester City. He's won the Golden Boot. Harry Kane has. Fair enough, but Harry Kane's not scored 11 and 11 has he? No he hasn't because Vardy did it. And what's Harry Kane won? Nothing. He's even gone to Bayern Munich and has still not won anything. So moral of the story is Varley has had a better career than Harry Kane. Yes, Harry Kane is the better player right now. But I tell you now, Varney has a better career. So you guys are the biggest plebs of the day. And you probably will because it's not podcast. You're a bunch of plebs. Peace out. Varney is a better career. I love you.",

Cause I don't know how he can watch Matt Somos at any point in his career and think that he's not about playing center back. That's exactly what he like. I just don't understand how you cannot want for your defenders to be able to initiate plays and like carry the ball and distribute the ball effectively. Which, by the way, is exactly how Matt Tomos and nikoschlatovic operate. For Dortmund, especially in that game versus PSG, I think they had the most successful passes of anybody on the Dortmund team, which is not a surprise considering they were defending for most of the game. It has always seem to me like mostly British fans seem to have this kind of obsession with hired men and like it represents the good old days of football. You know when you centre Backswood, rough upper man and slight tackle man but basically have no skill on the ball otherwise? And I just don't see how you can put homos into that category. I think he does precisely both. He is just as physical and rough as you need him to be, but he can handle the bath. And I just don't see how that can be considered nonsense.",

No one at the time thought it were a good idea, no one agreed with it and is massively under achieved, no matter what anyone says. The whole owner has actually come out and explained his decision. Um, it's on Twitter if you wanna go listen to it. Basically talks about ambition, but I think he's made the right choice here. Rosinio will get another championship job, but that squad, that whole of was fucking criminal. Plenty of names thrown about. Steve Cooper, Danny Roll. Will still a couple of Turkish guys in there as well. Emery Bellozzo and Errol Bulloch who was at Cardiff or still could be at Cardiff. The favourite is Tim Walter who was at Hamburg last year. LED them to back to back third place finishes but couldn't get them promoted. Who knows what their manners at Hull will do. But it's gonna be another interesting riding of some of Hull fans. Hull fans, who do you want? Let me know."

That being said, where is this implicated into real life professional sports nowadays? Like legitimately, there's too many talented athletes out there for us not to have some form of street like fucking sports at this point. Why don't we have an NFL street league? Even if it wasn't like professional players, why isn't anybody hopping off a fucking wall and catching it behind their back? The money I would spend, the dedication I would have for a team in the league like this. Fucking 50 yard field, right? Walls on each side. You can have it in like fucking backyards or alleyways. Just like the game. Fucking 5 on 5, nothing crazy, right? Fucking quarterback to like two receivers, fucking lineman, you know, nothing, nothing running back, nothing crazy, right? Switch sides, fucking three, three Q4 quarter games. Fucking, you know, just where is it at? It didn't make money. No one's gone to Shark Tank. What if you like, you know, you got the. You got the D league players and you got fucking retired people that are like, you know what? I'm gonna go to this lesser league to still play cause I love the game, but I'm still cold like that. I Hate Brady, but you don't think Brady's gonna drop a fucking 30 yard dime until he's 60? Bro, bro, think about it, dog. We can bring in people from different fucking sports. Imagine just seeing Fucking Canelo running a pass. Like, what the fuck? Celebrities and shit. It would be great. It would be fantastic.

    "voice_to_text": "I think United should bring Ollie back. I genuinely do. That's where I'm at right now. This video is so bad their visionism is actually crazy. So ha ha, let's get into it. It's time. At the club until it went south was better than any other managers we've had by a distance. I mean it definitely wasn't when Meridio came in. He won two major trophies in his first year. Then next year he came second with 81 points. Only one, no trophies and never reached a points tally near to that. He played good football, he had the fans on side. He had people loving the club and enjoying going to games again, being proud to support. Supposedly he had fans back and joined Cody games again. That is ridiculous. We were under lockdown for those two seasons. And the part of the first season we weren't under lockdown, United were 5th in the table under him. United didn't play that good football under and like some United fans might like to make out, they created the fourth most chances in the league. Uh, under him. In the two full seasons he was in charge, much behind Liverpool, Chelsea and city. And he wasn't trusted. He wasn't interested with the budget that Erich Andersen had, or interested with signing the plays that he wanted to sign. Because the vast majority of the plays that he signed personally were great for us. And he had this fantastic talent. I Did? Ha ha. I mean, he spent 460 million in 3 seasons, signed Mcguire for 85 million, who wasn't deemed good enough. And you signed replacements for you. Signed Juan Pasaca for 55 million, who had offered pretty much nothing going forward and has pretty much disappeared since Ollie left the club. He spent about 20 million on Dan James Diallo and Alex Tellers, all of which who have done nothing at the club. He spent 85 million on Jaden Sancho, who at United has been there for three seasons and done absolutely nothing and didn't even turn up for training. Oh, and he chose to sign Ronaldo, by the way. He was offered him and he said yes, which he admitted to on the overlap interview. So if Ronaldo was supposedly his downfall, which I don't think it was, uh, that was his fault. And I think other than if you getting maybe Thomas Tuchel, who's a guaranteed serial winner, still at the peak of his powers, Ollie is the best man to bring in. He's genuinely the next best option for me. Correct. Tom Stukel is a fantastic manager, but he's not the only one available. Hansy Flick is literally available. A sex super winning manager with Bayern. Here's the highest win percentage at Bayern by far, by the way. You also have Zidane available, who I don't think would be the best option out of those three. But he won three Champions League. He's done it, he's proven it. And I think That's far better than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who's proven nothing in his career. I have no problem with Dale, but that video was awful.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is anyone else finding this league just boring? Premiers just is draining the life out. I'll be honest with you, I'm bored of people saying that the Premier League is boring when it's not. Top flight European football. World football for that matter. Big five leagues. The Premier League is the only one of those fives that's not already decided. Spanish league already been won by Real Madrid. Bundesliga already been won by Bayer Leverkusen. The only thing keeping that league afloat is the fact that they're unbeaten. And that we love seeing our English captain not get trophies. Italian league already won by Inter Milan French league already won by PSG. Even the Championship? Leicester pretty much won it by Christmas. Nobody doubted they were never gonna get promoted. If switch by Christmas time you would have put your house on it. It was only because Leeds made a late surge and if switch failed. But still, the top two expected by Christmas also went up. Not that exciting right? You talk about the goals like every goal 10 years ago was a screamer. It's just not the case. When you look back at highlights from 10 years ago, guess what you don't see the tap ins, see the screamers. You see the goals that people go back to and want to watch nowadays. Screamers still do happen, but you see every other goal, whether it's through match of the day. Social media is so easy to find every Single goal that went in. Screamers do happen. It's not like they've gone extinct. Another thing that people like to say is that it's boring because the three teams that come up go straight back down. How many times that happened in the 22 years of the Premier League? Once, in 1998. This would be the second time it's ever happened. It's common occurrence. It just happens all the time. I think to call it boring is lazy and an easy way out. Because you don't enjoy it. You might not enjoy it, doesn't mean it's boring. Okay? Premier League and football as a whole has changed dramatically all the time. How often do you see a team lineup in a 4 4 2 with a tall striker and a short striker and just cross it in? Constantly? How often do you see, like a decade ago, Leicester, a team lump the ball forward, have a target man knock it down? Or Stoke for that matter. They survive loads of these because they have that tactic. Football is constantly changing, and just because you don't enjoy this style of play doesn't make it boring. And although nobody's got this far in the video, let's talk about the top six quickly. Yes, the top six are probably gonna be the same going forward, probably because they have the biggest fans, the biggest revenue, the largest stadiums, the best facilities. Somehow that seems like a recipe for success, right? Um, plus it's Rarely ever that the big six actually finish in the first six spaces. There's often a Brighton and Aston Villa, this season a West Ham. It's not always the same. It is far from boring. So just stop being so negative about everything.",

Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration about not having strawberries. I know some people, like, are like, that doesn't matter. No ice cream. You eat frozen avocados as ice cream. Not to mention, I've seen numerous articles over the years about this, like, illegitimate child that, like, he was with this girl before Giselle, and he, like, paid the girl off to say it's, like, not his kid or whatever. That's all. Allegedly. I don't know if that's true, but that's what I've seen and heard, and that was commented about in the roast as well. Like, leaving your wife and kids just to say, like, hey, football. Which I am a huge NFL fan. I've grown up a cheese fan. And, I mean, that may make me seem prejudiced to this man, but, however, he's just a douche. I don't know if I can say that on TikTok. Also, the, like, deflating football thing. Not cool, man. I don't know. Never liked Tom Brady. Don't think he's attractive. My boyfriend has always been a Patriots fan, so little beef there, but, yeah, basically, Just hate Tom Brady"

He's saying regardless of the players you have, go and play the way you want to. And that's exactly what he's done with Tottenham all season. They've played good attacking football, attractive football. Tottenham have been one of the most entertaining football teams this season personally. So you can't now go back and say this age well cause you're talking about something completely different. His comments recently about needing more players and needing a rebuild as you say is because he does. We all can look at Tottenham and see there is loads of Deadwood in that squad. He's been there one season and brought in what, a few players? Of course he needs to rebuild that squad in order to start getting more consistent results. But of course, like everybody does on TikTok, they take a screenshot like that and they have to twist it to their agenda. Absolutely wild. Maybe if you actually read the quote you'll understand it a bit better, and that way you can't make mistakes like this in the future."

    "voice_to_text": "Didn't really happen in previous years. Why? Why do you think it's happening this season? Deck on race. I mean, this. This is a joke. I mean, the geezer's gonna sit there and say, the reason why we've lost so many games this season, the reason why we've been fumped as many times as we've been fumped this season, it's because we didn't have Declan Rice. We got we, we will. You could say we potentially worse last season with Declan Rice. So where's the excuse there? The guy is just full of excuses whenever he comes under pressure. It's everybody else's fault, not David Meyers fault. He even went on to say, and I. And I. I saw a quote. Excuse me? I saw a quote. That he started to blame players. That is the players mentality. The players need to do better. Granted, the players need to do better, but they're following your system. They're following what you want them to do. Defense first, attack. Maybe they're following your style of playing, mate. So you wanna blame the players? They're partly blame. They're partly to be blamed. But you are too. Stand up and take a fucking account for what you have done instead of sitting there blaming everyone else and then using Declan Rice as an escape goat. Or we could thought cause we lost Declan Rice. Shut up mate. You've replaced him with 3 brilliant players. 2 in the fucking midfield. Our reservoir price can replace What rice did so fucking fix up. I'm so glad that the announcements been made that you're leaving. Excuse, excuse, excuse. Pathetic.",

 reason as to why these things are happening   to   why   these   things   are   happening why are these things not as strong as the teams of Hood   are   these   things   not   as   strong   as   the   teams   of   Hood because obviously all of us are watching this now ha ha   obviously   all   of   us   are   watching   this   now   ha   ha I've seen our Bonnie and Chevy that getting beaten blue   seen   our   Bonnie   and   Chevy   that   getting   beaten   blue black everybody and losing town like we are seeing it   everybody   and   losing   town   like   we   are   seeing   it but you are not giving us a reason   you   are   not   giving   us   a   reason so let me give you guys a reason in English word   let   me   give   you   guys   a   reason   in   English   word there's a rule called parachute payments and uh   a   rule   called   parachute   payments   and   uh the Premier League gives money to the teams that are just relegated   Premier   League   gives   money   to   the   teams   that   are   just   relegated for a period of three seasons   a   period   of   three   seasons so that's to help them soften the Bill   that's   to   help   them   soften   the   Bill because obviously the money you're earning in the Premier League   obviously   the   money   you're   earning   in   the   Premier   League is not the kind of money that are going to be   not   the   kind   of   money   that   are   going   to   be earning in the championship   in   the   championship and because you got relegated   because   you   got   relegated it doesn't mean the salaries   doesn't   mean   the   salaries and the expenses that you've been paying on Premier League revenue   the   expenses   that   you've   been   paying   on   Premier   League   revenue it doesn't mean those expenses will go down   doesn't   mean   those   expenses   will   go   down or those expenses will disappear   those   expenses   will   disappear you still have the salary of a primarily club   still   have   the   salary   of   a   primarily   club so the primarily gives that money to soften the blue   the   primarily   gives   that   money   to   soften   the   blue but another thing that that money does   another   thing   that   that   money   does is the money does give them a competitive edge over the teams   the   money   does   give   them   a   competitive   edge   over   the   teams in the championship   the   championship you can't expect a team with hundred million in the bank to not   can't   expect   a   team   with   hundred   million   in   the   bank   to   not Be better than a team with 10 million in the back where   better   than   a   team   with   10 million   in   the   back   where except if you are Manchester United   if   you   are   Manchester   United but that's by the way   that's   by   the   way and it seems that the Premier League teams are just so much better   it   seems   that   the   Premier   League   teams   are   just   so   much   better tactically or physically than the championship players   or   physically   than   the   championship   players that's why a team will get relegated this season   why   a   team   will   get   relegated   this   season and come back up next season   come   back   up   next   season because they already have those players   they   already   have   those   players that are better than the championship players already   are   better   than   the   championship   players   already that's why Leicester won that's why Leeds is among the mix   why   Leicester   won   that's   why   Leeds   is   among   the   mix that's why Southampton is among the mix   why   Southampton   is   among   the   mix you not see a team go down to the championship   not   see   a   team   go   down   to   the   championship but I'm gonna become a medieval team   I'm   gonna   become   a   medieval   team except there's a some there's also   there's   a   some   there's   also there's something going on financially   something   going   on   financially or something really wrong in the opera uh   something   really   wrong   in   the   opera   uh echelons of the club   of   the   club so all this to say is not like the relegation teams are not trying   all   this   to   say   is   not   like   the   relegation   teams   are   not   trying they are trying we all saw the first few weeks of one

This is what football means to the fans and the players. You know, here a little while ago, he found himself not making it. The great at Wickham, went to Wimbledon, super club. He looked after him superbly well. Born in Iraq, found himself in the Iraqi and national team. I know they think very highly of him. And we do it! Ipswich Town. You could see emotions, what it meant to him. This is life changing. He is the first Iraqian player to have played in the Premier League, so that's a massive, massive achievement. Massive, big up. And I just love the emotions there, you know, the fans and you could see what it meant to him. Tears coming from his eyes and the fans. Absolutely superb scene. So massive. Big up, big up to the town. Brilliant promotion. Big up to Ali Ahmad himself. Been an amazing journey. Big up to Iraq! Woohoo!",

Alright, so this, my brother here is asking which of these 12 versions of Lionel Messi was the best Lionel Messi, your favourite Lionel Messi, and the most complete Lionel Messi. So let's get into it. Alright, so I'm going to start with my favourite Lionel Messi, and is this No. 7 right here. This young Lionel Messi. Man, this guy, the amount of bravery that this guy had at that, his age, was crazy, man. Like, this guy was planning to demolish anything in front of him that was not his teammate. Anybody he sees, he doesn't care. He's about to go through that person. Like, this guy was scary. And when he's running, there's a way his hairs keeps going wavy like this, man, that's a mad register. Watching him was both tormenting, scary and beautiful at the same time. My favourite Lionel Messi, without a shadow of a doubt. And then the best Lionel Messi for me is number four right here, the 2015 Lionel Messi. Like, this was when Lionel Messi started taking the role of a playmaker. Like this guy, at that time, he had like, everything, like, everything. This guy could score, he could create, he could dribble, all at 100%. Like, it was crazy, man. This guy was scared. This is my. This is the best Lionel Messi, uh, for me, in this list. And then, for me, the most complete Lionel Messi in This list here is this number eight. I think this is the 2018, 2019 Lionel Messi there. About. This Messi was hundred percent complete. Like, he was winning both the Golden Boot and the Playmaker Award the same year. Like, you can. You can make an argument for this one, because this guy's. This guy, too, was actually quite complete as well. But for me, man, this guy, the amount of carry, the amount of boarding he carried on his. That Barcelona squad that he was carrying, this particular guy, or more like he was. He was Barcelona at that time. He was basically Barcelona. For me, this is the most complete version of Lionel Messi. Drop yours in the comment section and let's see.",

Out of the Champions League like you said when you made this video a few weeks ago. But after putting Spurs and Chelsea in a pack after both fan bases said they would end our season, you'd be looking forward to a early kickoff against Bournemouth this afternoon? Safe in the knowledge that whether we win the league or not this season, we will never starve in the way that I spent multiple decades watching Spurs fans starve and will continue to. I mean you'd find it funny watching Spurs fans how it feels like to be an Arsenal fan based on not winning the league last season or this season when they've never seen Tottenham with the league and probably never will. You'd find it absolutely hilarious that Tottenham fans hell Mary to these home truths would be to point out that they're gonna lose to Man City on purpose. As if they're not just gonna lose to Man City cause they're shit. I mean, sure, I'm not gonna pretend I wouldn't feel disappointed at the thought that we might end the season trophies, but there would still be optimism, clear positives to take from the season. And the optimism that one day we will lift the silverware that this club should be lifting. My question to you and the rest Of you Spurs fans would be this. Could you say the same thing",

    "voice_to_text": "This is the most shocking pick of the draft and even the players were confused the foul. As a Bronco fan, this reminds me exactly of when Patrick Mahomes was drafted and everybody thought it was a terrible move at the time. But then like I had to watch my opponents get clown for drafting a dude and then him to turn into arguably one of the best players at the position we've ever seen. Michael Penix Jr. Has the exact same arm strength, if not better. Faster and harder to tackle. If he can read a defense he's gonna be a problem. He can make all the arm angle throws that PAT can. Like if he gets put in a good situation it could be a woo! And I again hate the Falcons. Ever since the 28 to 3 blonde lead I've hated them cause I hate the Pats and just submitted my hate for them. I'm not a Falcon fan, but I do think we're looking at a trade that like. Right? Or a pick that right now everybody's like but in a few years I'm gonna be like damn, wish we would have picked him.",

    "voice_to_text": "What do you think about Pittsburgh's plan for reshaping their roster this off season? Overall, I think it makes a ton of sense. You bring in Arthur Smith to be your offensive coordinator, who wants to be run centric? Then you've got to rebuild that offensive line, and that's exactly what they've done. First not know you've got Russell Wilson and Justin Fields who are gonna battle it out to be the quarterback. You got George Pickens. You've got some weapons. But that offensive line is what absolutely had to be fixed in. The Steelers did that. Now they still have to get a wide receiver too. Look, that. That has to happen. They still got to get a cornerback. Yes, that has to happen. And they got to get solid quarterback play. But what the Steelers have done in the off season to rebuild the roster, this is exactly what they needed to do and is exactly what they have done. I think the Steelers this off season have gotten an A+ so far. And the one thing about it, I don't think it's over. I think they're still out there trying to get a wide receiver too in a trade. Is it gonna be Brandon and you? Probably not. Debo Samuels? Probably not. DJ DK Metcalf? Probably not. There's still some free agents out there that they can go and sign. Let's see what happens. But Steelers have a good offseason so far.",

I agree with Orloski. There is no doubt that Chicago has a lot of weapons. I mean, you start out Keenan Allen, DJ Moore, you draft romadusa, you got DeAndre Swift as running back, you got Cole committed tight end. Yes, they have a ton of weapons. But I've said it before, and a lot of people have said this same thing. The orphans of Line, Man, is where the difference comes in between Minnesota and Chicago. And look, while Chicago's offensive line got a little bit better, it's still bad. It's not a good line. Minnesota top 8 to 10 line in the league. Then you throw in the fact that you have Justin Jefferson, you have Jordan Addison, you've got Adam Jones the running back, you got Hawkinson at tight end. Yeah, DJ McCarthy is absolutely in a better situation. Now, does that mean that JJ McCarthy is a better player than Caleb Williams? No. Do I think he's even gonna have a better season than Caleb Williams? No. But if we're just talking about actual situation, yeah, his situation is better. Cause let me ask you this question. If you put Caleb Williams in Minnesota, who do you think would have the better season? There you go. That's why I think Caleb Williams is The better player because if he was in that situation in Minnesota, he would be lights out. I still think he can be lights out in Chicago. That offensive line is gonna have to come to play. Because if it does, then he'll have a good season. If it doesn't. Oh.",

It needs characters. And part parcel of this behaviour, these antics, it draws media attention, right? That's normal. Just like Mopey and Madison and plenty of other players who act this way. It's nothing exclusive or special to Ben White or to Arsenal, I promise you. Listen, I mean no disrespect, stitching a video and having a pop it someone, it's not what it's about. It's more of an observation that. I actually never used to mind his content, but when it pops up now, all I find is it's wine, wine. It's just a moan about this, um, with the victim. He's the victim.

Bro if you don't perform in weekend week out you are like falling off apparently. Except for Messi and Ronaldo again, one of the 2 best footballers of all time. No footballer was ever really performing week in week out, week in week out. It's not. It's not like possible. Like name any football in the comment section. I can tell you rnan has 14 Champions League goals. How many games has he played in the Champions League? Sudan again for example. People will tell you he wasn't as consistent as you think he was. I'm not gonna say it like I'm not gonna talk about Jude Bell and I'm for example if I didn't score against Dominez and even hit the post. And people already said this can't be the worst best footballer cause those ghosts and inspections. Bro chill out bro. Even though real life Messi didn't even score every single quarterfinal or semi final they played in. It's crazy bro. It's like the standards that people pretend to have for 4+ these days. Mad like I'm telling you bro. Twitter. Go on Twitter and see what people say about 4+ week in week out is actually mad bro. Van Dyke, Saliba, all these guys, did they make a mistake? How can this be this best centre back in the world? This clips of Finnish game abused by Bangalore. I'm just using that as an example or real friend and I getting touched by several defenders. But I'm telling you, like, football is so crazy. John Terry used to get touched on a regular. But people won't say nothing, bro. But in this football generation, if you have a bad mistake, bro. Oh, you can't be. We can't. You can't be compared to the greats. You can't be compared to him or that, bro. It's mad. Like, what we doing, guys",

    "voice_to_text": "we're gonna have to fade James Cook this off season and now I get it James Cook just had a baller season went for over 1,000 yards on over 230 carries amazing in the receiving game and there's really not a lot of other running backs outside of the recent draft pick on the roster who's gonna compete with them and in PPR I still think that there's a ton of applicability but this fourth round draft pick is really concerning especially since James Cook struggled at goal line this new running back Ray Davis bigger back had 21 college touchdowns his past year at Kentucky 14 on the ground and seven through the air and normally like a fourth round pick wouldn't concern me immediately but it's the fact that they were looking at bigger backs the entire time through the draft process like Braylon Allen Trey Benson Audrey Bastein made they didn't really interview a ton of small dudes and it seems like maybe that's a mentality shift that they want with like a bigger running back and for those thinking that this is the same as Travis Etienne Tank Bigsby situation and we're just overblowing things I think it's a little different one James could got nowhere near the snap share that Travis Etienne has gotten over the last few years even with Tank Biggs be in the fold and then two Davis you would just say he's just a better goal on back than even Tank Bigsby was coming out of college I'm not saying James Cook needs to be a seventh round pick like he was last year but I'm probably gonna avoid him in the third because his touchdown upside may take a hit with the player like Ray Davis even if they're at like a 60 40 split",
