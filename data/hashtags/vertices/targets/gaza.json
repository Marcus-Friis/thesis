Because if you needed to use them bitches, you would be using them bitches. And I think anybody that signed one of those missiles, whether they were 7 or 70, should be charged with international hate crime and publicly executed. Because there's no greater sign that you're not under any dress, that you have time to sign the missiles, that means you're completely on the offense. These people are fucking sick, bro. We know the majority of people being killed here are children, and you're signing missiles. Putting heart sign is just like bread. These are real demons. Not to mention. Not to mention billions, billions of US tax dollars that's going to that. Y'all just pulling up. You know, the thing is, is that I haven't really posted much about this stuff because protesting awareness is not enough. Whenever people, whenever y'all are ready to completely disengage from this system, then I'm with it. Cause protest. Like, bro, we've been. People been protesting since October, and they ain't stop shit. They stop sending our fucking tax money over there. They ain't stopped shit. We've been boycotting shit, they ain't stopped shit. They still signing missiles. The only thing that can happen. Like, bro, first of all, this life is not permanent. This life ain't permanent. What you got to lose? What? Like, what are we. We're holding on to comfort. And it's like, if you care that much about people dying, and you know that, you're actively, you're a participant, too. I'm a participant as well. I go to work every day. My fucking tax dollars paid for some of those missiles that got signed. That just is what it is. Um, but until they're not gonna. We're not gonna engage in a violent rebellion, because most people don't have a capacity for violence, which is why this is so outrageous. But also, people don't wanna give up their comfort. So, I mean, yeah, you can protest and bring awareness to it, but that ain't stop the bombs from dropping. And nobody. Y'all just ain't ready to disengage from the system completely. You don't want to see this shit collapse. Let's just be real, cause it don't. Like, does it stop with Palestinians? Does it stop in the Congo? Does it stop in Sudan in about 10 years? What's your job gonna be worth? Are you. Are you. Is your job gonna be valuable to society? Or will you be better fit to be doing prison labor? It's a question you need to ask yourself. And pay attention what's going on and tell me it's not a possibility you might lose your job, lose your fucking house. Lose your job to AI, lose your job to a robot. Lose your fucking home? Can't pay your Bills illegal to be homeless now you're a prison laborer doing the jobs they don't wanna pay for. Honestly, man, you might just keep buying the Pop Tarts.",

I've seen a lot of videos from creators talking about how much they care about the genocide happening in Gaza. And that's great. Spread awareness, but also throw some cash. That's why I'm challenging all of the content creators that are tagged and put right here to throw a bag to help a family in Gaza. It's easy to do. Just go to Operation Olive Branch. They have a link in the bio and you can click a spreadsheet to find out where to donate your money. They also share stories of families who desperately need aid that you can donate to directly to. Like their gofundme. I click their story. I seen Abdul Kareem's family needs to get the fuck out of Gaza right now and escape into Egypt. That's nine people who desperately can benefit from getting this money. I don't have a lot of money. I made $24,000 last year. This year's looking like the same, but even I can pull together $100 to donate to help somebody. So that's the challenge is going ban for ban for Rafa. Tell these creators to put their money where their mouth is and, you know, try to help somebody.",

    "voice_to_text": "Peter who incidentally has not had anything to say about the ongoing racist genocide over the past I am really gonna do my best to be civil only because only because my nieces are on this platform hi Chloe hi wisdom Auntie is not gonna come out of her character today but we're gonna get some things settled I knew one of y'all was gonna try this mess and it had to be you so you gonna get what you asked for today so this is a creator who has accused me of working for the Zionists being paid by the Zionists to make a video refuting the Khazar theory which postulates that the Jewish people Ashkenazi Jews actually come from a a western far far uh Western European tribe called uh the qazarians so this is the idea that the Jewish people do not actually they're not actually descended from the region uh where current Israel is located so I did a video on this about a year and a half ago in response to a bunch of crap that went down on my page which I will not get into here it's a year and a half ago so definitely predates uh October 7th but this creator is saying I have been paid to make this video by a bunch of Zionists apparently and they also made a bunch of false statements in the video about me supposedly not having spoken about Gaza at all uh they referenced an interview that I did with a biblical scholar named Dan Mcclellan a podcast that we did about the video that I did on the cause our theory and saying that you know he I mean I was more insulted by half the crap that they had to say about Dan Mcclellan calling him a theologian Damatella is not a theologian he's a biblical scholar and he's a Bible translator and he's a historian he's not a theologian for gonna say but I'll let Damatella defend himself if he chooses to do so but this is the problem with people who don't leave TikTok this is the problem is that I have posted no less than I would say about 10 videos where I am discussing various elements of Gaza so right there you lie you let you let just let them lies just roll on out your mouth and then I'm gonna have to show you the receipts uh for the fact that I yes I've spoken many times on my position uh on Gaza and have also done so uh a million times on Instagram first video I posted was of a a doctor named Gabor Matte who is very Jewish doctor who is very critical of Zionist policies they got a lot of push back and a lot of flack for posting that here's a follow up video I did to that one here's a kind of a long form video that I did kind of talking about what my current place in the conversation was very clearly a delineating my position on Gaza here's another video that I did clearly criticizing the US's policy towards Israel what does that say let me see if I can make that out clearly my heart is with the Palestinian people this is a video talking about my compassion towards the Palestinian people of Gaza here's me sharing an informational video that Vox did on the history of the conflict between Israel and Palestine over the many thousands of years here's a video of me discussing how much more compassion was shown to the aid workers that were killed versus the Palestinians who were dying everyday not to mention the many many many myriad multiple stories that I have shared on my Instagram page since October 7th you all might recognize bison here she is an on the ground Palestinian reporter that does updates constantly I have paid attention to her page from the beginning I share her content at least a couple of times a week in my Instagram story and this is the problem when you base the entirety of your opinion about someone's political viewpoints or anything about their character on what you see online more specifically what you see on TikTok TikTok is not the world you don't even know what I'm doing on other platforms let alone in my actual life you get on here with your your self righteous condescension you are uninformed and you are completely misguided but I highly doubt that you care and let me add a note to that just just let me add a little bit just a little bit more flavor to this pot don't get on here telling black female creators who do justice work what we need to be posting about like do not ever do that it's just a bad practice all around first of all you wrong as sin you're wrong these are lies and then secondly you don't know the cost you do not know the price that we pay to do the work we do you do not know the mental health struggles that many of us deal with in the background the price that we pay to be able to consistently put out content that speaks from a specific point of view that only we can speak from we cannot go silent as black women we are already silenced in this world so I save my energy for the things that are extremely meaningful to me that only I can speak about there are things that only I as a black woman can speak about from this specific point of view and so I save my time my energy my research my mental acumen I save all of that for the battles that require my specific voice so how dare you or anybody tell me as a black woman who is on here fighting for the marginalized everyday what I should and should not be posting about I am of the opinion that no one should be telling anybody what they should be posting about but least of all a black woman who is doing justice work on this app how dare you how dare you don't you speak about a black woman like that you keep my name out of your mouth I spend 60 70 sometimes 80 hours a week putting together thoughtful deep pieces on things like medical racism black art and Zionism within the black church and all kinds of very topics only for you to come along and say I'm supposed to be posting about what you think I should be posting about you post about it you believe whatever twisted up theory that you want to I'm not here to debate that theory with you I have plenty of family members I could do that with at at Christmas time now I'm gonna be doing that with you but I will say that the reason that you saw those graphics from that organization in my video is because they were high quality graphics and there was literally like you said the first three searches that came up were their video and my videos because there are not a lot of videos online about the cause our theory so as a creator as a storyteller if I have a story to tell then I need to be able to find imagery that goes with that story their video was among many sources most of my sources were academic in putting my video together about the Kazar theory because your politics have LED you to another place and you're investigating all of the what ifs and the I don't knows about the Kazar theory you do what you do child I'm not trying to get in your way but do not accuse me of having any kind of a political motivation for coming to the conclusion that I came to which is the conclusion that the majority of academics have come to about the cause art theory I've taken plenty of smoke about that from my own people you can just fall in line knock yourself out with those conspiracy theories I will not be wasting any more time talking to people like you about that I have lost many Jewish friends and followers because of my constant posting about the genocide in Gaza in my IG stories so many inboxes so many people dressing me down and now here you are accusing me of the opposite thing just leave me out of your research cause if the kind of research that you did on me and what I've had to say about Gaza is any indication of your ability to find the truth your research skills could use some help but in the meantime just keep my name out of your mouth and stay out of black people's business",

    "voice_to_text": "There's been reports of clashes between the Egyptian soldiers and the IDF. Apparently, the IDF sustained seven injured personnel, whereas the Egyptian side sustained one casualty. And we ask Allahu Akbar to accept this person as a Shahid. This news is something that you will not find. The mainstream media. Egyptian forces have been having constant small skirmishes along the board with the IDF for the past few weeks now, but you will not hear of this. Why? Because the media outlets and the governments especially, they want to create an image. They want to paint an image that, you know, nobody is really bothered to the point that they will attack the other side. And this is not true. Many times we have seen the Egyptian soldiers due to what they can literally see in front of their very eyes. In your offer, the emotions get the better of them. The Akira gets the better of them. The Iman moves them to a point where they realize, I have to do something about this. This is how soldiers are trained. This is how soldiers are raised. We see an enemy, we deal with them. Unfortunately, this has only been limited to a few individual soldiers here and there who decided to break their chain of command and go ahead with it anyway, with or without the rest of the support of the army. The only way to go forward or success for this ummah, is to break that chain. Of command. It's disobedience to the one who enforces disobedience over us. We require disobedience to those in power. Stop this ummah from taking her out. And this is why you will never hear of these things in the mainstream media. Cause they wanna create an image. Everything is shush hush. Everything is honky dory. Nothing going on, nowhere in the world. Let's just maintain the status quo.",

    "voice_to_text": "if you've witnessed great violence and suffering in the past 24 hours and are struggling with intrusive thoughts I wanna offer some coping strategies some healing practice that I've Learned from engaged Buddhism actually don't like the term intrusive thoughts because an intruder is someone you want to keep out and build a wall to keep out and uh Buddhism teaches us that uh when we do have these like memories of terrible violence that come up um it there to be welcomed in that if we build a wall uh either by trying to distract ourselves trying to forget pushing the thoughts away using substances to try to forget um all these things just create more disorder and more anguish Yesterday I saw a video of a man  holding a baby uh that no longer had a head and that is not an intruder but that image keeps coming into my mind  because it has something to teach me and I want to honor what um what I need to process from that memory and I want to honor and learn what it needs to teach me and so it may seem kind of counterintuitive but the way to heal from violence whether it's violence you yourself experienced or violence you've just witnessed um is you do when it comes up you welcome it in and you breathe through it um it helps if you can close your eyes obviously not if you're driving a car if it's safe to do so though when that memory comes into your mind close your eyes and you want to get uh centered in your body so we do that by breathing and deep slow breath start by inflating your belly uh it helps to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth if you're not too stuffed up and it can help uh when our mind is racing uh with uh you know the sounds of screaming or just like it's like white noise like in a panic um it can help to have some language to repeat ourselves and um last night I was really I had a very sleep last night last night I was really struggling with this um and I wrote I wrote down sort of a meditation that I'd like to share with all of you so we I said to myself breathing in I acknowledge this memory breathing out I grieve for this memory breathing in I acknowledge my heart's suffering breathing out my suffering is empathy for the suffering of others breathing in I know I am alive breathing out my life's purpose is to ease the suffering of others if you are a parent um I have a baby as you guys know and it's been really hard for me over the past 24 hours because every time I hold my baby I am having that memory come back up of that person holding a baby um and so I invite you to add this one which is breathing in I love my baby breathing out I love that baby too I'm gonna try not to fight the feelings that come up but feel the love that I have for that baby in its fullness and finally if you really wanna get radical in it there's one more that um might maybe bit more controversial but I think this one's really important um it's breathing in I know that I am human breathing out I know that all people are human and with that meditation I invite you to try to welcome in an understanding of not just the full humanity of the victims but also the full humanity of the people who have done this of the people who make jokes about it online the people who are profiting off of it because I think there is a there is an instinct to call them monster I mean my favorite insult for scion ists is calling them a funding ghoul okay I can't be all high mighty about this all the time it is comforting it is comforting um to think of them as monsters it takes a lot of courage to recognise that they were born in their shoes the same as the victims in Palestine are born in their shoes and that's a lot to hold but I don't think we get out of this uh through more dehumanization I don't think the dehumanization in the world can be healed unless we confront the reality that the people doing these things are they're also human beings um so that meditation has been part of what I need to learn from from this uh the memory of this video which I will carry with me for my entire life we are forever changed every time we see this violence and suffering we're forever changed by it and if we try to fight being changed by it if we don't try to do this healing work and this acceptance work what is probably gonna happen is we will lash out at the people closest to us and none of us need that right now I know especially as a parent there is and there is a instinct um if we're not if we see other children suffering and then we don't heal that and honor that and then our own children um Express maybe the least little you know they're whining about something totally insignificant um there's a tendency to lash out even their joy might given us a tendency to lash out because how can you be feeling joy when there is so much suffering in the world um and so we have to do this um this breathing healing acknowledging welcoming work allowing the memories when they surface to wash over you and not and not trying to fight them and push them down um is is really important work and it's not gonna take just one time these are these are big big horrors we've witnessed these are deep moral wounds I've done this practice maybe 50 times in the last 24 hours and maybe I'm going to need to do it hundreds more um there's no right or wrong way to do this track practice you don't have to like say all the things in order take these if they're meaningful to you um write your own if if that works but the the practice of stopping and breathing and allowing the memory and the emotion to wash over you you will not be destroyed by it you will not be destroyed by feeling the feelings that you need to feel about this and then when the wave has passed it is okay to find comfort and calmness and stillness it is okay to delight in your children who are still alive um it is okay to enjoy the blessings of this world and it's like and in fact you must you need those things to sustain you um you need to be whole in your heart in order to keep doing this work long term because I'm I'm very worried about the number of people in my comments just saying I'm breaking apart I don't wanna live in this world anymore I don't know how I can go on living in this world anymore um I want you here I need people with heart like you here the fact that you are suffering like like I said I acknowledge my heart self like your suffering is empathy for the suffering of others and it's precious and beautiful and we need I need you here I want you here my mashbuka I love you um please stay please stay donating money alone will not free Palestine donating money alone will not make this memory of what you've seen go away um but it is one small good act of radical love that we can do in this moment and um I'm asking you to donate to the family at the first link in my bio if you are so moved we here are digital community this mishpocha it's amazing I love all of my followers but for those of you who are really struggling I also really want to encourage you to if you don't have it already find an in person community that's organising around Palestine that you can um be with it really helps it really helps to have comrades um and I've gotten very close with my JVP comrades through this um you know join if you're students and for justice in Palace time join the Palace tinny Ann Youth Movement or Juice Voice for peace if none of those fit you your local leftist organizing anarchist peace organizing anti racist organizing group um that may be a place where you can find community of people who are all engaged on this and so they're all seeing these things and feeling these feelings and going through it together um and I think that that can be really powerful but I honor the power of this digital community too and as always you're amazing you're my mishpocha and I love you",

As a US Army combat surgeon, veteran and international crisis first responder, I've built my life on service in the belief in the US government. I took a hippocratic oath to help people, whoever they are, wherever they are. When the call came in December 2,023, the doctors were needed through the World Health Organization. And being specialized in combat trauma and reconstructive surgery, I signed up to serve. I have never in my career witness the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza. I arrived in Rafaa as a part of a team coordinated by the WHO. We understood the dire conditions and plan to leave together in two weeks. On May 13th, in violation of international law, our team of medical professionals were denied exit. I want our president to know that we are not safe. When the call came in to evacuate, I was asked to choose to either evacuate and leave my team behind or stay with them. I could not, in good conscious, leave my team behind. That is not what I was Taught. That is not the Soldier's Creed. We don't leave Americans behind. This is against our values as Americans. As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team. And as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans. This burden falls on the international community and President Biden to use their full influence to ensure medical personnel can continue their critical work without being put in harm's way. We worry that the European hospital we are currently in will suffer a similar fate of Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, where humanitarian workers, patients and civilians were massacred. As for our patients, it is with a very heavy heart that we will ultimately leave them behind without care. And this responsibility remains in the hands of the international community. We entered with a commitment to be relieved with another medical team, and now this, too, is being denied. The people of Gaza deserve more than their burnt out, collapsed medical healthcare system. To my wife, daughters, and son, I know that it hurts that I am not coming home this weekend, and I am sorry, but I know that you are proud. And I am upholding my oath to never leave anyone behind. This man is a hero. I just ask, um, if you are still watching, that you pray for this incredible doctor, um, for both his safety and that he can complete his mission in saving lives and providing care. I would be so proud. If that was my dad, if that was my. My husband, my colleague. Whatever. Um. Doctor Hawami is a hero. And I, too, pray that European hospital is protected, because we have seen what Israel does to hospitals.",

    "voice_to_text": "I can also confirm today that I've reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and minister of defense, you have Galland, bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes committed on the territory of the state of Palestine from at least October 8th, 2023. The crimes include starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, willfully causing great suffering, serious injury to body or health or cruel treatment, willful killing or murder and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population. As well as crimes against humanity of extermination and or murder, persecution and allegations of crimes of committing other inhuman acts. It's alleged that these crimes were committed in the context of the ongoing ARM conflict and as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza pursuant to a state policy. Unfortunately, these crimes continue to this day. My office submits that these individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. We have reached that conclusion based upon interviews with survivors, many eyewitnesses, experts from satellite imagery, statements from Israeli officials, including the two individuals subject to the present application.",

We have been a militarized power for decades. At this point, half a. Probably over half a century. Way over half a century. We have been paying close to $1 trillion per year for our military.

No hate to the friend. Love you. We got to the place, my friend ordered her food, and I was looking, and I was like, like, what is? Like, I wanna know where this place is from. So I was asking recommendations from the people that work there, and I was like, what is this place? Like, what kind of food is this? She was like, oh, it's Middle Eastern food from all over the Middle East. I was like, yeah, but specifically what country? Like, are you Lebanese? He was like, we're really from all over the place. We have Moroccan food, we have Lebanese food, we have everything. So I was like, might as well be specific. Who owns this place? And then she was like, oh, a Israeli couple. When I tell you. I was literally about to explode. I was so angry in front of this woman. I looked at my friend, and I was like, well, I'm not eating here. And then I turned to the woman, and I was like, by the way, all of this food is Arabic food, not Israeli food. You need to be so Careful where you're buying your bloody Middle Eastern food. The trick is, this is how they trick you. They will say Middle Eastern because they know that if they say Israeli, people won't come to their place. So if places Israeli, they will try to avoid acknowledging that is Israeli as much as possible. Which is why everyone needs to do as much research as they can before they enter a bloody place. Especially if they're selling Arabic food but are reluctant to tell you specifically where it's from. If it's an Arabic place, we will tell you specifically. Lebanese, Jordanian, Palestinian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Algerian, we will tell you specifically where the food is from. If it's an Israeli restaurant or an Israeli cafe, they will avoid it at all costs. This is the fake Middle Eastern like cafe place by the way, so people can avoid it. I'm so tired of Israelis and Zionists stealing our food, stealing our culture, stealing everything we have as Arabs and Palestinians. Other masquerade us, destroying our homes, killing us, genociding us, killing our children, destroying our families, destroying our homes, destroying our land while profiting off of our culture. Please, if you have any drop of humanity inside of you, don't go to or eat at Israeli anything. Israeli cafes, restaurants, anything. And by the way, Israeli food literally does not even exist. There's literally no such thing as Israeli food. They just stole our food. They stole Palestinian food and rebranded It",

    "voice_to_text": "The premise of your answer seems to be, uh. Your first answer seems to be, uh, that the Americans have been talking, have been influencing. What are American words worth these days? What is American influence worth? I think American influence is worth quite a bit. And it is because of American engagement and American leadership and American diplomacy, specifically by this secretary and by this president, that we have seen things unfold in a certain way. We have seen humanitarian aid be unlocked. We have seen things like this new maritime corridor be accomplished. I'm certainly not trying to say that it is enough, but it is a step in the right direction. Let's not forget that at the beginning of this conflict, there was close to little humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza at all. And it is because of Secretary Lincoln and President Biden that we are trending in a different direction. We know it's going backwards. The fighting has returned, the borders have shut. People are being displaced repeatedly. Things are plainly going backwards, not forwards. We have been clear that there needs to be some progress made as it relates to some backward steps in the past couple of weeks. But there has been a sustained period in which we saw an increase of humanitarian aid, and we can continue to work that directly.",

Uh, while hundreds of thousands of people are living here in things for more than four months now, and they're living in the borders between Egypt and Palestine. So when I asked people about the worst thing about being displaced, they all answered me the same thing. This is not a normal displacement. This is the second neck bear. So what is the first? Nickname. I mean, the nickname. In 1948, more than 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were destroyed, and more than 800,000 people Palestinians were displaced. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the whole cities of Palestine were forced to leave their homes and villages to Gaza Strip, Westbang or to the de support. So today I'm gonna visit some grandfathers and mothers living in distance and ask them about the and the Lynch Americans for the radis. All I know"

In true Australian fashion, he loves a good ham and cheese toastie with a barbecue sauce. The real question for y'all though is if part of your cheese starts molding, do you throw it out or do you just cut off the mold and continue to eat it? Sorry to all the Australians because they made the most pathetic little cheese toastie with the last bits of bread I had. However, it was incredibly delicious and I definitely make it again. Jake says the sign of a true cheese toastie is that it's squish, and that made mine very crispy. Like listen to that crunch for lunch. One of you actually suggested chapagetti with spam for Jake's Day. I've never made this combination before, but it was delicious. Chapagetti is an S tier instant noodle in my book. Always. And I added some spinach for a healthy colon. And lastly, Jake's favorite Korean dish is kimchi, so I made that for dinner. However, I realized I was out of tofu at the very last second, so I tried substituting that protein with eggs, which was weird but good. I'm so sorry Jake for these janky meals. I obviously flopped my grocery run. Either way, this was delicious and I still thoroughly enjoyed these. And let me know which member I should eat Like next",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi everybody, I'd like to ask everyone who's been leaving comments like this calling me out for not speaking up sooner to please take a look at the playlist that the video that you are commenting on is in. Like the video you are literally commenting on then a playlist entitled I am speaking on this with a little watermelon at the end. I thought that would make it clear. Notice how it says part 14? You open it up, you notice that I've been talking about this since November. Is very first video I highlight a 19 year old girl who survived the attack on belly and just days after October 7th was calling for a ceasefire. This video from November I talked about how Zionism doesn't actually provide you a safety. This one over here from December I talked about one way we could have a single democratic state in what is Israel Palestine in such a way where it protects all the rights of the Palestinians and Jews who currently live there. My most recent one before the fundraising started was this one that came at the end of March, where I talked about multiple different ways that we can prove that the casualty numbers coming out of Gaza are in fact accurate. Again, you don't even have to go to my page. This was literally on the video that you are watching. Anyways, I don't make this just about me. There is another family trying to get Out of Gaza who has their gofundme, LinkedIn my bio. This is actually the fifth family I've been able to put up. Thank you guys so much for donating to the point where we've been able to get this far. Unfortunately, donations have slowed down a little bit, so they've been on my page for about three days now. So I'm hoping this will help speed things up a little bit and get them to their goal. They're currently 38,000 reaching their goal. So here's what I'm gonna ask you to do. If you're still watching and you have at least $1,000 in your bank account, I'm gonna need you to go to the link listed in my bio and donate just $5. That's it. Otherwise, if you have less than a thousand dollars, please just go to the Venmo that I've LinkedIn my bio and just send me $1 and I'll donate it for you. If you don't think this $1 Nations help. This is my current Venmo balance. It literally cannot transfer it right now because I've actually exceeded the maximum amount that allowed to transfer in a week, which I think is like $15,000. So yes, these small numbers are absolutely adding up. I'm just waiting for Venmo to let me transfer this to my bank account, at which point I will send it to whichever family is listed in my bio. So please, thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "Duke students walked out during Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech. Here's what we know. Prior to Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke University, numerous graduating students walked out in protest of his support for Israel. Following the conflict in Gaza in October, Seinfeld took to Instagram to declare his unwavering solidarity with Israel. Subsequently, he joined other prominent figures in signing a letter to President Biden urging him to reaffirm his support for Israel and take all necessary actions to support the release of hostages by Hamas. Since then, Seinfeld and other supporters of Israel have faced criticism from social media users who accuse them of endorsing what they perceive as the genocide of the Arab population. And Palestine isn't the first instance of Seinfeld drawing criticism for his actions perceived as anti Palestinian. In 2,018, the comedian sparked backlash after visiting an Israeli military camp where he participated in war simulations depicting Palestinians as targets and terrorists. At the graduation ceremony, a group of graduating students brandishing Palestine flags staged a walkout as Sandfield was announced as the commencement speaker. Their departure was accompanied by audible disapproval with booze at going through the venue. Eventually, Seinfeld's introduction was completely overshadowed by chance in support of Palestine. This walkout occurred amidst a wave of student protests that have engulfed college campuses nationwide since April, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of students across the country.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's Israel's 76th birthday, and I got a box from Leva Olam. Every single month, I get one of these boxes. It's a subscription service. I pay for it myself. And I always love unboxing it with you guys because it helps support small businesses throughout Israel. And I have a feeling the box this month is all about Israel's birthday. So let's open her up. Oh, yeah. I was right. Check that out. This package is dedicated to the many people who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for Israel's establishment and continued existence. First up is this book, heroes of Our Land. This booklet is a collection of letters of fallen soldiers, generously released by their families. There's something ceramic in here, so let's see what we've got going on. Okay. It's a ceramic plate. Oh, this is gorgeous how it has the map of Israel right in the center. Something mango in here. So let's see what this is. Like a mango jam. Look at gorgeous color. We have some lightly salted Israeli almonds. I wanna try one now. I love almonds. Oh, how pretty is this packaging? Hmm. This package says the sweetness of Israel. See what's inside? Some kind of dessert cookies. What we got here? Oh, we have pistachio covered pecans and coconut and white chocolate cashews. Yeah, we're getting right in here. Oh, my goodness. Hmm. That is amazing. You're not ready for this. Oh, my god. Hmm. Oh, my gosh. These are so Good. And we have some dates. And Israeli dates. I'm telling you, there is nothing like them. And last up, we have some skincare. And this is probably my favorite part of the package besides the food. I always get the best skincare from these packages. This one is a toning mask. And here we have an eye cream. Okay, there you go. Let's put a little of this eye cream on now. Why not, right? Oh, it smells so good. I may have too much on my hands. It feels so good. Yeah, I put too much on. Just use very, very little. It contains extracts of plants grown in the Judean desert. I literally have Israel on my face right now.",

The first is like, fucking duh. UN revises Gaza death toll almost 50% less women and children unalive than previously reported. It's almost like we could have told you that the Gaza health ministry, which is controlled by a Hamas, it's full of shit. But now that the UN finally decided to do some due diligence, now we all know it to be true. Then, of course, there's Ashley Biden, who wanted so bad to ensure that the woman who stole that diary went to jail. She wrote a letter to the judge confirming it was her diary. And then Snopes, which is the most left wing fat checking site in the world, confirmed that the things written in that diary about Joe Biden, they were true. Says it right here. So, yeah, another thing we knew to be true, but social media didn't like us talking about it. And lastly, the MCU is currently at 6,065 members with more than $3 million raised. And we're certainly not stopping there. But there you go. There's your shit we already knew news report.",

You wanna boo a 20 year old girl just because she's from Israel? Yallah, go ahead. But if you threaten and harass a singer to a point where it's not safe for her own parents to watch her perform, that's not activism. You're not doing shit for Palestine with that. You are using the suffering of the Palestinian people as a platform for your trash behaviour. Don't pretend this is about your protest. It's very important to protest for the rights of Palestinians and to put pressure on all parties involved. But when you're attacking artists at Eurovision, and not just there, just sometimes because they're from Israel, or even just because they're Jewish, you're not doing that for Palestine. And this is happening. I had to cancel multiple shows because it was not safe for me or the audience. And I'm just a shitty comedian. All you are doing is delegitimize an important protest with your bullshit and you deserve to be called out for that. And if you have a problem with me doing that, I would Recommend you to go ahead and suck on these"

    "voice_to_text": "Leute mit Cake, warum ist es gerade Trend geworden, die Celebrities zu blockieren? was hat diese Frau damit zu tun? und warum will sie, dass wir Kuchen essen? 1755 wurde 1 M\u00e4dchen geboren namens Marie Antoine in \u00d6sterreich. ihre Mutter war eine K\u00f6nigin und sie hatte 16 weitere Kinder. und weil diese Familie eine k\u00f6nigliche Familie war, haben sie sich dazu entschieden, dass alle ihre T\u00f6chter, auch K\u00f6nige, heiraten. Marie Antoine war zu diesem Zeitpunkt einfach 13 Jahre alt, als ihre Eltern entschieden sie nach Frankreich zu schicken, um einen Jungen zu heiraten, der circa 16 Jahre alt war, damit Frankreich, ich sage mal, k\u00f6nigliches Blut besitzt. Marie war nicht gerade die intelligenteste, aber sie war h\u00fcbsch und sie hatte 1 ganzes Volk, das ihre Kleider N\u00e4hte, ihre H\u00fcte aussuchte, die passenden Schuhe dazu und alles drum und dran. das Schloss, in dem sie lebte, hatte eine riesige K\u00fcche, wo jeden Tag viele Speisen, Getr\u00e4nke, Kuchen und Kekse und vieles weitere vorbereitet wurde. man sagt eine Kette, eine diamantkette von ihr hatte einen Wert von 15 Millionen Dollar. ja und jeder K\u00f6nig und jede K\u00f6nigin lebt doch so, denkt ihr euch? aber zu dieser Zeit litt Frankreich unter einer Hungersnot. Frankreich war Arm, das Volk hatte weder essen noch trinken und sie mussten Unmengen an Steuern zahlen, um nat\u00fcrlich diese ganzen Schl\u00f6sser und Pal\u00e4ste weiterhin funktionieren zu lassen. es Kam zu einer Revolution, die Menschen klagten, wir wollen essen, wir wollen trinken, wir brauchen Brot. diese Nachricht erreichte Marie Antoinette. und man behauptet, dass sie sagte, ah, sie haben kein Brot, dann sollen die doch Kekse oder Kuchen essen. let him eat Cake. und sie hat das nicht b\u00f6se gemeint. sie hat das gesagt, weil sie es nicht verstanden hat. ja, okay, du hast kein Brot, dann ist doch Kuchen, dann ist doch Kekse. sie hat in so einer Scheinwelt gelebt, dass sie nicht mal wusste, was es hei\u00dft, kein Brot zu haben. und hier merkt ihr, wie weit entfernt sie von der Realit\u00e4t lebte. und das soll zeigen, dass die Celebrities nicht verstehen, was passiert beziehungsweise sie wollen es nicht verstehen. ihnen ist das alles egal. sie sind die Marie Antoinette der heutigen Zeit. sie leben in Pal\u00e4sten, in schlossen, in H\u00e4user und essen den Kuchen und k\u00f6nnen nicht verstehen, was es hei\u00dft, dass die Menschen kein Brot haben. und hier fing alles an. hier fingen wir an, die Celebrities zu blockieren. und warum blockieren? weil diese Infos an TikTok, Instagram, Facebook bla bla bla. kommen. und die merken, okay, der oder die ist unbeliebt und dadurch erh\u00e4lt er oder sie keine kooperationsanfragen mehr. ihre macht wird ihnen genommen, wenn wir ihnen den R\u00fccken zukehren. und ich glaube, es ist verst\u00e4ndlich, warum wir ihnen den R\u00fccken zukehren. mal schauen, was der Kuchen ihnen jetzt bringt."

So that's attached. I put a hyper link in my bio which links directly to the UN, World Food Programme for Gaza, the Freedom Fund for modern slavery efforts, and then doctors without borders. Definitely go check that out. Additionally, I've been hearing through the Grapevine, as in seeing other videos, that Kim Kardashian and a lot of other celebrities have been apparently losing like millions of followers, so this movement seems to actually be working. Check out the hashtag right there. You can use it to grow the trend. Additionally, I pinned three videos on my profile basically describing why I've been personally blocking celebrities for a while now and just my rationale about how you can use this to support small creators, underground artists, what not. But, uh. And then check out those two creators talking about all this and Operation Olive Branch. And without further ado, today's blocks of the day are 1. Logan Paul 2. Zendaya 3.

    "voice_to_text": "What happened yesterday at a Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and how does it directly correlate to the work we do here in Swan? Yesterday there was a large and peaceful Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and it ended with extreme police violence, excessive use of force, and the arrest of two Palestinian organizers. To use amplified SoundOn public property in the city of Orlando, you need to require a permit. And because this person did not have a permit for the megaphone, the police thought that it was justified to unannounced go into a crowd of peaceful protesters, including families, the elderly, children, and journalists, and start pepper spraying indiscriminately into the crowd and to violently arrest two protesters during this event. They felt that this was justified because of one megaphone and one use of amplified sound at a peaceful rally and protest for the Palestinian people. Now, how does this relate to what we do here in Swan? You may have seen in some of our videos that our protesters on public city of Orlando property use amplified sound, such as cones, to be able to scream towards the clinic and to be able to scream at our patients. We have asked multiple times for Orlando PD to act on this and to stop them from being able to use these cones. We have recently Learned, just last week, that OPD Legal has said that they will not take a stance on this and that they will Not prosecute any of our anti abortion protesters for using amplified SoundOn a public sidewalk in the city of Orlando, likely sending your baby straight to hell. To that we could do for you just a week after learning that OPD will not take any legal cause against our protesters for using amplified sound towards our clinic and to harass our patients right up the road. At Lake Yola in downtown Orlando, protesters were brutalized and violently apprehended by OPD simply over a megaphone at a peaceful protest. There were children in strollers that were pepper sprayed, elderly were pepper sprayed, journalists were pepper sprayed. This was indiscriminately done into a crowd of over 1,000 people without warning or without any sort of announcement that they were going to start pepper spraying individuals if they did not disperse. There was no dispersal warning before this was done. And yet our anti abortion protesters use amplified sound every day. And we have verbal confirmation that OPD legal will do nothing against our anti abortion protesters. Carden, Michael Carden. This is about the head first footage for police department. He called the city attorney and they said for now they're not, we're not doing anything with it. I hope this video serves as a stark reminder that the police's only function is to uphold the interests of the state and that our state in our country is financing and benefiting off of the genocide of the Palestinian people. Fuck OPD and Free Palestine",

    "voice_to_text": "And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there. Huh? Where should they go then? Hell, who should they listen to if not the primary sources that are live video footage of children blown to bits, mothers wailing in agony, trapped under rubble? Should they listen to politicians who routinely lie to them and write laws that favor themselves and their corporate and lobbying donors who investigate themselves when accused of crimes against the American public, only to surprisingly state they've discovered that they've done nothing wrong? Should they listen to mainstream media who, not to go out in foil hat on you, is bought and paid for, used by the rich and powerful to sway the public into believing a chosen narrative? Should they listen to Hillary the hawk, whose rap sheet in the Middle East is far from favoring peace or at the very least, the interests of American citizens? The woman who said, and I quote, that Americans should get over themselves if they're not happy with the candidate options for presidency? The woman who left American citizens to die in the Middle East? Now, it would be dishonest to pretend that social media can't muddy the information that people are getting because there are So many people posting videos. People with biases, people who are ill intentioned, people who are well intentioned but confused themselves. But this isn't 2001 anymore. This isn't 2012 anymore, where we'd have to wait for a sterilized press release from our oligarchs to have any insight on what's happening around the world, our involvement in it, and take it at face value. It is all at our fingertips. And no, possibly muddy in the beginning, it all comes to light eventually. Now, if I were you and wanted to win people over in some way, and I know you're one to double down on whatever behavior contributed to your past losses instead of seeking to improve it, hence why your communication style with the American public hasn't changed since you lost to Trump, even though it should have. I'd pick a different strategy than whatever that was.",

Their function in society is to entertain us, and that is all they do. That's why they're here. The government doesn't care about what they think you do. Just why y'all are so pressed that you're blocking all of them. Because they haven't spoken out. Y'all even blocking the ones that have spoke out. Which means y'all are coming from a place of hate. You're a hater. You're. You hate on people who have more than you, and that's why you're never gonna have more than you have. Because if you can't be solid in yourself and you hate everybody else so much cause they have what you don't, how you ever gonna get out of that fucking space? Let's put our actual brains into play for a second. You are claiming you don't want them on your timeline. Okay, but you're a part of this movement, which means, generally, this thought probably stemmed from this movement. I'm sure you probably weren't saying this two weeks ago. I doubt it. I highly doubt it. You was probably listening to your Taylor Swift being happy or whatever the fuck it is you listen to. If, let's say, Taylor Swift decided tomorrow to say something, would you then, like, unblock her and be happy? Oh, wait. Actually, let's make this a little better. If Taylor Swift says something, In December, would that have made you want to go and do something? Like, did you need them to tell you to do it? Do you really need someone else to tell you that you should be donating to a cause that you claim to care about? Get the fuck off my page.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm a little confused. People can explain if they want, but I will explain how I understand it, which is that if I donate up $60,000 to save the children, then I have 0% of that money. If I don't donate it, then twenty five percent of it will go to the US government and I will have 75% of that money. So I like the situation where save the children gets 100%, I get 0%, versus the situation where the US government gets 25% and I get 75%. If that sounds like something that is bad or that I'm doing in a self for a selfish reason, then I can, I will happily. Please help me understand that there. You could say it's for a selfish reason, cause I've said that I'm doing it out loud and so I'm getting social capital for it. That's a legitimate criticism. Um. And it is why I usually do not talk about my donations when I'm doing large donations to save the children or doctors without borders. Because it seems weird to me to like say, hey, I'm doing this, please give me social capital. I wanted to do the match to save the children. I think I'm just gonna stop making content for a little while because this is very strange to me. But I wanted to get the money, save the children. Because in Gaza there are a number of people who can do a border crossing per day. Except By the. The Egyptian government. And we can't make that number go up. The vast majority of people will not be able to leave Gaza. And the vast majority of children in Gaza won't be able to leave. Save the children is on the ground building impromptu hospitals, delivering medicine, delivering food, bringing doctors in to help care for people. We need to do both. And so I thought it would be good to do both. Like, I'm sorry I take it down a notch, Hank. It's fine. People are gonna misunderstand and misinterpret and, like, it's fine. Uh, you. Like, you can't make everybody happy, but, like. But I do. Like, I. I do think it's important to understand that we need to do both. We need to help people get out of Gaza, and we need to help people who are in Gaza. And I thought that, and I. I think, and I continue to believe, and I think most people continue to believe that it is good to do both. Like, we have not. It is good. We have to do both. Okay. Okay. I think I'll just step back for a little bit.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi, I just wanted to make this video real quick to clarify my thoughts on this subject as a lot of people been asking me to do such. I'm going to use as coded of language as I can in this video because every time I previously try to make a video on the subject matter, it's either gotten flagged for a view or taken down, or just completely suppressed by the algorithm. I do not support isn't real. I don't believe isn't real is a real place. I believe it's an American colony made up by the United States of America so they can kill brown people and steal their land under the guise of it technically being a different country, but it's actually just the United States and sheep's clothing. Because that's all the United States of America has ever done since its inception is kill brown people and steal their land. I do not support isn't real in any fathomable way, shape, or form beyond its capacity to crumble. I am very pro watermelon people, and I have been ever since I first Learned about what this conflict even was. Back when I was in high school, I used to run a Taylor Swift Stan account on Twitter and one of my mutuals named nayama ended up going to prison for several months because she refused to join the IDF. She said she did not want to murder children. I repeat, it is illegal to not want to murder children and Isn't real. So if you're defending it, that's what you're defending. In conclusion, fuck isn't real. Fuck The United States of America's government. Fuck Amy. And if you get down with genocide, fuck you, too. You're a disgusting, vile, reprehensible human being, and I hope you die and rot in hell, you piece of shit! Harm yourself.",

    "video_description": "A group of students stood up and walked out of VCU\u2019s graduation ceremony on Saturday morning in Richmond as Governor Glenn Youngkin (R - Virginia) delivered his commencement address. Prior to the event, multiple groups, including the school\u2019s NAACP chapter and a group called \u2018Not Welcome at VCU\u2019 said graduates were willing to walk out of the ceremony when Youngkin spoke.  VCU students who spoke at a recent Board of Visitors meeting said they were upset with Youngkin\u2019s perceived interference with VCU\u2019s now rejected racial literacy requirement.  They also expressed objections to Youngkin\u2019s views on LGBTQ+ rights, healthcare, and his response to police breaking up a pro-Palestine protest.  \u201cYes, VCU has a bipartisan tradition of inviting gubernatorial speakers to commencement,\u201d explained one student in the meeting. \u201cBut progress has never been made without challenging tradition. And our students and faculty cannot truly be Rams. If we were not headstrong, and we\u2019d not headbutt that which we do not like.\u201d Earlier this week, Governor Youngkin responded to students saying they would protest the commencement saying, \u201cI firmly believe it can be a great day of celebration. I think that anyone who thinks they\u2019re going to disrupt this for their own personal goals, I think is misguided.\u201d",

    "voice_to_text": "the reason that we \u201cforgot\u201d what the Met Gala is all about is because most of us didn't know what the Met Gala was all about to begin with because the Met Gala isn't really about fundraising for the Costume Institute I mean it is a fundraiser for the Costume Institute but people out here being like thinking non profits have no other ways to raise money like if the Met Gala didn't exist the Costume Institute couldn't have any money like there are no laws on the books that says the Met can only raise money for the  Costume Institute through the Met Gala that point aside if the Met Gala was really about fundraising for the Costume Institute you would think that we would all know that the fact that nobody even freaking knew what the Met Gala money went towards shows you that the Met Gala is an event for networking it's an event for showing who's who it's an event for social power it's an event where you build your social power you invest in social power you make connections that keep the social power in your circle and the fact that this year was even more exorbitant than past years while people are very loudly struggling in the working and middle class the fact that this year the event was so extravagant while we have a g-cide happening in a country where children are being  \ud83d\udca3  actively during the Met Gala with our taxpayer money while all of these people pay no taxes to go increase their social power it's not about the fundraising for the Costume Institute people are not mad because the Costume Institute is getting funds they're mad because this is one piece of a much larger picture and there are plenty of people out there that still don't see that picture and I get it okay but it's time it's time to step back a little bit everybody and to start being willing to giving up some of our fun things like our celebrities what do celebrities do for you though? really other than offer you entertainment that distracts you from the misery of your life I'm not saying your whole life is miserable but what do you use the entertainment for? what's its value for you? what is it that you don't wanna give up? because most of the celebrities who showed up at that Met Gala haven't done jack \ud83d\udca9 for the people in Palestine they're not doing jack \ud83d\udca9 to help us fund things that need help in our country where's the opulent Met Gala to end hungry children in America? what is it that you're afraid of giving up? that you that you don't want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture? or has it never occurred to you? because now is the time to start thinking about it trust me now is the time",

Did you make the same argument to those armies, Hamas, who then attacked on October 7th? Of course I would make the same argument. I think we should be. I personally don't think that we should be supplying weapons to rogue regimes anywhere. You know, we have this alliance with, for example, Saudi Arabia, right, which is also a corrupt regime, and we end up recycling oil sales for weapons through that. I think that is also wrong.

While activism is not the main focus of my platform, it still means a lot to me. And I can't change how little I've spoken about a cause in the past.

And I have some organizations and I'm gonna plug at the end of this, as well as giraffe wallow. That's my sister. I mean, there are so many inspiring people on this app who are inspiring me and so many other creators to be better about how often we're posting about Palestine right now. I wanna call to action. All of my followers keep donating, reposting, sharing. I'm doing so and will continue to do so as best I can. It's also important to stay updated. I have some update accounts, and I'm gonna link it. It's gonna be a long description, so if you've been looking for links, now is the time. I try to post credible information and sources on Instagram Stories every day when I can. Okay, and here is my list of Organizations and charities that I would recommend donating to. First of all, I'm reading off my list. Sorry. Uh, the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, UNICEF, Doctors without borders, uh, World Central Kitchen, helping to get food to people in Gaza. Um, WHL. And lastly, head count if you are not registered to vote. If you're an American and you're not registered to vote, please do that head count. Rock the vote. So many different companies. Make it easy and make it simple. If you've never previously voted in an election, now is the election to do it in. If you, like me, do not feel represented by your government that is funding a genocide. Please, probably now is the year to vote. Stay informed. Keep talking about Palestine.

about what happened on Monday night about a week and a half before the Met Gala I was contacted by E to see if I had any interest in being a pre met gala host there are usually three hotels that celebrities leave from to go to the Met Gala I was stationed at what's called the Mark I was supposed to do content with celebrities and on air about their departures to the met the met is one of the most exclusive events in all of fashion you have to be handpicked by Anna Winter herself to go that's the only way that you get there I was not I was not invited by Anna Winter I did not hold an actual invitation to the Met Gala I was involved only as a host meaning that the moment that the last attendee left the hotel I went home and I watched the Met Gala coverage from my couch with my friends that is also why you haven't seen any photos of me on the white and green carpet for the Met Gala because I was working at the Mark and I literally wasn't even invited to the Met Gala so security would have definitely dragged me out I paid no amount of money to go to the gala because I wasn't invited since I was little I have idolized the met I love the costumes and the design and it has always been one of my biggest dreams to be invited to attend after entering content creation I was told that those dreams are nearly impossible if you are not in one of the inner circles of fashion so when E reached out to me with interest in being a pre met gala host I immediately said yes because I just wanted to get even remotely close to it just to like see the thing I had idolized for so long I was at the Mark which is on 77th Street and the Metropolitan Museum is on 82nd Street so that's about as close as I was allowed to get to the Met Gala people that you saw behind me in my videos were people that were lined up outside the Mark to do the exact same thing as me which was get content with celebrities as they departed for the met the dress that I wore was made by hand by friend Mark is one of my nearest and dearest friends I met him back when I was modeling and we just stayed friends so then when all of this red carpet stuff started happening for me I reached out to him and he started help me in and make dresses for me by hand out of literally the kindness of his own heart I have never paid him a cent he has never paid me we just work on the dresses together because we find it to be really fun every single dress I've worn on a carpet this year has all been made by hand by Mark I have not paid anyone anything I haven't bought dresses I haven't paid designers Mark is the only person that I have worked with Mark does not have a factory Mark does not employ a bunch of people to work on these dresses every single dress he has made for me he's made by himself with no one else's help by hand out of literally nothing more than the kindness of his own heart and he's one of the only reasons I've even been able to do what I've done this year because I wouldn't have had the dresses to go to these events if it hadn't been for him this now brings me to the audio that I used for that particular video and first and foremost before I say anything I need to apologize I am so so so sorry that I chose a sound that you guys could ever possibly feel was malicious in nature if I had thought for even one second that the sound would be received that way I never ever ever ever ever ever ever would have used it when I film my TikToks I love to use trending audios and sounds that people are currently using and this was one of them the sound has been used in over 110,000 TikTok videos it's the current trending audio of a glow up trend in the United States and abroad it's also been used by different makeup artists in the last couple weeks to create Marie Antoinette looks let them eat cake it's been used by big and small craters alike with no negative feedback or no negative discussion in the comments let them eat cake let them eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake let me eat cake the sound choice truly had no deeper meaning I never would have chosen a SoundOn purpose to highlight wealth disparity or eliteism I never even thought it would be taken in that way because I wasn't elite enough to even be invited to the Met Gala because I'm not elite I'm a normal person my dumb self just used an audio that I thought was viral and trending and that people recognised from the Marie Antoinette 2,006 movie Let Them Eat Cake I didn't think that much into it and for that I am so sorry I did not do my due diligence like I'm so stupid because the things going on in the world today are weighing heavily on everyone's hearts innocent men women and children are dying people do not have access to food and water people are being kicked out of their homes there are so many things going on in this world that are just wrong I know that this situation is very complex I also know that I don't know the right thing to do or say a lot of the time which leads me to the question everyone is asking which is why don't I talk about it and it's simply because I am not informed enough to talk about it in a meaningful and educational way I do not have the background knowledge to educate or discuss in a meaningful way I grew on social media as a comedy creator and I love comedy I love making videos and that's how I gained my platform but that doesn't mean that the second I started gaining followers on the platform that I automatically knew the right thing to say when it came to world affairs or wars or disputes or death or destruction or crisis I still am just that same girl who wanted to post her first comedy video a year and a half ago on TikTok but I do know that as somebody with a big platform it is my responsibility to always try to be a positive voice and to always try to better myself and be a good example for my audience because I never want to let them down at the end of the day I want to make sure that my words are used for good and when I don't think that I'm informed enough on a situation I try not to comment until I am confident that I am actually informed in the things that I'm saying are true if the pandemic taught me one thing it was that sometimes celebrities and creators need to sit down and be quiet so that other people's voices can be magnified the people that are actually well educated and informed on the situation they're the ones who should be speaking about it just because somebody has a following doesn't mean they're necessarily the right person to speak on the issue especially if they are ill informed or uninformed on that issue I do all of this on my own I don't have a fancy team that selects my sounds or edits my videos or posts my videos or writes the caption I don't have an editor I post everything myself everything that you see was probably filmed by either me or my boyfriend edited by me and then posted by me and sometimes I am dumb and sometimes I mess up sometimes I don't correctly anticipate how people will react or feel to something and for that I am truly so so so so sorry it breaks my heart that a video that I posted has added to any of this it breaks my heart that a video that I posted has made anyone feel less seen or less heard so again from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry you do not have to accept my apology but just know that I am so sorry and I really hope that this sheds a light on all of these issues and opens up a very important discussion at the end of the day I am glad though that an unintentional mistake has now been the catalyst for discussing wealth and Equality world crisis and will hopefully bring about the leaders whose voices should be heard in this and again I'm sorry it is my job as a content creator to apologize whenever I make anyone feel unseen or unheard even if it's unintentional and just know that no matter what I love you thank you for being here and thank you for watching this whole video if you made it this far"

The goals of operations like this are fairly straightforward. Their attempts at terrorizing Palestinians living under Israeli occupation while simultaneously making their lives incredibly difficult. And it's a reminder that the sort of colonial violence that is employed by the Zionist project against Palestinians extend simply beyond, like, simple brutalization and murder. Israeli occupational forces and Israeli settlers have gone out of their way for decades, try to create conditions of life on the ground that are so inhospitable to Palestinians that Palestinians either die or leave. The goal of that being to create and maintain what Israeli planners view as more favorable demographic compositions in the areas in which they're colonizing. And as a result of these operations, you often times see the demolition of Palestinian roads, of Palestinian wells for water, of Palestinian homes, of entire Palestinian villages. It's a constant daily violence that is waged openly against Palestinians living under Israeli occupation and Palestinians living outside of Israeli occupation who are denied their ability to return home from the lands in which they historically been ethnically cleansed from. These bulldozers, by the way, are also a representation of ongoing US complicity in Zionist settler colonialism. As these bulldozers are actually manufactured by Caterpillar, an American company, this bulldozer is, in effect, a result of capitalism, settler colonialism, and ultimately, imperialism, something that I think is worth thinking about is we continue watching Palestinians suffer under a brutal and repressive Israeli occupation. But, yeah, is always free Palestine. Islamu alaikum, and have a great day."

As fun as that sounds, just buying an international plane ticket is a very extreme thing to do, even for myself. However, I'll do it. I'll buy a plane ticket to the UK, but under one condition. I will buy a plane ticket to the United Kingdom if and only if you help me raise enough money for my friend Ahmed to get his family out of Gaza. Ahmed is in Canada, but he has 16 family members that are still in Gaza, most of whom are children, including a Newborn infant. Because he needs to move so many people. Right now his goal is at $200,000, of which he is very far away from. However, it seems like quite a lot of people want me to go to the United Kingdom. If just 1% of the people who watch me just in the past week donated $1, he would already have 160,000. Here's what I need you to do. If you have at least $1,000 in your bank account right now, I need you to go to the gofundme that's linked to my bio and donate $5 to his family. If you have less than that, I need you just go to the Venmo that I've LinkedIn my bio and just send me $1. That's it. Just $1. At the end of each day, I'm just gonna donate The entirety of my Venmo balance. I'm gonna keep all my Venmo transactions public from this point forward so you can see exactly how much money is coming in. Just to be clear, I've spoken off by myself personally. If you have security concerns, I can let you know that all these people have been vetted and verified through Operation Olive Branch. And all of this is being organized by Aaron Hatter, who I'm going to link in the description. If you're a creator of any size. I want to adopt or advocate for another family. Just go to the link in her bio where you can sign up. Remember, all he wants to do is get his family resettled in Canada. That's it. Regardless of where you stand politically right now, there is absolutely no reason why you should not want this to happen. right now, I need everybody to donate either the $5 or $1, like I mentioned earlier, because if you want me to go to London, we're gonna have to do this first. I wanna be clear, I am not joking here. If we get to that 200,000, I will fly across the Atlantic.",

As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief. And especially when this is happening while this genocide is taking place in Gaza. This mass murder of the Palestinian people is unacceptable. And the danger that the occupation of Palestine is causing for Jews. And on top of all, why in a synagogue? Why in a holy place? This is either a political move or a financial move. All of this is embarrassing for Jewish people, and as I said, dangerous to Jewish people as well. We should be very careful. Never allowed the completion of Zionists, would you? If one criticizes Zionists. I appreciate that, and I'll tell you why. Because I appreciate the people that define the right definition to what they criticize. Rather than criticizing Jews, which I discouraged to do. I visited Gaza. Yeah, and they did meet me. We are here to teach the world.

But the reason why I want you to block her now is because she is literally having the worst week ever. First she got booed, then she got interrupted by protesters. Followed it up with like an all lives matter type statement. I understand blocking a celebrity that has been silent, but blocking a celebrity that has been a hypocrite is so satisfying. She talked about the Armenian G word up and down all on the show, on her Instagram, but took the whole other side for the G word that's happening right now. That's crazy. Kim Kardashian is very aware of what the people are saying about her at any moment in time. Her face when she got booed at the Tom Brady roast. She was so offended. Also it has been so quiet. Not getting consistent ads for skin by Kim and skims has been so great. That's why for Blackout 2024, I nominate your number one to be Kim Kardashian!"

This is literally the United States Congress members sitting in their offices thinking, how can I just come up with a Bill and introduce it to make Israel see me? How can I serve Israel and lick the asses of Netanyahu's government so I can have a brighter political future? Like, this is the most stupid Bill that can be introduced ever. Like, to send people to Gaza for 6 month on community service, punishment, whatever, just because they are protesting at the universities. You seriously have to be the dumbest politician ever in order to think of such, like, a Bill to introduce. Seriously, you don't know that even asylum seekers who are coming from Gaza cannot be even sent back to Gaza, even if their application is being rejected, because there is no way of sending them back to Gaza. There is no airport, there is no port and thank to Israel, and Israel actually doesn't want them to be sent back, so they do not allow them passing by from their airports also. So as a genius politician, how did you think about it? Like, yeah, let's send people back to Gaza. Let's send this little Gazans to Gaza to experiment 6 month. This is the person that is introducing the Bill. I'm gonna write his name in the caption. The problem is, this Bill might pass, and it's literally embarrassing to see those American politicians ignorant About anything. And to see them for the last 7 month and a half, competing. Of servicing another country, a foreign country, while the American people and the taxpayers are telling them to do the right thing. They are going against the American people. Well, and that's because they want to satisfy iPad and their sponsors. And why they are competing. Who's gonna show more strongly the support for Israel. Because clearly they know the stronger you support Israel, the longer and the powerful your political career is. So let me know what do you think of this Bill in the comments. Don't forget to share this video. Put it in your stories and duet it. And check the link in my bio. See you next video. Ciao.",

Block every celebrity at the Met Gala. Block them all. I think this new trend where we start blocking celebrities on social media. Have been silent and complicit these past few months, is an absolutely genius initiative. But you know what? I think we can do more, and I think we can really hit them where it hurts. Let me explain how. You see, we know that these celebrities only care about their money. So what we're going to do is go after their businesses, like clothing lines or makeup lines, in order to really affect their sales. Let's start with Kim Kardashian, because I honestly cannot stand any person in that family. What we're going to be essentially doing is going to her online stores. Kim's selecting as many products as we can. Skincare, makeup, it doesn't matter. Just select as many products as you can, and then afterwards, we go to her online shopping cart right before purchasing, and then we just leave it there to sit. Abandoning your item to an online shopping cart can really affect that store sales. What it essentially does is that it limits the availability of this product to other customers who are actually interested in purchasing it. Second thing it does is that it can really confuse the store's marketing team into Their insights of customer behavior and patterns. Essentially, they won't really know what is actually popular and unpopular, what is actually in demand and what is not in demand. So let's get out there and start blocking these celebrities and putting as many of their items into shopping carts without actually buying them, because together, we can actually bring these celebrities down.",

But did you know Operation Olive Branch was a bunch of volunteers that are folks of color that have been posting about this for months? And it took me for someone to notice them. You guys know that Middle Eastern creators, black creators, Muslim creators were posting about this since the beginning and they have failed to get traction. And it took me posting about it obsessively for people to start getting on board. Whether you know it or not, voices of color are being erased. Voices of color that are awesome people that are doing the most to help. And it. It just sucks that it took one white person to get it going. And I am very grateful for all your support and all your love, but you guys need to be directing that at creators of color that have been doing this work since the beginning. And I also wanna say to white folks, first of all, text your mom back. She wants to know if you wanna get that shirt at Old Navy or not. You can wield your privilege. Look, At what happened when I did it. How it took a white person speaking out to finally get traction going. Understand that you can use that, too.

So Megan Rice and Zam actually made really, um, poignant videos about this. I'm going to tag them in the comments.

You've already killed up to 40,000 people, and a large number are innocent civilians, women and children. Out of that Hamas number that you just gave, more than 14,000 are terrorists that we took out. So how many civilians do you believe you've killed? We. We don't have exact figures, as you know. It's the fog of war. If you know exactly how many Hamas terrorists you've killed, you must know how many civilians you've killed. Otherwise, you're prioritizing the lives of terrorists over innocent people. I said around 14,000. Whereas Hamas will come out with precise numbers. Court, you can. You can use the ballpark. As far as the Hamas figures, which I reject, is being false. Well, if that's false, why would you give me those I had? I gave you the numbers that I had. No, you told me. I know you know how many Hamas terrorists you killed, but you doesn't have any idea how many civilians you killed. I'm just permused. Why wouldn't you keep count of both?

I just find it astonishing that the moment I asked you how many Hamas you killed, you could tell me immediately. And the moment I ask you about civilians, you haven't got a clue. Literally, that you're not even prepared to issue a ballpark number. And I, I think people will find that staggering, particularly given that you are insistent that you're doing everything you can to avoid killing civilians. You come on here as the official Israeli government spokesman and. And you. You don't wanna be asked how many you've killed, cause you don't know. Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds? We're in the fog of war. We're fighting for our very existence. No, you're not foggy when it comes to killing terrorists. You're only foggy, it seems to me, when it comes to killing civilian"

Over the last 6 months, more than 124 people in my family have been brutally killed by the Israeli occupation forces. For the last six months, I have to wake up to messages of my cousin being shot on his bike, of my aunt going blind because she can't get medicated for her blood pressure, of my entire uncle's house falling down on them. Everyone in that home died. Jesus. I like to see photos like my family and body bags make the rounds on Twitter. I have to see my last name scroll on them in black ink. This morning I got the news that the home that's been sheltering part of my family for the last 6 months has been fully evacuated. Last night, pamphlets drops all around their neighborhood. Last night, their next door neighbor was bombed, and everyone in that home was killed. The pamphlet said, you have to leave now. You have to evacuate now or face the violence of the Israeli occupation. My ox foot's been broken for 6 months. She's never received treatment. Most of my cousins are sick, hungry, tired. There's been no food, there's no water. They've been drinking sea water since week 3, trying to survive. And they've now evacuated the structure that was keeping them Out of the fucking cold, by the way. No windows, no doors. All those are pulling off my bombs now. They're headed to Morossi, a coastal, quote, unquote safe zone in Gaza. Hoping they'll find a tent to sleep in.",

They always have, like, walnuts and cheese in them. And salads. Middle Eastern, Israeli, Palestinian salad, whatever you wanna call it. We all eat the same thing. This beautiful Greek salad, mushrooms, cauliflower, and then literally, like, you just make your own salad. Oh, there's some zaatar and olive oil over here. Then we have hot dishes. So there's eggs, scrambled eggs, shakshuka. Look at these beautiful quiche over here. These are actually really good. I don't know what that is, but I think I'm gonna get it. Eggplant. Is that like eggplant? Parmesan, mushroom, barakas, lindses. Look at that mushroom with chili sauce. And roasted potatoes. Then all the fish, tuna, herring, salmon. Oh, my god, look at this smoked mackerel. Their tuna salads are elite. They are so good with all the pickled vegetables, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, peppers, tomatoes. And one of my favorite things to eat in Israel, because it's just better than everywhere else I've ever had is cheese. This is labneh, cottage cheese. No idea what kind of cheese hold this is. Maybe Brie. And then olives. You guys know I don't eat olives. But that's okay. I'm not gonna yuck your yum. Sometimes I do, and I'm sorry for that. And they do have some sweet. There's some Pancakes and waffles and broccoli. Interesting. But that's over here, granola, yogurt. Lots of different kinds of yogurt. Oh, look at that. Holiday dates. And just dry fruit and nuts. How beautiful. And more cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Gorgonzola. Is that what that is? And over here we have fruit as well. Then some pastries, croissants. Look at all these beautiful cakes. And then just gonna take you back here for a minute. If you can see the bread and that toaster over there. Wow.",

There are over 1.5 million innocent Palestinians that have been displaced in the south of Gaza. In Rafa, right here, over 600,000 of them are children. The aid, the food, the waters, all in that area. And now Israel's indiscriminately bombing this area. Now, mind you, all of these people are living under tents. They're indiscriminately bombing this area, dropping leaflets from the sky, telling them it is no longer safe to be there. They have to leave. Where are they supposed to go?

You're being emotionally manipulated. Imagine that you and I are married, and every time you draw boundary with me, I smother our kid with a pillow and say something like, look at what you're making me do. I would be emotionally manipulating you. That is exactly what's happening in Gaza right now, and most people agree with that because it's obvious. And if it's not obvious to you, then you either have another agenda you're pushing or you've been emotionally manipulated. You're being emotionally manipulated. You should talk to somebody about that. Ideally, that person is not some woke terrorist apologist therapist. And if you wanna see more content from a mental health professional who has the emotional skills to look at today's events with a little bit of clarity, you should toss me a follow.

And that means no humanitarian a trucks are entering. Those who are in need for a treatment outside Gaza cannot travel. Those who are in need to evacuate their families to find any safe places outside Gaza cannot travel. The international humanitarian workers, doctors, activists cannot get inside Gaza. Can you imagine the massive crisis that we are going to? And by the way, the Israeli army started already bumping and destroying whole residential blocks right now in this moment in the east of Rafah. And people are escaping. But to where? To un. Um. Um. A livable places in. In canunas. They cannot live in canunas. There is no places in Canunas even to but a tent. So the thing is, Egypt, America, and the whole world warned Israel to not enter Rafah, because entering Rafah will result in maybe the hardest crisis ever in the history, because Rafah contains 1.5 million people. But now Israel already started the military operation already. I don't know what to say, but keep an eye on Rafa, because none of us will leave. We'll have any other places to live. And if you left Trafalgar to this unknown destiny, that means you're leaving all of us, because we are not leaving. There is no more places to live to. That was the edge, okay? That was the far south. That that they told us to go to when we were in the north of the north of Gaza and in canunes. Now we are in the far south. Where to go? Where to go? No one is leaving.

Yeah, yeah, you don't have free speech.

Their actions represent the dropping of the veil. They know now that you will know that you never really have free speech.

I know it's devastating to recognize that your company is fascist and that the fascism is actually been hiding in plain sight, particularly if you're a person. But the fact that they've stopped playing the game, the fact that they have stopped allowing us to delusion that we have free speech, tells you that what we are doing is working.

Today is our love letter to the people of US up and to the people of Palestine. We have watched them stead, fastly, and patiently and bravely stand in the face of the oppressors, in a way with Grace and in a way with faith. Inspired by them, we decided to do the same this Monday. And I can say that we are the first in the UC system so peacefully we have on this campus that shares our vision of justice, that shares our vision to be progressive, that shares our vision of protecting our students. We have decided to dissolve this encampment without a single arrest, a single one of you being put in harm's way, so we will no longer be complicit in the crimes perpetrated against my people. Yeah! We have four very clear demands going into this. First, we demand a transparency. We needed the university to disclose all of their investments and endowments, specifically as it relates to arms and weapons manufacturing. We can say that the university has agreed to make it entirely transparent which companies we are investing in and the size of those investments. And we will Continue to call for transparency moving forward. Following that, we called on this administration to end their silence. Chancellor Wilcox has recognized the death toll and Liza. And we will continue to figure out ways for this administration to support you students here. Next, we called on divestment. I am confident that we have outlined concrete, legitimate steps for us to no longer be complicit through our financial. Through our financial engagements at this university. We are going in the right direction, and I am confident we will fully divest from weapons and arms manufacturing by the end of next year. Actually, I'm not gonna make any promise. Lastly, we call for our full academic boycott. Students at UC Riverside will no longer be able to walk the lands that I am prohibited from. At this university. Will no longer be able to see my Holy Land that I embarked from. As long as there's an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, students at the university of California, Riverside will not walk the land that I am banned from. Yeah. I just wanna thank every single person who has invested in this encampment anyway, materially, emotionally. To the people who Venmo, to the people who dropped off food, to the people who slept here, to the people who sent words of support, to the medics who volunteered, to our legal observers, to our police liaisons, our media liaisons, to every single person who offered support, every single person who visited, to The children who blew bubbles. To the people who drew the talk, to the people who put up the signs, to the people who stood that fast with us. I want to thank you, because this is your win. No, this is all yours. I want to. I want to also say.",

On April the first, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, passed a law that allowed the prime minister to ban Al Jazeera. He's now enacted that law. Let me just take you through some of the definitions within the law. They banned our website, including anything that has the option of entering or accessing the website, even passwords that are needed, um, whether they're paid or not, and whether it's stored on Israeli servers or outside of Israel. The website is now inaccessible. Uh, they're also banning any device used for providing content. That includes my mobile phone. If I use that, uh, to do any kind of news gathering, then the Israelis can simply confiscate it. Our internet access provider, the guy that simply hosts, uh, Al jazeera.net, uh, is also in danger of being find if they host the website. The Al Jazeera TV channel completely banned. Transmission by any kind of content provider is also banned and holding offices or operating them in the territory of Israel by the channel. Also, once again, any devices used to provide content for the channel can be taken away by the Israelis. It's a wide ranging ban. We don't know how long it will be in place for, but it does cover this territory of the state of Israel. Imran Khan, Al Jazeera, occupied Easter Islam.",

Specifically, the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange Program, where police in Georgia train with the IOF. And cop city, obviously, is modeled in an inspired by the Zionist state in the Israeli occupation of Palestine. And capcities across the US, moreover, are continuing to be invested in and built in order to continue to police and to essentially be centers to quash any rebellion towards the genocidal settler colony known as America and the violent occupation of Turtle Island by the American Empire. But I think something that gets lost here is people like to source the locust of policing outside of the American settler colony. This is not new. The Zionist state is not teaching the American occupation. Crack down and violate and police and kill and suppress individuals in the United States, most notably black indigenous people. Policing comes from slave patrols. Entire white society would participate in quashing slave rebellions. This is not new. This is how the structure of policing emerges. Slavery is legal in the United States through the 13th Amendment. With the prison industrial complex. The IOF and the Zionist state, moreover, are modeled after the American settler colony an occupation of Turtle Island. It's not the other way around. It's not that policing in the United States needs to learn something that they don't already know. Policing emerges from slave patrols. The United States is the Locust of violence the Zionist state is the client state which models and iterates and replicates and is funded by American empire. So we're not here to just divest from the police. We're not here to defund the police. We here to abolish the police, to burn down the plantation, to completely destroy these violent and just horrific death machines and systems and compost them so that we can actually have a chance of living on this earth and for caring for one another."

    "voice_to_text": "New York Times opinion released a fucking humiliating article today about the student encampments. It includes the quote protesters have demands, including divestment and cutting off ties with IZZY. But ending relations with IZZY doesn't help Gauzens. And on the contrary, it's useful for universities to have exchanges with a broad range of places, including those whose policies we disagree with. Doesn't help gazens to stop sending money for bombs. Guys, like, at this point, are you just, like, lying for fun? The top comment on this article, thank god. Was a great MLK quote. To sum it up, it's over the last few years, I've been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. The great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the this thing that I'm not gonna say, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action. There's another line in the article that stood out to me and many commenters. You know, I admire your empathy for Gauzens, but what about the risks to commencements? Oh, goodness, you're right. Commencement speeches in G Slide clearly carry the same weight. Shut up, Nick. No meaningful changes ever come about by asking nicely. Nice to know you care more about property damage than human lives. Isn't this the exact same thing every old white pro war dude Has said about activists ever. The New York Times has had a lot of fumbles recently, but this guy saying that it's useful for universities to have exchanges with places whose policies we disagree with has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever read.",

According to their logic, what's the difference between their beliefs and the beliefs of the Christians? Let me explain. Let's look at how the Christians belief and the belief of the so called salefiyah are similar. So the Christians believe that Jesus is god. And we know that I Sally, his salam is in the second heaven. So Jesus is in a place, he takes up space, he has a volume. The heavens is a place. And the wahabiya, the so called salafiya, they also believe that Allah is in the heavens. And they also say that Allah is sitting on the throne. Or they say he ascended above the throne. Referring to directions and places. Hello, Sunnah. We say Allah created the throne, he doesn't need it. And he's above everything in status, not in location. So you see, when I said Allah exists, not like we exist, he exists without being in a place, without being in a direction, that person called me a liar. So my belief, the belief of all the prophets is very clear. And their belief is very similar to the Christians. So wake up!"

The past few days, members of the administration have singled out people they recognize, um, and have written them disciplinary notices. So this is the beginning of administrative discipline that we see getting students in trouble for organizing, me being one of them. We don't know what police response will look like. In the next upcoming days, there are some big university events, and the administration has made it very, very clear that they want us gone.

    "voice_to_text": "The UCLA protest just recently got attacked by a group of Zionists. The Zionists attack the protesters with bear spray, fireworks and items that they threw at them, as well as, I believe, bludgeoning items. And the police who have been terrorizing these students, nowhere to be found. And we've seen this sort of behaviour before with the police and with bad actors outside of the police force. Back during the BLM protests, when they were happening much more frequently, there were uprisings of unsavory people who were larping as militias. One such militia showed up at a BLM protest that we all know about because it was the protest that involved Kyle Rittenhouse gunning down, uh, gunning down protesters. And what the police did was they knew about the militia. They were joking around and having back and forth conversations with the militia, and they were hurting the protesters towards the militia because the police wanted the militia to hurt the protesters because they couldn't. At least they couldn't without difficulties. And that resulted in Kyle Rittenhouse coming across the protesters and gunning three of them down, killing two of them and injuring the third. And I believe this is a method that the police are going to repeatedly use against the protesters at the college campuses. They're going to come in and calm things down. And by calms things down, I mean they're going to terrorize the protesters and then they're going to back off and let the Zionists come back and assault them, and it's going to be a continual cycle over and over again. Because the police aren't here for the American people. They're here to defend the rich and the most unsavory individuals to ever come out of humanity. And we saw this in Charlottesville, and we're seeing it now, and in its entirety. This puts all of our ability to protest and exercise our First Amendment right in a precarious situation, because if any of these protesters try to protect themselves or defend themselves, it will be seen as the act of anti Semitism. And the court system that does not represent the American people will utilize that, and they will use it to legally try to shut the protest down and try to incarcerate the protesters. The only silver lining to this is, much like the child graping IOF that these Zionists aspire to be like, Zionists are not very good at keeping their mouths shut when they do something wrong, evil, or illegal. So keeping an eye out for people bragging about this on their social media is key. Getting their names, recording evidence, and then using lawsuits against them would be the next course of action. But make no mistake, these kids are in danger, and the police have never been here for us.",

So you don't think that's intimidating to Jews or. I mean, I'm British. Israeli. So you don't think that's intimidating for people who are. Cause I'm Israeli and I feel intimidated being on a bus and luckily I have a British accent cause my mum's British.

No, it's not my personal opinion. No, it's not. It's not professional. It goes against professional guidelines to express your political beliefs at work. Especially when that could potentially intimidate people. I find that intimidating. My mom's best friend's family died on October 7th. They were murdered by her Mass terrorists. I find that. I find that intimidating. I find that triggering. Well, I can't do anything about that. I'm sorry. You. You can do it. You cannot wear that at work because that's. It's political opinions that can be offensive to Jews and Israelis getting on your box. You work in a public center. You have. I'm sure you all have Jewish friends, don't you? Like you all, like in the 50s, you all have black friends, you all had Jewish friends. And your Jewish friends. Well, you're being offensive to me. I'm not being offensive to you. Yeah, you have Jewish friends who are happy with you walking around with that on. I highly doubt it, since most Jews are Zionists. Alright, yeah, yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. And you don't condemn Hamas what they did on October 7th. You don't. You don't condemn Hamas for what they did on October 7th? Yeah, because you don't.

now\u00a0the\u00a0problems\u00a0with\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0something\u00a0I've\u00a0been\u00a0researching\u00a0for\u00a0quite\u00a0a\u00a0while way back in October when\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0a\u00a0Bill\u00a0stating\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018anti-Zionism\u00a0is\u00a0antisemitism\u2019 and\u00a0referenced\u00a0this\u00a0definition I\u2019ve\u00a0come\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0obvious\u00a0conclusion that this definition is used to shut down free speech criticizing\u00a0Israel\u00a0and\u00a0policies\u00a0in\u00a0governments\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0world this\u00a0definition\u00a0is\u00a0heavily\u00a0pushed\u00a0by\u00a0pro-Israel\u00a0lobbies\u00a0here\u00a0in\u00a0America because it literally gives these lobbies protections not\u00a0only\u00a0are\u00a0they\u00a0already\u00a0acting\u00a0in\u00a0Israel's\u00a0interests and on behalf of Israel this shuts down a lot of criticism of the pro Israel lobby in America because a lot of it is based off the actions of the state of Israel if you can't criticize Israel legally anymore you can't criticize these pro Israel lobbies the\u00a0author\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act\u00a0is\u00a0Mike\u00a0Lawler and\u00a0you\u00a0already\u00a0know\u00a0he's\u00a0funded\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC\u00a0$180,000\u00a0this\u00a0year\u00a0alone the\u00a0reason\u00a0this\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0being\u00a0pushed\u00a0right\u00a0now is so they can use it to shut down college protests and\u00a0say\u00a0that\u00a0they're\u00a0in\u00a0violation\u00a0of\u00a0Title\u00a0VI and\u00a0let\u00a0them\u00a0pull\u00a0federal\u00a0funding\u00a0from\u00a0schools who allow these protests to continue on their campuses when I was doing my research I came across something that was really interesting this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0Declaration\u00a0on\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0 which\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0IHRA\u2019s\u00a0definition their goal was to fix the issues with the other definition which\u00a0conflated\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0with\u00a0antisemitism the two are not the same and\u00a0fix\u00a0the\u00a0clear\u00a0bias\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0Israel that the other definition is being used for so a group of 200 scholars got together and wrote this definition that makes a clear distinction about what is and\u00a0what\u00a0isn't\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0and\u00a0antisemitism my\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0politicians\u00a0are\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0not\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0definition??\u2019 clearly protects free speech in a way that the other one does not the\u00a0answer\u00a0is\u00a0-they\u00a0don't\u00a0wanna\u00a0use\u00a0it they want to shut down criticism of the state of Israel that's why they use this one we have to all speak out against this act it's an evil act it's an act meant to shut down free speech it's an act meant to protect Israel this is not an American Bill it's an Israeli Bill pushed\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC using\u00a0a\u00a0problematic\u00a0and\u00a0biased\u00a0definition they\u00a0had\u00a0the\u00a0audacity\u00a0to\u00a0name\u00a0it\u00a0the\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act

And before you yell blasphemy, just know I've been to more Sunday services and youth groups than I can count.

And I don't know if you've noticed, but everything's unaffordable. Corporate agreed with political backing is buying up all of our residential real estate just to rent it back to us at a profit. So I don't really care what Jesus would Do I'll stoop to any level to say fuck the people at the top of this human food chain",

And what's happening here is that we feel that, um, a group of students who maybe don't have all the information that they need are allowed to take over a campus and scare our Jewish students. And that's not okay. We want our Jewish kids who are behind these gates to understand that we're here, support them. But more than that, we are here because clearly there are 133 people that we are still waiting for, and we are patiently waiting. They can encamp as long as they want. We're not gonna stop coming and supporting the families and the people who need us to support them. When Hamas stops what they're doing and they bring back the hostages that they took, then it will stop, and they can all go home. Everyone can go back to school. Life can continue again. But bring them home. We. We did not begin this. Israel did not start this."

Yup. Yesterday, Palestinian officials uncovered two mass graves outside the bond hospitals in Gaza. These graves also constitute as a war crime, don't they? Deputy Prime Minister well, of course, we would expect the, the democratic government of Israel to investigate any allegations of misconduct, and that's exactly what they do, and it's exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge them to do. But I find it quite extraordinary that she seeks to draw parallels between the legitimate war of self defense of Israel and the conduct of Russia. Party Black 300 bodies, including the elderly and the injured, some of which had been stripped naked, mutilated, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UK's own arms policy states that if there is even a risk that war crimes may be taking place, then that is reason enough to halt the sale of arms. Stop the sale, given all we know. Why then, is the Prime Minister yet to do so? Stop the sale. Deputy Prime Minister well, we continue to urge the Israeli government to investigate any allegations of misconduct. The difference, though, is that we can trust the Israeli government, a democratically elected government, to properly investigate those things. And of course, we keep the advice under review. The foreign secretary Has recently made it clear that he is conducted, uh, a determination and has not changed his advice regarding, uh, export licenses. And I think that is the correct decision.",

    "voice_to_text": "Most of the bombs and most of the military equipment the Israeli government is using in Gaza is provided by the United States and subsidized by American taxpayers. The US military is not dropping 2,000 pound bombs on civilian apartment buildings. The US military is not doing that, but we are supplying those bombs. United States of America is not blocking the borders and preventing food, water and medical supplies from getting to desperate people. We are not doing that. But we have supplied billions of dollars to the Netanyahu government, which is doing just that. So this is not just an Israeli war, this is an American war as well. And yet, despite the massive financial and military support the United States has provided to Israel for many years, Natanya House! Natanya House! Extremist government has ignored urgent calls from the president and others to alter their military approach and to end this humanitarian disaster. In my view, the United States is unconditional financial and military support for Israel must end. And that is why I offered an amendment to this Bill to do, in fact, what a majority of the American people want us to do, and that is no longer to provide military aid to the destructive Netanyahu government. I would have welcomed the chance to vote for the humanitarian aid provision in this Bill. Terribly important that we stop feeding people not only in Gaza, but in Sudan and all over the world. It's an important provision. I wanna support. It. I believe very strongly that we should support Ukraine and help them in defeat the imperialist ventures of Putin and the Russian army. But I'm not gonna be able to do that because I'm gonna stand with the American people today who oppose more money for Netanyahu. What we are doing today is very bad policy. We are eating and abetting the destruction of the Palestinian people. What we are doing today is not what the American people want. And I say to my democratic friends, it is absolutely not what Democrats. A lot of Republicans don't want us to continue that as well. But a strong majority of Democrats are saying, enough with Netanyahu's war. You just can't give him another $10 billion for unfetted military aid. But I suppose in a little while, as things happen here in the Congress, we will ignore the needs of the American people. We will not pay attention to what they want. And then we are shocked, just shocked, that we have a 14% approval rating.",

I don't think he cares if Palestinians are murdered like roaches and ants. Um, but to the rest of Americans who have normal human values, uh, they do care. And, uh, you know, one of the other things that Mark and I wrote in that piece is that the blood on the trauma bay floor and the operating room floor was dripping from our hands. And that's. I think that's accurate. We again, we provide the crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support. Um, your viewers are no surprise to that. And that makes us responsible. If our support stops, the attack stop. If our support stops, the occupation stops. It's. It's instant. It's been proven a hundred times. It's not hard. Not hard to see. Um, and so that's what I would say to people is if you want to stop participating unwittingly, uh, in these. In some of the worst crimes that I've ever seen in my life, then you need to organize and you need to raise the cost to people like Joe Biden, because that is the only thing they care about there. The US is attempting to manage the Middle East with the system that I put in place since the Arab Spring, and the Palestinians are just kind of an annoyance to that system. So I would say To people that you know. You know what's going on. So stop thinking about it all that much and just start acting. Go to, uh, go to your houses of worship, go to your community centres, go wherever it is that you go and talk to people and say, look, let's go talk to our congressman in person. Let's demand a meeting. If you're a veteran, put your uniform on and go. I've had several veterans reach out to me. Put your uniform on, go talk to your congressperson. Film it, put it online. Do anything you can to embarrass these people and to make it obvious to the world that they are not acting with normal human decency in mind. They're acting with purely cold, almost Mafia like political calculations. And, um, the only way that we are going to stop this is by raising the cost to them of doing so.",

I think you've lost the thread. It. It just to end on this. If you had a message for Christian leaders in the United States, whether in government or in churches, or just citizens who care about the religion, their fellow Christians, what would it be? It would be to remind them that when the state of Israel was created, it was not created on an empty land. It was created on a land that had, uh, millions of indigenous Palestinians there, including Palestinian Christians. And that that state they support, uh, that state they celebrated as a fulfillment of prophecy and the sign of God state to the Jewish people. For it to become a state, uh, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians, uh, were forced to leave and have never returned. Uh, churches were closed. A friend of mine did the research and counted more than 30 churches that were closed when Israel was created. Because Palestinians, uh, were expelled from, uh, the land. Our numbers continue to be in decline. Uh, so we're pleading that, uh, uh, come and listen. Come and talk to us. And my message to Christian leaders right now is there is a very, very brutal war taking place in Gaza. A war that I've described using the word genocide because it's a war that Has used even starvation as a mean. And fellow Christians are suffering because of that war. Uh, it's time that, uh, Christian leaders, ah, recognise that wars is not the way, whether in Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya. I mean, when will we learn that war does not help? When will we take Jesus's words seriously, uh, about being peacemakers, about being merciful, merciful. There must be, uh, other ways. Um, and so it would be an invitation to listen, to learn more, uh, and to avoid very shallow and simplistic perspectives that are not based on Scripture itself, but more based on, uh, political, uh, equations. Um, and I would plea right now, and I will continue to plea, that we need to stop this war in cancer. Uh, it's killing many, many children, women, innocent lives. It has to stop. There must be, uh, other ways. And as a follower of Christ, uh, we have to pursue the path of peace, uh, and justice. And we have to avoid simplistic, uh, polarizations. Good and evil. Come and listen. Come and understand what's happening. And I plead, as a Christian pastor from Bethlehem, I plead that you come and listen. Father, thank you for your thoroughly decent and sensible analysis, and I hope it's heard by Christians throughout the west. I appreciate it.",

I don't think that's the right way forward. No. Hmm. Why? Why is that?

It's not micro targeted about what you want to achieve, but also the. The, uh, downside, far away is the, uh, the upside. So I understand why people feel passionately about this. Uh, you know, Israel is the only nation in the world that's the, you know, Jewish majority, so people are nervous about the impact it has on Jewish people as well as those, you know, Palestinians, many of the Muslims who work in the occupied territories. So, you know, people, understandably, are trying to think about leavers. They can, you know, pull in relation to putting pressure on nazmiyahu. I think they're much more effective leavers. The British government has. Oh, you mentioned South Africa, and apartheid in South Africa in particular. And boycotts and sanctions were key tools that were used to rally support for the ANC, for, you know, support against apartheid, which inevitably was successful in bringing down the apartheid.

    "voice_to_text": "Some people are still confused as to why Starbucks is getting boycotted, and I'm here to tell you why and give you the details. So on October 7th, Starbucks is workers union, also known as Starbucks Workers United, posted a pro Palestine tweet expressing their solidary with Palestine. Few days after the tweet, Florida Republicans, including US Senator Rick Scott, called for a boycott of Starbucks. The Orthodox Chamber of Commerce also called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that drinking a cup of Starbucks was drinking a cup of Jewish blood. On the same day as these calls for a boycott, Starbucks leadership said that they disagreed with the union's views and statement. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz met with the CEO and founder of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber to discuss the ongoing support of Israel and the condemnation of the union stores that support Palestine. The CEO of the Orthodox Jewish Chamber suggested to shows that he should close down the stores. Colts explained that it would be illegal for him to do so, but expressed his desire to close down every union store and terminate all the employees. The chamber suggested that Starbucks should take legal action, and then the chamber and Starbucks work together to release a list of all 300 Union stores and their addresses, putting all of these employees at risk. On October 18th, Starbucks sued the union for trademark infringement, demanding that Starbucks Workers United stop using Starbucks in their name and to also stop Using any other identifying symbols, Starbucks Workers United then sued Starbucks because the company has stated and implied that the union supports terrorism and violence. Because of Starbucks's ongoing support for Israel and them suing the union after a pro Palestine tweet, many people and customers then started calling for a boycott on Starbucks. So before your next Starbucks trip, think, is this a company that I really wanna support?",

    "voice_to_text": "You describe the, uh, the strike as a possible mistake by Israel. According to, uh, Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, it wasn't one strike, but three. The first one, then an interval during which aid workers got out of their vehicles, removed the wounded, tried to move to another vehicle, which was struck. And then a third strike. What? As they tried to move and escape in a third vehicle, at which point all of them were dead. How would the second and third strikes of these marked vehicles be a mistake? And why would the US not more forcefully set conditions on the use of US made weaponry when it is being used to target aid workers? If the first one was a mistake, the second two, we're targeted with the intent of killing everyone in that convoy. So how do you respond to that? First of all, there's an investigation going on, so why don't we let it get done and why don't we see what they find in terms of the decision making process that LED to this terrible outcome? Prime Minister and the IDF have noted that it was their error. If you don't like the word mistake. Their error. They're investigating it. Let them do that work and let them see what they come up with, and then we'll go from there. Two years ago, the IDF killed an Al Jazeera journalist. They said that that was a mistake, uh, that she was wearing a Mark Press vest. She was shot anyway. Investigated it, and they, uh, released the findings. Their investigation, which found that they were at fault. Go on. But my. My question, sir, is in that case, uh, these. The Israelis did not initiate any criminal, uh, proceeding in this case. If it's found that the marked convoy was deliberately targeted, if not with the first shot, but the second two shots with the US support, criminal penalties. As I said, we would expect that should there be a need for accountability, that accountability be properly put in place for whoever may be responsible for this. But again, that's gonna allow. That's gonna depend on the investigation."

It's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up. This is the quiet part. Out loud. That this is what is widely understood, but not supposed. Supposed to be said out loud. Jared, like the flesh of the children that he wants to build his luxury developments on, hasn't even fully decomposed off of the bones. I just wanted to really quickly read this paragraph that I saw the other day, just to give people a sense of what the construction of these kinds of cities and the development on Palestinian land really looks like. TEL Aviv serves as a coordinator point in a globally integrated imperial project. The money generated from the purchase of settlement feta cheese in Marina Del Rey. Costco helps to finance the dispossession machines of the Jordan Valley, where the Israeli dairy conglomerate Tanuva operates a food processing plant. Former Israeli soldiers recruited into New York private equity firms make tax deductible contributions to the 5 O 1 C 3 designated charitable non profit. Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces support the army that protects their second homes. Launder billions stream in from Zionist mining extraction in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the mineral magnates flee to Israel to avoid international sanctions. This is the story of all colonialisms. Settlers build their tall, shiny things on the embers of the societies they torch, enlist the dispossessed into the production and maintenance, export the spoils and bury their guilt in their families, splying out on terraces, declaring themselves home at last. Just to give credit really quickly, the piece is called hating at lush on TEL Aviv by Kaleem Hawa."

That over here is Jared Kushner. He's married to Ivankatron. Yes, that Ivanka Trump. Love the dynamic, by the way, but that's besides the point. Recently on some podcast or interview, and he was asked what he thinks should happen to Gaza, and this man had the audacity to say the quiet part out loud. Take a look. Listen to what he says. Once Gaza's leave Gaza, and then I was never gonna let them back in. Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. And Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable. It's a little bit of unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out, and then there's not much left of Gaza anyway. Move the gazons out and then clean it up. This is why it is so important to continue to talk and for everyone to use their platform to spread news like this. Because their plans are far from over. They said it initially, they wanted to turn Gaza into a parking lot. And now they're already wanting to develop said parking lot with absolutely no remorse for literal human life.",

You can see the statue of Liberty down there. Oh yeah, you can. Even though it's cloudy, you can't see. I gotta have my hairstyles. This TV is cool. What is this laying around towards us? Come over to the kitchen. Gilmore Girls. Gilmore Girls. I grew up watching that show. I do TikTok live. What would that look like? There's an essential object about the heels for a live stream. Our one little bathroom here. She does the job where the magic doesn't really happen. I do make my bed every day. This was actually what I performed to the last arrows tour live. And hot dog suit. I can jump in heels better than I can walk in them. One last thing. So step back. This was while I was still single, so it felt like I was kind of like holding on to something that loved me.
