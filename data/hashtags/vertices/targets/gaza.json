    "voice_to_text": "yelling many of you I've been watching Dara Starr's videos for years and I have never seen her that upset she has been giving us free education on social justice on history on racism and on so many problematic things and I've never seen her that angry and she talks about heavy heavy stuff with beautiful PBS style videos for free okay and I've never seen her that angry despite all the heavy things that I've heard her talks about because this creator this white creator decided to call Dar out saying that she doesn't do enough for Palestine that she's not posting about Palestine because his white creator only looked at Dar's videos on one platform and decided okay she's problematic without doing any due diligence and it's very frustrating to see because I think that this like creator who's also Jewish has done a good job in the past with a lot of the content that they put together but I think that we come to a problem here where a lot of folks have totally lost the plot in the way that you do activism work because there's so many folks that are so focused on call outs and they're not interested in calling out the people in power they're not interested in calling up the people that can make the most impact they are calling out people that have completely aligned values but they don't feel like they're aligning enough and for that reason alone they're going to go ahead and publicly drag them I am not interested in watching videos of these are the celebrities that we need to block this is the creator that said this and should have said this it is such a massive waste of time there are so many movements that are happening right now that really need attention and need to get awareness and need to get some really great visibility and spending time on while so and so didn't say enough about this is wild for Darra to be somebody who has been a loud activist for Palestine and be called out as not being an activist at all it just really goes to show like where people are putting their focus and energy and it does not make sense it takes no time to see somebody who is aligned with you especially somebody who belongs to a marginalized demographic and send a message and just ask like hey I don't see this I looked on all of your platforms and just curious like what that's about because there's lots of reasons why people don't post as much as they would like to or on the platforms that would think that they would wanna post I don't post about this topic as much as I'd like to there is a reason why and instead of being asked that being dragged is not the right next step and this was incredibly frustrating to watch I just I hate that",

What about our beheaded children? and burned children and mishandled the mistreated women? that occurred on October 7th? where people deliberately engaged in those specific actions? Hamas takes from the exact same playbook of the Beduoins indigenous of the Seir region (Red Land) by which most have migrated to the Negev who take advantage of the plight and exploit the plight of The displaced Hellenistic, displaced Egyptian, and displaced Arab communities that form the concept of Palestine they (The Beduoins indigenous to the Seir Region of Jordan/ Red Land) have used their vulnerability (of the displaced Hellenistic, Egyptian and Arab Communities making up the concept of Palestine) over and over again to attempt to annihilate and genocide Jewish and Christian communities in that land (that was formerly Israel) after the destruction of Jerusalem (during sporadic pogroms over the last 2,000 years) and during the destruction of Jerusalem almost 2,000 years ago I'm going to summarize what Josephus wrote about in 70 AD by quoting the Midrash here according to Amos 1:6 these are the displaced Egyptian and Hellenistic and Arab communities that form together under the concept of Palestine or the Philistines even after the Babylonians came and destroy them that basically contributed to the attempted genocide of the Jewish people in Jerusalem and Judea almost 2,000 years ago (Today) Rafa is the last holdout Hamas could have surrendered by now it would have been easier for them to surrender Hamas has been hiding among the civilian population in Rafa there was a couple in Gaza who got married and Hamas decided to take the husband and decided to drag him along the back of a truck until he died because everybody's supposed to be sad and promoting the same exact propaganda can't even imagine the turmoil that the that Hamas is inflicted upon the Palestinian population but you label our side as a conspiracy why you gaslight and then like the obedient robots that you are you don't think for yourselves and you try to cancel us off the internet just because we're Christian and Jewish Zionists I don't wanna cancel your side I wanna come to the table and have a discussion because Israel is gonna be left with the Bill once this is all said and done and once they win and I assure you that the tension will not go away so yes let's discuss",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm gonna have a RANT okay so skip this video if you don't wanna see like um if you don't like the kind of angrier content that people make but it's interesting looking back at this with the context of everything that's going on now at the time it was so easy for the right wing followers to villainize um Jeremy Corbyn and use this to undermine his um his you know place in the race to be prime minister um and it just it makes me so sad because I remember at the time so many people my age were desperate for Labour to come into power and all of the turmoil we've personally experienced as a country since then at the hands of the Tory party in facilitating people who pursue power for the sole purpose of their own greed of fulfilling their own greed um and the consequences of giving those people a platform that we've all experienced over the past what's it been 12 years but also how quickly that plight was dismissed and having Jeremy be like \"oh he's anti Semitic\" and this whole inquiry of anti Semitism in the Labour Party I'm not saying that's not justified because we like to rule that shit out anyway but you know now the people in the Gaza Strip the people in Rafa Palestinians have essential uh uh they're having their own Holocaust um they're having their own genocide and it's it just seems so hypocritical these people at the time that was so vocal about Jeremy Corbyn and you know him being disrespectful about like the Holocaust and stuff like that and it I guess the point I'm trying to get to is the people who voted *Conservatives in back then have facilitated the trauma that's happening in Palestine you and I guess it comes back to the issue of critical thinking and just being fed what you were told by the parties you choose to believe and I don't wanna like say like oh Tories are responsible for what's happening in Palestine but kind of yeah because when you undermine something in order to further your own party in your own pursuit of power you facilitate stuff like this happening um and people who you know said that Jeremy was anti Semitic um and took that side of the debate it it's part of the reason why Palestine is getting so little support now why so many countries are more concerned with um the anti Semitic side of the debate as opposed to the fact that you know 15,000 children have died um and millions of people are displaced and if if there's any message that there's gonna be to this video it's just genuinely think about the content you are consuming because all of it is intentional all of it is to make you behave in a certain way every advert you see on the TV every advert that comes up every two seconds on TikTok um a corporations that so much larger than you trying to influence your attention to further their profit the governments are corrupt and now um it's just sad to see that you know the labour we are exposed to today is nothing compared to what we could have had access to back then and what sorrows me is if Labour had come into power back then how many Palestinian lives would have been saved in this conflict how many children families would have a chance and still be alive today if back then we'd set the precedent of supporting these people instead of now where the the Labour Party is so twisted in order to respond to the Tories and have a chance against the Tories because the British people are an absolute mess these days and the only way to have a shot at being in power is trying appeal to those awful twisted ideologies that you know we have all been infected by it doesn't take a genius to see videos of like children's broken bodies and people screaming in grief their homeland being burnt dying of sickness no hospitals and for you to go that's fucked up and despite a lot like you can't trust a fraction of what's in the news these days anything um any random article is designed to detract us from these issues so we get distracted so we forget the Tories will focus on things like the transgender about the women's bathrooms debate um to detract from these real issues and give us other things that they can control that we can focus on and we can hate um if anything it's just uh a plea for people to instill critical thinking to look at the content you're being fed and being like okay what's the agenda here is this true you say there's articles you've made claims where is the truth what has this been you know investigated has this been substantiated um you know the when they actually investigated the Labour Party for anti Semitic claims back in I can't remember what year this was going on um they didn't find anything because the Tories and made it all up to stir a load of bloody chaos um and ensure that Jeremy didn't get into power because it was easy to turn this against him because it was radical for the time and again how many Palestinians would still be alive today if we had dismissed that um that doctrine back then and given Jeremy

If you have money to donate, go to his page and click on his gofundme. And even $5, um, if you can donate that. But if not, just interact with his video. Like comment um. Favorite share. Um. He actually reached out to me on Instagram to try to get the word out about his gofundme, um, because he is trying to evacuate his family of 13 people. I think the fact that he reached out to me on Instagram really says something. Me only having like 530 followers, not having a huge following just shows how very desperate he is. So please, please, please go back to his video and interact as much as possible. Thank you."

Wages are so stagnant that people can hardly afford groceries; Target recently (basically) admitted that, \"yeah, we inflated our prices for funsies\" and now they're deflating them because of all the complaints about people being unable to afford shit. And this is what you're talking about? THIS is the most important thing you think you could possibly talk about at this point in time?! There are families in Gaza that don't exist anymore! There are entire genealogical pools that have been *wiped off the face of the earth*. There are people in Rafa begging for help. We are watching the wholesale destruction, slaughter and eradication of an entire people group; but you think strangers' genitals and which bathrooms they should use is the most important thing we can be fucking discussing right now?! What rock do you live under? What do you smoke? What do you drink? Because I would love some. I would love to be so detached and delusional and completely unaware of the world around me, so that I can be just as oblivious and focus on things that don't matter, just like you. I would love that! But no, instead, I wake up every day thinking about Palestine and how I'm unable to fucking help anybody because I'm broke, how all of my money has to go to rent, otherwise I will end up homeless. My thoughts are consumed about the deteriorating life of every American in this country, and how we are just watching a genocide happen in full goddamn view of everyone and God,  and you are sitting on your butt, in your bathroom, with your 4 inch baby pink acrylics, talking about genitals!! I think what hurts me the most is that there are so many people just like you, who literally don't give a darn about how the average American is this close to homelessness with every paycheck, and how there's entire families just gone, off the face of the planet. I hate you, but in a way I envy you. I envy the fact that you can hear all of this shit going on, hear about the misery and the frustrations and the unhappiness, and still be wholly consumed by whether or not somebody has a weenie. I don't know how.. but somehow I envy that."

    "voice_to_text": "I'm just trying to get some clarity okay I'm gonna try and give the Alphonse angle here as best I can for me this is a very simple decision Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden let me tell you guys why most people who have reached the conclusion that they're not gonna vote for Joe Biden primarily I'd say about 60% of people who changed their vote away from Joe Biden is because of the war between Israel and Palestine specifically Gaza  completely understand what's going on in Gaza is an atrocity it is genocide there's no other way to put it and the fact that the United States is supporting Israel in this madness is outrageous and I don't blame anyone for choosing that to be their single issue voter deal deal breaker I get it but here is where I kind of come into complication when Donald Trump was president now I want you guys to think about this when Trump was president he moved our embassy to Jerusalem to do nothing more than antagonize the people of Palestine right to prove a symbolic point that Jerusalem belongs to Israel if you listen to the rhetoric of the Republican Party present time and I believe it is a reflection of how Donald Trump thinks all you hear the Republican Party say is support Israel without question we must throw all the support give them all the military aid financial aid at our disposal so that they can defeat the enemy in Gaza there is no one that I've heard thus far in the Republican Party that has tried to be a voice of reason as it relates to Israel and Gaza that to me lets me know Donald Trump would not just support Israel in their actions but in bolding them at least the Democrat Party if we just look at it from a bare minimum standpoint at least in the Democrat Party there are voices powerful voices that are calling out US support of Israel and the need to withdraw when Joe Biden spoke at Morehouse just a few days ago he said himself that he is working on a ceasefire granted a little too late an action should have been taken far sooner but I can at the bare minimum if I'm just grasping for things here respect that at the bare minimum this administration can recognise the wrong that is being committed I'm not saying that they moved as quick as they needed to but at least they recognise I don't believe that what happened with Donald Trump Donald Trump is the definition of I'm gonna dig my heels into the sand and I'm gonna dare you to move me he loves opposition and the amount of opposition to Israel that is growing in the United States would only push Donald Trump to support them more I guarantee it something else to think about and this is more on a domestic front overnight the Supreme Court turned women into second class citizens it happened because we had Donald Trump in office for four years and he had the opportunity to put not one not two but three conservatives on a Supreme Court that fulfilled the Republican Party's wet dream of overturning Roe v Wade really think about that do you really wanna give that man an opportunity to add another and another and another you never know what could happen tomorrow to any of these Supreme Court justices do you really wanna give a man like Donald Trump that opportunity do you really wanna give the Republicans as a whole an opportunity to push policies such as Project 2025 that would literally roll back the years that people like Martin Luther King Malcolm X and so many others fought for us to have greater freedoms project 2025 would roll that back overnight do you really wanna give the Republican Party that type of control and power and opportunity really think about this young voters Joe Biden tried to cancel student loan debt a lot of you guys when it didn't fall through blamed him when you should have been blaming the Supreme Court why because it is a super majority of conservatives on the Supreme Court who ruled that Joe Biden trying to overturn our cancel student debt was unconstitutional you put Donald Trump back in office kiss it all goodbye at least Joe Biden now is making incremental cancellations of student debt Donald Trump would do none of the aboves so my point here is yes what's going on in Gaza is terrible and US support for Israel is out of line and I don't stand behind it at all however I'll take that reluctantly because I fully understand the latter would make that vary issue 10 times worse and also ding us here in the United States over the head this is a man Donald Trump who said that on his first day of office he'd be a dictator that's not something the leader of the free world should be joking about a man who just recently released a campaign ad that had the words that we have not seen since the days of World War Two in Germany let that sink in let that really sink in at the type of person we're dealing with here and sure you guys can vote for a third party candidate but let's keep it a buck let's keep it a hundred here R F k has no viable path to the White House and sitting out out of an election what are you doing like what are you actually doing protesting protesting how by not voting you're not hurting anybody but yourself these president's former presidents are gonna go off and make millions you not voting ain't hurting nobody but yourself and that's the how fun thing on that"

    "voice_to_text": "Boom lawyered STITCH INCOMING Boom lawyered STITCH INCOMING let's explain a little something about how the ICC works now the ICC is created out of a international statue called the Rome Statue which was codified in 1998 the ICC's only been around since 2002 I think and what's important about it is that countries that are party to the Rome Statue have to comply with the ICC Israel and the United States are not party to the Rome Statue and therefore why does this even matter because countries that are a party to the Rome statute have to comply with their own statue which includes honouring arrest warrants so BiBi\u2019s freedom of movement just went from to in about five minutes it's also not great being labelled a war criminal"

    "voice_to_text": "The second family is Rias family. Rias comes from a family of 15, but. Okay, I promise you, this literally only gonna take a minute of your time. So this video and account I've just stitched, is that from Tanzania? So Tanzanian reached out to me asking if I could share her page, um, and share the fundraising link for her family. You can watch the video that I've just stitched for more information on this. But this is about RAF's family. They're trying to evacuate 15 of the family members, but 5. Only 5 of the immediate family members at the moment. A lot of rehab family members are sick, and they need support and medical support, and they need to evacuate safety from Gaza. So if you can share, donate, anything with that page, even just go follow Tamzim and start reposting her videos. Literally anything helps. Truly, no family should have to be going through what these families are going through right now. And remember, it's gone to the point that we can't look the other way just because we're privileged enough to do so. So please, just repost, share, like, comment. Anything you can do helps."

I'm telling you that she is still supporting it, and she is still on this European stage, happy, waving her flag, while this flag symbolizes a country that commit Genesis. Now, a lot of people say that she is 20 years old, she doesn't know what she's doing. I am 20 years old. I know exactly what happens in Gaza. I wouldn't support this country in any way, shape or form. Meanwhile, she is going on state, waving her flag with a smile. Not only that, but Israel had a petition against them signed by a bunch of former EOC members and contestants to not compete because Russia didn't compete either. And what did the EOC say? We are not a political, political competition. We do not do politics. And what is Israel's response to that? They write a political propaganda song about October 7th, calling it October Rain, with the EBU telling them several times to not only change the title, but also a bunch of lyrics. So what is. What is the argument about that? I bet that now you will argue, but she didn't write the song, she. She just performed it. She just performed it, which in it alone is Already pretty bad, but let's, let's, let's, let's ignore that she probably didn't write the song and just performed it. But let's, let's look at her harassing other contestants with her team. For example, photographing Bambi Thuk after they explicitly told Israel to not photograph them in any shape or form. Or photographing and posting the door of Greek contestant marinazari into their Instagram story with a marking tag. And let's not ignore the whole just Klein situation where after yours, Klein wasn't allowed to perform, an Israeli team member was harassing him for not performing. Mocking him or her mocking the audience for booing at her. Like the the Israeli contestant mocking the audience for booing and. And making fun of the whole situation. let's talk about her not being allowed to talk to other competitors because the Israeli government was fearing that if she talks to too many of the contestants, she might change her mind about her whole political stand, which in it alone is a. Is, is, is a hard statement. Or let's not talk about the whole thing with Israeli supporters using several credit cards to vote hundreds of times in different, in different countries in support for Israel. So I don't, I, I am not for booing any Jewish artist off stage, but if this Jewish artist is waving an Israeli flag, makes fun of other contestants, makes fun of the audience, makes fun of the people, and it's just such an asshole. To be around. I think. I think we're allowed to boo at her at any age."

If Democrats actually cared about defeating Donald Trump, they would force him to get a ceasefire by using the full powers of the presidency (like HW, Carter and Reagan did) and then force him to step down as the candidate to have a contested convention so they can nominate a pro-ceasefire/progressive candidate to unite the base. But Liberals and Democrats continue to support and prop up Biden as he still allows a literal g*nocide continue to unalive Palestinains every single day. Its 2016 all over again, except even worse.

    "voice_to_text": "if we want to influence celebrities to speak out on Gaza her video makes it make so much sense so if you're anything like me you don't really know what's going on over there I really had no idea all that was going on in Gaza until the whole block party started and everybody started blocking celebrities and then the Hayley Bailey thing happens that's what really sparked my interest in what the fuck is going on and why is everybody so mad I don't watch the news I don't watch any kind of like world news I watch TikTok and that's it because I don't in my mind I can't do anything about it so I'm not gonna fuck with it okay well that's kind of like we can't do that no and I am in no way an influencer but I do have 12,000 followers which is more than like most of the surrounding towns have in population so in my mind I'm like oh shit maybe I should say something about this because in my mind I'm thinking I'm nobody um it does not matter what I have to say about it but at this point I'm seeing all these people bashing celebrities and people that have a platform for not speaking about it and I'm like okay I have a platform it may only be 12,000 people you know but I still have a fucking platform that I worked really hard for by the now being a mother what this lady said makes so much sense because I have really tried to re parent myself so that I can parent my children the correct way which is helping them learn how to be normal human and in that process I have Learned that beating kids um taking stuff away you know all the negative reinforcement that all the corporal punishment that we were raised it doesn't work I mean some of it might but not really it doesn't really teach them how to be grown UPS how to manage the stress how to not make those mistakes and what she says is you reward good behaviour which is I am all about when you are doing nothing but pointing out everything that's wrong or everything that the celebrity or person or kid or whatever is doing wrong that's not going to make them want to do right that just makes them feel less than and make someone crawl in a hole and not do what you want them to do so I did a quick Google search of celebrities who have supported Gaza or who have donated or spoke out something to that effect because I think it's better to shine a light on the people that are doing something instead of just forcing people to speak about it or block them that's kinda like a double edged sword like they'll speak on it yeah just like Haley did her little apology thing but did she mean it do they mean it do they really want to help or are they just doing it because you're forcing them to you're forcing their hands so like to me that's not if somebody was like let me give you $20 I know you you look like you need $20 I wanna help you let me give you $20 okay I would feel one way if somebody was like here's this $20 the world's forcing me to give it to you here's the $20 I get it it's still gonna be helpful and I get it but it's like you're doing it out of spite practical I understand how scary it is to get on the internet and voice your opinion when there are other people that could possibly not agree with your opinion believe me I fucking I have an entire the Kelsey show it has over 8 800 posts I have posted and most of them are about my event and at first it was very scary to start posting about them so when people were getting mad at celebrities I'm like I feel not how they feel but I understand why they're not talking about it but at the same time I'm like maybe you should grow a backbone and not worry about the bag so much and maybe spread the word because at this point I I've done the research now it's not fucking good and people do need the word does need to be spread and these celebrities have ungodly amounts of money to help the people it should not be on us the normal people of the world who have barely enough to get by to try to support these families when these celebrities are out there just living their fucking best life on their yachts and fucking private planes and giving a dollar or two or making a simple fucking post I get that that that's good I'm glad people are doing that but fucking syndrome so I made an entire list of all the celebrities that I found online that actually have started donating and have been outspoken about it and they are supporting and calling for ceasefire wearing the so since this video is already 4 minutes and 30 seconds of to me just fucking bitching and ranting I love it I'm gonna go ahead and start a whole series of celebrities who have donated to goth or spoken about because I think people just want the celebrities and the influencers to do their influencing job and spread the word and I get that so I'm gonna start a whole series of celebrities who do support Gaza and do make the the noise and do all the thing maybe that will get more track and maybe that will get the people who aren't you know saying something to do something"

    "voice_to_text": "as we're going into an election cycle it's really important for us to understand how these things are sustained from one presidency into another presidency from one decade into another decade one generation into another generation and why voting in the presidential elections is simply not enough to ensure that the continued and ongoing support for Israel stops this is bigger than a single president while yes the president may be the most powerful person on the planet um they are inheriting a system that was created generations before they got there and understanding how those systems operate is critical to truly and effectively dismantling them so that we can never repeat this I'm using example here um and I really hope that it is not experienced or perceived as dismissive or flippant because I'm pulling from children's literature so think about the Harry Potter series also I feel like we should add JK Rowling to the block list um I might just do it for shits and giggles okay so the Harry Potter series right when Voldemort rises to power it was because of this already present historical sentiment and fear of the muggle world by the wizarding world right and it was a legitimate invalid fear right like I don't wanna dismiss the wizarding fear of the Muggles they were persecuted um and that LED the wizarding world to become extremely isolated and very insular which made it possible for these really extreme and damaging ideologies to faster and grow um strong enough and pervasive enough and insidious enough that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and had an entire plan of genocide against Muggles um and then Harry Potter does his whole heroes journey thing Hermione Granger is the real hero all along all the things happen right seven books later we get a glimpse into what the future is like and it hasn't actually changed there's this podcast I listen to I really recommend it um called witch please it's too um literature professors at a university in Canada and they go through the entire series like every single chapter and provide this really great analysis using all of this like super smart people stuff and literature theory and like things that like I don't necessarily like understand at that level um and one of the things that they talk about is that the underlying ideologies that created these systems like the Ministry of magic and the RS and the pedagogical approach in the Hogwarts system which is just horrifically abusive um and the prison system of Azkaban and like just like like what the fuck who where is the adult in charge of the wizarding world kind of thing you know what I mean that I think a lot of us like muggles at this moment in time can really relate to the ideologies that LED to the creation of those did not end when Harry defeated Voldemort and they continued as Harry and Hermione and Ron and Ginny and Luna and Neville became adults and then inherited those systems what they chose to do with those systems moving forward we don't really know you know like that's the world of fanfic um but the last glimpse that we got of them they were the same systems and that's the cycle that we are going to find ourselves caught in if we don't look at those underlying ideologies and the ways in which they have been institutionalized and legitimized through our legislation through our education system through our law enforcement system and our criminal justice system through our media and our literature and our religions and our neighborhoods and communities and businesses right like they are embedded in all of these things and so in order to really stand a chance at never again actually being never again one of the things we are going to have to really really grapple with is the how and why of every single decision that we make as Americans because from the moment of our inception as a country blood was on our hands this country is built on the genocide and destruction of Turtle Island it is built on the enslavement of African peoples and we continue to reap the benefits of those horrific crimes against entire civilizations until we grapple with those very foundations on which this country has been founded we will continue to fund and support and legitimize things like the Zionist project",

Kicking them out of school and housing right before graduation. Literally all these college presidents and nonprofit CEOs and education leaders\u2014All they care about is their donations. Money. And proximity to power. Because they aren\u2019t speaking up and when they do speak up, it is to call the law down viciously on teenagers and young adults exercising their free speech in the face of some of the worst ethnic cleansing of their lives. But watch how these young adults move. They refuse to be silenced when we are talking about genocide. Babies blown apart day after day by a ruthless, brutal army. Hillary Clinton and all the war mongers invested in weapons companies will try to tell us what we see with our own eyes is propaganda, but they are on the wrong side of history and we will never ever let them forget it or live it down. These students? These students are on the right side of history and I am so damn proud of them and I stand with them. #students #college #career #VCU #harvard #columbia #CUNY #protest #gaza #freepalestine #palestine #war #uwmadison #uwmilwaukee #calpolyhumboldt #UCLA #ASU #Emory #Penn #Tulane #FSU #ohiostate #USC #NYU #CCNY ",

Um, and I don't necessarily feel like she doesn't deserve hate, um, but I am not trying to be that kind of person anymore. Right. So in the off chance you ever see this video, Haley, you have no excuse not to be informed, not to be educated. You made a video on a platform that has been informing people about this since it started. You very, very likely make well above the medium, medium income. You have access to education, you have access to inform yourself with various tools. You're just choosing not to, and that speaks volumes."

People in Lebanon,   that   amazing   People   in   Lebanon people in Palestine, people in Congo,   in   Palestine   people   in   Congo everywhere where they're suffering in the world,   where   they're   suffering   in   the   world they're not gonna have food on their tables if you block Beyonce.   not   gonna   have   food   on   their   tables   if   you   block   Beyonce I really need you guys to go outside and speak with real life people.   really   need   you   guys   to   go   outside   and   speak   with   real   life   people And what pisses me off the most is   what   pisses   me   off   the   most   is when these celebrities do eventually speak up   these   celebrities   do   eventually   speak   up because of these blockings,   of   these   blockings people are bashing them. Like Lizzo spoke up and you guys are like,   are   bashing   them   Like   Lizzo   spoke   up   and   you   guys   are   like well, it's very interesting   it's   very   interesting the timing. Uh,   timing   Uh well, you're a little late   you're   a   little   late and you don't wanna even listen to what she's saying.   you   don't   wanna   even   listen   to   what   she's   saying Like if the point is not to make these celebrities speak up,   if   the   point   is   not   to   make   these   celebrities   speak   up then what really is the point?   what   really   is   the   point It seems to me that it's just   seems   to   me   that   it's   just for people to make themselves feel more or less superior than others.   people   to   make   themselves   feel   more   or   less   superior   than   others To be honest, it's also useless.   be   honest   it's   also   useless These politicians that are Enabling these genocides to happen   politicians   that   are   Enabling   these   genocides   to   happen are probably rejoicing right now   probably   rejoicing   right   now because the attention is diverted to blocking the rock.   the   attention   is   diverted   to   blocking   the   rock I just can't get on board with this.   just   can't   get   on   board   with   this I just need the internet   just   need   the   internet to shift their focus on something that actually matters   shift   their   focus   on   something   that   actually   matters and change that actually changes something.   change   that   actually   changes   something",

    "voice_to_text": "hello I'm one of the poors you pissed off let me explain to you the reason why people are so fucking pissed off with you because after watching your apology I don't really think you understand why you went to the Met Gala a place that has been known for its historical extravagance and is extremely exclusive guest list consisting of only celebrities or anyone in the 1% with tickets that cost up to $75,000 while dressed as the representation of French aristocracy itself during the French Revolution Marie Antoinettes while lip syncing the infamous line let them eat cake from Sophia Coppala's Marie Antoinette film but for me as an American student who has been learning European history ever since I was in middle school let them eat cake is supposed to be a representation of the ignorance of the aristocracy while the masses were starving the French aristocracy decided to ignore their plight their calls and pleas for help and instead decided to surround themselves in the gilded halls of luxury do you understand how ignorant you sound when you reference that fucking quote at the Met Gala when there is a genocide going on when there are a lot of people who would benefit from getting the coverage that you have with your 10 million followers I'm sorry 9.9 million followers in your apology you stated that you are a normal girl just like anyone else I don't know what to tell you but just because you didn't get a personal invitation to the Met Gala from Anna Winter herself does not mean that you are one of us sure you're human but you're human who's able to affording $17,000 in rent and yes you probably worked really hard for the position you're in but the fact of the matter is that you are a 30 year old woman you're an adult same as I I know to not say something so fucking stupid and tone deaf when I'm in a clear position of privilege when people are struggling just to fucking eat when you mention in your video that you weren't very educated on the topic of Palestine even though you don't outright say Palestine because you're treating it like it's Voldemort I can at least level with you and say that I understand where you're coming from to an extent now I wasn't completely educated on the topics of Palestine and the complicated relationship between Israel and Palestine but I got fucking educated and I myself have been really quiet about Palestine up until recently so you can call me a hypocrite for this and part of that is because I'm thousands of dollars in debt and I'm far too broke to contribute to the cause and I fucking hate myself for that and all I can do is talk about what is going on in Palestine so I decided to let the more well spoken people with a larger following take over the discussion which I see is the coward's way out now I can admit that but what about you you Haley are at the nexus of a discussion about the complete worthlessness of celebrities people are pissed because even though you are a d list celebrity cause let's face it that's what you are because you were sitting on a pedestal of privilege that allows for you to have the capital and following to actually make a difference that being putting your money to use by helping people evacuate from Gaza these people these families who are being torn out of the tapestry of history by the oppressor and yet when these people are reaching out to you asking for help you just go back to your slice of cake and call it a day that's why people are fucking pissed at you Haley"

    "voice_to_text": "stop blaming famous people for your problems everyone's talking about oh the Met Gala yeah this is actually so crazy to see cause there I feel like there's a period of time where I was on TikTok and I used to like I don't know if I was following Desmond but I would actually see the videos a lot and I felt like I would watch them almost religiously and I don't know Desmond's pronouns I'm probably just gonna say Desmond the whole time I'm sorry but just to see this kind of take from Desmond after like I know I was a fan probably when I was in that high school I'm about to finish college now it's like crazy so basically in that video Desmond just says like oh like if you're hating on celebrities for being at the Met Gala um and when there's a genocide going on in Palestine you're a hater and you're deflecting from a problem and that the Met Gala in total probably raises about $350 million or I don't know if he said like 35 I don't know one of those numbers just a high number and he said that if every person in America gave 10 cents it would have the same effect so if we all did that instead of hating on celebrities and it would fix the problem that calling out celebrities for not saying anything about Palestine is hating and that we're deflecting and it just means that we don't wanna act on our own now before y'all even yeah just know that I do donate e sims for Gaza so yeah never too much on me but I mean I don't know why Desmond is acting like it's like they're acting so obtuse obviously people are saying that people with more money should be doing more about Palestine um I'm sure that you know about like equity but if I have like no or almost no um like spending money spare money like all of my money goes towards taking care of myself I'm not saying like this is the case for me obviously but people that have less means obviously will give less or just speak out about things when they can and people who have more should give more listener to understand also I'm pretty sure people's criticisms are that like or at least what I saw on Twitter um was like the media coverage of the Met Gala when Rafa which is like designated as a safe zone was being bombed heavily at the same time that the met was the Met Gala was going on because they knew people would be like tuned in or at least Americans be tuned in and same thing happened during the Super Bowl so people are upset because a safe zone in Palestine is being bombed heavily as the Met Gala is happening and the media coverage was just covering the Met Gala and not the genocide that's going on in Gaza I don't see how calling that out is deflecting from the behavior in fact people can do both people can donate and so call out that behavior then doesn't goes on to say that blocking celebrities does nothing or like influences and it literally does like that's their livelihood if 50 million people decided to block Zendaya I'm not saying that I'm blocking Zendaya or whatever I'm just saying if 50 million people decided to block Zendaya her engagement would go down like she's now worth less because like that's part of her job posting on Instagram and you know being liked is part of her job if she's not liked and people suddenly decide to like hate her then you know she's an she's an actress um movies are gonna say we don't watch Zendaya because then people are not gonna watch her film because people hate Zendaya because of this and that's what get celebrities that have the means to do something to speak out and to do something I'm not sure why this is such a hard concept um I'm pretty sure it's not I think that people just don't want to admit that their silence their lack of help and their lack of empathy quite frankly is like something that needs to be reassessed handled even",

If you feel like that, there is nothing you could possibly do other than to just spread the word of the traversies. The genocide of the people of Gaza. This is what you can do. Punish the people who can do something about it. These people get money and revenue from our viewership. Our attention is their currency. When we block them, they have to now be forced to pay attention of the suffering of others when they chose to ignore it. Don't pay attention to the shitty things that they will come up with to bring you back and make you unblock them. Block these influencers. Block these celebrities that refuse to speak about the people of Gaza. Do it now.",

    "voice_to_text": "as a traditional egalitarian American Jew it is always really reassuring to see moments and takes like this from other Jews because it can be so isolating in this world to have ambiguous or not perfect love and adoration of the state of Israel and what really changed for me and how I got here was the fact that in 2011 after college I did economic development with Bedouins in southern Israel I was about 10 minutes outside of beersheva I was within the 67 border and I just saw first hand how dehumanizing the occu Pa tion is and how horrific it has been for people even those that are considered Israeli citizens um and so in this Bedouin town called Lachia uh I was there and everybody had water tanks that I thought was kind of weird until I realized sometimes the water just goes out sometimes you're mid shower and you're just shit out of luck and this is the desert like water you can't just like run to a spring right there's just not a river to go to I Learned that a lot of what the organisation as part of was doing was literacy because for decades like literally after the founding of Israel there were no schools close by for Bedouins and traditionally Bedouins the men would go and roam with the herds and the woman would stay near the house and do a lot of the farming and so men would go to school because that felt kind of akin to what they did previously but it was a lot harder they didn't feel comfortable sending their women and so there's like whole generations of women that are illiterate and they're having to do a lot of catch up because the state wasn't bringing schooling close and affordably to them there's also a lot of ancestral claims of land in the desert by Bedouins and because those claims aren't recognised when people build houses they're considered like unrecognised and the state will come and demolish them they won't provide any services and they will come and raze their homes to the ground um this was happening all over the south while I was there um and it's really traumatizing to watch that oh and on top of that like I would travel around Israel like I had weekends off I had holidays the number of like terrible things that people felt comfortable saying to me was astonishing they were like why are you working with better ones when you can work with Jews they would you know talk about just how more like animalistic Arabs are um it was baffling to me and incredibly insulting because these people had like taken me into their homes they had welcomed me they had been very very kind to me and like it was just so wild to be watching Jewish Israelis like spout this nonsense that like people used to say about us all over like the irony was not lost on me and the thing is that most American Jews do not get ever get an experience like I did they might go a little bit into like parts of Jerusalem but they're not spending time really in depth of Palestinians they're not having conversations they're not building relationships and that's on purpose that's that's on purpose um so they're only seeing one side of it they're only getting one narrative and it has been so built up that this state is so key for our safety that it's the sort of us versus them thing that like if they have a chance they're going to wipe us from the face of the earth like all of this has been so built up that I think even now even now when you see some of the most horrific things happening in Gaza like people are still you know doing what about October 7th what about the hostages what about this like two wrongs don't make a right and it's deeply deeply hurts me as somebody that like believes that my Judaism is about showing up well in this world like my practice is about both connecting to the divine but also like connecting to the earth connecting to people and like what we leave behind matters and like this state all of those things is is now my Judaism and for community that often relishes discussion relishes debate and has such a welcoming kind of large tent perspective the radical hard lines that I'm seeing within Jewish spaces around this topic like it's not often safe to even have just to be able to say like I have an ambivalent relationship to Israel like I don't see it as my homeland or I like even just having some critical discussions of what the state is doing is considered radical and like that's not it shouldn't be like this and my hope is that we're finally getting to this moment where we can really start reclaiming that like Judaism does not equal Zionism they're two different ideologies there's lots of people that have an overlap but that doesn't mean if you criticize Zionism you criticize Judaism one is not the other these are apples and oranges for God's sake and for 2,000 years we have been living all over the world and as an American Jew and as a Jew of the diaspora that's the Judaism that I have really fallen in love with is this idea of what does it mean to have a relationship with god my people my faith no matter where I am um and one of my favorite prayers is the kedusha which is about how God's holiness is everywhere and bless the place of god and I think about that a lot which is we do have a lot of liturgy around Jerusalem around Zion but what I really think about is how do we bring the divine in here and now and what does that look like and it does not look like what the Israeli state is doing in Rafa it does not look like what's happening in Gaza",

This month or the earliest of the following month, which is June, I'm gonna be donating $100 here and there. I'm hoping I can give to multiple families but I'm only one person. the whole flying to the UK thing doesn't really matter, I don't care I don't really watch for him going to different countries; especially UK. At the start of the video it was at about [$2,000*], they are about $75,000 away from their goal. I hope this helps push it further into the algorithm, however it seems like my account might be shadow banned, because I can only reach about 200 people and then it's gone. But if you can, I hear that copying the link a bunch of times and commenting five words will help the algorithm push this a little bit further. Do what you can to help these people and to [FIND*] people who can fund it at this moment, because it is very important that we help these people escape what we are funding. Remember, our taxes are going to the horrific things that are happening to them, not trying to guilt anybody, but it's just important that we do what we can and give what we can to the the right things. Because we're forced to pay taxes that are ending up doing these horrific things, but we can make the choice to spend here and there on the the right thing to help these innocent people. \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49all eyes on Rafa\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49 \ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49free Palestine\ud83c\udf49\ud83c\udf49",

    "voice_to_text": "Today's blocks of the day are one. Rihanna, you've been a little quiet from your mansion. I've seen several TikToks like this today about blocking celebrities, and I love it. I think it's brilliant, because these celebrities and their just brazen commitment to staying tone deaf, like we saw at the Met Gala in the midst of the times that were in, is getting ridiculous. But I keep seeing videos like this where they're like, let's just go for that top, top celebrities like Rihanna, Drake, Taylor Swift, Beyonce. And I think that's the wrong strategy because these are A list celebrities that a lot of people are very deeply attached to. And getting enough people to be on board to block somebody, say like Taylor Swift, is gonna fall flat on his face. But if we can start with one lower level celebrity, say that maybe not everybody knows about or is as attached to, but they have enough clout to where getting enough people to block them would send a message, I think that's gonna be a lot more effective. Because a highly concentrated move like that, as a collective, would start to create pressure on the celebrities at the top, like, they could be next. I mean, if we can't create enough meaningful pressure on a lower level celebrity as a group, how are we gonna do it on a higher level one? Because, y'all, in order for a movement like this to have any potential of having the Impact needed to spark change. We have to be organized, and we have to be smart about it. That means making it simple. We need to make this as simple as possible so that more people will be willing to participate. And in my personal opinion, I think that that celebrity should be the celebrity that probably started this whole idea in the first place. And that's Haley Bailey with her let them eat cake video. That video captured the entire embodiment of the scale of just how out of touch these elites really are, and that's why it makes sense that's got to be her and my ideas for the next seven days until next Thursday on May 16th, nobody blocks anybody but Haley Bailey. If we're gonna do this and have results, our targeting efforts have to be laser focused. And she's sitting at about 10 million followers right now. we're gonna need hundreds and hundreds of thousands who are willing to block Haley Bailey daily. We just put all of our focus and all of our concentration on Haley Bailey alone for the next seven days. And if we can achieve that, then maybe as a group, we would start to get more of a momentum to go after celebrities more like Drake or fiance or Taylor Swift. So starting now, let's all work to get as many people to block Haley daily.",

What I find so funny about this is the fact that she paid 75 K to go to this event. 75K, not including the cost of her dress, the cost of hotel, the cost of traveling to New York. I think this is how that. I really don't care. Not including those expenses, that is $75,000. That is the amount of money that people pay for a car, down payment on an apartment. That is life changing money. That money could set someone up for comfortable, comfortably for a long time. I work a 40 hour work week. Most of the time I work at 2 to 10, 62, 73, whatever. Those shifts normal to me. I'm used to them. I'm probably never gonna own a house. That's just. That's just being realistic. I will never own my own house. This isn't the main issue. The main issue was her saying, let them eat cake while children in Gaza and Rafa are starving to death while their families hide from bombs. While children are being trapped in cars or under rubble, while their parents carry what is left of them in plastic garbage bags that you carry your groceries in. It's surreal. We can't even protest against our government as to what's going on. Students of colleges are protesting on the campuses that they pay Money to go to. And they are getting shot with rubber bullets. They are getting maced, they are getting tear gas. They are getting attacked by Israel supporters who are dragging them to the floor and beating them so badly they need to be hospitalized simply for enacting their First Amendment right. If you are still thinking that both sides to the story are wrong, they're not. Because when you have one side that is being protected by the police and you have one side that is actively being attacked by the police, you know which side you need to be on. All eyes on Rafa. All eyes on Gaza, all eyes on Palestine. We need to keep talking about this because the more that we talk about it, the more attention it gets, and it needs all the attention it can get right now. Stop allowing the government to distract you. That is what they are trying to do. Stay the course. Keep on it.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I am 29 years old and when I was in high school I went through this program all four years of high school called youth and government and I wanna talk a little bit about that and um I will just say the only reason I'm not crying right now after watching that video that I'm stitching is because I took like an hour break to get some coffee and some food but um anyway so talking about youth and government it was absolutely wild to me and I'm gonna make some parallels to what I'm seeing with the students at like these Ivy League schools and what was going on at that time so this uh program was funded and created by a um I'm not gonna name the organization but it's a big organization um I later ended up working for this organization for a little while and it was not great but anyway so you think government was really catered towards students of these better high schools in North Carolina um and honestly I don't really know if they do these programs in other states but it was kind of expensive to go and the only reason I was able to go is because um we had kind of like a fundraiser that's the word um but we also like had assistance in decreasing our price because we were doing it through this like camp that's local to us and blah blah blah but a lot of the kids almost all of the kids there you know when we would talk about politics cause obviously we would talk about politics um amongst ourselves because we were all interested in government youth and government my friend and I were like the only people who were considering ourselves Democrats not the only but we were a very small amount and when we did find other people who were more on the left leaning side which I am no longer a Democrat I do not consider myself a Democrat I was a registered Democrat when I was 16 and got my driver's license but of course I've since changed my mind and I am as far left as I feel like I can get a lot of these kids that were gearing up to go to these Ivy League schools cause these were the kids of parents who had the money and they were going places because they could afford to and that was kind of like in their breeding they were all Republican because they heard their parents talking and they were doing what their parents were doing so I just wanna say that the shift that has happened from when I was a teenager from 2,009 to 2,013 when I was in high school to now these kids in these big colleges with wealthy parents seeing what's going on and standing up about it is a big deal especially if it's happening in North Carolina because let me tell you that was not the commonality I am so proud of these kids and it breaks my heart that that girl has to stand up there and talk about her family dying to get people to listen to her to get people to listen to what's happening because this is absolutely heartbreaking it should not be happening these children should not be having to bear the brunt of what's going on but they are they're brave and they're bold and they're getting is done and I am so proud of them and I feel like we should all be trying to do our part to to do better because this is not right the the absolute pompous display of wealth is not right and the fact that the celebrities and these people of wealth and these billionaires like Taylor Swift are a part of what's the big talk right now and not what's going on when we're watching our neighbors being murdered our brothers and sisters get it together"

I'm a black Muslim myself I know I don't look like it but I'm Muslim but I'm more worried of the fact that like through this  little Met Gala,  IS NOT REAL ARE bombing RAFAH as we speak and let's be honest I came across your video as the only video about Palestinians being racist to Afro Palestinians that's how you know it's not the main focus they are being k!l!ed!!!!!  and that right there should be our main focus by the way I like your makeup but back to the point that should be our main focus and just to add one more thing one more thing I don't think all Palestinians are racist.",

Look at what's going on in Rafa. 1.5 million Palestinians sought refuge there. They all funneled in there, half of those children. Today they had leaflets dropped on them by the IDR with QR codes on them, telling them they had the day to evacuate or they would be considered enemies and unalived. Meanwhile, they're just trying to distract us with these weird fancy dresses at the Met Gala and Drake and Kendrick. Kendrick Lamar. Meanwhile, there's 1.5 million people that could be unalived. There's a genocide going on and our country is just looking the other way. I might not have a large platform, but if all I could do is a single mom is talk about this, I would regret not talking about it one day. All eyes on Rafa. This is the most disgusting thing to see, and I feel so fucking helpless. Shame on everyone who attended the Met Gala. It's disgusting. So disgusting. 650,000 of those people are children. Let that sink in."

Um, so we already know that the American taxpayers money is going um, funding the ammunition bombs in Gaza. Um, and of all the things that I have kept Palestinians in my heart, of all of the pain they're experiencing, a specific type of pain that I never considered. Because honestly, it's just, it's still kind of unfathomable to me that such a scenario even exist in real life. It's extremely dystopian. Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine.

You know in countries that Westerners look at as Muslim there are Christians there too and  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 just means \"God is great\" or \"Praised is God\" or \"Blessed is God\"  (depending on context/ dialect/ scripture or even Aramaic phrases included in Arabic dialects) It depends on whether someone is saying that to praise God in the context of Islam or to praise God in the context of Christianity you will never know unless you know that person specifically and it is racist to assume someone who looks Arab saying \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 is automatically a Muslim that could be arguably an anti-Semitic view considering Arabs are Abrahamic descendants of Ishmael now for Christians across the United States I want you to know we in the messianic community stand with you besides rallying for jury nullification in jury trials and appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court if they try to bring people up on charges for it; while citing the First Amendment believing in the New Testament and believing Yeshua Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected from the dead is a branch of Judaism I would go all the way up to the international levels to advocate for any person who claims they are a Jewish convert even Palestinians who have trouble immigrating to Israel over any suspected Christian prejudice this branch of Judaism is speaking of is Messianic Judaism hello I'm a Messianic Jew I consider myself the same as a gospel believing Christian because I believe in the unmerited Grace that Yeshua Jesus gave us in accordance with Ephesians 2:8 in fact Christian and Messianic both have the same meaning and word root Christian means to Christen as with oil Messianic comes from the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 which means to annoint as with oil this word is one in the same our history as messianic Jews was firmly established almost 2,000 years ago in foundation during the time that the authors of the New Testament were alive fifty one days after our Messiah died on the day of the Passover sacrifice (John 19:14) people from every nation under the heaven were present in Jerusalem (Acts 2, 51 days after Yeshia died) to receive the Spirit of God that is the spirit of the Messiah who came and died for our sins on the day of Pentecost which is the Jewish festival of Shavuot by which converts and physical Jews became a part of the messianic faith and this receiving on the Spirit accordance with Acts 2:5 and Acts 2:11 I'm a messianic Jew who does not support the integration of heavy rabbinics into the doctrine of faith and encourage those who call themselves messianics or Christians to read the book of Galatians and also Matthew 23 and Jeremiah 23 to see what I'm talking about At a leadership level we are responsible to examine those doctrines and see if they are relevant to scripture but if they are not relevant with scripture and confuses the context of scripture in accordance with the Jewish Tenach (Torah, Prophets, Writings) and Jeremiah 8:8 and Jeremiah chapter 23 they are not from God and we do not count them now regardless of race or one status with conversion in an Orthodox synagogue or how they define a Jew race and ethnic status does not matter to us although we do not replace the nation of Israel I will make that clear this is not replacement theology and we do NOT embrace that we do not embrace that as someone who literally lives at the furthest reaches from Jerusalem in the world, literally the ends of the earth I believe even if someone lives so far away from Jerusalem or ethnically different than a Jew or Middle Easterner if they accept Yeshua as the Messiah they too are taking it to our faith and are given the same spiritual blessing of being delivered out from sin and from the confinements of sin of this earth the same way that Jews were taken out from the confinements in the land of Egypt we are Messianic we as messianic Jews keep the appointed times of Leviticus 23 practice physical circumcision and the dietary laws however we know that even as Moses received The 10 commandments on Mount Sinai it is also said in the same instance in Hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 -He makes unmerited Grace- Exodus chapter 20:6 \"He makes unmerited Grace to those who love him and keep his commandments\" Deuteronomy 6:4 - 8 tells us to love God with everything that we are John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God our commandment is to love and keep the word of God all 66 books as Messianic Jews Christians are grafted in and we are one in the same (Galatians 3:29) we came into the faith the same way the Christians did (Ethnic Jews who embrace the gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) - such as myself) as sojourners lost and the noble memorial of the price Yeshua (Jesus) paid for our sins delivered us out equally we are all strangers no one is better than the other because of his ethnicity. In the 37 chapter of Ezekiel, one of the infamous prophets of old Ezekiel, was taken out to a valley of dry bones by the hand of God and told to preach to an impossible situation and tell the dry bones that God's Spirit will come into them and they will live Ezekiel 37:4 - 6 so the dry bones became his flesh that is the nation of Israel coming together in 1948 but there was no breath in the bones (Ezekiel 37:8) so Ezekiel prophesied regarding the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) as he was commanded by God to say to the Spirit of god (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) come from the four winds (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) [Holy] Spirit and breathe upon the slain so that they may live (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) in the same chapter (Ezekiel 37) so let us speak the word of God and let us all come and look to the one that was pierced (Zechariah 12:10) for the transgressions of all mankind  that was set before us by the One who created us God knew man would make mistakes and that our greatest defeat is our own sin and it was necessary for Yeshua the Messiah to die we all pierced him as humanity (because our own sin is our greatest defeat) and anyone that believes in Him will not perish (John 3:16) but have everlasting life (John 3:16) John 3:16. We eulogize the price that was paid for our own sin as one eulogizes upon a firstborn upon an only child Zachariah 12:10 (and John 19:34 - 37) we remember our going out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05df \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of confinements of this earth and its wickedness on our own (by our own choice) just as the children of Israel were delivered out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of Egypt all the days of our life as it's written in Deuteronomy 16:3 in Hebrew let us rise up from this valley of dry bones as spoken by the prophets of old in the Spirit of god and in salvation as one every time someone comes to the Lord he rises up in a vastly and joins a powerful army that will not be defeated and more and more people will rise out of this valley of dry bones unto the coming of the Messiah himself.

    "voice_to_text": "And because like.. What if you're just minding your own business and then like.. the members of enhypen just walk in ? Euhhhhh I thought about this..before. I think.. Ummm..I genuinely don't know. I feel like I would be.. Knowing myself I'd probably be like.. Like.. in shock ! Cause I'm not a lucky person dude ! Things like this will never happen to me. And no, that\u2019s not just what I like, I'm just.. (I\u2019m not sure what I said here, but this is what I heard, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense \ud83d\ude2d) I- Let's just say.. I think I'm very unlucky.. to the point where I say I'm cursed. Let's just say that. Okay..so if that were to happen to me\u2026 It will be like God telling me\u2026(aish - meaning: Ah shit) it would be like.. Dude just..ahem, I don\u2019t wanna say it out loud. But..like I would..I really\u2026 Okay, I went through the comments under that..video, that I'm stitching right now. Anddd, it sounds like no one would really approach them, out of respect. Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay.",
