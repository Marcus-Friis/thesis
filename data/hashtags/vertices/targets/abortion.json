    "voice_to_text": "this morning we are back to reality where a Texas Supreme Court has decided that women in Texas cannot bring constitutional challenges to the abortion laws that were passed this whole case started because there was a woman that was 18 weeks pregnant and she had pre term pre labor rupture of membranes and she was becoming very very ill and there was no chance for the fetus to survive but the fetus still had a fetal heart activity and the doctors refused to terminate the pregnancy because they did not wanna be prosecuted criminally and she ended up going into sepsis and she lost her ability to be able to have children in the future there were 19 other women that join this lawsuit as well as three doctors and they also have very um horrific stories about the lack of healthcare in Texas an Austin judge did provide an injunction that said that doctors will not be prosecuted who terminate pregnancies in good faith judgements considering one where there's a risk of infection if the fetus will not survive after childbirth or when the pregnant patient has a condition that requires regular invasive treatment can Paxton then appeal that injunction which is what brought it to the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court ruled that that injunction was not allowed and so now in Texas there are really no protections for women who are pregnant um and this is what we mean by there's no medical exemptions when it comes to abortion there is none they'd rather see us die than terminate a pregnancy Ken Paxton also sued over the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act for state employees in Texas and he was successful in Texas state employees do not have protections under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which provided reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers and now 17 other states have filed suit and they're suing over the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act they do not wanna provide reasonable accommodations to pregnant workers in the workplace this has nothing to do with protecting the life of the unborn this has everything to do with forcing people into pregnancy into birth and into motherhood and it's disgusting this is control of women just another day in the life of a birthing person here in the United States",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

That's why, for the majority of American families, suddenly coming up with thousands of dollars to fly out of state for emergency health care is out of the question. For our client Samantha Casiano, who's earning $15.80 an hour and raising four children in a mobile home, the cost of an out-of-state abortion to terminate a pregnancy with fatal complications was simply out of her reach. Instead, Texas's extreme abortion ban forced Samantha to carry her doomed pregnancy to term and then watch her baby Halo die a painful, traumatizing death. Economic inequality in the US is already at an all-time high. Abortion bans force low-income people to endure unspeakable trauma\u2014unnecessary trauma\u2014at the hands of the state.

And 2022 we found out that we were pregnant. I was excited, um, until. Unfortunately, we found out that my daughter was diagnosed with encephalie, which meant that her skull and her brain was never going to fully develop, which meant that she was incompatible with life. My doctor said my only option I had in Texas was to carry on my doom pregnancy until I was able to give birth. My doctor was only able to give me a prescription for antidepressants and a funeral home paper of where I can bury my daughter. We called clinics in New Mexico and Arizona, but financially, it was out of our reach. So having to get a rental, extra childcare, gas, food, hotel stay, and then missing work, we quickly realized that it was impossible. I had to remain pregnant and carry Halo for the rest of my pregnancy until I went into labor. I carried Halo for several months. Once Halo was born, all we can do was hold her tiny body and watch her change colors to her death. She went from Pink to red to blue to purple. It was cruel and inhumane.

Yesterday there was a large and peaceful Palestine rally in downtown Orlando, and it ended with extreme police violence, excessive use of force, and the arrest of two Palestinian organizers. To use amplified SoundOn public property in the city of Orlando, you need to require a permit. And because this person did not have a permit for the megaphone, the police thought that it was justified to unannounced go into a crowd of peaceful protesters, including families, the elderly, children, and journalists, and start pepper spraying indiscriminately into the crowd and to violently arrest two protesters during this event. They felt that this was justified because of one megaphone and one use of amplified sound at a peaceful rally and protest for the Palestinian people. Now, how does this relate to what we do here in Swan? You may have seen in some of our videos that our protesters on public city of Orlando property use amplified sound, such as cones, to be able to scream towards the clinic and to be able to scream at our patients. We have asked multiple times for Orlando PD to act on this and to stop them from being able to use these cones. We have recently Learned, just last week, that OPD Legal has said that they will not take a stance on this and that they will Not prosecute any of our anti abortion protesters for using amplified SoundOn a public sidewalk in the city of Orlando, likely sending your baby straight to hell. To that we could do for you just a week after learning that OPD will not take any legal cause against our protesters for using amplified sound towards our clinic and to harass our patients right up the road. At Lake Yola in downtown Orlando, protesters were brutalized and violently apprehended by OPD simply over a megaphone at a peaceful protest. There were children in strollers that were pepper sprayed, elderly were pepper sprayed, journalists were pepper sprayed. This was indiscriminately done into a crowd of over 1,000 people without warning or without any sort of announcement that they were going to start pepper spraying individuals if they did not disperse. There was no dispersal warning before this was done. And yet our anti abortion protesters use amplified sound every day. And we have verbal confirmation that OPD legal will do nothing against our anti abortion protesters. Carden, Michael Carden. This is about the head first footage for police department. He called the city attorney and they said for now they're not, we're not doing anything with it. I hope this video serves as a stark reminder that the police's only function is to uphold the interests of the state and that our state in our country is financing and benefiting off of the genocide of the Palestinian people.

Do you agree with the point of view that if we continually restrict the freedom of marriage as a legitimate social option, we do this to people who are of fertile, ripe, fertile age and may have. May have a pregnancy and a baby involved. Are we not, in fact, making abortion a much more desirable alternative when marriage might be the right solution for some freedom loving couple? All disrespect intended, representative. Little girls who get their periods are not ripe and fertile. And suggesting that you marry them off to the predator who got them pregnant is not a way to solve for abortion. That was Representative Jess Edwards out of New Hampshire, whose idea to curb abortion is to force children who become pregnant into marriages. If you're like me, you might have some strong feelings about that. Some. Some. Some feedback. Because according to Jess here, it is better to force a child not only to give birth, but also to be married to the predator who got them pregnant.",

    "voice_to_text": "No one's died because they haven't had access to an abortion. There are no dead women lying in our streets. The world can move on without abortion. People have died in countries where abortion is restricted. Savita Halipanavar, a 31 year old woman living in Ireland whose baby had zero chance of surviving, died in 2,012 because she was denied an abortion due to the country's strict laws at the time. Her death received worldwide attention. That repealed the Eighth Amendment that made abortions illegal unless the pregnancy was life threatening. Then in America, states with limited access to abortion had maternal death rates that were 62% higher than states with unrestricted access. And we're still not seeing any change. But unfortunately, 40 Days of life founder and president Sean Carney didn't stop there, even though most of us wish he did. You know, my body, my choice. You can't really go streaking in most parts of our country and tell the cops, my body, my choice. We have to wear a seatbelt, you know, for crying out loud. I don't know how he went from point A to point purple, but just to summarize what my body, my choice means, since it seems to be a hard concept for some people to grasp, it means you should decide what you want to do with your body. So, yes, if you want to streak, you made the decision that will probably and rightfully land you in jail if you don't. Want to wear a seatbelt, for crying out loud? Then yes, it's your decision to possibly suffer injuries that could have been avoided. But at the end of the day, it was your choice. I hope that clears some things up. No one benefits from abortion except for bad, irresponsible men. Actually, I think the women who are experiencing medical emergencies. Or those who simply do not want children are benefiting from abortions. The only true irresponsible factors in this case are the lawmakers who pass such strict abortion bans. That place hundreds, if not thousands of burden people at risk every day.",

Used to, they could get these medical procedures done and, um, and kind of hide the. The fact of what had happened to them because it really ain't none of nobody else's business. Well, now it is, huh? We did that. See, I know that we don't really know a whole hell of a lot about how government works for really to give two shits about what policies are anything like that. We're on the Trump train because it just pisses off those liberals, and we just love that. That's what it's all about, right? That's what it's all about. But look what we're doing to people. Little teenage girls being forced to carry their rapist child. Hmm? Hmm. But you'd feel different if it was your little girl, wouldn't you? Hmm? Um, also, uh, uh, these same red states are forcing women to carry eptopic pregnancies, uh, you know, once. It's gonna unalive them if they care in the term. Yeah. Uh, the law in those red states says Uh, tough shit. You're gonna carry it anyway, regardless of the consequences. Yeah, we did that. That blood is on our hands, MAGA. And also, uh, if a woman becomes pregnant with a baby that, um, has a certain disorders that, uh, whenever it's, uh, delivered, it's just gonna lay there and it's gonna unalive and excruciatingly painful. Unaliving? It's the best outcome. And by the way, the mother may never be able to bear another child again because of it. We did that, MAGA. All for owning the lives, right? We're doing that just to own the lives. Pretty sick bunch of people, ain't we? Maybe we should start caring about things that matter, MAGA. Maybe we should educate ourselves. This isn't a big giant game of owning the libs. What we're actually doing is destroying our democracy over ignorance and ruining lives all over this country. Inmate Trump, 2024.",

Maybe if black mothers would stop having random children with random men without being married and having a family to keep that child in, there wouldn't be so many black children to adopt. Also, while you're on the internet running your mouth, how many children can you adopt? Probably zero, because you don't qualify. Because you have to have a family. You have to be financially sound. See, this is how the process works. First they reach out to the immediate family, any blood relatives, and try to get somebody to take that child. That didn't work. Then they try to find a child which a family they can connect with. Same race. That didn't work, and they had no choice but to put the child with a white T family who was willing to take the child. So instead of asking why are YT people adopting black people, why don't you ask why there's so many black children up for adoption? Aren't y'all the most educated? Aren't y'all making the most money that any other group of black women have ever made? So why aren't you adopting black babies?",

Especially if you're talking about someone in a rural community. They could essentially, like, reverse engineer, um, identifying information. And so they said, you know what? Um, we're not gonna do that. We're not gonna put out individual reports. We're gonna put out aggregate reports.
