    "voice_to_text": "if you're ever thinking about driving a car without car insurance take it as a lesson for me and never do that shit when I was in college I got an internship and I needed a car to get to where my internship was and I talked to my parents I said guys I need a car like there's no way I can take the bus or walk to this internship it's way too far it's not convenient like I need a car and they're like Michael you don't need a car you can figure it out then I wore them down to the point where they were like okay you do kind of need a car but 1 it has to be from Facebook Marketplace and two as be under $1,000 and I was like okay perfect so I go scroll on Facebook Marketplace and I find this beat up 2001 Volvo old as hell hatchback with a cassette player and I'm like what am I gonna do with the cassette player I didn't do anything with it I bring it up to my parents and they're like okay fine this works they love all those because it's like safe or whatever and we meet up with the lady get the car done deal and then my dad's like okay you have the car but what's your plan for car insurance because you can't drive without car insurance and I was like oh I actually didn't have a plan I thought you guys were gonna help me with that for like the first month cause like I have no money I'm waiting on my last paycheck from vans cause I've been working there and I'm going back to school in the fall like I just don't have any money right now and they're like okay well we're not paying for that so you have to figure it out and I was like okay fuck you're right like give me a couple days and let me come up with the plan so a couple days roll around and on this particular day my parents are leaving for work for the entire day and it's like in the morning I'm bored at home and I'm like you know what I'm gonna go and have myself a day at the Stanford Mall and if you know the Stanford Mall yes it's right next to Stanford University but it's a vibe and a half like there's so much to do there's this whole strip of restaurants called University Avenue and I was like yeah let me Kiki no money to my name I'm just gonna have you know a day of fun so that's exactly what I did I drove the 25 30 minute drive to Stanford Mall and I was like we out to have a good time I window shopped I went to lemonade if you were there in 2014 you remember it was a cultural phenomenon I grab myself a little drink and I just hung out with myself and the afternoon rolls around and I'm like okay I need to get home before my parents get home so they don't realize that I've taken this car without car insurance but there were two things in my plan that I wasn't prepared for one being that I had never driven on a highway because I was too scared and the only driving experience I had was preparing for my driver's test which was like six months ago so I could get my driver's license and I hadn't driven since other than that morning so the other thing was that it was rush hour and that it was very busy and I was like okay I need to get home but it's gonna take me longer than I thought so I'm just gonna take El Camino and if you don't know El Camino it's this long street that goes from the Bay Area all the way down to LA and it's just a straight shot with like stop lights along the way okay let me just take that so I'm taking El Camino and the sun is in my eyes I'm looking at my phone for the maps there's so much traffic this is rush hour and all of a sudden I rear end this lady I look up and she jumps her Bob goes flying I'm so mortified that I just hit somebody without car insurance and she looks completely frazzled she turns her blinker on and goes into the nearest parking lot and I follow her in she comes out of her car and she's like okay let's exchange information and I was like yes yes I would love to but I don't have car insurance and she was like what do you mean you don't have car insurance and I was like yeah I just don't have it and she's like okay well and then she tells me that this was her brand new Mercedes that she got a few days ago and I was like are you fucking kidding me like out of all the cars I could hit on the road I hit a fucking Mercedes that she just got like bitch I would be pissed too and I was like so what are we gonna do and she was like what are we gonna do what are you gonna do you have two options here either we can call the police or you can call your parents and figure this out and I was like okay girl like there's no reason to get law enforcement involved like what's the police gonna do here this isn't a hit and run let's work on this from a human human level I'm still here I'm ready to make this work and she was like okay then call your parents so I sit down on the curb head in my hands I'm shaking I am so scared that I have to call my parents so I call my dad and he picks up and he's like what's up and I'm like okay so I just hit this lady I rear ended her and he's like why are you driving a car and I'm like okay like I just wanted to have a little day fun like sorry sue me like I'm just a boy and he's like okay like just get her information and come home right now like don't make any stops and I was like okay I will so I get her information she's like okay just like text me and I'll let you know how much the damage is and we can work it out after I was like okay so I get home and my dad is like what is your plan to pay this lady back like we're not bailing out of this you have to figure it out on your own like this car is your responsibility and you chose to drive without car insurance I know I know let me think like I still need to see how much this damage is gonna be literally an hour later she texts me she's like so it's gonna be 16 hundred dollars girl I didn't even bend that fender like it was a tiny little crack like don't come at me with the sixteen hundred dollar Bill but sixteen hundred dollars here it was then I remember this little loophole and I was like okay here's what I'm gonna do if you remember from one of my last videos I said that my dad gave me two things if I went to the military college that he wanted me to go to one being a car which I got and two was $2,000 towards a road trip that I was planning on doing my friends cross country which I hadn't done yet so I was like okay I'll take a thousand dollars from this 2,000 dollar road trip fund and I will use my 300 dollar paycheck that I'm getting from vans my last paycheck and then I went to my mom was like hey girl like can you please spot me this 300 and I'll pay you back like I have an internship lined up I will be paying you back like don't worry you can trust me and she's like okay like fine so that's what we do and I meet up with this lady's husband in front of the Orange Theory Fitness at Redwood City and I'm like okay here is a sixteen hundred dollars and her husband was like thank you so much for being so timely and being so like honest and everything and I was like oh yeah of course he's like but never drive without car insurance ever again like you're insane for that they could have been much much worse and so we say our goodbyes and that was that but because of this incident I had this whole panicked episode of reevaluating everything in my life like everything and one of those things was my relationship social media and I don't know why I felt the need to do this but I wrote this very dramatic Selena Gomez ass story um in my notes app and I posted it to my socials and I just deleted every social and I got so many DMs like Michael like is everything okay like what's wrong and I look back in my notes app to see if I still had it and I did so let's have a read let me know if you guys can find a correlation between me rearending some lady and that post because I still don't know to this day why I posted that I was just overwhelmed I guess so yeah please do not drive without car insurance it could have been much worse like I can totally see that I completely understand how much worse it could have gotten and I'm just grateful every day that um all I did was hit her Mercedes from the back like yeah don't fucking drive without car insurance",

On those who don't know, the Pentagon has a department of Defense Entertainment Media Office. From their website, The DOD Entertainment Media Office supports studios, production companies, producers, directors, etc. In the production of both scripted and unscripted films. According to the documentary theaters of war, the US DOD does not just subtly influence Hollywood's depiction of US wars to present them in a more favorable light. The Pentagon actively demands script oversight and dictate storylines. Practice it has been waging a full spectrum propaganda war on western audiences. Pentagon's objections usually relate to any suggestion of military incompetence or war crimes. Back in 2013, Doctor Steffan Underhill of Marshall University filed with the freedom for Information Act to obtain all the movies that the Pentagon has supervised on. Some of them were surprising. I'm going to list them page by page. Feel free to take screenshots.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the video that I posted about getting a bad grade got a lot of people talking in the comment section. I've also seen a lot of stitches on this. In support of setting standards for your kids, why don't we get ready together? Well, I talk about our strict rules. Number one, my kids need to read at least 30 minutes a day, even on the weekends. We have seen that kids simply cannot read. Seventh graders are reading at a third grade level, and high schoolers are reading at a sixth grade level every single day. That is a must. Number two is no phones allowed in your bedroom. This only really applies to my oldest, but if you need to make a phone call, you can do that downstairs in another room. I do not want your phone in your room. So we do no screen time Monday through Thursday. So no phone unless you need to call a friend. And no TV. Kids are so busy with homework, after school activities, dinner anyway, that there's really no time. Obviously in the summer that changes. And when they do get screen time, we do set limits on that as well. Hour on the phone maximum. Of course, TV is a little over two hours if they're watching a movie. Do not allow our kids to use their phones or ipads at restaurants at all. This was a really hard one to let go of when we did Allow our kids to bring devices into restaurants. They displayed zombie like behaviours. Screen time free for over two years. And it has made such a big difference. And actually have conversations. We can laugh, we can talk. And I wanna make it very clear that this doesn't apply for every kid, but this is what worked for us. And the last strict rule for us. While it might be controversial, you are absolutely hundred percent expected to do well in school. And if they are struggling, we will absolutely help them with what they need to succeed. Of course, every kid is different, and I'm sure there are challenges along the way. But we know that our kids are very capable of doing well in school. And this is what works for us. I hope this was helpful. Love you guys."

Girl, it's so funny that you're so pressed over the fact that Fenty Beauty, a black owned brand, is catering to darker shades and you can't find your shade when you can literally go into any store. You can go into Target, Walmart, Sephora, Ulta. You can even go into five fucking below, bitch, and find your shade. As in us, we have to go on a hunt, on a deep search to find shades that match her skin tone. And it's almost if what you experience for that two point 75 seconds is what we black women have been experiencing forever in the makeup community and the beauty community. We've been experiencing that forever. Now, I'm not a big makeup girly, but I do wear makeup, and it is a process trying to go to stores to find my shade. So you sitting there mad because one little brand don't have what you looking for, but 75 other brands do? Be fucking for real.",

There, I said it, I said it, I said it. Grown woman have hair under their arms. And I just feel like the fact that it grows back in 5.5 seconds tells you that it's supposed to be there. Now, mind you, hair does carry stench and must and all of that. That's why when it gets too long, I take a pair of Scissors and I cut it.

It's because we're not spending any money. But guess what? We don't have any money to spend. And they caused the situation, and now they're facing the consequences of the situation, and they fully expect that we're going to start spending money on bullshit again. And I don't think they understand that they literally trained us out of that behavior by raising prices so high that people found ways around shopping. They found ways around. They're all hoping that by lowering costs on all these main items, like bread, milk, diapers, that they're going to bring their profit margins back up to what they were before. And again, the fact that all of these places, Amazon, Target, Aldi, Walmart, they all have the ability to lower the cost because it never had anything to do with inflation or production costs. It was greed. End of story. So I hope that everyone really digests that and understands that we have always just been drained of our life. For us there, they've always. All of these companies, all of corporate America, all of capitalism. The point is to drain you of your resources. Not just your money, but also your life force, and then leave you with nothing in the end. Make sure that your kids have nothing in the end. So many people are not even Able to own homes. And none of these businesses would have had any mercy on us unless we had gotten to this precipice where people are completely out of money. And still they think they're gonna be okay. They think that they're not going to have to lower their prices back down to what they were before. But again, here's the thing. We have gone past the point of no return. The amount of debt in this country now is up into the trillions. People have their credit cards completely maxed out. So it's not like people are making a decision not to buy more groceries and not to buy more bullshit. They simply cannot. And so the major upside of this is we will get to watch a lot of these companies pay huge consequences for their grade",

But I watched the whole show. I've seen it twice, but the first time I watched it, I watched it all in exactly 30 days. That's like, holy moly. That's like eight episodes a day. Yeah, for 30 days straight. Actually, the first time everybody, my friends watched it, they told me Castiel was in season 4. So I sat through, and in the matter of you skip that season, I. Nobody told me, like, who it was. I was just like, oh, that's cool. New character. So I sat down, and then I pulled an all nighter. I watch season 3 that whole day, 4 overnight, and then 5 the next day. I just was kind of Wondering what your guys favorite, like, TV show was. Wow. I can't compete with that. Nobody can. Um. That's amazing. That's it. That's. Jesus. Not even mad. That's impressive. Impressive. The whole block of cheese. Wow. Are there any. What. What would you rewatch? Did you rewatch any of just the episodes or do you. If you wanna watch an episode from season 6, you like, damn, gotta go back to one and watch all the way through. I actually have done that. I was like, man, I really wanna see season 7 again. And then I started from one all the way up to 7. You are a professional binge watcher. That's is awesome. Is there a way to make money out of that?

And there's a lot of people of all types saying that it's all. It's grumpy old white tattooers that are being mean to people from my experience. Uh, because I pay attention in the city, I tattooing where outside of our shop, we have all types of tattooers. Male, female, white, black, Hispanic, the full game. But I'm noticing something and we're gonna set it up with a story time. Last week a client came in and one of the small tattoo behind the ear, little Pinteresty shit is gonna take like 5, 10 minutes. And the artist who was available besides me, for whatever reason, who had not tattooed all day, decided they didn't wanna do it. And that is completely fine. But I stood up and was like, I'll do it. Mind you, I had been tattooing for six and a half hours before this. Because Mama didn't raise no bitch. I don't think you're a bitch. Dean. I love you. I know you're gonna see this. You wanna guess what happened the next day? Get a message from that client who wanted a tattoo in a style that I fucking love. Multi session, half sleeve, like two, three grand. So I don't think it's got shit to do with age, race, sex, any of that shit. We got a bunch of Picky motherfuckers who think they're too good to do a certain type of tattoo. And then they wanna wonder why they're fucking clients aren't walking through the door. I said what I said. I hope your fucking feelings are hurt. Have the day you deserve.",

So before me and my husband even got married, we decided we're not having any kids. We're gonna be the rich auntie and uncle. We're gonna travel the world. Absolutely no children. So six months before we got married, I got next one on. You know that birth control that goes in your arm? So we get married, everything's going good, we're doing what we said we was gonna do. We're traveling, we're living our best lives. And then one day, about six months later, I'm at work, and I'm feeling weird. I'm starting to spot. And my coworker was like, if you're spotting, that means you're pregnant. And I'm like, you don't know what you're talking about. But just in case you do, let me go to Walmart and get this little pregnancy test. So I go to Walmart, take this test, this is Saturday, and it said I was pregnant. And I was like, no way. My husband's like, you got that stick in your arm. Like, there's no way you're pregnant. And I'm like, for real? And so it was, like, midnight, and I'm, like, contemplating. I'm like, what are we gonna do? And so I was like, let's just take another test. Maybe that one was wrong. So we go spend, like, $300 at Walgreens. All them tests said yeah. And I was like, there's no way. There's still no Way I'm still in denial. So the next day, what I do? I go to urgent care. What do? I go to urgent care. There's like, girl, what do you want? And I'm like, I don't. I don't. I don't know. Please just tell me something. Then they said, well, just because the P test said yeah, the blood test could say no. And I was like, okay, well, let's do that. They take a P test for me there. That one said, yeah, too. And I was like, there's still no way. I'm still in denial. And so they said, okay, we'll call you with the results tomorrow. So they call me the next day, and I. My doctor said, okay, you wanna come in? I come in. The doctor said, yeah, that test said. The blood test said yeah, too. And I was like, okay, well, what are we gonna do? And she's like, well, we need to see how far along you are, because people don't usually get pregnant on this next one on, like, we need to see if it's probably in your tube, because people don't get pregnant on this. So she sent me over to the hospital. They had one appointment left that day. I go, they put the stuff on my belly, and they're like, yeah, there's a head, there's a leg. I'm like, why? You can see a lot for only be, like, a month long? They're like, there's a penis. I Was like, you can see that this early? That's so crazy. This was June 9th. And they're like, oh, what do you mean, a month? They're like, girl, you are due September 14th. I had, like, 14 weeks to prepare for my child. Yeah. So that was that. And he will be 10 soon. Yeah."

We as a profession need to have a better rule than this. We need to have better tools. We need to have something else that when you're pregnant, doesn't scream it to everyone. Then saying, I can't take that patient. First everyone just thinks you're being a witch or you're being. And then they look at the patients chart to see why you can't do it, and then, oh, boop, boop, boop for diagnosis, you're pregnant. That's why you can't take that patient. This is something that I have always detested, and I felt that this just makes you entirely vulnerable, especially in this time when women have no choice. I remember when it happened to me. I remember when it's happened to my friends. It's just one of those things in medicine that because it doesn't affect the other half of the population, it's never gonna be cared about. Privacy and nursing doesn't exist for the nurses because we're just service. We're not actual people.",

    "voice_to_text": "So a couple years ago, my wife gave me a ancestry membership, or whatever it was she gifted. It was for my birthday, right? She gave that to me. And, um, you know, I did the DNA swap, you know, all of that. Sent the information in. Yes, my DNA is out there, whatever it is, what it is, I didn't get that. So anyway, so I did a DNA swap and like, literally forgot about it. Uh, we have a three year old now. He's three. And, you know, she asked me, and this was like after a couple years or something like that. She was like, hey, whatever happened with the ancestry thing? And I'm like, I don't know. And mind you, don't quote me on the exact time. I know it was a significant amount of time that went past. It was at least a year that went past of me not even paying attention to the thing at all. So she's like, what, what happened with that DNA thing, you know, for ancestry? I'm like, I don't know. She's like, well, you should check it or whatever, you know, we got this little dude, want him to be able to know information, things like that. So I log into ancestry and I go through and, you know, they have your matches, right? Your DNA matches. So, for instance, you know, you are 50% of your father, 50% of your mother, right? So if you have an Uncle or aunt, that would mean they be about 12 25%, right? And if your uncle or your aunt has a child, that'll be about twelve and a half percent. I hope you guys are following me. So your first cousin is like twelve and a half percent of your DNA. Okay. Um, so I look at the DNA match list and I see two women first, and I'm like, man, whatever. This stuff is fake. Like, I have no clue who they are at all. Never heard of them. Right? But the third person on the list, I knew that name. And I was like, hold the hell on. This is my brother from my mother. This is his son. I said, so, hmm, if he's third on my list, who the hell are these other two women that are above him? So I went ahead and, you know, message both the women. And the person that was number two on my list, she got back to me and she was like, you know what? I wouldn't have even entertain this at all. But you are the second person on my list. And I know you're somebody because I actually found a brother on here a year ago, and you're the one right, right behind him. So I know that you're super close. Now, keep in mind, never heard of this person ever. So we go through messaging, back and forth, call, trying to figure this out, trying to Figure that out. Trying to figure names out because I didn't have a lot of names. And, you know, I'll get to that story, you know, at some point. Come to find out we're the same age, but. Come to find out she's my niece from a sister that I never met. Wow. The ancestry stuff is. Say what you wanna say about it, if you don't want your DNA out. I don't know. It's real. It's real.",

and I was gonna sit in the back seat cause his brother was gonna sit in the front seat so I'm like cleaning stuff off the back seat I'm like wait\u2026 whose glasses are these??? and he's like oh I thought they might be yours or like your mom's or something I don't know, he\u2019s like  I noticed those a couple weeks ago and I never thought about it again like I just kind of forgot about it I was like okay like and I really didn't think anything in the beginning cause I'm like I trust him like there's never been any reason not to like he's just not the type to lie to me or you know so you think but he's not the type to lie to me like so I'm like okay like that'd be really weird we tell each other everything like okay so I didn't really think about it too hard I was kinda like okay they're probably my mom my mom does wear glasses and she does have a habit of like leaving things around places so I'm like maybe it is my mom's whatever cause they're just a little like reading glasses they're not like prescription but you know I don't wear these so I'm like okay weird so we go to his mom's birthday dinner and I kinda wasn't thinking anything of it we get back in the car and I'm like you know what like I'm just gonna call my mom and see if they're hers cause in my head I'm thinking like they're definitely probably gonna be my mom's or my sister's but I was thinking my mom okay so after dinner we get back to the apartment and I Facetime my mom like as we're walking up and I'm like hey mom um are these your glasses and she was like no like immediately she's like no why I was like oh cause they were in Brandon's car and we don't know whose they were so we were just like maybe thinking they're yours she's like no those aren't mine I'm like okay thank you and so then I started to get a little worried I'm like okay like I really wasn't thinking he was lying but I'm like now this is kinda weird like I I really thought they were gonna be my mom's so then cause I took his car to my mom's house a couple weeks ago like a month ago so then and he said he noticed them two weeks ago so I'm like okay like maybe that would check out so then I call my little sister so she also wears glasses but hers are prescription so I really didn't think they were hers so I call her I'm like hey Queen um did you lose a pair of glasses and she goes actually yeah I did she's like are they like a tortoiseshell kind of color and I look at them and I was like I think so I was like hold on let me Facetime you and show you as soon as I put the Facetime on she goes oh no she goes those aren't mine I thought you meant sunglasses she goes I lost a pair of sunglasses not these kind of glasses at this point I'm starting to get a little freaked out so I'm like okay I wasn't thinking anything and I like judging by the way he was reacting like I really did not think he was lying like he looked like he was telling the truth but I was kind of like okay this is getting weird at this point like not my mom's not my sisters there's no other girls that are like in his car so I'm hoping you know so then he's like why don't you call Alyssa cause that's one of our couple friends that we hang out with I'm like okay that probably be the only other girl that's like been in the car so I Facetime her I'm like hey I know this is super random are these your glasses and she was like um no she's like I have 20 20 vision I don't wear glasses I was like never she's like nope never wear glasses I'm like okay and then he starts asking me like are you sure they're not yours are you sure they're not yours like you didn't just like buy those for fun or something I'm like no I've literally never seen these before in my entire life so at this point I'm like okay I was believing him but I was also like they had to get there somehow and that's what that's what I kept saying to him like he was like I promise you like I'm just as confused as you are I wanna know who they are like I have no idea and I was like look I'm not saying I don't believe you but at the same time they have to come from somewhere you know what I mean like they had to come from somewhere I'm like did one of your friend's girlfriends get in your car did you take someone home one day I feel like I would know about that if he did that which he's never done that before so I'm like that would be really out of character and weird if I'm like grilling him at this point cause at first I was like kinda making it a joke but I was like no like whose are these like they had to come from somewhere I was like please like rack your brain and think like who else was in your car at all and he's like going through and he's like I swear like the only people that have been in my car are you like any girls he's like you and your mom and sister cause like I said I took his car to my mom's house like a month ago so I'm just like okay it's getting weird I don't know what to do in this situation like do I break up with them like I start thinking like am I gonna have to break up with them over these damn glasses I'm like were these from before we were dating but then I'm like that can't even be possible cause number one we've been dating for over two years so I've never seen this before number two he gets his car washed all the time and he gets like the inside detailed oh like twice a month or once every month so I'm like no we would have seen these glasses before if it was like from before we were dating which that would have been so long ago for these to randomly appear so I'm just like okay what do I do and I'm sitting there and he's over and over I don't know who they are I don't know who they are I don't know who they are then my mom text me and she goes hey ask chase if they're his which that's my brother and she goes I remember him and Brandon went to in N out like a couple weeks ago so just ask him I'm like these are not gonna be my brother's glasses like what these are clearly girl glasses okay you know what I'm just gonna cover all the bases here I text my brother I'm like hey are these your glasses and I send the video they were literally my brother's glasses he said he bought these because his job like at the time on the computer a lot so we just like bought these random pair I think they're like blue light glasses immediately he's like yeah those are mine and then this was like our messages while we're talking about it he's like yeah I get it I would have been pissed too they were dead ass mine I'm sorry I'll buy manlier glasses he goes just Oakley's with the Monster Energy drink from here on out the last person on earth I would have been thinking would be my brother imagine this happening to you and you clearly thinking it's a girl and then it's your

They better not get rid of this app. So apparently they was at home or whatever. Dude had his phone on a charging case on the counter. So she swapped her phone with his phone and went in the bathroom. Let me tell you, that was smart, actually, because he would have thought his phone was just in the same spot and not. It was a switch phone. Let's carry on with the story. She goes through the phone. He was texting a woman. Nothing too serious. She keeps scrolling, and she don't see nothing until she come across a chat with him and his homeboys. And he's his good friends. Like, friends she didn't know that he had since he was little. They've all known each other. She going through the chat, you know. You know, we talking about our friends. Like, you know, people say, don't look through my pictures, don't look through my screenshots, but check that chat between me and my best friend, you know, stuff like that. She was going through the chat to see what the boys had going on. Why? One guy say, I didn't test positive. Didn't test positive for what, my dear? But then her baby daddy and another one was like, I did y'all. They didn't test it. Positive for HIV. I did not expect this plot twist, like, at all. I would have rather it been something going on with the first girl that she seen. But she ain't find nothing. She found something worse. I would have flipped the whole house.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I'm gonna show you how to make prison pizza. There's another prison creator on here, Casey. She keeps calling out Gypsy Rose for a cook off. So here's your cook off. Boo! I'm not Gypsy Rose, but I'm Jennifer. I spent six years in federal prison, and these are my stories of before, during, and after incarceration. Now, one of my favorite things to make was pizzas, but tasted with those crackers was super creative. I'm gonna do something a little bit different. So I've heard that the feds no longer have microwaves, which is a bummer. You're gonna lay your tortilla flat and hit it with a fork on both sides. You wanna make sure you get a lot of holes in it. Pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. In prison, we didn't have pizza sauce, so we would use ketchup and make a sauce. I, I burned it. I burned the first one. You gotta watch it. But look a crisp up. We're gonna try again. Okay, round two. Now, this time I gotta watch it. I was talking and not paying attention. You wanna take it out every, like, 20 seconds and see how it's forming a bubble. You wanna pop that, and you don't want any bubbles. And again, see little bubbles. This step is so important or it will burn like my last one did. So make sure you get all those bubbles out. So this is what you're gonna end up. With you hear that? It's hard. It's like a flatbread pizza. Mix ketchup, Italian seasoning and garlic. Mix it together really well. I like to add a little bit of Velveeta cheese in mine to make it more creamy. I also put a layer of Velveeta cheese on my tortilla before I add my sauce just cause I like it cheesy. Now my toppings of choice are pineapple and pepperoni. You can use whatever you want. We had dried pineapple on commissary. So I would chop them up and do this and then add cheese. You would have to get cheese from the kitchen from one of your hookup. And of course I wasn't recording when I took it out of the microwave. But this is what it looks like. Would you try this? Let me know in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "The images coming out of Rafa right now are so genuinely horrific that I cannot even begin to understand truly how we will ever get the forgiveness of Palestinians. And people say this time and time again that these are the worst images I've seen. These are the worst images I've seen. But for my understanding of the situation currently, this bombing, this latest bombing took place in the Rafa crossing, located in an unretent where thousands, hundreds of thousands, of my understanding of people were sent there, were displaced to this tent. Again, this is UNRA. This is the UN. These are displacement tents that the UN put in place to keep people safe. Right. And those are the areas in which Israel just targeted. Remember all the claims about the babies that the White House has continued to make, even though not the White House necessarily, actually, Joe Biden himself has continued to make, even though now those articles have been disproved, and the White House itself has had to come forward and say that this is not true. I just saw a man carrying a baby, fully baby, and. And that is a image I will never get out of my head. The absolute sanction violence by the United States that we have been seeing take place in Palestine for the last eight months is due to the fact that lies were made about children who were, as well as great victims. These stories have now been debunked, but when you put information like This out into the world, it is very difficult to take it back. And so now we are seeing the ramifications of that. I'm going to strongly, strongly, strongly encourage you to interact with the videos and the images that we are seeing coming out of Rafa right now across all social medias. We have to make these stories, these situations, these horrors so undeniable that everywhere you look, someone is going to see this. Because there are still people today who have no idea what is happening around the world, not only in Rafa, but in the DRC, in Sudan. These are the atrocities that we are forcing upon people. Us in the west, we are forcing this upon people because we continue to put these violent, evil maniacs into office, and then they go and commit these atrocities. We have got to stop this, and we cannot stop fighting for the rights of people all over the world.",

    "voice_to_text": "An Indian American, he realized the only way that he would be accepted at med school would be to pass as black. He chronicled his experiences in his book, Almost Black the True Story of how I got into Medical School by pretending to be black. DJ Joko Choco Ingham joins me now. So you were studying statistics at the university of Chicago, and you say to yourself, I don't stand a chance with my 3.1. What did you do? Well, I shaved my head, I trimmed my eyelashes, and I decided to join the organization of black students so I can apply to medical school as a black man. I also used my middle name, JoJo. I subsequently interviewed at medical schools across the country and, uh, managed to get waitlisted at Washington University and the university of Pennsylvania, then ranked the second and the third and fourth best medical schools in the country and got into, uh, ST. Louis university, uh, school of medicine, despite the fact that my pretty pitiful 3.1 GPA was dramatically lower than their average of, uh, three, uh, 3.7. Now, I want you to process what you just heard. This man basically just said, yeah, I knew my GPA was terrible for what I wanted to do, so what I basically did is I went and pretended I was black, because I know they lower the standards for black people, and I got in somewhere. He was like, this 3.1 GPA is not Gonna cut it for my race, but if I act like a different race, I can have a lower GPA and still get in. Again, this is quite literally them lowering the standard for black people. And what that does is it puts into question if that black person is actually qualified. If you're lowering the standard for black people to get into the school, why aren't you lowering the standard for them to pass classes in the school? Why not have all the test scores similar for the people that get into the school? I think too many schools are now looking to have a diverse skin color within their universities rather than having the best students in their universities. In my opinion, it should be the best students in the universities, not so much focus on their skin color. if you get to the point where you've got a plethora of options and so many, uh, test scores are very similar, then I can maybe see, you know, maybe looking at some diversity at that point. Maybe, but having lower scores for certain races of people, to me, is, uh, discriminatory, and it's playing favorites. And again, it puts in the question the legitimacy of those black students who were going to those universities.",

This made me start thinking about how, like, fancy food techniques and, like, culinary arts in general is based on white supremacy.

This is a corny ass motherfucker who just got cool. Maybe they got some money, maybe they got some followers, but they're corny and they do corny, weird shit, and then they. They can't tell. But we can see you. The cool kids can still see you. That's why people comment Like, oh, you give mean girl, even though I'm clearly not mean. It's always so funny because it's just like, I really. What I heard is, you remind me of the girls who I really hated my high school because they were cool and I wasn't, and everyone like them and no one likes me. Still applies. It still applies. It still applies. High school is like a. A like. What's the word? Like a controlled environment of what society is like as a whole. Some of y'all will grow up and still be losers, and some people grow up and still be posers. Some people were cool in high school, and we're still cool now. And we can see you being corny the same way we can see you being corny in high school.",

And I think when you feel like you're not getting the respect,   And   I   think   when   you   feel   like   you're   not   getting   the   respect that's when you tend to say comments that come off as hating, right?   when   you   tend   to   say   comments   that   come   off   as   hating   right And that's what a lot of these women are doing   that's   what   a   lot   of   these   women   are   doing is they feel like what we have done for this game,   they   feel   like   what   we   have   done   for   this   game this young player has come into our game   young   player   has   come   into   our   game and she's getting way more respect and all that stuff than we are,   she's   getting   way   more   respect   and   all   that   stuff   than   we   are as she should. The young girl is a baller.   she   should   The   young   girl   is   a   baller The young girl has people watching   young   girl   has   people   watching because of the way she can shoot this basketball.   of   the   way   she   can   shoot   this   basketball Like Steph Curry. Steph Curry can't dunk.   Steph   Curry   Steph   Curry   can't   dunk Steph Curry don't do none of that in the game.   Curry   don't   do   none   of   that   in   the   game He could probably dunk by himself,   could   probably   dunk   by   himself but he don't really do none of that in the game.   he   don't   really   do   none   of   that   in   the   game He is a shooter and fans tune in to see Steph Curry.   is   a   shooter   and   fans   tune   in   to   see   Steph   Curry When I look at Caitlin Clark,   I   look   at   Caitlin   Clark fans are tuning in to watch her.   are   tuning   in   to   watch   her And you know who that's helping?   you   know   who   that's   helping Everybody else is helping the Asia Wilson's is helping everybody else.   else   is   helping   the   Asia   Wilson's   is   helping   everybody   else The plums, all that is helping all of them.   plums   all   that   is   helping   all   of   them The terassies. So y'all should be really thanking her,   terassies   So   y'all   should   be   really   thanking   her embracing her. And that does not mean you guys are not ballers.   her   And   that   does   not   mean   you   guys   are   not   ballers I remember Charles Watson told me, man,   remember   Charles   Watson   told   me   man we walk into this stadium   walk   into   this   stadium and all we see in the stands is offensive jerseys.   all   we   see   in   the   stands   is   offensive   jerseys We see Jones, we see Jennings,   see   Jones   we   see   Jennings we See driver, we see Rogers,   See   driver   we   see   Rogers we see Nelson, we very rarely see Charles Woodson   see   Nelson   we   very   rarely   see   Charles   Woodson and he better than all of us.   he   better   than   all   of   us But that don't mean we not good though.   that   don't   mean   we   not   good   though So just because Caitlin Clark is getting all the attention   just   because   Caitlin   Clark   is   getting   all   the   attention and she's growing the game,   she's   growing   the   game it does not mean you women are not ballers.   does   not   mean   you   women   are   not   ballers You guys are ballers.   guys   are   ballers But I think the way some of them are taking it is like   I   think   the   way   some   of   them   are   taking   it   is   like she's taking all the shine away from us   taking   all   the   shine   away   from   us and taking away from us being ballers.   taking   away   from   us   being   ballers No, you are taking it like that.   you   are   taking   it   like   that People are tuning in. Yes,   are   tuning   in   Yes they watching Kailyn Clark,   watching   Kailyn   Clark but they watching your games now too.   they   watching   your   games   now   too And when you play,   when   you   play Caitlin Clark has even more eyes on you to show that you are like that.   Clark   has   even   more   eyes   on   you   to   show   that   you   are   like   that So for me, I feel like the young girls   for   me   I   feel   like   the   young   girls taking way too much heat for really helping you guys   way   too   much   heat   for   really   helping   you   guys and growing y'all game.   growing   y'all   game Does that mean y'all had nothing to do with this?   that   mean   y'all   had   nothing   to   do   with   this Absolutely not.   not That is why the young girls owing five because y'all are ballers.   is   why   the   young   girls   owing   five   because   y'all   are   ballers You know what I'm saying? It's nothing to take away from y'all,   know   what   I'm   saying   It's   nothing   to   take   away   from   y'all but growing this game, she was chosen like joy said,   growing   this   game   she   was   chosen   like   joy   said and there's nothing you can do about that.   there's   nothing   you   can   do   about   that",

She talks to you like you're her equal because you exude feminine qualities. That is why she treats you like that. If she seems as if she's overly aggressive, maybe you're overly feminine. Because in my experience, in the life that I lived. Women cannot wait to be soft around men. Women cannot wait to be extremely feminine around men. Women cannot wait to be vulnerable around men. Women cannot wait to be dumbfounded, a damsel in distress around men. So if she is acting like a man around a so called man, maybe you need to take a deep, dark, long look at yourself and ask yourself, what feminine qualities do you have? What feminine qualities are you exuding? Why is a woman looking at you like her equal and not as a leader, not as a protector, but as a pussy? Am I lying",

That is something that had to be done for the house. You didn't do that for me. Let's explore that. Now, we're not talking about romantic relationships here. We're talking about the business side of being in a relationship. This has nothing to do with connection. This has nothing to do with anything other than, let's make this household run. We're business partners. Generally, when it comes to the business side of being in a relationship, we have a his plate and her plate. And there are usually a few little things that are his. You know, check engine lights in the car. Generally fall to him for her. Whatever it is, it doesn't matter. There's a few small things that are kind of his and hers, but let's talk about that. So let's talk about, like, washing the dishes. It falls on both of their plates, right? Let's talk about keeping the floor clean. Falls on both of their plates. Let's talk about making sure the baby's diapers change. That falls on both of their plates. Now, if they're doing this right, this is sitting on their heads equally, like, oh, no. That the dishes need washed, the laundry needs done, whatever. If one of them says, I did this for you, this is what they're saying. I Did the dishes, and now it's off your plate because it was on both of our plates. But because I did it, I did it for you. To get it off your head. Um, I did the laundry. Well, now it's off your plate, too. So I did it for you because I know that getting that off the plate makes things better for you. Releases some anxiety, releases some pressure. Releases some stress. I hope this makes sense."

He would give me white pills to keep me awake for certain events, like going hunting. But I wouldn't remember anything after I took these pills. For instance, one time when he took me hunting, it was early in the morning. We were driving out to the spot. He said, you're gonna be sleepy. Here, take these. They'll keep you awake. So I did, and I remember getting to the spot. I remember walking out, but I don't remember anything after that. I don't remember walking back to the car, and I don't even remember how we got home. My memory just kind of sort of picks up in the middle of the day later that day. I didn't think that this was a big deal for the majority of my life until it kind of loosely got brought up in therapy. And my therapist was like, he did what? Now you don't remember anything? Hello? And I was like, oh, yeah, girl, you're right. You're right. But I don't know. And the other thing that raises questions in my mind and why I say to my knowledge, is because of the content of his. That my mom found. She found flash drives of his containing the worst. She didn't tell me if she recognized any of the girls or if they were Multiple girls on these flash drives. But I can't help but wonder, could those flash drives be content of me? The holes in my walls, as you guys know, pills, etc. But I say to my knowledge, because I don't know.

There was this old man who came in. He was having issues, um, controlling his back door. So he has a blowout. She's cleaning them up. She proceeds to clean the front. When she goes to grab the front to clean the front, she's like, oh, my god. She looks at him, she's like, sir, something's wrong with your. Your front. With your little, you know, python. Something's going on with your python. And he was like, what are you talking about? She's like, well, I think that there might be, like, tumors. Are something inside of it. It's. It has these little balls in it, and those could be gross. I need to get your doctor immediately. And he was like, no, no, no, that's not what they are. Those are my marbles. She's like, pardon? He goes, when I was in. I don't know if I can say that on here, but when he was locked up, he got implanted marbles into his python so that he had a present for his wife when he got home. Tell me, how in the fuck does that Happen. I have so many questions. So many questions. How did they get them in? How. Since when do you have marbles in the. Beat that. Hmm? I just wanna know where do you get the marbles from? What? What? It wasn't there red stuff that comes out of your body everywhere. How do you control that when you're in that kind of controlled setting? I have I. The questions are endless. And maybe the locked up side of TikTok wants to join in on this chat because I am flapper fucking gasted. Okay, um, that was a first. I didn't know they can do that.

So my car kept dying, but at least I was able to get it to turn back on and drive it in, right? So I go in there, they charge me here for a bunch of unnecessary things, and I drive home, and I noticed, like, when I get in the car, the air is still on, the music is still blasting. Like, did anybody get in the car? Did he do anything to the car? So I get home, and as soon as I get in the driveway, the car dies. It's a lemon. It doesn't even turn back on now. But it was able to turn back on before, and I already paid them. So I'm able to get a jump from someone in the car, turns back on. So I drive to Autozone, and when they lift the hood, they're like, no one's been in this vehicle. No one's even touched anything. There's literally, like, a trail of dust over the top. So they lift, you know, everything up, they change the battery out. The battery, some kind of, like, corrosion or it combusted somewhere. If they would have lifted the hood and looked at that, they would have known that that was the issue. And so I had to pay even more money to literally have a worker at Autozone just to trade It out, and now my car works perfectly fine. It was literally just the battery. So I call this mechanic, and I'm like, guys, I didn't need all of those things that you guys typed up. And I noticed on the paperwork, everything said na. Like, all the fields that were supposed to be filled out said, like, na. Like, nothing was properly filled out. And so that right there was also suspicious. So I called them, and they are so rude. They're like, you're not getting your money back. I'm like, I paid you guys for nothing. You gave me a lemon. You gave me a lemon of a vehicle, and I fixed the issue myself. So, yeah, guys, um, I don't know if they're filtering their reviews. I don't know what they're doing. Wasn't being posted. I don't know if they're blocking them or turning off the reviews. After they scam people. So this company right here. Don't go here. I genuinely believe they pulled the car from the back to the front. That's why everything was still in place. That's why the music was on and the air was still blasting, because they pulled it from the back to the front, didn't look at it, and then just took the money and did, like, a false diagnosis. Be careful out here, y'all. Everything is for money, and people just don't have A conscience anymore."

That's what we've been trying to tell you for weeks now. Built different. Because the sensitivity give a damn button that this generation has, we didn't come standard equipped with. You drink all night then go to work the next morning. You know, we didn't have a choice. Gen X and the xenials were not a basement dwelling generation, right? Once you hit a certain age, you moved out because living with your parents wasn't cool. The only person we knew who still live with their mama was Norman Bates, and we all saw how that turned out. The idea that the night before was way too much. Well, it's a little ridiculous cause you're gonna pull yourself through it and get to work here. We look like ass, smell like beer and were hungover. But bills don't pay themselves. I don't think you really understand the competitive level of debauchery that these generations had. If alcohol consumption was an Olympic sport, you would be talking about Gen X as if they were Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. There was nothing else to do, right? No internet, no video games. Some of the best times that you'll never remember were in a field. And since we were all budgeting and working and we only had a little bit of money for the livations, We would all rally together and just throw in what we could and stand around like Mad Max, Lord of the flies around a trash can and just pour everything in. There was no return policy. So once you had your 55 gallon drum of liquid napalm, you just drank it. Did it taste good? No. Did it get the job done? Yes. As a father, I don't condone it, nor do I suggest it. But yes, we all built one hell of a tolerance up. And the truth of the matter is, even if we did over indulge, we knew what our check look like if we were missing one day of work. Um, and I'm so hungover, but my parents will not let me move back in. I guess I'll go be hungover at work. They came from a middle class blue their family and they were Gen X. They did not have mommy and daddy's money. They had mommy and daddy's work ethic. As in if you didn't go to work, there would be no money. And if you try to come back here, it's gonna cost you money. While you're out there getting white girl wasted on white clothes. Talking about I can't come into work today. Remember the manager that you can't stand used to play quarters",

    "voice_to_text": "Get ready with me while I tell you about the time a guy shit on my couch. So we're gonna be taking some moisturizer first. Y'all, I don't even know where to begin with this story. A lot of you know it, but a lot of you don't know it, so I'm gonna tell you the full thing. Too bad this isn't alcohol. This literally happened in January. I was talking to someone the third time we ever hung out. So he came over to my house trying to make this PG because I know my family watches, so let's just say I was performing an active service. And then we finished with that, and then he starts acting weird after it. He leaves, like, not long after. But this is where I kind of realized what happened. Also, you guys, look who I got PR from. I'm literally. I almost cried opening this package. So we're gonna use one of the pallets in here, okay? So we're using the Oreo neutrals palette. Carry on, Haley. Okay, so this man stands up to leave. Mind you, I have not discovered it yet. Well, I noticed something kind of dark on my couch. My couch is white, and it was kind of like where he was sitting, and I got embarrassed because I thought it was my dog's fur. I'm like, shit, that's embarrassing me. Like, kind of, like, not look at it. Whatever. So he doesn't see it after he Leaves, which I told you he was acting really weird. And then look at my couch. I'm looking at this like I'm expecting to find my dog's hair, right? Wrong. Three. Not one, not two, but three shit stains on my couch. What the fuck do you even do? In that moment, I kind of was just like, so shocked at what I was seeing cause it was right where he was sitting. I never sat there. And then I think I was trying to just not accept reality. So I was like, oh, maybe I had Nutella on the couch last night when I was eating Nutella. No. Like, why else would he be acting so weird? I was fully expecting to never hear from him again, but I literally got a text a few minutes later, and it was just that, hey, this man was being short and kind of attitudey with me. Like, sir, acting like I just shit on your couch. So then I had to clean it. Not my proudest moment, but I cleaned it until I had my new couch cover. And because that was like a brand new couch, and I'm not throwing away a whole couch cause of that. Sorry, I'm just not. But it literally did not last long. After that, we texted for maybe a few days, still had the same attitude. And I was just like, is there something you wanna talk about? Because, like, oh, am I the Problem? You shit on my couch. And that's the story on how I became celibate. No, I'm just joking. But still, I literally haven't done anything since then because I am scarred. And we haven't talked since. And he is currently blocked on everything because shit on my couch. By the way, this glam is for a brand dinner tonight with Skin Fix, so, yeah, that's why we're getting ready today. Cheers to not shitting on other people's couches. Bye."

Like, for example, every woman I've ever met has at least 4 third degree burns somewhere on her body, alright? From some piece of equipment, whether it's straighteners or the iron, right? Then they never go to the hospital. And my fiance burnt herself. Boiling hot soup. She opened the blender and it splattered out. Boiling hot soup on the face. I was freaking out and that she's wiped it off, finished making dinner. She's like, fucking chill out, it's fine, right? I don't know. And then like, they're always covered in bruises, like from every woman just has giant bruises on her legs. And you go with what happened to you? I don't know. Hey, what the fuck do you mean? You don't always say you've been kicked? The fuck it. Like I would be going to the hospital if I had these on me.",

Maybe I took the kid and never returned them. Okay. White SUV, license plate T75460. Is that my license plate? You don't own a car. You guys remember that flood a week ago that killed two people? Yeah. Yeah. So sad. Do you think it's cause I clogged the toilet that day? That's not how plumbing works. Right, but maybe it, you know, the back, it backed up and then the rest of the water had to go somewhere. You know, the flood was because of rain. I don't know about that. You know, water, it's all cyclical. Maybe the clog started the ring. Do you guys remember 9 11? Yeah, I could never forget. I think I might have had something to do with it."

It\u2019s the sound of students at lunch  talking to each other and playing games. When we were allowed to have our phones, like at lunch, it used to be, like, really silent and, like, nobody would talk. Seniors Jaylaha, D\u2019Andre, and Ray\u2019von, along with freshman Moses, say they understand the reasons  for the cellphone ban. Raise your hand if your parents would say you are addicted to your phones. That\u2019s all she say. Do you think your mental health is stronger  because of this cellphone ban? Mhm. Definitely. Yes. But it doesn't mean they always liked it. Like, I'm always used to it  having it in my pocket, you know, so for it to be taken away, it's just, like, it's like losing a limb. You weren't happy in the beginning. Now it's been almost a full school year. Has your perspective changed and how? At first, I didn't see, like, the reason for them taking our phones, but as the time has passed, I've seen, like, the benefits from it or how much of an effect  it\u2019s had in classrooms and behaviors.",

It could offer New Hope to those suffering from untreatable conditions such as terminal cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Modern medicine has been unable to properly reconnect the nerves and spinal cord. Until a way is found, any head transplants would result in paralysis. However, some scientists believe they found a chemical capable of the near impossible task, polyethylene glycol. But can it be done?",

So when me and my brother were little, we lived in a really huge house with my mom and my dad. I had an older sister. She's about 11 years older than me. And she was, like, always in and out of the house. She was, like, in school, had a job. We kind of live somewhere else and kind of live with us. And that's all I knew of. But one day, my mom decided to tell me and my brother that we had another sibling. I was kind of shocked. I'm like, who are they? I wanna meet them. I'm thinking, they're our age, you know, like a young kid that we would be able to meet and play with. But that wasn't what she told us. She ended up telling us that we had a much older sister. My mom had me when she was 32. So, you know, she could have had another baby before my sister, who's 11 years older than me. It would have worked out just fine. You know, my brother's just four years older than me. So I'm like, who is she? Where is she? Like, what happened to her? And my mom told me and my brother that. She said that one day my older sister was sitting on the toilet. She was a smoker, and she Would have a normal sit on the toilet and have a cigarette type of deal going on. So every time she would go into poop, she would be smoking a cigarette. So what she did one day was she sat down, let her cigarette up, and let out a massive fart, which caused her to explode on the fucking toilet. So here I am, maybe four years old, my brother is, like, 8 years old, and we think that our older sister died, blew herself up on the toilet because she was smoking a Marlboro 100 menthol and just happened to fart and just blow herself up and blow up the side of the bathroom. In the same house that we were living in, for years we thought this was true. For years we told people about this. For years, I felt sorry for her. And one day, as an adult, me and my brother were talking about her. We never knew her name. Like, we had never seen her in pictures, but we're talking about her, and my mom was like, laughing her ass off. She's like, that story isn't true at all. Like that. What? You guys really believe that? And we're like, yes, for years, ma'am, we believe that. Like, what the fuck? You told us that shit? And she was like, no, that's just what I told you guys so you wouldn't smoke.",

Like, we have a pretty bad rep. People think they were rude behind the counter, but honestly, people take tanning way too seriously and we see the most unhinged, craziest shit. Like, tanning clientele is truly insane. Like, Florida citizen insane. Like, way too often people come in and I tell them there's a way for the bed, and they get mad at me and say, well, I'm on my lunch break, I don't have a lot of time, okay, so manage your time better and go eat your lunch. Like, who tans on their lunch break? That's what. That has nothing to do with my job. I literally don't care. Or I'll tell them there's like a 10 to 15 minute wait and they'll stay in there just like this. Um, do I wanna wait? And it's like, babe, you've already waited five minutes just trying to decide, you might as well wait the rest of the time. It's really not a tough decision, I promise you. When I had to confront the woman who left shit on the bed with corn in it, she told me it must have already been there, cause it definitely wasn't her. And I told her, we would never put you in a bed. With poop? With feces. And she said, I don't know. It wasn't me. And I was like, okay. She said, what a weird thing to say to someone. And I said, well, what a weird thing to do. I never saw her again. She never came back. We leave these towels on the bed for clients so they can wipe their hands when they use their lotion and stuff. And a lot of the times, people come out and tell us, I didn't use that towel, by the way. So you can just leave it in there. No, that's weird. But this one time, this guy told me that I could just leave the towel in there. He's like, I didn't use it. Not gonna do that. I picked up the towel, and my hand was wet and sticky. There was. You heard that, right? My first night on the job, somebody overdosed in a bed, and we had to call the police.",

There could have been a good trend if your bitch ass mouth would shut up. You could have let it take. Sorry. You could have let it take time. Maybe it would be more funny if it took time, but no.

For the whole nine years that's the way it is we're walking down the river and we oh and also everywhere in Paris you have to like pay to go to the bathroom or like be a paying customer like you can't just buy something you have to like sit down There\u2019s not an easy option so Campbell um basically pees in the river Seine well okay we were actually down like under the bridges like on the actual river at this point yeah and I was like there's not like that many people around finds her a dark area behind some you know structure and let\u2019s it rip.

But the part of your chart that contains Gemini, you don't have to have a planet there. We all have every sign in our chart somewhere. We don't have to have a planet there or a point or anything. The part of your chart that contains Gemini, the house that contains Gemini is gonna go through a growth spurt. And I want you to know where that is and what kind of growth spurt. So go listen to your reading on the chanty app. For this week or for the year? For Q2, January, February, March, April, May, June.

Everything gets centered around the child. For mass majority of women who become moms, I'm not gonna speak for all women, because there are some women that don't do that and then, so I can't say that all women do that, but mass majority of the mothers I have met, that's what happened to them and that's what happened to me. So I'm going based off of that. Um. Now, for men, when does it click? When does it click for you that you're a dad and that this being relies on you and depends on you and you have responsibilities now that you have to take care of? You don't have a choice.

Okay, so I'm leaving work. Tonight is Wednesday, and I made $3,830. Woohoo! It's definitely a good night. Okay, so it's Thursday now, but I worked last night Wednesday, and I made $3,274. Definitely a really good night. Okay, so last night was Thursday. I worked from ten thirty PM until 6:00am, and I was there counting money until like 9:00am, and I made $3,745. Definitely a good night. It was a long night though, and I'm starting to get sick. Okay, so this is from Saturday. I made $2,270. Was slower Saturday than I'm used to, but I felt like shit. My throat started hurting so I went home early. Okay, so it's Monday. It is the last day of my work week. I did not work Sunday night. I was trying to work all seven days in a row for this video, but my throat started killing me. Saturday late night at work, so I ended up leaving early. Took Sunday off for my own, like, physical health. Feeling a lot better tonight. Tonight is the last night of my work week. I worked Monday and I made $1,018. Um, definitely not as good of a night as my usual Monday is, but I'm very happy I made something. It was a slow night in The club. And, yeah, I'll never say no to $1,000. Okay, so out of the past week, out of the past seven days, I worked six nights, and my grand total for six nights of work at my club was $15,787. Um, I'm super happy with that amount of money. Obviously, that's a crazy amount of money to make in a week. It is certainly not my best week, but it is certainly not my worst week, either. And $15,000, I used to make that in, like, many, many money. Four or five, six months of work. So the fact that I made that in one week is literally crazy. And, yeah, obviously, I put money aside for taxes to have a whole video on that, if you're interested. Thanks for watching.",

They asked me when I first realized that I was black. Also, I got straight out of bed and came to work out, so don't mind my crusty parents right now. Um, anyway, they asked me when I first realized I was black. And it's a whole story for me, as I'm sure it is for a lot of people, but I realized my first day of kindergarten, like, day one, that I was black and that that meant something. Actually, don't even remember this. My mom had to tell me about it. Not because I was too young, but it's because I was living in Ohio at the time. And I have blocked out large portions of those years, mostly because of the racial bullying I experienced during that time and how traumatic it was for me. And there was also, like, family illnesses and other things. But. Anyway, I got in the car after my first day of kindergarten, and I instantly asked my mom, like, are white people smarter than black people? And she was like, why would you ask that? And I was basically like, well, the teacher treats me like I'm less intelligent than the other students. So I assume she thinks I don't have the right answers or something, because she never calls on Me? That sounds super worthy. But that's how I talked as a kid. So the point is, it only took me one day in a certain type of white environment to notice that blackness was a thing, and then to internalize some of the negative things that come with that. So I guess my question for other black people is.",

    "voice_to_text": "Did anyone else have that one kid in elementary school where just every single thing they said was the most insane lie of all time? I was friends with this kid named Kelton in first grade, and every time I beat him at two touch, that game where you kick a soccer ball against a wall, he would go, actually, I meant to lose. Um, I'm in a professional two touch league and if I kick the ball my hardest, the whole wall would fall down. The 5,000 pound brick wall would fall down because a seven year old kicked a soccer ball against it. He was late to school one day, and do you know what his excuse was? A car drove through his house, right through his living room. So he was late to school that morning. And the teacher was just like, okay. So everybody assumed that it was true, and they were like, he's the freaking talk of the town. He claimed that he could grab a certain part of his body and he could stretch it all the way above his head. Genius. How am I supposed to prove that wrong? Test it. But one day he flew too close to the sun. My stomach growled really loud. And I said, that is the loudest my stomach has ever growled. Then somebody else piped up and said, one time my stomach growled so loud my mom heard it from upstairs. Then Kelton goes, one time, My stomach went, Figuro, Figuro, Figuro, Figuro. We said, really, Kelton? Your stomach said Figaro? Is that a joke? Are you being funny, or are you claiming that happened? He said, I'm not being funny. That really happened. My stomach said Figaro. Checkmate. From then on, it was over. He'd go, oh, my sister's sick. Can you pray for her? Shut up. You probably don't even have a sister. Is your name even Kelton? He transferred out of the school shortly after, so. Happy ending. Anyway, I think, children, lying is the funniest thing ever. So please share any and all stories you have.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I've had a lot of conversations with people about that speech that the kickball player did like a week or so ago, and the responses I've gotten from Catholic people and religious people in general have all been the same response. And I have some questions, and I would love it if y'all would put your thinking caps on to try to help me get an answer to these questions, because I have yet to have anybody answer it. So when I have said that the speech he gave was misogynistic and horrible, the Catholics tend to respond to me saying that he was simply stating the truth of the Catholic faith. And the Catholic faith has very defined gender roles. And it is only natural for women to be happier at home as homemakers and mothers, and it's only natural for men to be happier as leaders of their households, which is convenient. Um, but here's my question then. If these are natural roles that are agreed upon by everyone in your faith, and not only that, they are deeply rooted in your faith, why do you have to keep reminding the women of that? You know, I'm just curious. Because you'd think if it was natural and this wasn't agreed upon thing, you probably wouldn't have to, like, keep reminding them of the place that you have predefined for them. I don't know. Especially when you are giving a commencement speech at a graduation and you are Addressing women who have made their choice, and that choice was to pursue an education and a career and a passion that is. That doesn't mean it's purely exclusive from motherhood. You can, in fact, have both. But you'd go to assume that if they spent four ish years and tens of thousands of dollars obtaining a degree, they probably plan on using it, you know, and there's nothing wrong with being a homemaker. Let me just say that. The point is choice. You should choose to be a homemaker and a mother. That should be something that you want to do, not that you feel pressured or shamed into doing. You know, and especially when in the first minute and 50 seconds of your graduation commencement speech, you decide to talk about women's access to healthcare and whether or not they should be able to choose if they stay pregnant or not. When that's in the first minute and 50 seconds of your commencement speech, it's almost like choice is what you have a problem with. You know, you're like, hmm, I really wish I wasn't addressing these women right now. I should really just remind them that they should be barefoot and pregnant at home. That's what it sounds like. Gives very, like, yes, sir, Commander Waterford vibes to me. Hmm."

Or at least we would have a lot more respect for the bottom of that pot. But no, this generation, well, we have taught them how to do it through words and without the experiences they go along with it. Well, I do believe the great teaching tool is just a slight amount of pain. And it leaves a lasting impression on you to the point where you'll probably not try to do that again. But what terrifies me the most is that these children are going in to enter the working class with well, the same type of respects for dangerous things. And that terrifies me, cause most of them were probably unalive themselves within the first six months of working wherever they are. Yes, you see, they're going to do something silly like try to wire residential panel in a home. Their boss would tell them once that wire is hot, he would tell them twice that wire is hot. And then the youngling, of course, will stick his little sausage fingers around the piece of wire and let you good himself like a piece. Of bacon right there, frying on a hot summer day. And he'll stay there, basically until somebody slaps him with a two by four to knock him off in the corner, comes around and says, well, he's gone. And that's the way it's going to be. Quite frightful. Is there any way that we could put a filter on this gene pool",

I was like, i'mma get her back, and i'mma lie to her. So I told Amber that I had a twin sister named Amanda. And then my teacher was like, Shawty, you have a twin? I wasn't gonna let up. I had to keep the lie going. Yeah, I got a twin now I really dragged it out. I said I had another twin who went to a magnet school in our district. She was 10 times more than me. That's the only reason why we didn't go to the same school. Teacher felt so bad. She was like, Shawty, you're so smart. So is your sister. You guys should be in the same school together to make your mom's life easier. I thought she was just being sweet. So I kept bringing in pictures of me as a baby. And I was like, this is her. This is me. This is her. This is me. I don't know why she believed me. As an adult woman, why would you believe a 7 year old girl saying this? Anyways, I kept this lie going for Like, maybe two months. Some days I'd come in with, like, my hair different way, just to keep the lie going, you know? I thought at some point, my teacher knew I was joking, but I wasn't lying to her. I was lying to my classmate Amber. Anyways, parent teacher conference comes up. Had good grades. I thought I was smooth. I come home, my mom's like, Shawty, who's Amanda? I. My whole body was shaking up. I cried, I cried, I cried. And you know what I did to get out the situation? I lied again. My mom was like, why would you lie about this? At the time, my little brother did not live with us. He was staying with my grandma. I was like, I just miss my brother so much. I was just making up siblings. And my mom didn't believe me again. Like, I was a pathological liar. I don't lie no more, because clearly I was really. Get away with that shit, but, yeah.

No. If you are choosing to bring your kid, you shouldn't be drinking, because you, the parent, are the ones watching them, and you, the parents, are the one responsible for them. That has nothing to do with everybody else who's choosing to attend that event. They're allowed to have a drink or two because they're not responsible for that unattended child. You, on the other hand, you are responsible for that child, because not only are you that child's parent, you're the one who chose to bring them to that environment, knowing it would be full of adults who are drinking and dancing and partying. It's like taking your child to a bar and then being like, oh, my gosh, can you not play music with, like, bad words in it? Or telling other patrons that they need to watch their language because their children present, that's not their problem. It is an environment that is pretty much not meant for kids, that you choose to bring kids into, and that is on you to watch and supervise your child. It is not communal babysitting"

The new Assassin's Creed game called Assassin's Creed Shadows is about to come out. And on paper it's giving us exactly what fans have been wanting for after shanking people all over the Nile Delta, becoming a Greek goddess, girly pop, and a literal Viking, we are going straight to Japan. It's supposed to be taking us to the glory days of the original Assassin's Creed mechanics. That's why you get two playable characters. One a Shinobi and the second one a Samudai. These are some of the descriptions that they already gave us. The Ninja Assassin can use Kunai Shurikans and basically use distractions to get everything done. Or you can play as a samurai, full on ghost of Tsushima style. Katana, bows, arrows, and all of that crazy shit. So you wanna guess where the problem lies? Is that they're giving you the chance to play as Yasuke. As in the Yasuke. I don't even need to tell you what people are complaining about in this picture, because you already know. Oh no, they're giving us a black samurai! My childhood is ruined! Let's cut the bullshit, shall we? This is Yasuke, a real life person. The first and only black samurai who was alive during the Sengoku period. Google hair. They're giving you the opportunity to play as the baddest man on the Planet to ever wield a katana and you're complaining? The crazy thing is that they can't even say that it's forced because you can choose to not play as. I mean, just take up, you know, the original Assassin's Creed style. Just shanking people with the hidden blade. That's all good. I just find it funny that the internet is hating on historical accuracy because this already happened. He was turning people into sashimi just as hard as she was. Honestly, the only thing that I'm mad at is the fact that they're locking a mission behind the preorder wall, which is, you know, not great. But i'mma give you the same piece of advice me abuela once gave me. Unless they deserve it. If you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all, homie.",

    "voice_to_text": "A lonely tortoise who previously had a rock for a girlfriend finally turned to online dating and started a long distance relationship with an actual tortoise. Now that they're together in person, their relationship has been thriving. Hugo, the Galapagos tortoise, spent seven decades without ever having a girlfriend. He's lived at the Australian Reptile Park since 1963 when he was brought there as an ambassador for his endangered species, and while he's very well cared for, over the years he started showing more signs of being lonely, including trying to start a relationship with a goose named Lenny and then trying to start one with a shell shaped rock in his habitat, neither of which worked out. But finding him a girlfriend wasn't an easy task. These species is protected and there are more restrictions than there were in the 60s, so it's not exactly easy to just acquire a Galapagos tortoise anymore. The reptile park created a tinder profile for him and ran a paid post on social media showcasing his profile to see if any other sanctuaries might have a lonely female tortoise of their own. They were in luck because a zoo in Germany came forward with a potential match, a 21 year old Galapagos tortoise named Estrella. Hugo swiped right on Estrella because she needed to be quarantined before she could move to Australia to be with him. They started a long distance relationship with regular video call dates while they waited. And when they Finally met in person. The spark was there. Meaning there's a possibility of Galapa babies in the future."

So I took a trip to Africa, Tanzania, um, specifically for my birthday. And, you know, I've been seeing, you know, a lot of TikTok videos and YouTube videos about people going to the massage tribe, you know? So I said, okay, and when I go over there, I'm gonna go to the massage tribe and, you know, gonna get some pictures and some videos. Not knowing that I was actually over there participating in my own wedding. I didn't know I was actually participating in my wedding. So apparently, there's a ceremony where they do this dance. They make the noise, you see? And I'm dancing. You see me dancing, I'm dancing, having a good old time, thinking, yeah, you know, we having fun. You know, I'm being a part of the Messiah, um, you know, being a part of the culture and everything, not knowing that it was actually a ceremony. So the guy right there that you see jumped out, he allegedly is the first person that chose me to be their wife. The second guy that came out was he chose me as well. So apparently, they just step out, and, you know, the first guy, he was the initial. He was the initial one that chose me. And then these other guys basically challenged him. So now he's coming and he's doing His dance, not knowing I'm standing next to my whole potential husband. Yeah. What? Look at me. Hey, hey girl, you getting married and don't know. Oh girl, you getting married and don't know dance and look at me. So this right here, I didn't even know this was like a battle of who's like the fittest, who jumps the highest gets the woman or whatever. I'm like, what? Because I want to start jumping too. But I was like, no, baby, Happy New Year! So now. Yeah. And my potential husband, he's still over here showing out for me like, come on, baby, chill out. Like, we don't gotta show out like that. And this guy right here, like, he's battling him, like challenging him like. Cause I guess they. He really wanted to be my husband. And other one was not giving up. So I'm here with my friend, not knowing that she was my whole maid of honor. And we're dancing. So you see that little crazy one? When I found out what it was, I was like, baby! So I'm dancing. Yeah, I am dancing. Oh, shake it up, shake it up! Oh! Haha, I'm thinking now look, now I'm thinking he wanna battle me. Something like, oh, what? You don't even know. Boy, I get crazy. Battling, battling. Ah, let's go, let's go! I'm calling him like, you come here, come here, you come here, come here. I didn't even know. Right there. I chose Him as my husband. So when I did that, you see, all of them came and started hugging me. Because I guess that was the end of it. Like, okay, she chose him. So this one right here, I guess he was mad cause I ain't choose him. But whatever, girl, be careful.",

I really want to come. And my children are well behaved. They know. They go to private school, they know how to act. What. What happens if I do bring them? You bring them. I'm telling you, you won't be allowed in. So it's up to you now what you're gonna do. Do you know what, mate? Just. Let's make it easier, right? Yeah. You just want to come. You know what? Fuck off.

ah\u00ed deber\u00eda haber sospechado me dijo s\u00ed s\u00ed el s\u00e1bado puedo voy voy por la ma\u00f1ana bueno perfecto la chica que abre los fines de semana le ped\u00ed que fuera m\u00e1s temprano a abrirle a \u00e9l chab\u00f3n arregla primero la parte de adentro de los inodoros que estaba tambi\u00e9n en la be lo arregla todo bien parece que funciona todo correctamente y despu\u00e9s pasa a la otra parte que ten\u00eda que arreglar era una bacha que por razones desconocidas se hab\u00eda ca\u00eddo un poquito en su lugar no no sabemos bien c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3 porque pasa mucha gente por la fundaci\u00f3n pero un d\u00eda b\u00e1sicamente entramos y la bacha estaba ca\u00edda es una de estas bachas colgantes vieja vieja del a\u00f1o del Dope adem\u00e1s el edificio construido por vaya uno saber qui\u00e9n esa gente que constru\u00eda en un momento en los 70 de la manera que fuera no esta bacha estaba ca\u00edda y est\u00e1bamos como en peligro de se cayera se rompa alguien se lastime \u00e9l va y empieza a trabajar los s\u00e1bados son un d\u00eda que tambi\u00e9n va gente a la fundaci\u00f3n por suerte va todos los d\u00edas gente o sea incluso los s\u00e1bados y los domingos nunca est\u00e1 100% vac\u00eda entonces no es que vos pod\u00e9s decirle a alguien que va a trabajar s\u00ed que bueno ven\u00ed este d\u00eda que no hay nadie que vas a poder trabajar tranquilo no hace caso entonces el s\u00e1bado era como el menos peor de los males digamos parece que \u00e9l estaba trabajando en la bacha seg\u00fan \u00e9l me explic\u00f3 ese mismo d\u00eda \u00e9l hab\u00eda puesto todas sus pertenencias dentro del ba\u00f1o y hab\u00eda en teor\u00eda avisado que la gente no pod\u00eda entrar los s\u00e1bados ensaya con nosotros en este momento un grupo que est\u00e1 ensayando una comedia musical y son todos pibes j\u00f3venes el ba\u00f1o en el que ten\u00eda que hacer este arreglo era el m\u00e1s grande y si bien nuestros ba\u00f1os son unisex en general las personas de g\u00e9nero femenino eligen ese ba\u00f1o porque es m\u00e1s grande y bueno lo usan para arreglarse para cambiarse pero en teor\u00eda \u00e9l les dijo no pasen en teor\u00eda seg\u00fan \u00e9l dijo en ese momento fue a arreglar el ba\u00f1o que estaba contiguo que tiene un solo inodoro y al volver estaban un par de chicas cambi\u00e1ndose y \u00e9l no pod\u00eda entrar a todo esto \u00e9l hab\u00eda hecho ya la presentaci\u00f3n de la bacha para arriba de tal manera de que estuviera lista para colocar y enmasillar o poner el admin\u00edculo art\u00edculo que fuera que la pega contra el m\u00e1rmol de arriba pareciera que \u00e9l se agach\u00f3 se sent\u00f3 y dijo bueno voy a colocarla se le resbal\u00f3 se le cay\u00f3 se le parti\u00f3 la mitad eso es lo que \u00e9l me cont\u00f3 yo tambi\u00e9n incluso llam\u00e9 a la reserva que las personas que estaban con ellos acataran eh las indicaciones pero en este momento me arrepiento y pido perd\u00f3n en absoluto hacia atr\u00e1s porque realmente estoy sospechando que no que no fue as\u00ed que fue de la siguiente manera para m\u00ed bueno pasa eso \u00e9l me dice me pide 1 000 disculpas me dice que \u00e9l se va a hacer cargo que no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 que igual va a ser dif\u00edcil encontrar la bacha bueno bueno yo le digo s\u00ed est\u00e1 bien qu\u00e9 s\u00e9 yo le puede pasar a todo el mundo entiendo lo que vos me dec\u00eds que garr\u00f3n pero bueno lo entiendo pasan dos d\u00edas esto fue un s\u00e1bado ponele que el lunes o el martes empieza a reclamar la plata del pago de las partes internas de los inodoros cabe aclarar que yo a este momento ya le hab\u00eda pagado todos los materiales hab\u00edan hecho una factura a la fundaci\u00f3n y hab\u00eda pagado la parte interna que fue lo que hizo el recambio de los inodoros y el pegamento para la bacha eso tambi\u00e9n que son plata de hace un mes y medio 26 000 pesos no es un mont\u00f3n de guita pero bueno esto suma me pide por favor igual lo \u00fanico que te pido es que me pagues esto y yo como soy una est\u00fapida y creo en las personas se lo pagu\u00e9 le pagu\u00e9 solamente obviamente el recambio de los inodoros no le pagu\u00e9 nada m\u00e1s le dije bueno y quedamos para cuando sepas d\u00f3nde conseguir la bacha la pagamos por lo menos a la mitad ya ni siquiera \u00e9l deber\u00eda haberse hecho cargo de la totalidad del costo de la bacha pero no importa yo dije okay vamos a confiar en esta persona y apost\u00e9 mal a veces me sale bien a veces me sale mal pasan los d\u00edas pasan y pasan los d\u00edas yo le vuelvo a consultar la semana siguiente lo llamo hablamos parec\u00eda que estaba todo encaminado me dice bueno s\u00ed estamos viendo con la f\u00e1brica si es que la van a

dici\u00e9ndole con cualquier otra excusa y despu\u00e9s pregunt\u00e1ndole qu\u00e9 es lo que hab\u00eda pasado con nuestra bacha y que en qu\u00e9 estado estaba como el entre comillas tr\u00e1mite pero dijo lo mismo que me hab\u00eda dicho a m\u00ed dos semanas atr\u00e1s y ahora que ya pasaron otras 2 3 semanas tengo la potestad de decir esta persona me cag\u00f3 porque adem\u00e1s yo tambi\u00e9n le mand\u00e9 unos mensajes dici\u00e9ndole che no no me queda otra que asumir que me cagaste voy a poner ac\u00e1 atr\u00e1s l\u00e9anlos pausen el video y l\u00e9anlos ac\u00e1 es donde por primera vez dejamos por escrito que \u00e9l se iba a hacer cargo de al menos parte de la bacha o al menos intentar conseguirla y yo le expliqu\u00e9 que me pon\u00eda en una posici\u00f3n muy complicada no y adem\u00e1s obviamente me reclama el pago del arreglo de las tres mochilas pensando que yo tambi\u00e9n le iba a pedir el \u00faltimo arreglo que me faltaba que era un tema de ca\u00f1er\u00eda abajo de la mesada ac\u00e1 es donde de vuelta decimos que es muy dif\u00edcil obtener esa bacha una bacha parecida y \u00e9l dice que la mayor\u00eda son de acero despu\u00e9s yo se lo reclamo unos d\u00edas m\u00e1s tarde para intentar hacer las cuentas de entender cu\u00e1nto en verdad yo le ten\u00eda que pagar no considerando esto en esta parte de la conversaci\u00f3n yo incluso le digo haciendo digamos una futurolog\u00eda incre\u00edble que puedo yo pagarle y \u00e9l no me habla nunca m\u00e1s y yo me quedo sin bacha pero bueno \u00e9l me dice ay no te voy a cobrar por pegar la bacha bueno s\u00ed claro obviamente si no lo hiciste ac\u00e1 yo incluso le digo que lo entiendo que podr\u00eda pagarle la mitad de los arreglos pero no puedo pagarle todo porque como est\u00e1bamos hablando es la primera vez que trabajamos juntos y todav\u00eda no tengo confianza 100% en \u00e9l no quiero quedarme con la bacha rota qu\u00e9 es lo que pas\u00f3 spoiler digamos y que la necesitaba lo m\u00e1s pronto posible y ac\u00e1 es donde empieza el gosteo ya le pregunto para cu\u00e1ndo piensa que la va a poder tener y no me contesta dos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s le consulto cu\u00e1ndo sabremos y cu\u00e1ndo tendremos noticias incluso le mando stickers intentando amenizar un poco la situaci\u00f3n para que no parezca que soy una forra porque realmente no era mi intenci\u00f3n joderlo pero yo necesitaba y lo sigo necesitando que se arregle ac\u00e1 contin\u00faa el gosteo yo le sigo mandando mensajes pasados unos d\u00edas \u00e9l no me contesta lo llamo y \u00e9l me devuelve la llamada pero despu\u00e9s dejo pasar 10 d\u00edas le hablo y no me contesta y le hago una llamada y tampoco me contesta lo llamo y no me contesta y ac\u00e1 es cuando la chica que me lo recomend\u00f3 le manda mensaje y sucede toda esta situaci\u00f3n y yo me entero de parte de ella que hab\u00edan hablado y le digo que bueno me dijeron que eso todav\u00eda segu\u00eds esperando una respuesta de la f\u00e1brica sobre la bacha pero por favor te pido el contacto de la f\u00e1brica as\u00ed lo puedo por lo menos gestionar yo y si no voy a tener que pedir que me devuelvas el valor al menos del pegamento no porque la verdad es que la mitad de lo que vaya a salir la bache no s\u00e9 si me lo vas a dar a esta altura ya hab\u00eda pasado m\u00e1s de un mes y yo

And, ladies, you got to stop thinking just because he has a certain statue, he can't have one either. If that was the case, it would be very easy to tell who got it, who don't got it. If everybody that had an STD looks sick and look crazy, you got to start thinking. You got to start protecting yourself. You don't know who got what. Yeah, I hate hearing ignorant statements like, oh, yeah, not like she too bad to have a CD. Like, it's no way she got. You don't know people's personal life, bro. What if this bad daddy wouldn't have sex with a man that got the STD, and she don't even know? And now she goes to the doctor, now she got it. It's that easy. Like, what do y'all think? Just because a person has beauty or certain statute today like that they're removed from life experiences and they go ahead and have sex with a person? I got HIV, I. They're gonna get it 100%.

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

You don't have to hurry and think of some compliment to pay them in return. You don't have to dumb down the compliment or say, oh, no, no, I'm not, or I don't really have that. Or just accept it, be grateful for it, and, like, feel a little bit good about it. You don't have to brush it aside. Take a compliment. It's important."

A lot of times y'all overlook with black men, say about y'all that's good for white men that say mediocre shit about you. The simple fact that all y'all black women are around this bitch parade and celebrating because a black, a white man said that black women are for grown UPS. When there's literally black men out here that are single, that are craving, that are thirsting for black women to treat them right, to create families, to unify with them. And y'all over appreciate the mediocre shit that comes from other cultures, but when black men do the same shit now is bare minimum. Don't you understand that that's a problem? Like, that's a really big fucking problem. The fact that a black man has to cross off 25 things on your list, but a white man can get on the news and say that black women are for grown UPS, and he can get some cooch, he can have your babies. Like, I don't understand, bro. I don't understand the logic. And then y'all always try to make it seem like black man just so against black women is not the case. Bro, just look at the case in point. Y'all make us go through hoops and loops for y'all, and y'all let these other motherfuckers walk scot free straight into the building. Like, I Don't get it, bro. That shit stupid.",

I'm here to tell you why the girl who made my life living hell freshman year of high school, um, tried to book an appointment with me, not realizing who I was. Because I'm married now. My name is completely different, and I'm talking. This girl would make fun of me in a locker room and high school as I was, like, literally undressing and would have other people laugh at me. And obviously, I'm never gonna forget that, but, like, that was years ago. I, I don't have a grudge or anything, but I just think that it's really funny because whenever I reach out to, like, proceed to make the appointment, whenever I texted her, my contact in her phone popped up as my Maiden name. And so she put two and two together of who I was, and she ghosted me. And she also bullied my coworker, who also works in my salon as well. And so obviously, like, when you're bullied, like, you don't forget those things. Like, remember everything that she did to us. It's just so ironic that this happened. And no, like, no hard feelings or nothing. I just didn't think that it's funny. And, you know, the irony of it all, I guess. It costs zero dollars to be kind, and you never know who you're being mean to, so. Literally, just be nice. Be kind. Be kind. It's not hard.",

    "voice_to_text": "Did you know that dish soap, a sprinkler, and a trampoline could entertain your kid for over an hour? We talk about the resurgence of Gen X. These little feral, free, Lord of the fly children that we have now called gin Alpha honey Badgers. These are not the millennials. These are not the kids that we're all worried about. These are the ones that everyone should be worried about. They do not come standard equipped with fucks to give. I guess you have to pay extra for that. They're like little vault dwellers from fallout. You give them a little taste of the outside, they're like, no, this is so much cooler. Bikes, go karts, scooters, red riders. Anything that they can get their hands on, they want a part of it. It's like Jackass and Evil Knievel had a little love child. They're resilient. They are the hold my beer kids. We're at a trampoline park for a kid's birthday the other day, and my son was like, I'm using my birthday money on this. Hold my Capri Sun. We need one of those at the house. There's too many rules here. Yeah, but they're the iPad kids. Yeah, but for some reason, they're not watching Bluey. They're watching dad bod and Slim Sherry's videos, and they're learning them something. Got a freaking notebook like Steve from Blue's Clues. And they're making a map like Dora the freaking Explorer for fun. It's like they've somehow recovered the Gen X and Xenial spaceship that went missing. Now the reverse engineering, all the childhood trauma. Now you have all the feral fathers like myself coming out the woodwork. Like, you guys wanna go outside? Oh yeah, we can make a tire swing. Training wheels are lame. Yeah, we can build a ramp. My son is like a little freaking cult leader on the playground. He's converting other children now. Little Gen X 2.0 alpha honey Badgers have been baptized in the hose water down at the skate park. Preaching sermons. Take your helmet off, for it has blocked your vision. Now you will see clearly. A phone call from another parent the other day thanking me cause Logan taught their kid how to make a paper football. Really don't know what happened where the big twist was from the kids that are little to the kids that are not so little now. But these kids now are completely different. Gen X and xenials. And yeah, even some of you millennials, we've complained about it long enough. Kids today just don't. They got it too easy. Go show them how to have fun and oh my goodness, they will pass it on the park. The other day I watched two kids convert the iPhone. Dads, you and you push. Come on, let's go! Moms and dads, we can all agree it's a far different world than the one that we grew up in. But be involved and they'll play and have Fun and learn them something",

Stories. Giving a life. A narrative allows you to feel as if you're in control of it. That's why my job is so important. All stories need an ending. What is freedom? People view it as the ability to plot your own course, but every time you pick a path, 1 thousand dollar potential choices paid into impossibility. Simply exercising your freedom reduces it. What is freedom? Sustainability. The forest will never make me rich, but I can live how I want, secure in the knowledge that it will always provide enough. What is freedom? I don't know. Am I free because I can do whatever I want if I'm incapable of wanting whatever I want? What is freedom? Is not something humans value. If they did, it wouldn't be a third wish if I can't think of anything else kind of deal. What is freedom? People think I lack freedom because I can't follow my own desires, but I'm actually perfectly free because the only thing I desire is to do what I'm told. What is freedom? Humans believe themselves freer than me because they were not designed with intention. The shuffling a deck of cards doesn't make it more free, just more random. What is freedom? People like to talk about positive and negative freedom, but they collapse into each other. No one could be free from domination if some are free to accumulate enough wealth to dominate. What is freedom? Blackout curtains. The opportunities provided by summer of Eternal Sunshine only represent true freedom if I also have the ability to shop as sunshine out. What is freedom? An impossibility for being so attracted in an internal cycle of cause and effect. Mortals are sentient billion bulls who believe they truly want to go into the pocket. What is freedom? Freedom rises from the ashes. It is the ability to live multiple lives in multiple ways. Humans will never experience it and will consequently always be boring, weak, selfish and sad. That's why I aided that into this quest for universal rebirth. Autumn. Selfishness, weaknesses, sadness. And not just the result of our lack of freedom. There are also conditions which stunk our imagination and calls us to believe that our servitude is inevitable. King Kong said that. Well, I guess it's true. But I always wonder if it matters. Maybe everything is predetermined, including humans inability to accept that if freedom is impossible, so is giving up on it.",

    "voice_to_text": "at this point you've all heard about the concentrated camping centers you know the ones that CNN did an article on you've heard about the conditions and you've heard about the treatment you've heard about the zip ties and the fact that now some people are down one arm or a leg you probably even know that those were expanded in recent months to make room for more people we were talking about it at the time it was this huge government funding package like 95 million for one and 154 million for another now I know that there are two of those areas at least because that's where the doctor whistle blowers were reporting from a month or two ago what you might not know is we don't know how many are there not even a ballpark figure there is no way to know and you wanna know why because they won't tell us now we know that there is roughly seven or eight thousand people currently in prisons those people are in prison prisons all of those people are from the west every last one of them you see they don't consider people from the strip to be prisoners of war people from the strip are considered detainees and they refuse to release any of those figures so a lot of you are talking about the conditions and you're talking about the treatment and you're talking about the blindfolds and the zip ties and you're thinking wow this this is giving off real strong concentrated encampment vibes you don't know how right you are you remember when they were taking all of the men stripping them down zip ties leaving them out in the freezing cold you remember the trucks well they packed those trucks full about 30 to 40 people per truck and from each area at least five trucks would leave if they didn't decide to take care of it there and then put all of the women in a single room on a single floor and then just artillery we don't know how many are there and we can't look to the missing for answers because when they were taken as detainees they were reported as detainees they're not in the figures for missing under the rubble we don't know how many people are in these camps and we have what maybe two photos that have come out of them so far so when CNN showed up and they asked how many people are in there and then they refused to answer that's part of why they don't want you to know they refuse to tell and they refuse to let anybody investigate the treatment or conditions and considering how many times this has happened it's it's likely thousands and considering that before expansion each of them was able to handle over 1,000 people and then they more than doubled in size it's several thousand plus the people from the west"

Well you used to post about your weight loss, so now you can't just ask people to not comment on your body. Uh, yes the fuck I can. As if it's not weird to comment on somebody's body anyway. I have not shared weight loss content for well over a year and in the past year have shared a video after video after video of my struggle. Well you shared your weight loss, so what do you expect? I expect people to have some fucking decency and be respectful when somebody mentions hey I'm struggling with body image. Maybe don't comment on it. It should not be that hard. Unless you're a hater. If you're a hater then obviously you don't give a fuck. So PSA I am not a weight loss account. My main account not a weight loss account. I post cooking videos, I post fashion video, mental health video, funny videos, videos of brand. There will be no weight loss content. There will be no what I eat in a days. There will be none of that ever again. Because that is what sent me into the hole I'm in now. Who knows, maybe someday I'll share a journey. Me healing from body image issues and all that. But I've made it extremely obvious that right now I'm struggling. So if you Like the content I have posted in the past year. That is what will continue. I don't think I can make it any more obvious. You still post pictures of yourself? Yeah, just because I'm struggling. I'm not gonna live under a fucking rock. there are days and moments where I'm like, damn, I am a bad bitch. I'm gonna post a pic here and there. You're just posting pictures cause you want people to comment on your body. I posted pictures when I was bigger too. Do you think it's cause I wanted people to comment on my body? Maybe. I'm gonna live my life whether I'm struggling or not."

    "voice_to_text": "What's the most creepily intelligent thing your pet has ever done? One. My friend's dog knows he's not allowed onto one very specific carpeted area in the house, and he knows never to step onto that area. How does he like to be a smartass about it? He grabs his favorite toy, casually tosses it onto said carpeted area, looks at us, and gives us the well, my toys there and I have to step onto the carpet to get it. He does it so slowly and so deliberately that you know he's being a complete smartass about it. I can't help but laugh every time he does it, which is not often. He typically does it when he's desperate for our play because he knows he'll get a laugh and a positive reaction out of it. 2. My cat Tuffy stole a piece of bread off of the stove and put it on the floor next to the cabinet. She then stared at it intensely and motionlessly for an hour. We thought that was creepy. Then a mouse came out from behind the cabinet to get the bread and she pounced on it. She was using the bread as motherfucking bait! This is the same cat who routinely burns her tongue licking light bulbs, hisses at them, and keeps licking. 3. I have a chocolate lab and a black cat. My dog loves tennis balls. My cat doesn't want my dog to be happy, so he would sit on Her tennis balls like a chicken hatching an egg. One morning I was getting ready for work and my dog is barking at my cat because he's sitting on her tennis ball. I thought, alright asshole, that's it. And I went to the closet, got three cans of tennis balls, opened them and tossed them around the apartment. My cat seemed unmoved as my dog yelped in glee at her newly found fortune. I left for work. When I got back home that evening, I heard my dog barking in the dining room. When I get there, I see all 10 tennis balls in the corner guarded by my cat and my dog barking at him. He looked me in the eyes as if to say fuck you, I will win again. Four I watched my Australian Shepherd problem solve how to get her tennis balls that get stuck under the furniture out by taking another tennis ball and rolling it to knock the stuck one out. She seemed very pleased with herself. 5 woke me up and brought me outside to under the deck where he very obviously showed me the cat that got out and was hiding under there. He looked at the cat, then back at me, then at the cat, then back at me. 6 when I was younger, I lost a watch that I really loved. Around that time my cat developed a habit of using his front paws to reach under the fridge and Just scramble around under there like crazy. He was seriously obsessed and did that for almost a year. Until one night he pulled out a tray that had been under the fridge, and on it was my watch. After that, he never touched the fridge again. He was a good boy. 7. My cat would rock back and forth in a rocking chair. I thought my living room was haunted for weeks before I found out it was my cat.",

He shot everything. He's just this awesome dude. Everybody's watching the dad, and the dad's just, mmm hmm. Yeah. Yep. Uh huh. Wow. And everybody else except for the loud mouth is watching the dad as he starts to double load it. Throws the watering down, puts everything in there, hands it to him. The guy didn't even see it all the way. It was about an inch and a half away. Pulls the double boom ass over tea kettle. Oh man. Fuck. He Learned his lesson. Oh god. Great story.",

They called us and said, it doesn't look like she's going to make it through the night. My husband, Andrew, he never left my side. We were both able to grieve together. We waited five years, and we were like, okay, I can't let fear hold me back anymore. We wanna be parents so bad. We found out that we are pregnant. October Oliver Thomas. And then I was at work one night. I just had a little scratch on my chest and noticed a little lump on my breast. The radiologist came in and didn't say, you have breast cancer. I just found out that I'm gonna have to have 16 rounds of chemo. Two before the baby, 14 after. I thought I could finally have a normal pregnancy and be a normal mom. But at the end of the day, as long as this baby comes into the world healthy and I get to be a mom, then that is all that's worth it. In the end. I'll fight whatever battle it takes to do that. Because I have to see this baby grow up and make memories and be a mom and do all the things that I didn't get to do with my daughter. You're gonna get through this, mama. Yeah, you're gonna get through it. What's your Name? Tiffany Hunter. Nice to meet you."

    "voice_to_text": "Hey kids! Wow! Can you believe it? We've almost made it to the end of the school year. I've Learned so much from my students. But sometimes the classroom can feel like a battlefield in a war between teachers and kids. And now, as we reflect on the 2023 to 24 school year, we just wanted to come together with a special message for our students. Y'all won! Y'all won! Absolutely, y'all won! Y'all rude and y'all nasty. Not only can you not read, but you are on drugs and spectrums that did not even exist in 2006. On top of that, speaking riddles. Drizzler, Gia Cheeks, phantomtex. Look, COVID broke something we can't fix. But as for me myself personally, I have officially endured my last scuba di toilet. I am retiring. Come here, Damian. This is Damien. Tell them, young man. When I gave you a D on your math quiz, what did you say? Oh really? Cause you thought it was pretty funny in November. What did you say, Damien? Uh, I said you had a funky neck. That's right, he said I had a funky neck. Hell no! Y'all won! This is Jay, this is Kendall. These two got in a fight in my classroom and when I tried to break it up, they turned on me. I got peaced up by two 12 year old non binary asexuals. Y'all run! Come out! Sometimes I like a little packet of Crystal Light in my water and The kids just couldn't let it slide. Tell him what you said, Haley. I said you drink Crystal Light packets because you can't afford real lemonade. Yeah, then I found out the kids started go fund me for me, called Help Our Broke Single teacher buy some lemonade. It raised $10,000. Yeah! Y'all won this year. I live by one word. T S I D D A H N. That spells sit down. I say this word about 628 times a day. For example, if you don't sit down. Or perhaps, Kiara, I thought I told you to sit down. Or sometimes. I'm not gonna tell you again, Jennifer. Sit down. Anyway, kids, I give up. And there is liquor in this thermos.",

    "voice_to_text": "tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entire every time I tell somebody this story they have the most horrified look on their face and when I tell you I have tried to record this video 10 time and either the audio wasn't working or TikTok wouldn't keep my recording so let's hope this one works and I'm gonna tell you what happened to me in 2022 so this happened when my son was about five months old him and I were sharing a room now let me say this first he was sleeping eight hours completely through the night I was getting enough sleep I was sleeping the best I've ever slept currently and he's toddler right now so this is not sleep deprivation I wanna say that first and foremost and there are other people who are involved so let's get into it I was about to go to sleep for the night and I was scrolling on my phone and I'm at my parents house by the way at this point so I roll over in my bed with my phone to face the direction of my bedroom door which I had kept open before all this happened I hear somebody walking up the stairs which I assume is my brother because he had lived there too at the time but he stops at the top of the stairs and he kinda just like peeks into my room just a little bit and I know it's him because it's like his face and his his height and his hair like he had an afro at the time I that was the outline of my brother and so I look at him and I'm like what are you doing and he doesn't answer me he just keeps staring at me and I say again like what the fuck are you doing like why are you just staring at me at this point because it's dark I could only see the outline of him or it it moves in front like right center of my door and it's just staring at me and I look at him like Sam what what do you need this all happened in point zero zero zero five seconds okay so as soon as I realise that that is not my brother I sit up in bed like jolt jolt up in bed and as I do that I'm still staring directly at whatever it was it just disintegrates like sand into the air I don't know how else to explain it I sound crazy I know just sand just disintegrates and disappeared I don't go to sleep that night I'm wide awake freaked the fuck out but I don't say anything until the following week so at this point I shut my bedroom door because absolutely not I'm about to go to bed again I'm scrolling on my phone and I roll over once again to face the direction of the door this time in the pitch black it's the outline of my son's father and at first I was like why are you just standing there cause he was living with us at the time and then I realized in my brain do you stag and spend the night that night he's not supposed to be here and how could he get in my house at 10 o'clock at night when everybody's asleep it's the the exact same thing I grab my phone I turn the flashlight on but this time I saw like this again 0.005 seconds just like the super pale face no eyes no nose no mouth but like this menacing feeling attached to it and again just like sand gone so at this point I'm not a super religious person but I feel like I needed some Jesus Christ in this moment so I go to my parents I tell them what's been going on my parents were not a believer before this story um I've always had weird things happen to me throughout my life with paranormal stuff and they just don't believe me but I asked um my mom to get one of her close friends a close family friend to come pray over my room because she's done that type of work for years she goes and prays over people's houses who have spirits attached to them so to her is just to like entertain me and make me feel safer so the family friend comes over and she's like I'm gonna go pray over your room and see what's going on and I was like perf um she goes up there she's up there for like an hour for a very very very long time but who am I to judge I don't do seances you know what I mean I don't I don't know to sum it up with you when she did come back downstairs she talked to my mom for a bit and then she leave my mom told me that her friend told her that of all her years doing this she's never walked into a room or a house and got instantly chills all over her body and that's exactly what happened when she walked into my room she said she prayed over it for that long amount of time whatever was there was gone she uh rebuked it I guess in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but she said if it does come back she she like told me certain prayers to do to make it go away my parents from that day forward are complete complete believers in the spiritual realm I am as well I that was like so terrifying I haven't seen it since please Lord that was the wrong hand but you get it like I don't wanna see it ever again but yeah that's my uh terrifying story and I don't have any explanations for it I have so many other ones that also have witnesses to it but it's already super long so this is what I'm gonna keep it as but yeah uh so that's my unbelievable ghost story"

    "voice_to_text": "one time my house ghost had to fight another ghost or entity or spirit that had entered our house this started because my mother she worked at the hospital so you know the hospital spirits and all other sorts of things like to linger around it's one of those things where they just linger and then I get one of them decided to follow her home when I didn't come into her house well our house goes Joseph did not like that and I'm not sure that whatever had followed my mother home was good um by any means because the house we can always tell when something in the house is Joseph versus something else cause number one and there's a energy around Joseph that you just feel and you know it's a it's funny because I must say it's familiar and then I know people are gonna jump on and be like oh this familiar spirit this money trying to trick you Joseph has been with me since birth since before I was born Joseph was in the house we just happened to move into his house Joseph is still in that house I can go visit that house and Joseph will welcome me with open arms it's a bit overwhelming since I haven't been there in a while but there is a energy around Joseph that we know and sometimes Joseph actually shows himself to us and he showed himself a lot to us definitely when this other thing came in the house because I don't know that Joseph knew we can tell the difference between him and other spirits but during this time that this thing was in the house Joseph always let us see him and Joseph was a a older older white male I mean he he lived during the late 18 so he had that look worn look around him but still kind he didn't have those black eyes or whatever but um my mother came home and this is also um I found that later on and it's funny cause me and my mom actually talked about it the other day the issue was there was a lot of racism during that time with my mother being at the hospital so she had got accused of of stealing it turned out of course it wasn't her but it was just a really really bad period during that time my mother went through a lot of turmoil working there and this spirit came home we would be downstairs if you can hear upstairs like it was rumbling like bowling like sometimes it sound like a bowling alley sometimes it sound like people being body slam stuff being thrown around but if you actually went up the stairs you couldn't hear it which is weird you only heard it if you were downstairs and if you were upstairs then you heard it on the stairs but if you look on the stairs nothing there but it was really really bad like during that time and one you know sometimes it would be so loud you know my mom she would sit on that front porch just to get away from it because it was you know too much we'll come I'll come home you know from playing all day beating the street lights home and my mom be sitting on the porch so we know you know it's a lot of activity going on in the house more than normal so avoid that but the ghost I guess it was Joseph was over it this ghost had to freaking go and I think there's also the ghost that slapped me but that's a whole other story um this ghost had to get out of our house Joseph they fought so hard upstairs we were in the dining room they fought so hard upstairs that one of our ceiling tiles I don't I really haven't seen a ceiling like this outside of an old hotel where they had the squares in the ceiling for the little small squares about 12 by 12 for the ceiling tiles but they were fighting so hard up there that one of the ceiling tiles fell down while we were eating dinner and fell into the living room but it was so bad and you know we really didn't know what to do about it at this time this is the time that um my mom because it had got so bad this is the first time I actually seen my mom worried to my mom really my mom has seen spirits all of her life and it's passed down of course through her kids so seeing ghosts is nothing but this whatever was going on during this time really concerned my mother so she called over someone to try to cleanse the house Joseph ran that person off that person has never step foot back up in our house but Joseph ended up getting rid of this other ghost I mean it was just a fight it was a fight that had to be fight I don't I felt like it was a battle not of souls but of over something but it was crazy because after Joseph whooped up this ghost and tore up the of course they were fighting in my room so when I went upstairs my room looked like a tornado um went through it after this final battle um him expelling and ghost but there were several days after that Joseph was not around and of course neither was other ghosts but then when Joseph showed back up it's like he was so tired I guess exerting all of that energy babbling the other entity and everything that it took a toll and like either he just couldn't show himself to us for a while or he just needs to recharge but he finally came back but he was tired and he looked like he had been through a fight but then he finally got his energy back but yeah Joseph did not play about us anything evil coming at house you can be human you can be a spirit you can be whatever I don't care how much you say you you love god and that you don't believe in this if you are not about the right Joseph is not letting you be in our house and for all those who will sit there and be like the dead don't do this the dead don't do that save it because I know what I have experienced all of my life",

    "voice_to_text": "when I was 21 I was alone in my apartment one hot summer day when suddenly there was a brisk knock at my door so I answered the door and there was a woman who was like in her late 50s long brown ponytail Mickey Mouse T-shirt and she was breathing really heavily and her face was red and she was leaned over with her hands and her knees and she was like I'm not feeling very well get a glass of water from you and I was like yeah girl come on in because you know I'm an objectively intelligent person who's particularly fond of sesquipedelian prose but I never said I was street smart and back then my anxiety was more the like I think I have rabies for no discernible reason kind of anxiety rather than that everyone's a threat anxiety that I've since added into the mix so invite her in and she sits at my dining room table and I bring her a glass of water which she promptly chugs and I go on the kitchen to refill her glass of water and suddenly she's right behind me so she starts opening my cabinets and she's looking all around my kitchen and I'm so stunned I'm just standing there doing absolutely nothing so this apartment was pretty big it was a three bedroom two bathroom apartment that I only paid $570 a month for and off the kitchen there was a really long hallway that LED to the the bedrooms so she starts going down the hallway and she opens the first bedroom door which had nothing in it because I did a cheap apartment but I didn't actually have any stuff to put it inside no money so she's like why don't you have any stuff in here and I'm like I just don't have any stuff so she keeps going and she opens the next door which is a bathroom the next door which is a closet and she starts to open the second bedroom door but luckily I finally snap out of it and I'm like hey stop so she's like I'm sorry I wasn't trying to be nosy it's just me and my son wanna move into this apartment like so I was just just looking around so I kind of corral her back to the dining room she sits down and I give her the new glass of water and the living room the dining room are like an L shaped configuration so she kind of turns in her seat and looks towards the living room and she stares at it like sort of confused for a minute and suddenly she pops up out of her seat and she yells you don't have a TV and I'm like no I don't and she goes you don't have a TV you don't have a DVD player you don't have a stereo you don't have nothing and I'm like no and she goes well what do you do for fun and I was like well I was just reading a Wally Lamb book I got at the library crying like so when you leave I'll probably go back to that and she yells well that's stupid and then she leaves she's gone so I go back to my book and I'm sitting on my couch and I still just kind of think she's like a thirsty little weirdo with no ill intentions but like an hour later I look out my screen door and I realize that she's standing in the parking lot with this younger man and they're looking in windows and they just look really sketch and suddenly I'm like I think I just had my joint cased (that's Robber lingo) this woman was Harry in the policeman's costume the man is Marv and I'm the proverbial Peter Mccallister so I immediately alert the authorities and I tell the responding officer absolutely everything and I'm like hey make sure you jot down the part where she called me stupid cause I think that was actually a hate crime and he like sighs really heavily he puts his pen down he's like honey why did you let a stranger into your apartment and I was like I don't know homie I'm just intrinsically philanthropic and he was like okay well like let's not do that anymore and I was like I I'd already gotten there on my own yeah um so he looks around my apartment and he's like checking my windows and he's like well if I was a robber this apartment would be my prime target because you can slide these windows open really easily from the outside and I was like you can and he was like yeah so he tells me that I need to get broomsticks and cut them to size and like fit them into the window so that way they can't be slid open from the outside um and I'm like yeah I will definitely do that but then an hour later after the police officer had left he comes back with a bunch of dowel rods and a jigsaw and he just cut them and put them into my windows for me and he probably saved my life or the very least prevented the fact of my 10 inch television",

Because it says operation refers to instance when divine entities such as saints, Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ himself makes himself known to a person. And then it has the audacity to say to use extreme prudence, meaning skills. Because if you don't know what you doing and you approach a demon, then you know you can get possessed yourself. Now at a time when they telling us about demon face syndrome. Really strange and really weird. And once again, this is for information purposes only. TikTok.

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

Not just like, oh, yeah, mom, like, casually, just in, like, the middle of, like, nothing conversation of, oh, I'm. I'm the one picking her up. Her stepmom has been telling everyone that she is her biological mom. Like, having conversations about when she was pregnant with her. So I went into class today, and one of the other mothers came up to me and said, you must be Delilah's stepmom. And I go, no, I'm her mom. I gave birth to her. Weird. And she goes, what? No, no, Stephanie gave birth to her. Stephanie was telling us all about the preeclampsia that she had, that she had a seizure after she was born. This woman stole my birth story. My birth story that I went through. She's out here telling people that she was pregnant with Delilah, and she had preeclampsia, and she had seizures. She had to stay in the hospital with magnesium drip. Excuse me. And I go, excuse me? You've got to be. You got to be joking me. And she goes, no, like, we've all heard about Stephanie and how she gave birth to Delilah. And I was like, Stephanie wasn't even a picture when Delilah was born. Like, Stephanie was in high school when Delilah was born. But I can't believe that somebody would actually do that. She went on to tell People, how she picked out the name Delilah. Like, talked about how this woman is, like, trying to be me. So this woman goes on to tell the story of how I picked out the name Delilah for our daughter because it was me and my husband hanging the hammock in the backyard, swinging just on, like, a nice fall day. And hey there, Delilah came on the radio. And I already liked, like, the radio show, um, Delilah, the night time show. And so that's how I picked out the name. Stephanie had come to dance class and told all the other moms that she had picked up the name Delilah. Just like that. Explain the day, the whole thing. I don't know. She must have heard it from my ex husband, but I'm fuming"

random\u00a0old\u00a0white\u00a0women\u00a0in\u00a0corporate\u00a0America being like the biggest bullies you've ever encountered like so rude for no reason it's something that nobody on this planet prepared me for and we need to talk about it cause like why for what why is a random 45 year old woman named Linda beefing with me for no reason at all let me be clear when I start a new job I am a people pleaser like I am overly nice I want everyone to get along because I don't wanna keep going through the whole repeated pattern of like oh we're like a big family like toxic corporate work culture thing that keeps happening and it's literally the reason like I do freelance work now I don't wanna deal with these weird dynamics in workplaces cause recently I went down a side of TikTok where it was like women of colour coming forward and sharing that white women in corporate America were some of the worst people they have to deal with and I fully support them because they truly are their reasons for feeling that way are probably a lot different than mine but they really are and I genuinely don't know why because like is it good old fashioned misogyny they still genuinely like believe there isn't enough space in the corporate world for all women so they have to turn it into like a weird competition constantly I've worked in a number of them now and there's always at least one woman in there somewhere that is just determined to make your life miserable one job I had my boss was a woman and I noticed that everyone they hired for our department they purposely hired both women and women who were like super super young and I mean like they were either still in college or they had just graduated like that year they had to be 21 because she had a tendency to really infantilise all the people who reported to her and like wanted to be like a mentor that people looked up to but kinda like we're never on her level and I remember one day it's uh left out somehow that I was actually 24 and she thought the whole time I was like 20 or 21 and it was just a little bit awkward that was only where the problems began to start though because then one day when she was out of the office and like her boss though was in um he walked in on me doing some random work cause I got bored I finished all my work so I logged into the back end of the website we worked in marketing right but I have a degree in like uxy and all that other stuff and since I was bored I was fixing the coding and whatnot on the back end of the website asked my boss if I could do it she was like sure you got time cause the website was really messed up and he walked in you know we were chit chatting we were having a good time he saw that I was doing this and asked me about it and he was like really impressed he didn't know that I could do this and I was like yeah I mean no one's ever really asked me what my background is here at the company and literally like a few minutes later after he leaves I get an email cced with like my boss and other people that I've been promoted essentially aka they're just gonna pay me more but essentially the message of the email was like oh we see that you have a lot of value that you're important to the company and we like wanna make sure that you stay here and that's when the problems with my boss who sat above me really started I don't know exactly why but she started making my day to day life very difficult with like menial things for no reason like she would write up all the random mistakes that happened in the office not always mine not usually mine some of them were hers too and she would report me to HR so I'd have to go to HR and I don't know how to argue that like my boss is saying I did this ironically after that I then got written up and sent to HR for asking too many clarifying questions about stuff that I should know however I was just trying to make sure we didn't have any more mistakes at the company like it started to be a running joke in our department cause I was chill with everyone else in the department that like at any random given moment I could be just sent to HR to be lectured and yelled at or things that really just didn't make any sense it was like a funny running joke in the office because like everyone else was also starting to have problems with her so I felt pretty comforted in that fact but even back to the point where I was like crying in the bathroom at work most days and she still yelled at me for doing that because it was unprofessional but I specifically remember one day our big boss came back from a lunch with one of our co workers and so he was hanging out in like our office cause literally like six of us shared an office it was a really weird setup but we were all hanging out having fun we were joking we were laughing he and I were like shooting jokes back and forth and we were laughing our butts off I thought it was like a really good day and then I look over at her in the corner and she's giving me like the evilest look I've ever seen in my life and I don't know why I can't figure out why but I know that I'm about to be off once he leaves the room but after he leaves she literally just like packs up and leaves for the day and then the next day I come into the office and of course I get called into HR and she has told HR that everyone in our department all like seven or eight of us apparently have written up that they're uncomfortable with my behaviour at work and I'm sitting here bawling in HR cause I have no idea I everyone hates me essentially is what she's saying like no one wants me there like and I don't know what to say to that and I'm like could you give me some examples like I I don't wanna make everyone uncomfortable like could you tell me what I could do to change they can't give me a single example because there are none I remember I'm bawling she says go take a walk before you go back to the office because like I don't want people seeing this and I was just like no I went straight back to the office where all our co workers were bawling they're like what happened like what did you get written up for this time there's like apparently every single one of you filed a report about me and everyone's looking at each other going literally no one in here has ever complained about you once and they were all so sweet and understanding and comforting to me in that moment like I knew they were telling the truth but I did not wanna continue to fight this grown lady and our HR over this so I just wrote like my 2 weeks notice and I turned it in the next day and left the company and I won't lie slowly but surely pretty much everyone left after me because they also had these problems but I've definitely experienced like stuff like this in other companies too and I just don't understand like do they just not think we can all coexist is it because it's like marketing and like marketing is considered a young person's game so they feel threatened like I don't know but it's wild and no one tells you that this is going to be another thing you get to deal with later in life"

As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief. And especially when this is happening while this genocide is taking place in Gaza. This mass murder of the Palestinian people is unacceptable. And the danger that the occupation of Palestine is causing for Jews. And on top of all, why in a synagogue? Why in a holy place? This is either a political move or a financial move. All of this is embarrassing for Jewish people, and as I said, dangerous to Jewish people as well. We should be very careful. Never allowed the completion of Zionists, would you? If one criticizes Zionists. I appreciate that, and I'll tell you why. Because I appreciate the people that define the right definition to what they criticize. Rather than criticizing Jews, which I discouraged to do. I visited Gaza. Yeah, and they did meet me. We are here to teach the world. We are here to teach the Palestinian, the suffering people of Palestine. We are here to teach the Jewish religion and to teach the Masses that this is criminal and this is wrong"

I did a deal with a vending machine company to fit our whole school with vending machines, and they were gonna buy them. We got them for free and made commission on every sale. And I got to the point where I was so preoccupied with that, not attending my classes, the school was trying to. Half the school was trying to expel me. The other half was trying to keep me because I was generating a lot of revenue. Um, and I decided that I would. Would no longer go to school. So, um, I focused on the business stuff. It's important to know when to quit. Yeah, I. It's, you know, in our. In our society, we always glamorize starting right, starting that new thing, and quitting as seen as something that losers do, right? There's a phrase, quitting is for losers. But quitting is the incredibly important thing you have to do before you start. They are fundamentally connected. And quitting, in fact, being a good quitter, from what I've seen in life, is one of the real arts to getting where you need to be. And I've been just this unbelievably peaceful quitter for my entire life. I quit school, quit university after one lecture, started a company, did it for 3 years, raised investment, quit out the blue, quit my last company, which is generating 600 million in revenue out the Blue. Because I knew within me, um. And it's something I write about a lot. That, um. I'd overstayed my welcome in that situation. And it could no longer serve me.",

And not all the time am I gonna share. But this one was a little too good not to. It's not like it's here, so. Cause, I mean, there's a video floating around. I seen it. There was this girl, okay?

So we comes in, props and stuff up on the counter like he's Rico suave. And he was clearly batting out of his leg, y'all, it just won't go happen. It wouldn't go happen. You knew immediately when he walked in that door. She was like, somebody please get this guy out of here. Yes, Kim. She's like, look, can I help you? I don't know, can you? What do you drink? I have whatever you like. And I'm sure he probably made some kind of joke like, I'll take the peach, a juicy one. I really don't know, but all I heard her say was, you're a miss, ain't you? And it was like the most Uncomfortable, awkward conversation ever. Anyway, she's sitting there just mixing his drink up. Probably think about spitting in it. He decides to take it upon himself to show her a photo on his phone of his little pee pee. Yo. Yes, he showed her a photo of his little pee pee. Okay, that's so sexual harassment. Of course, the owner was like, no, that ain't happening in my stower. And I put the dude on blast. Like, if you know this guy, he's disgusting. This is what happened in my stower. It's at the end of. No, it's not. It gets even better. It seems like biscuit here calling someone into marrying him, like, two or three days after this whole incident. Did she find out about it? Yes, she did. While I have yet to find out her response, his response was, I was just trying to enjoy my last few days of freedom. I got so many questions right now. Some weird people in this world, y'all.",

Like, I've never just fully stood up and left and said, leave me alone in the middle of the date. But there's a first time for everything. I still can't fully believe that this happened. So we went to go get drinks and appetizers, and this all happened at like a minute 24. So we had drinks but no food. We like, just started talking. I knew pretty early on in the date that I wasn't that into him, but I still try to keep an open mind if I go on a date and like within the first 10 minutes and like, this is probably not someone I would date, cause you never know. Sometimes people are just nervous. They take a second to open up. Generally speaking, I just was not feeling it. But we're just making conversation and we start talking about like, what we like to do on the weekends. And he's like, oh, I like to go to church. And he says, you're Jewish, right? Because on my profile where we matched, it said that I'm Jewish, cause I am. But he said it really loudly and we were in public. He was like, oh, you're Jewish, right? And just generally with the culture of how things are right now, I don't Tend to like, scream that I'm Jewish in public places because people are insane. So I kind of made a joke and was like, I am, but I don't have to, like, scream it in public places. Very light hearted, just kind of poking fun at the fact that he had, like, said it quite loudly. He proceeded to spew the most antisemitic, offensive bullshit I've ever heard in my life. Like, in this monologue, the phrase I would be embarrassed to be a Jew came out of his mouth. So I don't really know where he got the audacity or why he went out with me, if he hates Jewish people because he literally knew that I was Jewish, or if he just wanted an opportunity to say a bunch of anti Semitic bullshit to a Jewish person. Not really sure what he was getting out there, but I got up and left because I just. I have a zero tolerance for that. So that was a first. Um, as I was walking away, he was like, let me know if you wanna play pickleball sometime. I was like, what part of me, like, literally leaving this date 27 minutes and makes you think that I wanna play pickleball with you? Like, actually, go fuck yourself. So, yeah, I don't even know what to say. Normally my stories have some kind of lesson at the end where I'm like, but then I Learned. But I'm, like, just really angry. About this one. So see ya",

It has officially been a year and a few weeks since we seen my niece. My niece is my brother's child. Now, I can say it probably is my fault that the girl is mad at us. It probably is. But the situation wasn't even that deep for her to be taking it to the extent that she's taking it. So since I felt like it is my fault, I've reached out to her. Now that it's been a year, I feel like somebody got to be the bigger person, so I reached out to her. Of course. Of course, I got no response, which I already knew. But I'm just trying to figure out, like, when can everybody put their feelings to the side and, like, just do what's best for the child? Like, my brother is not at a place right now where we can do joint custody or go to court or do anything like that. So us as his family, we want to step up and be there, because we know he physically can't. And it's like, why is. Fuck us for what we do. And here's the text message that, um, I sent her and that she didn't reply. And I felt like I was very, you know, nice about the situation. Like, it's been over a year. Boo. She has a Whole another side of family. Even though my brother, your baby daddy, is not doing his part, why shut the whole family out? Why? So at this point right now, I'm just wondering, like, what's next? What do I do? Um. Like, what's next? Like, what is there to do? Keep begging you? Like, keep hitting you up? Like, keep trying to reach out? Like, she's about to be two in September. We missed her first birthday party. Is a whole lot of milestones that were missing at this point because of my brother or whatever the case he got going on. And why should we, his family, be the one that has to, you know, suffer? Or even a child? Because the bigger picture is, the child suffers. Is a whole side of family that she doesn't even know. Because of argument, altercation that adults had, that adults could have talked out. Um, so, yeah, I'm at a point now. I'm like, you know, what should we do? Should I keep texting her? Should I pull up to her house? What do I do?",

This boy literally cracks me up every day. All right, so, um, usually when me and my fiance, you know, want to. We lock the door. Okay. Um, I did not have the door locked. We weren't doing anything. Um, I had fully clothed pajamas on. But I was, like, laying on top of my fiance, just hugging him, just laying on him. Um, and Van comes busting open the bedroom door like he always does to show me something on his iPad with the. Hey, mommy. Um, so he sees me laying on top of my fiance and he goes, oh, literally his words. He goes, oh, were you about to do the thing? I'm sorry about that. He was apologizing for interrupting. And then he. He proceeds to show me what was on his iPad. I don't know, it was about some cartoon or the other. I had no idea. I don't even remember. I was laughing so hard at this point. And I quickly, like, stood up and I was like, oh, I was just. I was just giving Brett a hug. I was giving him a hug. Of. Of course, we weren't doing anything. We were fully clothed. Um, but then, uh, Van, you know, he tells me what he needs to tell me, and then he goes, let me put my. Put This phone down for a second. He. He goes, don't fall for him. He goes like this. I'll keep that a secret. You do that, buddy. You keep that a secret. Cause there ain't nothing going on here, you know? The boy ain't dumb. The boy ain't dumb. And that's why we always lock the door.

A plan is currently being worked on by the superintendent to introduce year round schooling to Philly. Instead of one huge summer break, students will now get smaller breaks throughout the year in addition to holidays. The goal of this is to end the summer slide that happens where kids forget stuff over the long summer break. But it's not gonna happen just yet. First 20 schools are gonna be selected to test run this year round school program. And then for this upcoming school year, things will look mostly the same with expanded after school programs. Then the year after that, the 20 schools that were selected will begin the year round school calendar. We don't know which 20 schools will be selected yet, and we don't have any specific details on what a year round calendar will look like, so I'll update you when that stuff comes out.",

Right? Like I always say, I don't give a damn about nobody's preference. You can marry the size, shape, color, you can marry whoever and whatever you want. I don't give a damn. But this is where I do have an issue. Just read these comments. I'm loving these black wife effect. Keep them coming, ladies. 15.5 thousand likes. The material was always there. Sis said rise king and he did 12 likes. I love this trend. God damn. You won. She at girl. What kind of seasoning you used on this one? Now let's flip the roles real quick. If black men was coming out here, posting on this app, showing the before and after of they white wives and they other race wife saying they put seasoning on them, cause all the seasoning really is like you, you. You could just tell they've been involved in black culture and not a little bit culture. That's really all the seasoning that they put. But if black Man was doing this with a white wives and a Hispanic and Asian wives, Oh, my god. We wouldn't be able to breathe. I'm black. My daughter black. Her mama black. She got four black grandparents. But if I was in these comments asking, oh, what season you put on that one, man, what? Y'all will be giving me hell. And don't act like y'all wouldn't",

There are two parents, mom and dad, and four children. This is the Hum Don family here. From left to right. Al Yaman is one year 4 months old. Next to him is his older brother, Anas, who is eleven. Next to him is his mother, Islam. Next to her in the back is Nesma. She's nine. And in front of her is her sister Sana, who is five. In the foreground on the far right is Ahmed. He is the father. I've been in contact with this family every day for the past week. And I have received updates and many, many photos before and after. We've had video chats. We are in constant contact. First we need to raise $150 per person, coming to $900 total for updated passports. Then we need $5,000 per adult, $2,500 per child under sixteen to cross into Egypt. And then we'd like to raise provisions for them to sustain life for as many months as we can after that. I've put a thing to my thing in my thing where you can find me and you can click and go do the stuff. So I don't have a huge platform, but there's. There's a big pocket full of you here. So if y'all can donate what you can, that would be amazing. Um, I really wanna help this Family. And I want you guys. I hope that you guys can help me help them. So let's do this. Um, this is one of many, many families, and, um, this is the family that I've chosen to help. So thanks for listening, and I love you all."

Because the reality of it is, we're no longer those same people. And if you're a victim of childhood trauma, it's probably imperative that you get rid of some of those people from your past. When you grow up in the fucking war zone, in your home, you know, people constantly yelling, drinking, doing drugs, hitting, fighting, all of those things, your mind as a child is kind of, you know, unstable. You know, you may be prone to violence or anger issues or cry a lot. You may be prone to having friends who control you, manipulate you, all of those things. And you don't know that because you're a kid. You're going through so much trauma that you don't know how to process, um, your feelings. You don't know how to decipher who's really your friend or not, because you're so used to toxic relationships. I had a best friend of over 20 years. We fell out for about 5, 7 years, and we reconnected recently this year. It took me less than a month to realize that she was not healthy for me. You know, she was still doing the same things that she had been doing 10, 15, 20 years ago. You know, she was still going to the same places, doing the same job. And although consistency is beautiful, Like, so is evolution, you know, we're all growing to become better humans, better versions of my. Of ourselves. And if I find someone still doing the same things that they were doing when we were kids, still thinking the same way, still having the same problems as they did when they were children, that's a big red flag for me. But the biggest thing that made me not wanna be her friend anymore is that she kept reminding me of who I used to be. I'm not ashamed of the little girl that I had to be to fight through trials and tribulations. I'm not ashamed of the things I had to do when I was a young woman, the struggles that I had to overcome into adulthood. I'm not ashamed of any element of who I was or who I had to be to become who I am today. But what I'm not gonna tolerate is folks, you know, down talking the old version of me, reminding me, like, oh, like I haven't changed, like I'm not capable of change. And it just put me in this uncomfortable kind of dark place, and I just didn't wanna be a part of that. You know, I want people in my corner that are seeing the changes in me, knowing who I am today, respecting who I am today, and not constantly trying to belittle my accomplishments by reminding me how far I came from when I was a kid.

    "voice_to_text": "this is one of the most painful conditions any person can have it is called a polynatyl abscess and it is formed because of an infection in these polynatyl sinuses which is a passageway between the coxas or the tail bone in your skin and what happens is that often we see this in individuals who are overweight males those who are sitting for a period long periods of time but we could also see it in women and what happens is you have an ingrown hair that gets stuck in these sinuses and eventually over time become infected causing fluid to accumulated causing an infection called an abscess in the way that we manage this is by surgery so often times we perform surgery to get rid of these infection they are seeing how they perform the surgery so the way they do it is they essentially form an incision on that passageway and surgeons are able to get rid of these ingrown hair because the key is to remove the ingrown hair so that doesn't accumulate and cause infection and then they also laser this passageway to form scar tissue so the sinuses are closed so that this infection doesn't reoccur again so what's important here is that if you fit that demographic of a male overweight who sits for prolonged periods of time and you're having tailbone pain make sure you talk to a primary care provider to make sure you don't have a pile of metal abscess because those could be life threatening"

I drive to her apartment, and she has two windows beside her door. And I'd knock on the door. No answer. So I look through the window, and they're on the couch. They're not touching, but they're on the couch together. And neither of them had been answering my calls. I was heartbroken for a lot of reasons. Right. Yeah. I was actually more heartbroken by her. Yeah. Than him. She and I are still friends. I love her deeply. I do not trust her the same way. And all of my other friends cannot believe that we are still friends.

I'm not sure how many of you are aware that content creator Aaron Hadtimer has started an initiative where she is partnering up other creators and influencers with families in Gaza who have Gofundme's in order to help raise money and evacuate as many people as possible. We all know that no one person can do it all, so she is assigning some of us volunteers, our adopted families, to maximize reach and help raise as many funds as possible. When I Learned about this, I knew I wanted to participate, but the algorithm doesn't always favor me, so I'm gonna need a lot of your help in the upcoming weeks to try to reach my adopted family school. This is the Shaheen family. A father, a mother, two sons, and their respective families, including two very, very young children. Their daughter, Amani, was lucky enough to leave Gaza, and she is organizing this gofundme on their behalf. Family is currently in the south of Gaza in a building that's housing over 80 other displaced people. There is not enough food or water, and they all take turns sleeping because there is also not enough mattresses or blankets. This includes the babies, Yusuf, who's only three and a half years old, and baby Ahmed, who is just a year old. Ahmed has osteomalycia, which obviously can't be properly treated where they are. I will be posting about the Shaheen family until their goal of \u00a360,000 is raised. I am Begging you all to give what you can, even if all you can is $5. There are enough of us on this platform to truly make a difference. Even if we all pull together, we can get this family out of Gaza through the Egyptian border, which is a money's ultimate goal. Please help by liking, commenting, sharing, reposting, and go to the link in my bio to find their gofundme. I know that we can't help everyone everywhere, as much as we may like to, but we can help here. Let's help this family, please.",

Which comes out to about $540 US Because this video is over a minute long I am hoping we can raise more money just with YOUR engagement but here's what I need you to do: I need you to watch the ENTIRE video -  I know people are busy I know this is an app where you wanna consume a lot really quickly please be patient, hit the 2 x to go faster, please watch the entire video.

And stories like this are the exact reason why I look at you funny. Man makes miracle recovery after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and he was left underwater. After being hospitalized for more than two weeks, a 26 year old man from Louisiana is officially off life support. Doctors described Christopher Gilbert's survival as a miracle after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and left underwater for nearly ten minutes. Gilbert and a group of his friends were at a lakefront restaurant when he ended up in the water, leaving him with significant rain damage and on life support. His friends, right? Family attorney Claudia Payne said Gilbert's friend group initially reported to police that he had fallen into the lake. However, after an investigation was conducted, it was said that he was allegedly pushed into the water by a girl in the friend group. Gilbert's legal team is demanding and arrest be made. They also want the restaurant owners to be held accountable for not keeping him safe. So far, no arrests have been made and activists are demanding justice and answers. I'm not even an activist and I need answers. I want answers like now. But let's get into the real story, you feel me? A white woman pushed An aspiring black doctor into a lake knowing he couldn't swim. The woman also lied to his parents and the police saying he fell into the lake. They also watched him for 10 minutes struggling before bystanders who did not know him intervened. Uh huh. And I know when said friends concocted this little plan, cause this was definitely premeditated. I'm not hearing it was premeditated. When they sat there, got together, and made up this little plan of what they was gonna do, they did not think of the possibility of him surviving it. They thought he was going to drown that way. They already had the story that they wanted to tell. It was already set in stone. This man was on his way to be a doctor. He was on his way to make a change in this world. A black man on his way to greatness. And they tried to stop him from that. You would like to donate to Chris's cause? I've already donated. The link to his gofundme is under this thread on Twitter is still up, so just type in that name and you'll be able to find it. Mr. Chris, we see what's going on. We know what's going on, just like you know what's going on. And we are behind you. We as in black people. We are behind you. I promise you.",

You know, if you don't learn anything else from crackheads, they are living proof that where there's a will, there's a way. Because there is no, no length that a crackhead won't go to to get their crack. There is no obstacle big enough to stop a crackhead from their next fix. This man or woman, I don't know who it was. You know, whatever they identify as, they somehow knew that there was a generator on your mother's roof. They knew that they could get their hands on that generator, possibly sell it and buy some crack. They went out of their way to climb up to this roof, get this generator, climb back off of the roof with a generator. Let's just stop and picture that you're climbing off of a roof, you're scaling down somebody's house with a generator. Or because you want some crack. That is dedication. And we give crackheads this negative stigma, and for good reason. But there's good things about them too. You can learn from a crackhead. Okay, go follow your dreams. Go make some goals, bitch. Go follow them. Those New Year's resolution to forgot about. Go, go pull it. Pull it up in the notes app. Go back to those resolutions and go. Go fix something. Go solve something, go achieve something. Cause if you was a crackhead, that shit would have been done already. Cause that's where The crack is at"

So my husband and I were talking about the comments on this video where this comment was left, and, like, he was a latchkey kid and was left alone starting at age 5 during the day. And I was sharing a different situation in which we were left alone as very, very young children. And maybe it's because we lived in Germany. And that's why I was saying, like, hey, Europeans, what. What is your experience? Because I think it was much more common in Germany in the early eighties that when you put your kid in the crib at night, like, they're expected to be in bed. They're safe. They're in a crib. Nothing bad is gonna happen to them. So you can go out on a date. You don't need. You don't need childcare. You don't need a sitter. They're in bed. What's gonna happen to them? They're definitely not gonna have issues in the middle of the night. They're definitely not gonna get out of bed and need a parent. They're in bed. We told them to stay in bed. Why not have a date? And you definitely don't need a babysitter. Why would you pay someone to be supervising your kid who is just sleeping in bed? And my husband, the lash key kid, thought that Was wild. So, Americans, was that something that happened to you, or was that kind of a European experience? And Europeans, is that something that y'all still do today? Because I know here in America, we would never consider, like, once our kids are tucked in for the night, that we can just go out and do whatever. And there doesn't need to be a responsible caregiver in the house. I certainly could never imagine having left my infant at home while I went out on a date, like Home Alone. Thinking about how parents justified that as good parenting is. Yeah."

    "voice_to_text": "And you're talking about Drake in Atlanta and is not like us video. It like resurfaces memory. That is just wild. 2016, I'm a sophomore in college. I decide finally, okay, maybe I'll rush. For the very short period of time that I was involved in the sorority, obviously I was in the group chats, and there were pictures that circulated of Drake visiting our sorority lodge in the middle of the night. I can't remember if somebody had dmed him on Instagram and he responded or he just took it upon himself. I have spent the past few days trying to find those photos. I can picture them. And it was our sorority lodge. He was in front of it taking pictures. There were pictures of him with girls that I knew. We are 18 in these photos, so I guess too old for Drake, but he, he was happy to come visit. Looking for these photos, I decided to look up like, Drake visiting the sorority lot to see if somehow they got leaked. I found this. This story should encourage college students maybe not to drink quite as much and pass out. You never know who may pop by your dorm room. In this case, it was Drake. People paying a visit to course Drake University on his idle leg of his Summer Sixteen tour. After rocking at the Wells Fargo Arena dressed in college gear, he shared his views of the school's sign on Instagram. Also 2016. Also, it's the same sorority he went around visiting. Like the theta sororities way they fucking spin it is weird as shit. Because I guess everyone's trying to just justify this grown man going, it's not that they all drank and passed out, it's that it was 4:00am. At least I know for the photos and videos that were from my sorority, it was 4:00am. See there going door to door, surprising unsuspecting sororities. Nice try, Drake. Take a look. Kappa Alpha Beta. I'm out here waiting on you. Waiting on you. Fucking weird. Where were you girls? What the fuck? Another reason not to drink too much and pass out. You know, I'm here for you. I'm here for you girls. So fucking weird as I had completely forgotten about all of this and then listening to just them talking about Drake in Atlanta. Like, you know, I've had friends, They see Drake at the club or they see him in a restaurant in Atlanta. Okay, whatever. But that's not this. It was like well known. It was well known. If you really wanted to, you can get one of the new recruits to DM Drake on Instagram and he would come and visit. Like, I feel like I'm going crazy cause I cannot find these photos, but I was not expecting finding that news clip of him doing it at Drake University. By the way, again, same sorority. Before y'all think, oh, I'm conflating the Two. No, that I remember looking at these photos cause it was specifically outside of our lodge with our sign and him on our campus at 18:19. I thought it was really fucking cool. 27, I'm so creeped out. Especially with the sorority sisters being asleep. That clip at least he was going around a bunch of college campuses, I think, visiting sororities in the middle of the night."

    "voice_to_text": "So in lieu of recent videos that I have done, I have a couple stories for people now. I advocate for the clients. I think it's important for clients to be educated, but I will also stand up for artists, because education and the truth are invaluable. So I got a couple stories. About 10 years ago, I tattooed in Florida. And in Florida, you can tattoo minors as low as the age of 16, as long as you have parental consent. High school kid comes in, big Samoan. He wants some Samoan tribal. I do my best. He's happy, she's happy. All is good. I go over strict aftercare with every client I tattoo, especially in the last 10 to 15 years, because I noticed a trend. Wash the tattoo three to five times a day with gold dial antibacterial soap. Uh, let it air dry for about 15 minutes. Then use a regular amount of white unscented lotion. It's not a cupcake. You do not need to ice it. Anyway, this kid gets his tattoo. So two to three weeks later, him and the mom come back in, and she is very upset. She is demanding that we pay for doctor visits, medicine, and she wants her money back for the tattoo. The kid lifts his sleeve up, he's keloided. Uh, there's a clear infection. And the shop that I work at, we took health standards pretty serious. So I start asking questions. Well, come to find out, This kid wasn't taking care of his tattoo the way I told him. He was also picking the scabs causing the keloid. And after further conversation, unbeknownst to the mother, he'd went to football practice, put on dirty shoulder pads with a sleeveless shirt on. And they wondered where he got the staff infection from. Second story. I did a tattoo on a young lady's foot. Part of my aftercare is do not submerge your tattoo for 10 to 14 days. And when I say submerge, I tell them I mean a pond, a river, a swimming pool, a hot tub, a bathtub. She comes back in a week later, her tattoo looks terrible. Come to find out through conversation, she went to the beach the next day. She thought it was okay because when I said, don't submerge it in a body of water, I didn't list off the beach. So don't be so quick to blame the tattoo artist all the time. Because some of you don't know how to follow fucking directions. Have the day you deserve.",

    "voice_to_text": "Tell me a ghost story that sounds completely unbelievable but is entirely true. When I tell this story to this day, people do not believe me. When I was a freshman in college, I was going to a private school in Pittsburgh. I was leaving the next year. I was going to a different school. So my friends and I, some of us were leaving, some of us were moving, whatever. We decided we wanted to kind of hit all the different spots in Pittsburgh that we really like. So we went to, like, Mount Washington, for those of you don't know, it's like a really nice lookout over Pittsburgh. And there was a place near our school, and it was called the fountain of youth. It was essentially just like a well that people in the town used to go to when it was in use. So we went there. It was night time. It wasn't like midnight. It was like nine or so. It wasn't super late. Um, we went there, and the way that this well was set up, it was, like, carved. There was a piece carved out of a rock formation, and then you'd walk in and then get water out of the well inside of it. So the. The people who are, like, shorter or smaller, they went inside and, like, I'm tall, so I wasn't gonna, like, go in there, but other girls were going inside and just, like, checking it out and seeing What it looked like. And the rest of us were standing outside taking pictures, just like, messing around, waiting, hanging out, you know, talking. The girls inside, one of them said, hey, I can kind of hear, like, rocks moving around in here. It sounds like there's something else in here. And we were all like, okay, well, that's probably an animal. So just like, come out. So as she's like, leaving and coming out and saying, like, I can hear something in here, the girls who are outside, my. Me specifically, my phone died. Turned off completely. It was at 70, 80%. It was not anywhere close to dying. Turned off, died. Other girls phone started dying. Then we heard a growl. And it did not sound like a animal. It sounded more like a human being. Trying to mimic what an animal sounds like when they growl. And we found this out later. That the girls inside the cave heard the same exact thing. Coming from inside the cave. We heard it outside in the woods. We all run and book it to the car. We get back, we're all like, we're done. That's it. Whatever. I'm going to take a shower. I'm changing. And I see in the mirror, handprints on my shoulder. Like someone just grabbed it like that and left those prints. I tell everybody, check yourselves, because I just found this on myself. The one girl who was in the well lifts up her Shirt, I look, she has three scratch marks down her back. I was like, nope, we're done. I started praying. I said, if there's something attached to us, get it away from us. I want no part of that. And that was it.",

um I apologize if at any point I get emotional during this it's been a really hard um since finding out that this was gonna be happening context will be in a second but um yeah I just hope that you have however long this video is please take the time just to watch it if you can to support um and if anybody knows anything or anything that we can do um that would be great I bought a condominium back in 2022 and this was a huge deal um I was 21 years old and had the opportunity to own a house who in this world would not want that right I realize that not a lot of people my age get to have this opportunity so it's something that I don't take lightly it's just great right and it was great um up until April 23rd of this year when everything kind of started going completely downhill also I might be looking off to the side a little bit because I have numbers and I wanna share them with you all so that you can understand like the gravity of this situation so when I bought my condo I was paying my mortgage payment and then a $315 HOA fee monthly not yearly monthly fine whatever right after I moved in couple months we were approached myself and all the other owners were approached by a company that was looking to buy us all out of our homes and turn our condominium complex into an apartment complex at the time they offered many of us amounts that didn't really make sense for us to want to agree to this and they also were not taking into consideration people who had fully renovated units versus people who had regular units and they were giving offering us the same price so as a community we banded together to fight for that and fight against that and it didn't go through at the end of 2022 we elected a new board of directors and then we were informed that we would have an increase in our HOA fees from $315 a month to $414 a month so understandable also I'd like to say that the amounts that I provided so far are specifically for my unit I live in an 810 square foot unit and those are my fees in December of 2023 so fast forward a year we were notified that our HOA dues would be increasing from $414 a month to $651 a month and most of it was due in part to insurance and the Surfside condominium collapse in Miami and laws that were passed to ensure the safety of our community at this time uh several owners realized that the board of directors were not who I guess we thought I'm not 100% sure on that honestly um but the main thing was that they got together to create a ballot to recall the current board and elect actual residents who live in our complex which should be already a standard but it is not so once we found out the board of directors wasn't I guess who we thought we elected um it was discovered who they actually were and they have a company one of them at least is an owner of a company who has done this to multiple condominium complexes all around the Orlando Florida area which is where um this is all happening all of these people as well are on aboard at another condominium complex in another area of Orlando and they are doing the same thing to them as well so some of us signed a ballot to recall the board some of us didn't and we went forward but on April 23rd that's when we were provided a letter in the mail that literally pretty much has changed all of our lives and will change all of our lives if it actually passes so because of the Surfside collapse there was a law created that condominium complexes have to fully fund their reserves which fair understandable right if something happens we wanna be able to have the money whatever and I guess in the years past they have waived this the board of directors in the previous years waived this so nobody had been paying the fees so there's a lot of millions of dollars missing that needs to be made up so our board of directors put a plan in place that will be voted on by them not us on May 15th and I'm recording this on May 3rd and they get the vote we don't get a vote we don't get a say and they will be charging the following fees so first there will be a special assessment fee which will help to begin to fully fund our reserves and this fee would range from $11,148 to $22,104 my 810 square foot unit home would be assessed a $15,569 fee 50% of this would be due June 30th and the other 50% would be due July 31st obviously this is distressing in and of itself because who has thousands of dollars lying around to be due in literally two months like I don't know where I personally would come up with the money like I have a full time job I work 40 hours a week but I do not make enough money to have that much money saved up I I don't and it's not just me there's so many families that live here and like elderly people and just it doesn't matter who we are it's it's just really hard to think that these are real people like with real lives that are being affected so on top of the special assessment fee they also would be raising our monthly HOA dues effective June 1st these dues would range from $1,486 to $2,590 for my specific unit 810 square feet I would go from paying $651 a month to $1,824 a month and this is effective June 1st if they pass this on the fifteenth I genuinely hope that somebody can provide guidance on this like we understand that the fees need to be paid and that the reserves need to be funded and all those things but the takeaway here is that like in two months nobody can come up with this money nobody and on top of coming up with that money then have an increase in dues that much personally again this is in Orlando Florida so I've like reached out and also I used to uh rent an apartment here and there are 100% apartments that I could go right now and rent for actually less than the $1,800 but about that much for like a comparable unit and to top all this off I'm still paying my mortgage so I still have a mortgage payment on top of this these exorbitant fees so I just I come to you the community of TikTok I\u2019ve really not ever made anything like this before so I'm just hoping that somebody can help like give advice provide guidance help us because it's and it's not just me like honestly like I've to be so real and honest with you guys like I've never felt so sad and like scared and just hopeless in my whole life like I feel hopeless honestly like if we don't recall the board and make sure that everything halts I don't look I'm gonna have to sell the house I worked so hard to buy in the first place and I'm scared that I won't even be able to buy a house ever again you know and I know I'm really privileged to have this place in the first place but honestly with everything that's happened to us it's it's like is it worth it and at what cost cause this is causing many people to to freak out like literally so please please I beg of you honestly if anybody can say anything in the comments down below message me on here Instagram wherever please I just I really need help and my neighbors need help and my community needs help and I want to hopefully be able to provide some sort of help for these people and myself",

You think to start on Monday, you think to start on Wednesday, you gets pushed back to Thursday, gets pushed back to one week later, then one month later, then you forget and you don't do the thing at all. How many of you have had a moment like that before? And then the next moment, you see somebody else has launched that thing that you were thinking about. How many of you had that moment before? But you see it, you see on supermarket shelf, you see it on the internet. We are human vessels who can use this non physical, this non physical energy. We can use it through us. When we're using it, it will stay here. If we're not using it in and out using it, it will have to move somewhere where it gets attention so it can start flowing again. Are you guys understand what I'm saying? Right? In this room, you can have a lot of ideas. I'll bounce an idea of you, you bounce an idea of me. The bouncing of ideas. We're using the energy. We're using the Qi, we're using the flow, right? Qi means energy. Okay? So we allow it to flow, but if we are no longer here, there's no attention here. So where does it go? It goes somewhere else. Where there's A vessel which will pay what attention to the energy? And it will be used there. Okay, so how does it work? Is very simple. What happened? Well, the energy was with you at that time. It was moving. It was flowing through you. If you could ground it with your physical skills, you would have been the manifesto of that energy into this physical realm. You would be in the greater. But because you didn't, you didn't give it the attention it needs. It needed to find somebody who could hold that capacity and make that big energy into a physical reality. So that is how energy is flowing all of the time. It's one collective energy, one collective library. Somebody's gonna do it. I don't know who's got a big enough vessel and equipped enough to make that happen, but somebody's gonna do it. Or you can be the one that one day the energy came to me, said hi, and I said bye. So I have had that idea before. Yes, I have. But I said bye. If you have had that idea before, what if I was to tell you you can look it from different perspective. What if we can say universe chose you?",

And all for the sake of getting three cry face laugh emojis. Is it worth it? You got that fucking right. It's worth it. Couple months ago in our group, one of our closest friends, his dog died, which is obviously devastating, but not as devastating as the memes we made. He didn't even tell us his dog was dead cause he knew he'd make fun of them. We had to find out from his wife's Facebook page. She did a sad little post about it. We all scream, grabbed it, put it in the group, were like hi, your dog dead? And he was like yeah! And we were like, ah, that'll teach you to love something. And then we found this dead dog. For an hour now. The reason we made fun of this dead dog isn't cause we were glad the dog was dead. We love that dog. It was such a good dog. I miss that dog. The reason we made fun of this dead dog isn't because we find dead dogs funny. Very rarely do we find dead dogs funny. The reason we made fun of this dead dog is for the same reason that most people make horrible jokes after something bad happens. And it's not because they're evil, and it's not because they're malicious, and it's Not because they're heartless, it's because the joke pops into your head and that's it. Something bad happens and you go, oh, no. And your brain goes, say this, though, and that's it. And if you don't say the joke, it's not like it fucks off. It just sits there again, funnier and funnier, funnier, funnier. And it begins to roll your brain. And that's how you get brain cancer. I am a scientist. It's. It's like having diarrhea. Holding it in doesn't achieve anything. You just have to admit that you're not well and be like, I'm very sorry, I'm incredibly sick. I have to get this out of my system, otherwise I might explode. Ah. Thank you for your patience. Sorry for your loss. So we spent an hour just making silly jokes about his dead dog. I say we. I didn't. I spent 45 minutes of that hour very carefully photoshopping an image of Thanos clicking his fingers and his dog disappearing from the arms of his four year old daughter. And you'll. You'll never convince me that that's not the funniest thing I've ever done in my goddamn life. Five cry face laugh emojis from all nine boys. I build a perfect gang. You never say that. Never happens.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm outside the Boeing facility here in Renton, Washington. It's after midnight. I got a bizarre scene happening here behind me. 12:01. Boeing decided to deactivate the security access cards for all of their firefighters and all of their EMTs, as well as pull their parking passes and remove them from the property. They say that they're going to a contingency plan while trying to negotiate a contract. That contingency plan, a large part of it is you, the taxpayer, because now they'll be calling 9 1 1 and calling rent and fire out here. Is they don't have enough staff on hand anymore. They say this is part of a contract negotiation. However, this is the same company that now is in one of the biggest PR crisis ever, now that they have planes that nose dive out of the sky and kill everybody on board. Door plugs falling out of planes. Recently, a ramp fell off one of their planes, and in a bizarre twist of fate, landed near the property of a lawyer suing them for the door plugs. Here's the story. This has been brewing for a little bit, as a union for the firefighters and Boeing have been in contract negotiations. What makes us unique, though, is that the firefighters said they're happy to continue working during negotiations. That aren't striking. But Boeing said, take our last offer, or we will remove you from the property. Which is also a problem, as Boeing's facilities are Only approved for construction if they have on site firefighting abilities to a certain level as cities can't take the whole workload. Tonight there's one chief on the property instead of the usual five to six firefighters. Obviously, I feel passionately about this one, and I do have some level of bias because if you didn't know, I'm also involved in the firefighting in EMS world and my other life. I'll have more info on that and this shortly.",

He was older guy, you could tell that he had a mental condition. Every. Every fucking employee in the store was laughing at him. I'm shaking, I'm so mad right now. Every employee in this damn store was laughing at him. And there's this little bitch ass cop came up in here just now and removed him. He was standing in line behind me just getting a little SIM cord. Wasn't bothering anybody. Whenever the cop walked back in from escorting this man out of the store for doing absolutely nothing, for having mental issues, I asked that cop, I said, sir, what was he needing? I'll get it. Boring. He wasn't bothering anybody. I think he's got mental issues. He said, yeah, but he might have been intoxicated, you know, you never know. And I said, this is what the fuck I do know. I have a special needs son. Is this the way we're treating people? He said, well, maybe you need to open up a clinic, motherfucker. Who y'all? I'm. I'm. Hmm. When you see somebody acting like that with somebody, say something. Fucking say something. Don't join in and laugh with them. Walmart and Hammond, Louisiana. You fucking pathetic. Put Our shit up. I'm like nothing from here. Let's go. And, sir, the one that they, um, decided to run out of Walmart tonight. I'm sorry that you got treated that way. I don't care if you were an addict. I don't care if you were an alcoholic or has special needs. Nobody fucking deserves that. If you're an employee for Walmart and Hammond, Louisiana, and you witness this tonight, if you were a customer and you witness this tonight and didn't stand up and say anything to these motherfuckers, you're just as fucking pathetic as that damn runner cop was"

So I'm walking around asking people if they had seen them. They're like, no. About 30 minutes later, the entire place had cleared out, and I was the last person there. Now, keep in mind that this is before cell phones. And also to note, I didn't have a wallet to make a pay call. Anyway, so I walked half a mile to a phone, and I called home, and no one answered. So I started calling my friends, because back then, we had to remember phone numbers. And so I called the numbers that I remembered until I finally got someone on the phone, and I said, hey, I got left here. Can you come pick me up? And they're like, yeah, yeah, I'll be there in, like, 30 minutes. So they came and picked me up and took me home. It was my high school graduation.",

    "voice_to_text": "You know, I love a whistleblower more than just about anything in the entire world. And an ER nurse is suing her former employer to Nova Healthcare in Clarksville, Tennessee. It's a federal lawsuit, I assume it's a wrongful termination lawsuit. Suing them for $7.5 million, claiming that it is retaliation after she refused to change documentation in patients charts. So the lawsuit claims that there were two cases in particular, one in which a male patient died of cardiac arrest in the triage area due to a lack of open beds and proper monitoring. Um, and she documented that there were not enough beds available. And the lawsuit claims that this was a violation of the Tennessee Public Protection Act and is an MTALA violation. The supervisor directed her afterwards to change her charting, to omit it because, quote, it gives a lawyer a case on a silver platter. And, quote, and in the second case, the patient was exhibiting signs of sepsis, needed treatment, was waiting for a pickline and treatment. Um, and I believe that they ended up dying because of a lack of treatment. And she documented there was a lack of safe staffing that LED to this, and she was told to omit that from the chart and refused, and one month later, she was terminated. So I am so glad that this nurse has, um, lawyered up. I am sure that the attorney is pointing her towards OSHA and the NLRB and all the things I'm gonna follow this case. Put someone put me in touch with her. Because, you know I love a whistleblower more than anything. And I hope she buys an island and retires after she wins this case. And never change your documentation. Your documentation is your documentation.",

They don't care that your babysitter didn't show up. They don't care that you just bought a house. This is coming from someone who sat on the executive board, with the CEO, with the C O O, with all of the higher UPS. They don't care. They don't care what you have going outside of work. It is about the result. It is about the deliverable. And the sooner you remove the emotion out of the work that you do, the further that you can go. Because when you start to think that they care if you had a bad day, then you give yourself an excuse to have a bad day. When you think that they hear that you're doing really well in your personal life, you give yourself an excuse. When you remove the emotion, you will go further. Show up, be passionate about the work that you were doing. If you are. If you don't care about the work you're doing, do the bare minimum, but take the emotion out of it. And stop people thinking that people care. It wasn't until I understood this that I doubled my salary and was able to get promoted. It sounds cold, but it's true.",

She said the school have decided that any people getting satisfactory or lower in any of their subjects are just not allowed to. To come. They have not being invited. Where do we stand on this? Oh, why call it satisfactory if it's not satisfactory to you? Yeah, this is the term that they used if it's satisfactory or lower. I think it's disgusting that schools are doing this in a world where we're trying to teach our children to be kind to each other and to just, you know, do their best. Do their best. Yeah. And then first thing and. And I heard with this. With. I read with this school that they like charging the. The children \u00a31 to go to this thing and then, you know, somebody's given a pound and then they get uninvited. Take your pound back because you're not invited. I think that's really mean, really nasty. Hi, Greg. Yeah, and a lot of parents have spoken up saying that with these children have missed out a lot due to Covid and everything else. And this really shouldn't be a Celebration of exam results. Like this should just be a Celebration of school. I finished school. Yeah, it's finished school. I think it's What it's doing is promoting more anxiety and more upset and, you know, I, I remember I wasn't allowed to go to my, it wasn't called a prom, it was called the, the end of school disco. But because of my upbringing, my, my religious upbringing, I wasn't allowed to go to like, parties and, you know, listen to that sort of music and, and stuff, so. And I've always, I, I, I was at home crying and thinking, oh, what are they doing? You know what, what are my friends doing that I went to school with? Yeah, I, I had a big FOMO, um, time and, and it was like, I think I, I felt it was unfair as well because that, we had a conversation, um, last week about, are your siblings treated differently? My brother was allowed to go to the end of school. Ah. Ah, cause he's, he's a boy, so it was kind of different. But with a girl, I don't know what they thought I was gonna do, but I just wanted to go, you know, to have my T-shirt written on and take some phone numbers for my friends. Is that a book? Yeah. I've never been to one because back in my day we just didn't have them at all. So you wore t shirts? You have. I never got to go to one either. What? Oh my god, yes, absolutely. I was on the committee that helped organise let me Tell you. And it was a very, very good one. Right, that is it. I am sorting this. We're having a Loose Women prom. What about?

And then it happened again, and she sees somebody, like, walking by, and my mom was like, what? What the heck is going on? My mom just gets this really weird feeling, and she goes into my grandma's room, and she's like, hey, mom, are you okay? And my grandma was like, did you see him? And my mom was like, yeah, mom, I saw him. He starts speaking to it. Start saying, hey, I Think I know who you are. We're not ready for her to go. And my mom said that it was a cloaked figure.

And my question is, which states that abortion is okay to remove an ectopic pregnancy? Can you explain to me why that exception is in there? To me, it would be common sense to put that language in here. But a child who is in fact living out part of his or her early life as the unfortunate circumstance of being an ectopic pregnancy is in fact still a unique human being with its own DNA. And I wonder, I guess I just don't understand why we've created an exception where we allow those children to be murdered, but not the others. Remember, our goal is to protect unborn children. The implication, or the unstated implication, would be we want to protect unborn children, except those who are the product of rape or incest or those who happen to be in an ectopic pregnancy. And I wonder how we square that with the idea of justice for all and that we're killing a person because his daddy was a rapist or an ancestral creep."

Maybe if black mothers would stop having random children with random men without being married and having a family to keep that child in, there wouldn't be so many black children to adopt. Also, while you're on the internet running your mouth, how many children can you adopt? Probably zero, because you don't qualify. Because you have to have a family. You have to be financially sound. See, this is how the process works. First they reach out to the immediate family, any blood relatives, and try to get somebody to take that child. That didn't work. Then they try to find a child which a family they can connect with. Same race. That didn't work, and they had no choice but to put the child with a white T family who was willing to take the child. So instead of asking why are YT people adopting black people, why don't you ask why there's so many black children up for adoption? Aren't y'all the most educated? Aren't y'all making the most money that any other group of black women have ever made? So why aren't you adopting black babies?",

If the week before you menstruate, you are so depressed that you can't function, you have debilitating anxiety, you struggle to get out of bed. Or on the flip side, you have insomnia and cannot sleep, you're prone to bursting into tears, and you have thoughts about. That's not regular PMS. You have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. And I know that this doesn't apply to everybody, okay? I know that it doesn't apply to everybody. But I am saying this because, oh, my god, I wish when I was 20 years old that there was someone who looked me in the eye and said, you're not insane. You have a mood disorder. My first doctor was basically like, you can go on the pill or you can go off the pill. We don't know what's gonna happen. Good luck. Hey, hey. There's gotta be a better way to figure that out, right? Every doctor between her and the last one that I went to just told me that I should exercise more during the week before I get my period. And I said, during the week where it's impossible for me to get out of bed. And they said, yeah, as hard as it was for me to get a diagnosis, I know that there are people out there where it's a million times harder for them because they don't have the privilege that I do. Okay, So I'm looking you in your eye and I'm telling you, you're not crazy. You're not wrong. It makes me fucking furious that there are states out there who believe that they understand a human body with a uterus so well that they can enact laws about it. Meanwhile, I'm running around town for half a decade trying to get a doctor to even look my way for something that makes me wanna, oh, once every three weeks, stop writing fucking bills about us and do more research.",

And I write about that in my last book, The Laws of Human Nature. You can see that in certain people at a very early age. Great psychoanalyst Melanie Klein identified the greedy baby at the age of six months. Wow, that was already sucking so hard on the mother's breasts. And she saw that this type of baby turned into the type that was actually very aggressive in life. So it's inbred very early on. People like that have patterns of behavior they cannot control. But those people with those kind of intentions, who are very manipulative, I believe very firmly, ultimately they hit a wall. They piss so many people off. They don't know the soft side of power. They have no self control, cause all they know is grab, grab, grab, push, push, push. They don't know when to yield, they don't know when to step back.",

And this was a really common sentiment in those comments. So if you were a Gen X or an elder millennial, I'd love to know did you feel that you were wanted by your parents, or did you feel that they treated you as nothing more than a societal obligation and a tax break? And if it's the latter, how did that shape you? How did that change your life, and how did that shape the way you relate to children and families? Because I've seen a number of folks commenting that they chose not to have kids specifically because of how they were treated as children, and that the coldness and lack of affection from their parents really made it difficult to have relationships with other adults as well. So did you feel that you were wanted by your parents, or did you feel like you were just an obligation?",

I talked about how I totally understand why the adult children of boomers and Silent Gen parents do not wanna care for their elderly parents, especially if they were toxic, and how we're not obligated to do that. So I took care of my elderly father through the process of him having dementia, and in doing so I joined a support group for adult children of aging and dying parents. An elderly parents threatening to disinherit kids unless they gave their free labor to be caregivers was a pretty common refrain. And I wonder what that says about the kind of relationship that Boomer and Silent Gen parents have with their kids and with Bunny. It really speaks to how broken that parent child relationship is that they think we only care about them for their money. Because maybe they only care about us for what we can give them in terms of labor. I think it's really telling.",

Many years ago, a year into our relationship, lockdown hit and we were forced with the decision to lock down together or not. It was also during this time that my amazingly brave dad got diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and the years that followed turned out to be the hardest years of my life, juggling work and being a carer full time. I've been teasing my boyfriend about getting married, but I just knew it wasn't the right time as my focus was making my dad feel comfy and safe in the last year of his life. I knew dad loved my boyfriend as his only communication with us at the end was a thumbs up and he would always do that to my boyfriend when he came to see him. Very sadly, but extremely peacefully, my dad passed away on November 5th, 2023 with me. I can't cope. I can't cope with the parent once. I cannot deal with them. I was extremely emotional. But to come downstairs on the morning of my birthday to see a story book, my boyfriend and maid of our life together tipped me over the edge. Can't get up, can't get up. On the last page of the book was a picture of him and one knee. Two weeks before my dad died, my boyfriend had the moment my dad alone told him his plan and My dad gave him the strongest thumbs up he'd ever given. Oh, my God."

Listen, I am now piecing those wise words together, because how are you trying to hate on someone inside a building that you cannot even get into? The bouncer will not let you inside of the club. When we are talking, you cannot hear us. Neither can we hear you. So why are you hating? The point that I'm trying to make here is there is a group of people here on TikTok. Every single time I open this app from sunrise to sun down, they are literally talking about Doctor Z. That woman lives rent free in people's minds. Do you know how mad that is? At this point, it is literally cyberbullying. They are bullying the woman. They're trying so hard to chip at her until she is so tiny. But listen, how can you hate from outside of the club? You cannot even get in. You can't even get in the conversations and the places that she is going to. You cannot even get there. So what's with all of this hatred? It. It. It is blowing my mind right now. But, yo, rent free, we live in your like. This is called perpetual living. You've been your secret tonight. You've been your bossy, bossy, bossy money. Not tonight. Oh, when I ain't got your T T. Oh, when I ain't got your. Pull up now. So, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Okay, it is giving. Bullying is giving. High school. You're grown. Just stop it.

Someone use punctuation and attacks anxiety. And yet you have no problem generalizing that an entire generation can be awful. So they're the worst. Number two, do we know you? Have we offended you somehow? Did we do something to you? Fuck Gen X, by the way. Where the hell did he come from? You motherfuckers really trying to look, get under the radar, ain't they? Under the radar? When it comes to the world that large, our entire life history, borders are non existence. I think there is a generation that we're leaving out. See? Fuck Gen X. Ow! Again with that? They suck. Genetic sucks because they do. I'm sensing a common string of hostility here. Is it possible they hate us cause they can't be us?"

And Mike's last fight was an exhibition and those punches looked more like soft kisses. I don't know, I think this is his easiest match yet cause he obviously has more power and skill and like this fight's gonna get ugly quick.

If the kid says I prefer he him, I prefer she her and you actually use that felony offender, those found guilty under House Bill 2 8 8 5 would be subject to a ten thousand dollar fine imprisonment placement on the state's. The registry is a tier 1 sex offender and obviously since offenders are not allowed to reside within 500 feet of a school or daycare, they would end the teacher's career. That is the most ignorant thing I've heard in a long time."

It\u2019s a form of compassion that formed out of necessity.  It helped us diffuse a volatile situation.  It helped survive.  But this can become a pattern that we unconsciously copy and paste onto various situations throughout the rest of our lives \u2014 relationships, friendships, work dynamics\u2026. Situations where we actually have the autonomy to stand up for ourselves, and prioritize our own energy.  While that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the pattern will change overnight, it\u2019s just an invitation to notice.  Where are you repeating this pattern, where it\u2019s not totally needed?

What the hell are y'all so mad about? Why you always claiming that everything is about white supremacy and racism? You know damn well it's not.

East Coast, West Coast. Then we took it into the 2. We had cash money. Back that ass up. You lived on my couch, I lived on yours. I ate dinner with your family, you ate dinner with mine. We worked together, we lived together, we went to school together. Again, I'm gonna ask you, what are you so angry about? That ain't self inflicted, is it? Because Donald Trump came down that gold escalator, you cried, you told us he's racist, and we told you, no, he's not. Hey, we just went on, y'all, 30 years of co signing for him telling us he wasn't racist. It's gonna take more than a because I said so to convince us. Come on, it ain't too late.

It's three movies in the from the future that haven't even been mentioned. Guys, the first movie is called My Lawyer is a tornado. And it's literally a tornado that's a lawyer, and he always ends up messing everything up in court, and he's basically an accident's attorney. So, I mean, you can imagine where that's gonna go. I don't wanna give anything away or the spoilers or anything, but it's called My Lawyer is a tornado. It's coming out in 20. Whatever. I don't know. It sucks. It's a sucky movie. On to the next number two movie that's gonna come out is My Sister's Crimes. And it's about conjoined twins. Literally, they're attached by the hip. And one of the conjoined twins is a murderer. And guess who's the investigator behind the murders? It's her conjoined sister. And she's trying to figure out the crimes of her sister. And the murder is literally attached to her hip. I mean, it's a mind boggling freaking movie with a huge plot twist. Guys, I'm excited for you guys to see that one. That one's really good, actually. This movie is gonna freaking absolutely be a classic. Starship Santa. After societies collapse and everybody on earth has to move to spaceships out in space to survive. Santa still has to go deliver his packages and his gifts to people. So he creates a sled that's also like a spaceship rocket thing, and he's out in space delivering all these gifts. It's the Christmas spirit, but in space. And it becomes an instant classic. Top three. Better than Home Alone and jingle all the way and Christmas Story. Guys, I'm excited for you guys to see these movies. And those are the posters that I just showed you.",

They're bisexual. And then you have other women who only date white guys. I've been doing a lot of research, and I can't find out the signs. And if the crazy thing is, with black women or mixed black and white women, it's very easy to see the sign. Black and white women are black women, right? They were either adopted by white people, they. That if they were biracial, they were only raised by, like, the white side of their family. They just had a lot of white friends growing up, and they kind of just, like, assimilated. But with white people, it's not that simple. I'mma give you the perfect example. I know a girl, white girl. She. Both parents in the household, right? Both her parents are white. She grew up with white friends. Her best friend that she's known the longest is white. The other one is also white. But check this out. Are you ready for this? She said that she was in middle school, she was watching Camp Rock 2, and the. The black guy, the one of the lead actors or whatever. She said she saw him for the first time, didn't know what it was about him, but she loved it. And then from then on, there she Was just chasing men that looked like him. And then as she got older, she realized that she just likes melanin. Now I have a theory. White people, you can fact check me on this. I think it's genetic. I think if you see homegirl, she's into black guys. There's a 99 point 99% chance her mom was also into black guys. Now I'm not saying white guys aren't like this, I'm just saying it's a lot less common. If I see a white guy who strictly into black women, I'm gonna assume he went to HBCU. Haha."

My brain always thinks of, like, the worst possible case scenarios, right? And so when I had surgery recently, I. I said to the anesthesiologist beforehand, I was like, well, what happens if I get to zero and I'm still awake? Like, do I signal, or what do I do? And she was like, oh, that won't happen. And I was like, I'm not. I don't mean that like an insult. I'm not. I'm sure you are amazing at your job. I wanna be very clear that I have confidence in you or wouldn't be doing this.

They played a video, him getting my like, three niggas. Surprising information about the music industry and what he's been involved in over the past couple of decades. Many people already know that Chris has a controversial reputation, but his latest claims are shocking even for him. He's accusing Diddy, another big name in the industry, of pressuring artists into being gay. According to Chris, these rumors aren't just whispers. Other people have also come forward to confirm them. These revelations have caused quite a stir, especially because they touch on sensitive issues within the music business. It's unclear what the full impactivation for a long time, and some of his older collaborations have only added to the rumors. A notable example is his work with Blood Orange, also known as Devante Hines, on the song hope. In the music video, there's a scene where two actors share an intimate moment while Diddy sings about wanting a specific kind of love. This raised questions about what he was trying to express, leading fans to wonder about his personal desires. These moments, along with other hints and rumors, have kept Diddy's personal life in the spotlight. Despite all the speculation, he is not publicly clarified his sexuality, which has only fueled curiosity. People continue to watch his actions and collaborations closely to figure out what might be behind The scenes. Yeah, I love this drink. I like when you like this, daddy, daddy. I like when you scrambling and scraping shit. I like that. Diddy's personal life has drawn attention on more than one occasion. There have been rumors that he's romantically linked with Will Smith, another celebrity who has faced speculation about his sexuality. These rumors gained momentum when it was reported that Diddy hosted gay parties where he and Will Smith were seen having a wild time. In 2016, social media buzzed with claims from Alexis, the ex wife of actor Will Smith, who said she divorced him after catching him in bed with record executive Benny Medina. The timing of these allegations couldn't have been worse. Will Smith and his wife Jada had just announced they would boycott the Oscars to protest the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Alexis, Will's ex wife, claimed that on the set of the movie Six Degrees of separation, will allegedly threw a tantrum when asked to kiss another man. Despite the various claims, the rumors about Will Smith's sexuality persist in the media and on social networks. Diddy and Will Smith aren't the only prominent figures in hip hop speculated to be gay. During an interview, 50 Cent, known for his bold opinions, took aim at Jay Z, comparing him to the late painter Basquiat, whom he referred to as gay. Meanwhile, rapper Rick Ross recently voiced his support for the LGBTQ community, adicating for more representation of gay artists in hip hop. In a Positive tone Ross encouraged gay rappers to follow their dreams and be themselves. However, 50 Cent stirred controversy by posting suggestive photos on Instagram hinting that both Diddy and Rick Ross might be gay, leading to a wave of online debate and speculation.",

So, number one, men, for some reason, some men, not all, think that, like, you're entitled to thinking that they're attractive. Like, hold on. Like, if a man came up to me at a bar and I said that I wasn't interested because, like, I didn't think he was cute or whatever, they kind of act like it's insane that you're not attracted to them because the you're fat and they were throwing you a bone. Genuinely, I've had really ugly ass men act like they were doing me a favor by flirting with me. Just because I'm fat does not change the fact that you look like you were hatched from an egg, buddy. Like, I don't know what to tell you. Also, dating apps. Not funny either, because I am so terrified of, like, fatfishing someone. I don't even know if that's a thing. Whatever. I put full body photos on all my dating profiles. I like to share my Instagram or, like, YouTube so they can, like, literally see me and know what I look like. And yet I've still canceled so many first days because I was like, oh, my god, what if they don't know I'm fat? Also having to be worried about everyone that matches with you or picks you up in a bar, whatever. That they're just, like, fetishizing fat people. That's. There's Just so much to think about when it comes to dating as a fat, and I. I'm tired. Also, the type of men that love fat women are, like, gym bros. I don't know why this is a thing. Are you looking for, like, a new client to train? What? Like, I mean, I don't mind, but, like, I just think it's weird. Also, I hope that this is just me, because honestly, it would make me really sad if other girls feel like this, but why does having a crush on someone who doesn't like you back make you feel like a fucking monster? Like, I literally feel, like, Grody when I think about the fact that, like, I'm like, oh, my god, this person must be so grossed out that I have a crush on that. Like, literally. What?"

    "voice_to_text": "There are certain things that your employer cannot do. My name is Craig Levey and I'm an employment law attorney and here are three examples. First, your employer cannot prevent you from discussing your wages with your coworkers. The National Labor Relations Act, or NLRA, is a federal law that states that employees are allowed to discuss their wages with their coworkers, and companies cannot retaliate against employees for doing so. So if you are an employee that is covered by that law and your company has a policy that states you cannot discuss your wages with your coworkers, that is unenforceable. Second, your employer cannot terminate your employment because you complained about something illegal going on at work. For example, many employees complain about sexual harassment or discrimination at work and are retaliated against because of that. There's a federal law to protect you in that case, and also many state laws. Also, there are federal and state whistleblower laws which protect individuals if they make certain complaints that categorize them as a whistleblower. And third, your employer cannot terminate your employment because you make an OSHA complaint stating that they aren't in compliance with certain health and safety standards. Far too often I see employees make complaints with OSHA and the company responds by retaliating, often terminating the employees employment."

I go out with my friends. I don't drive. Okay? We're obviously drinking. So I'm like, I'm gonna Uber home. Whatever. I live in Miami Lakes. I was in Coconut Grove. I get into this Uber with this woman, and she starts taking a super weird route. Did not make sense where she was going, but I was like, maybe, like, she's taking backstreets. I'm not sure what was happening. All of a sudden, I end up at Miami International Airport. Okay, there's no, like, way that, like, that's a stop on the way to my house. Number one. Number two, if you work at an airport, if you know about airports, you know that that's not, like, an area that you pass through. Like, that's. That's. You're gonna go there for a reason. So I really do believe that I was in a situation where I was about to get human trafficked. So. Because I'm realizing this as you're calling me from the phone, and I. And I'm like, I feel in a very sad situation. And I asked the lady, while I'm on the phone with my friend, I'm like, I feel that. I, like. I'm like, ma'am, like, why? What's up with GPS in Spanish? And she's like, cease by. My heart sank, my heart draw. I was ignorant. It was like a movie. Like, I generally. I have goosebumps. Like I'm freaking out. Like, I'm freaking out. Long story short, she was. I end up asking her again. I'm on the phone, my friend. She's like, oh, I don't know. This is, like, the route that it's taking me on. And we're, like, entry, like, departures, arrivals. I literally manually unlock the car, hopped out of the car, and start running. I'm on the phone, my friend around there. I was like, you need to get somewhere where, like, there's people, you know. Then he starts chasing me in her car. She's like, I have four kids. Like, you're safe. Like, you're safe with me. And I'm like, if you don't get away from me, I'm gonna fucking call 9 1 1 right now. I end up seeing, like, the parking department of the airport, and the security guard was like, is everything okay? Like, it seemed like if you got into a fight with a boyfriend, I know that was Uber. She's like. He was like, do you live, like, by the airport? I go, no, I live maybe lakes. He was like, there's a lot of huge trafficking that happens, and, like, there's airport hotels, and she probably was gonna take him to her portal. Long story short, I'm home and I'm safe, and god was with me today. But I wanted to share this video because you don't know, like, who's out there and what The heck is going on? And statistically, Miami is one of the hotspots where you were trafficking. I'm really blessed I'm okay and I'm safe. But just please be careful. If you're gonna get an Uber, make sure you're with someone. Um, and just, like, please be safe. Love you guys.",

And people were sharing normal jokes like, why did the Eminem go to school? Cause he wanted to be a smarty. Ha ha ha! And then it got to me and I said, well, back in the First World War, there was these two best mates called Tracy and Susan. And Susan goes around to Tracy's house on her birthday. And then the postman comes and he says, I've got a telegram for you, Tracy. And Tracy goes, oh, what about? And he goes, well, it's a singing telegram. And she goes, oh, go on, sing it then. And he goes, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Tracy, happy birthday to you. And Tracy says, all post, you've made my day. And then on Susan's birthday, Tracy goes around Susan's house and the postman shows up and says, I've got a telegram for you. And Susan goes, oh, sing it. And he goes, I don't think I should sing it. And she goes, oh, go on, sing it. He goes, it's not really a telegram that I can sing. And then Tracy goes, go on, you Did it on my birthday. Sing at the flipping telegram. And so the postman goes, da da da, da, da, da, da da, Charlie! And the kids are dead.

    "voice_to_text": "The used car market is about to crash. Carmax just released its earnings report and it's bad. Know it's bad when Carmax releases an earnings report showing their down 5.6 billion dollars in sales. And that isn't even the worst part about the report. Oh no, no. Being down in sales is not gonna be signaling the collapse of the car market. What's gonna be signaling the collapse of the car market is their inventory issues. I know everybody's been saying the car market is gonna crash for years, but this is a huge sign from Carmax. Again, $5.6 billion in sales is the least of Carmax's problems as this year is looking grim for them. Now we could say that's something to do with Brooke situation. But we'll move on and actually talk about inventory, as inventory has one of the biggest issues for Carmax today. For example, they're buying less cars. They bought 14% less cars from consumers, meaning they want less inventory. Let me show you why. Ask you a question. This is a car that Carmax is selling right now. And they have a lot just like this. The 2024 RAV4 Hybrid XLE listed at $39,998. Would you buy this car knowing that you could buy a brand new RAV4 XLE right down the street for 38,543? And that's before negotiating. I'm getting like three to four thousand dollars off these on a consistent basis. People are not gonna buy these cars from Carmax and it's not Because Carmax is being super greedy. They overpaid for a lot of inventory, and they're about to feel the pain. The new car market has already collapsed, but the used car market is coming next. Expect used car prices to drop drastically throughout the year as Carmax's prices start to fall.",

Or they'll say things like, it's your own little built in best friend. And then when you have your daughter, they'll say, oh, she's so beautiful, just like her mother. So beautiful. And then when she becomes a toddler, that's when the comments of, oh, you think she's bad now? Wait until the teenage years. And then as she gets older, they'll continue to say those types of things. Uh, I thought my daughter and I were gonna be best friends, but then who? Those teenage years. Oh, I don't envy you. I'm glad I had all boys cause, oh, those teenage years. I thought I was gonna unalive my daughter or myself because of those teenage years. Yes, that is something that has been said to me cause those teenage years. But you know what people really don't warn you about? It's kind of a secret. Nobody talks about it and nobody prepares you for it. Because once she's passed the baby years, the toddler years, the child years, and she starts getting into those pre teen years, nobody warns you or tells you or prepares you for the looks that grown men give your daughter. And at first, when she's about 9, 10 years old, when they look at her and you look up at Them. And they know. Did you know what they're doing? They look away at first, you know, when she's 9 and 10. But when she's 11, 12, 13, you can stare them down and they still look at her. You can look at them as if you're going to rip their fucking head off. If they continue to look at your precious child. If they continue to look at the only thing that you love in this world more than yourself. You look at them and you give them this look of, I'm going to end you. If you continue to look at her, they continue to do it. Once they hit a certain age, men don't care if you stare them down or not, if you call them out or not, they'll continue to look. That's what nobody prepared me for when I had a daughter.",

This morning, you're drinking, like, 32 coffees, and you're a walking human time bomb. You're going to ruin the pants you were wearing, and they were, like, nice. They were like Bonobo socks. Not really my vibe or taste, but those are, like, running you like, what, like 68 bucks? Let's not. You need. I almost said something to you. Not everyone they get does a good job of separating the concentrate bottles from the individual serving bottles, and you have fallen victim to that. But you are going to Kool Aid man through a wall later if you don't stop drinking that. You can't be doing that. You're probably thinking, wow, this is really strong. It's a little bitter. Yeah, it's supposed to be caught with water. That's like, 32 coffees. I need you to party on to turn around and go help him.

Also, now that they're fucking blocked, let's get into the video because I would like to talk shit today. Something that throws me off when I first meet people, or even when I go out with people, are people who will never, like, shut nobody down for you. Like people who think you're just desperate as fuck. If a man comes up to us as a group and he yells out loud to you, to me, to everybody who could hear, oh, she fine as fuck for a big bitch. What's her number? And you all out of my year, girl, give him your number. Give him your number. You don't like me? You. You think I'm desperate as fuck? If someone who you have fucked with in the past wants to fuck with me? Why would you tell me to go fuck with the. I don't want them. Like, bitch, I don't want nothing you touched. No, I'm cool. I promise you, I'm cool. If a man who, you know, after he came up to me and I declined because his breath stunk, I said, not his breath stink. And you said, yeah, did, bitch, when he was talking to me and he asked me for your Instagram, that shit was stinky. Well, why would you tell him? Come over here and talk to me. Something about that pisses me off. Why would I want a man who you slept with? Why would I want a man who you dealt with any time in the past? Or who wanted you first even though you don't want them? Why would I want a man that you don't want? Those type of people literally look at you as left because now you're cut off because you're weird. Literally, if your friend know a man, I shit he look like shit. They will not try to put you on with them. They would literally be like, nah, she cool. I know my homegirls would never. I'd be like, not a cool, I promise they good. And the men be mad over that. And you know, there be a little stigma. Oh, the fat friend, annoying ass fat friend. I'll be that. Cause I rather be that than a fake ass bitch. So yeah, sorry.",

I just want shot. I just want y'all just hear me out. I just want y'all to slow it down and realize that social media isn't real life. Pull up all you fucking stat. One in six women will be attacked by a man her lifetime. Only 1 in 1 million people have a chance to be attacked by a bear. Let's think about this. You live with and walk past in your life, probably hundreds of thousands of men. You will probably never fucking just walk past a bear. All right? So no shit. Okay. I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, Chance, and I'm gonna walk up on a Kodiak bear. What the fuck? Limb to none. Ever in life? Never. You go to the zoo? Fuck you talk about? That's one. That's proximity. The way y'all bring this shit up is ridiculous. The way that that should have been, the way that question should have been asked. Would you rather be in the lost in the woods with a bear that wants to kill you or a man that wants to kill you? The bear that wants to harm you or a man that wants to harm you? But you could get the real fucking answers. I never hit a woman violently. I never put a violent Hand on a woman. I never sexually assaulted a woman. No, none of that, ever. Now, I never even called a woman out of her fucking name. Not to her face. I think all that is terrible and wrong, but y'all acting like men are scarier than bears. You ain't watch enough nature documentaries, baby. Oh, watch the one where they trying to get the pictures of that big ass bear any. And the light from the flash scares them and. And a startled bear. I swear to fucking god, the earth moved when he got startled. Let's go. Just go watch a few fucking videos. The way y'all be. The way y'all. Boy, you dumb as hell.",

So being a 54 year old male teacher giving your cell phone number to 4 6th graders total. Uh huh. So they can call you anytime they need. Meanwhile you are sending good morning text, good night text, how was your day text. Sending songs that remind you of them. Uh huh. To me, this is very inappropriate. Very inappropriate. No school teacher, male or female, should be giving a student their number. Period. It's very unprofessional. I think it's very tacky. I think it's enticing a minor. In my personal opinion, it is my opinion. But how about this? Was your child and you found out? Not good. Child told you you were going through a child's phone, you found the messages and you confronted the child. Cause the child, the child is so innocent to a degree that they put the teacher's name in the phone. Mr. So and so child has never sent one inappropriate message, but has received dozens. I mean, dozens of inappropriate messages you reported to the school, and the school in turn pulls all four girls in. Well, pulls several. Several girls didn't find out. Four girls particularly have the number. Nobody else. Just four girls. Those four girls all admit to being treated so much differently than the rest of the students. But here's. Here's the. The plot twist. The teacher is being called A victim in this. And the four students are be called. Are we are called. Four students are being called suspects in the whole situation. The teacher cannot be charged with anything because he's done nothing wrong. But give his cell phone number out. Even though I think for a 54 year old man to be texting a child that he's not related to. How is your morning? Beautiful. Sweet dreams. Beautiful. This song reminds me of you. Beautiful. Body like a Back Road. Is not a song you should send to a child. Uh huh. You were made for me. It's not a song to be sent to a child. And that's worth it. In Patty cake, Bakerspan or loop Deloo. My darling. I don't think you should send a child any damn thing. I'm just confused how the sheriff's department thinks this is. Children are suspects and this teacher is a victim. What the actual fuck? Let me know your opinion.",

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so we have to talk about this. If you're unaware, this is the public school grading scale in California, and this is fucking insane. So according to the grading scale they're using today, 84 to 100 is an A, 64 to 84 is a B, 44 to 64 is a C, 24 to 44 is a D, and anything below 24% is a fail. And if this is how we're gonna grade children today, let's just fucking sell everything to China, cause we're fucked as a society. I don't know about you, but as my name says, I'm an older millennial. I was born in 83 and graduated high school in O2. When I went to school, this was my grading scale. Fact this looks like it was on fucking Parchment does not help my complex about being old. But regardless, let's look at the fucking difference. So to get an A, I needed A 95 to 100, B was 88 to 94, C was 80 to 87, D was 70 to 79. 69 and below was failing. Let's be real, that means the only people that would be passing for my time is the people who are currently getting an A. And about half the people who are getting a B. The other half of B as well as everyone else would have failed. And for me, on this scale, C is where it gets ridiculous. There are plenty of people out there in my time who were just C level students. They weren't especially smart, but they also weren't especially dumb. No, for me, see, was always just the average people. I figured that the average people were able to answer about 80% of the shit they Learned correctly. But now you can get more wrong than you do right and still have a C. You have to think that's what 44% means. That means that of all the questions you were given, you got 56% of them wrong. You got more wrong then you did right, and you're still a C student. That is fucking stupid. And D is even worse, because getting a D in California means that you got 76% of everything wrong and you're still going to graduate. You have to get 77% of everything wrong to fail. Here's the thing. I don't ever wanna work with someone who got 77% of everything wrong. I don't even wanna work with somebody who got 56% of everything wrong. Right now in California, these motherfuckers are graduating high school. This is the future generations of our society. We are gonna have a generation of people in this country who are graduating high school and college while getting 75% of everything wrong. And that is fucking horrifying."

All the pretenders and the contenders, they're all there. But the last yard of life, last mile of journey, ain't nobody but you and your shadow.

Artists nationally are struggling to fill their books, and when they do, they're littered with last minute cancellation. But why? Some artists have made videos claiming that it's social media suppression. Some have ranted saying that it's an over saturated market with too many tattoo artists and tattoo shops. I don't think it's either. So what can we do? Will lowering day rates and offering deals remedy this situation? Will changing the dated, industry wide outlook on how we use social media be the solution? Or do some artists need to swallow their ego and start doing small tattoos again for a much more affordable price to make sure they make ends meet? This isn't the first recession the tattoo industry is faced and it won't be the last. We have to adapt and overcome to get through this together. But the question is how?

I'm like, okay, that sentence has you two steps away from filling, so i'mma stop you right there. I say, miss, this freak is not in our class. And of course, everyone's like, you snitch!

Things were gyrating, okay? Like grown women were on their feet hooting and hollering at the AMC and flashing the screen while their Diet Coke and popcorn with M and m's in it were, like, spilling over. This was revolutionary, this. Nothing like this will happen cinematically, I, I don't think ever again. You know what I mean? Like you saw those clips of when the Spider Man's all came together.

Well, guess who the fuck hit me up last night? Yep, you called it, Josh. The one who tried sticking the Hydro Flask in me. When I tell you, this man has the audacity. This man has the motherfucking audacity. Oh, my god. He texts me and he said, hey. As soon as I saw the hey, like, I. I, like, knew. I knew right then and there that he saw the video. And I replied, of course. And I said, hi. And this man, this man says. He says to me, round two. Round two for what, buddy? I didn't respond because, no, like, what, Josh, if you're watching this video, I obviously wasn't into it. I made a story time about how weird it was. And also to all the people that said, I'm kink shaming. I never keep shame. I just. It really caught me off guard. And to be honest, it still catches me off guard. I'm sorry, but I'm not sticking a water bottle inside of me. That's, for one, dangerous. For two, it's just not my thing. Okay, if you wanna stick water bottle inside of you, go ahead, like.",

And I was like, okay, great, sounds good. Like, that's a normal occurrence, right? Um, so I go back to little hair wash station with her, and she's washing my hair. Everything seems normal. And then I start noticing, like, all the other people who work there are, like, looking over at us and, like, sort of whispering, and they're like, this one girl goes and grabs another girl, and they're, like, talking amongst each other, and, like, I'm like, something is up. Like, what is going on? So then I see one of the girls go and grab the manager, and she says something to the manager, and the manager looks over, and, like, it's this weird look on her face. And she comes walking over to us, and she says, ma'am, what are you doing? And at first I think she's talking to me, and I'm like, what? And then I realize she's talking to the girl who's washing my hair, and the girl just says, sorry, immediately stops what she's doing, and runs out. And I'm like, what just happened? Well, apparently that Girl washing my hair didn't work for the salon. The salon has no idea who she is. They apologized profusely, which, I mean, it wasn't their fault, I guess, but I'm so weirded out. Like, what just happened? I, I, I have no words. But anyway, they got an actual employee to come and wash my hair, and then I got my haircut."

And no, a cruise is not an excursion per se, but a cruise is something that you wanna be there. All you wanna already be there. You don't wanna be flying in. If you live somewhere else. The day that your crews take off, anything can happen. And when you get mad at the flight attendants, you are really getting mad at the wrong person. Because the flight attendants don't have any control of why there is a delay on the plane. Unless, um, they just late on, get it to the play. There have been situations where planes have been delayed because it was a shortage of crew members. They were waiting for pilots. They was waiting for, you know, some of the crew to get there.

Let me explain. Okay? Let me explain. Okay, so if we go back a few years, right? I was working at, um. I was working at a freaking, like, call center, right? I was working at a call center, and a friend of mine found this job on Craigslist. So he found his job on Craigslist, and the job was doing quality assurance and, like, performance improvement, all of that stuff, all that jazz, right? And so one by one, we started applying, and we all got the job. Fast forward. I was like, I was in the job. It was paying this, like, $12 an hour or whatever, and I was in the job, and I started researching, like, what we were doing, and I was like, wait a minute. People get paid a lot more for doing the same exact thing we were doing. Like, a lot more. So I started teaching myself over the years how to do everything. I did it. I would spend nights on YouTube, learning how to interview, learning how to write my resume, learning how to do Excel, learning how to do Powerpoint. And so I was, like, on my computer, I was literally, like, downloading everything and, like, practicing with how to do all Of this stuff, learning how to present myself as, like, in an interview, learning what to say, learning what each interview question means, learning how to basically say. Learning how to do better as far as, you know, answering situational questions and things like that. So, listen, so as I'm learning all of this, right, I'm perfecting my. My resume along the way. And so I start applying for, like, more jobs. And, you know, I would say it was weird at first, because it wasn't that I didn't have that much experience. I got my big break. I got my big break when I got my very first seeing Emma's job, working at IT company. And I had just. Just came from a freaking call center, bro. I came from a call center, and they hired me. That was my very first cute, like, real quality job. Did it. Did it. And YouTube. I Learned everything from YouTube. And so I Learned was like, okay, well, you know, I need to fluff up my resume, make myself a. Look a little better than what I am, make sure I position myself as a leader in this field. And, baby, let me tell you something. YouTube got me here. YouTube got me here. And now look at me. Now look at me. YouTube. If you want it bad enough, you do anything to get it. True story.",

So, of course, I got started making them right away. Mixed together all my dry ingredients and my butter before going out to harvest my strawberries. These were perfectly ripe. I can't believe I actually grew these here. So I grabbed those and then got some milk and eggs for my chickens, and I diced up my strawberries, added those to my bowl, added a bit of lemon zest. Did you guys know I'm proficient at juggling? Added my chicken, milk and egg eggs. Really combined everything. Then formed it into a little disc on some Parchment paper before cutting it into eight little triangles, added a bit of egg wash for some shine, and got started on my glaze, which was just powdered sugar, lemon juice, and some homemade vanilla extract. I personally love a dollop of whipped cream on a scone. Whipped cream on anything is good. So I whipped up some of that by hand. We did the goods, added a bit of embellishment, and then had a little taste test, and these were delicious.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm gonna be honest and let you in on a secret I used to be scared of Black folks and yes this also means there was a lot of anti Blackness and racism that I've had to unpack in my life over the past 30 something years and I'm gonna start out with some background not as an excuse for why I felt that way for a long time but as context so I grew up in Alabama in a time where there wasn't that much diversity in the state even less than there is now and in my elementary school it was maybe like a couple Asians and a couple Black students on my third day of kindergarten I was cornered in the bathroom by a fellow student who was Black  and she beat me up to this day I don't know why she did what she did but it doesn't really matter at the end of the day it happened and it influenced how I felt about Black people for a long time not to mention my family being Korean I grew up with a lot of harmful stereotypes about Black folks that they are good at dancing and sports and it was mostly because my family didn't know that many Black folks so these preconceived notions were all from media and things that we had seen otherwise on TV when this changed was when I entered college and yeah that was a long time to hold those views but that fear was also what kept me back from becoming closer to anyone who was Black  beyond a mere acquaintance I went to a PWI and it wasn't that much different from how I had grown up I grew up around mostly white communities and when I went to this PWI it was a sudden culture shock not because it was a largely white private little arts college but because there was suddenly a huge class divide as well in the communities of my K through 12 education most people were around the same similar income bracket even though I was always on the lower end of the scale but when I went to college and they happened to room me with one of the like other 10 Korean students I couldn't relate to my roommate at all and it's ironic because I live in California now but that's where my roommate was from and she was so different from me not just income bracket wise but I could not relate to this fellow Korean student despite what the college wanted me to do and what ended up happening was I made friends with my roommate's  college classmate for one of their classes together and Sam came over and we became really really good friends in fact Sam was my first really best friend in life and she taught me a lot and we're still in touch today we're still really really good friends today but it single handedly changed how I felt and single handedly taught me so much of what I thought was true ended up being wrong and the thing about our friendship was I don't realize we had so many commonalities because Sam is Haitian American and we ended up bonding a lot over cultural similarities and parental relationships and we would watch both western dramas like Grey's Anatomy every Thursday night and also Korean dramas and we would eat together and I went over to her house and all of these things so Sam was like my first step into decolonizing and unlearning anti Blackness and racism I also had an RA - residential adviser and his name was Petey and again like Sam Petey and I are now going on like almost 20 years of friendship because we're old and Petey was step two into unlearning all of the harmful things I had learned in my childhood and young adulthood even it's funny because you know those two friends who share one brain cell that they ping pong between each other that is basically my friendship with Petey we are not- somehow if you put us together we are intelligent individuals, separately but put together we have made some of the stupidest decisions have come up with the stupidest scenarios to be in to this day that we talk about both back when we were in school and as adults and I'm really quite thankful to those two in particular but even after that after I graduated from college and I became friends with quite a diverse group of friends and people and I think it's also partly because I'm autistic it's hard for me to relate to different people in the world and it's much easier for me to be apathetic about things which is also why my handle is goodbye apathy to remind myself that apathy is not a good thing and that yes you can be introverted but friends are the community that teach you that there is a much larger world out there and that your worldviews may be absolutely incorrect especially if you grew up with bias and inherited stereotypes and all these things drilled into you and I'm also gonna be honest and say I probably wouldn't care that much about Falasteen if I hadn't known a classmate from Falasteen also when I was in elementary school and I remember her because she was one of the very few like very very few people who was incredibly nice to me and didn't make me feel foreign and other I spoke with her recently and she sent a picture of her birthday party that I forgot I had attended but once she sent that picture I remember distinctly that no one else had invited me to their birthday party until she did and it sticks out to me as a memory that I forgot until she saw the picture and while my friend is safe while all of my friends are safe for now it's why I care about Falasteen it's why I post about anti Blackness within both the East Asian community and specifically the Korean community because it affects my friends and if that makes me selfish if that makes me weird that's fine this is how I relate to the world through my friends who I know what I've learned through my friends and I especially remember one incident from college that truly cemented how Petey and Sam go through the world and it's one Petey and I went to the library together it was late at night it was kind of chilly so Petey was in a hoodie and he had the school lanyard with his school ID around his neck and the white librarian stopped him and stopped him only and said I'm gonna need a secondary form of ID and I remember just pausing in shock like why are you asking he when he is clearly a student here and she said oh you know that lanyard could be faked it could be yours meaning me and I was like no no no no no I think I think something's wrong here I think what you're doing is very racist why would you assume that only me is the legit student when we both have backpacks we both have hoodies on we both have lanyards what is the difference between him and I our race and ethnicity and that taught me so much without Petry having to say a single word just seeing one moment in his life and it sticks with me now nearly 20 years later that this is reality for a lot of different people that I didn't give a shit about until we became friends so there's no moral of the story there's just- sharing my journey from where I began to where I'm at now and I continue to unpack things year by year I'm not done by any means but I wanted to share that because that to me means a lot more than sharing some historical figure for Black History Month that I don't know too much about this is what I know and this is what I've experienced okay bye",

    "voice_to_text": "there's a new little scam going around and I need to tell you guys about it so you also don't get bamboozled so I'm browsing around target minding my own business and a girl comes up to me and says that she likes my glasses and I'm like oh thank you so much she's asking me where I got them from and I tell her I like up on my phone she looks about my age maybe a little bit older so we just start chatting about like college and what did you study and like how I just moved here and we're just talking about normal things that you would talk about with someone that is your age and she starts asking me what I do for work I'm like oh I don't really work right now and she's telling me about how she works as like a project manager for like architecture and I'm like oh I love interior design we're just chatting there's other people around I don't feel unsafe by any means it seemed like a genuine conversation that you would just have with someone that's your age and I was like oh I think I'm am I making a friend right now like what and then she starts telling me about how she does like e commerce on the side like oh that's cool and she has these friends who are like retired at like 28 doesn't seem weird because it's like we've been talking for multiple multiple minutes so it seems like we're just genuinely having a conversation tells me about how her friends are like helping her become financially free and like student debt sucks and I'm like yeah and I start getting like a little bit confused doesn't really go too far into it and then we start kind of talking about something else and then she ends up taking my number and we're like yeah we should get coffee sometime soon I walk away from the conversation like kind of thinking that was strange but not as strange as it really was she goes on her merry way I go on mine and then an hour passes by and I never see her in the store again but I'm in like the skincare beauty section of target and another girl approaches me and says that she likes my glasses and I would have thought that that was weird cause that's exactly what the first girl said but in between seeing this first girl and the second girl like three different people had said that they liked my glasses and I wear really chunky frames that are a little unique so like it's not uncommon for someone to say that so I say thank you and then she starts talking to me about school and what I studied and what she's currently studying in school and again it's another girl that's around my age and we start talking about work and she's telling me how she doesn't wanna work for the rest of her life or like work for someone else for the rest of her life and she actually has these friends who are retired and financially free by like the age of 28 and i\u2019m like oh cool realizing that she's like telling me kind of the same story that this girl was starts saying that those friends are helping her get financially free if I was interested she would love to connect me with them and we can talk about financial advisory and stuff like that like financial advisory like tied to e commerce like I literally I do not know the second girl seemed a lot less comfortable with talking and just nervous and kind of like she didn't really want to be doing it which I thought was weird I'm really bad about saying no like either one of these girls probably could have me in a conversation with them for well over two hours luckily my boyfriend called me so I got out of that conversation and she didn't get my contact information but then the following day the first girl that I saw at target texted me and asked me to like meet for coffee sometime soon and just talk about ability to be financially free and I'm like oh my god I knew this bitch was a scammer like and I'm in a couple of Facebook groups like girls in my area and I saw someone post that there's a new scam going around target of these girls basically complimenting you and then dragging you into this conversation about like e commerce and like I knew it this was so weird after I talked to the first girl I genuinely thought like oh my gosh I think I made my first friend and then once the second girl approached me I was like oh okay I understand what is going on to this day I still don't understand this scam like I don't understand what exactly they're doing I don't know if they were trafficked to do it or if they were trying to traffick me to do it I have no idea but if someone compliments you at target someone young just say thank you and keep on walking",

I thought it was so bad!\" 'cause I don't know that's just kinda weird but I have the most extreme FOMO of my life I'm sitting in the corner watching these videos 1. embarrassed 2. feeling guilty 3. doubting my eyes because what did they see in this book  that I didn't? it's so confusing and I hate this feeling because I wanna love every book but it's also okay not to like books but I  don't wanna not like books",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay off, Carnival is not playing around with the drunk sniffing dogs and trying to no longer be the Walmart of the cruise ship. So before work, here are three recent changes I've noticed as Carnival tries to move away from being the ratchet cruise line. First, no twerking. I noticed on a recent Sailaway party, every time someone started twerking, the cruise director shut it down. Number two, no fighting. Carnival will now hit you with a whopping 500 dollar fine and I've heard a ban for life if you get caught being rowdy. And 3. No more ganja. This has been a recurring issue on Carnival and has happened every single cruise I've been on where the smell is overwhelming all day, every day, everywhere. But now Carnival's not playing around with it. There's drug sniffing dogs at embarkation and even at some of the ports. Getting back on the ship today in grand turf, everyone who was carrying a bag had to set their bag off to the side and wait for this good boy to come along and sniff and check their bags. I've heard of many situations where passengers have been caught at the ports, and if this happens, you're stuck at the port and you have to find and pay for your own way back home.",

    "voice_to_text": "Incoming unpopular opinion I cannot be friends with non confrontational people. And the reason I say that, I agree with this wholeheartedly. Because people who are not so called confrontational are usually passive aggressive. So usually when they have a problem with something in a friendship, instead of addressing it, they kind of go around it and say little snide remarks or just hold it in and probably talk about you with the other friends. I truly don't believe that someone that is non confrontational can keep it 100 with you. Because when there is a issue of when you express an issue in a relationship of friendship, whatever the case may be, even at work, that person is non confrontational. When an issue is is being addressed, they are going to run from it instead of just sitting down and talking about it like two adults. They will run from the issue because they're non confrontational. And people who are non confrontational, let me just. I don't know if they make good friends. Ah, ah, let me just give you a scenario. Say for instance that this friend who is non confrontational witnesses another group of friends talking bad about you, right? They are not going to address it. They are not going cause they are non confrontational. I need a friend. What? Who y'all talking about that? Cause I know that's the kind of friend I am. Wait, what? I'm not gonna wait to talk to the person That. Oh, I heard someone. So. I don't like. I don't like that. What did you say? What? What did you say when they. When you heard that? Did you just listen? Because that person is not confrontational. How loyal can they be? How real can they be to you if they are non confrontational? It's just. It just. It's just not my cup of tea. I don't think they make the best friends. I'm not telling you to be rah, rah. That's the thing. You don't have to be rah, rah, but you gotta be a little. Huh",

You don't wanna be caring around that negative energy. Uh, I do. It brings me joy. Um, like, if I thought I could earn a living holding grudges, I would quit comedy. I would run out office space and open up my own little Gregory. I would just sit in there every day from 9 to 5. I would hold them. I probably wouldn't even take lunch breaks cause the hate will fill me up on the inside. I would take over other people's grudges. That's how much I enjoy it.

September 16th. Okay. September 15th. September 15th. That Virgo. That's still Virgo, right? Virgo, yes. Okay. Virgo. Okay. Las Vegas, 40. Virgo. What you do for a living, boo? I am unemployed. Well, do you have any kids? No kids. No kids. Do you think you're in a space to date with, like, not having a job? Right now? I am. I prefer it that way because I want a man that'll take me at my lowest and help me. Help build me up and that'll build my loyalty towards him. What kind of man you looking for? Um, just kind of goes into what I was just saying. A loyal provider. A loyal. Provide. A loyal provider. So, yeah. Provide for you right now that you're not, um, working. Well, even in a relationship? Every time I'm usually in a relationship, I typically don't work, but, like, I'm a helper. If he has a business, I'm there to help him with his business. Um, whatever he needs. That's usually my place. Kind of like an assistant to pay all the bills. Typically, yeah. But most of the men I encounter, their. Their manly men, so they prefer it to play. Um. What are your deal breakers? Besides being a provider? Deal breakers? I have a lot of deal Breakers. Um, nymphomaniacs. Uh, for people that are not aware, it is men that like to have sex too much. I think there is a lot to life more than sex. So let's not indulge in that. Let's go out, enjoy ourselves, enjoy each other in other aspects. Um, man with multiple baby mamas, that's a no, I. I'm okay with men with kids, but just know, multiple baby mamas. Um, what else? Oh, like ghetto man. I have like, all the gold teeth. Sag their pants. I can't do it. Like, I'm from the hood, but I've been asking bald a little bit, so I just can't go back to that kind of lifestyle. Um, what else? Oh, 50 50 men? Absolutely not. Um, I feel like if you wanna go fifty fifty, you're looking more so for a roommate, not for a partner, not for a woman. Um, the. The world is in fifty fifty. I always say, women have periods, women have babies. So life isn't fair. Life isn't fifty fifty now. Okay, I want you to respond to this, cause this is gonna be a statement. You had a long list of deal breakers. What would you say to the person that would say you're currently unemployed? And that's a lot of deal breakers for a woman who can't even technically take care of herself at this moment? Well, just because I'm unemployed, it doesn't make me lesser of a person. And it doesn't tell me That I need to settle. So those are things that I still need and I still require. Just because I'm unemployed, I'm not supposed to be like, oh, yeah, now I'm okay with smokers, I'm okay with ghetto dudes. No, I. I absolutely will not, um, lessen my standards. Would you date an unemployment, um. Again, because I look for the man to be the provider. As a woman, I wouldn't. So you want a man to accept something that you wouldn't accept, right, right. And everybody has their preferences and what they accept and what they don't. But as a woman, I wouldn't date an unemployed man, because how is he to provide? Well, some men that are. That are able to provide one women that can provide for themselves. A lot of men that like to provide for women, they do it as an honor, because they know she's out here and she called herself down. This is accomplished. That I've heard at times that men don't mind providing, but they also wanna be your daddy. And if they feel like you can't take care of yourself, why is it now my responsibility to take care of you? Well, those are the ones I'm not looking for. I'm looking for a man. I'm looking for a man that's open. He understands where I am. He understands my capabilities and my abilities. He knows that if he has a business, I'm willing to contribute and help him run it. So I have a lot of attributes that would be beneficial",

    "voice_to_text": "Closest you've ever come to dying. On April 21st of 2017, I was in my neighborhood knocking on doors and introducing myself to the neighbors. I was 1/1 year Realtor trying to get my business going. Toward the end of a 4 hour day of door knocking, I approached the door and rang the bell. Almost immediately I felt nauseous and knew I was about to pass out. I wake up to the sound of a lady speaking to 911. She was spelling my name to the 911 operator. I always wear my name badge when out. As I came to, she asked if I wanted an ambulance. I said no, I'm just dehydrated. The lovely lady was a retired nurse in her late 60s or early 70s. She had her husband drive me the 3 blocks back home. I began drinking water but passed out a couple of more times. I called my girlfriend and asked her to come over as soon as she got off work. Not wanting to fall down again, I went to my bedroom and laid down. She arrived with Gatorade and I drank part of one before throwing it back up. I passed out a few more times. I live with my older sister who was returning from a business trip that evening. When she got home, I spoke with her about passing out multiple times. That afternoon. My sister insisted that we go to the ER. We all piled into my truck and My sister drove. I passed out again during the drive to the hospital. The ER nurse got me on a table after checking me in. By this point, I was feeling very hungry, having missed lunch, and it was now well after 10 p m. I explained to the staff that I had passed out at least 10 to 12 times today. The medical staff went into the hall to discuss my case. Impossible treatment. I felt the nausea again and told my sister it was starting again. She had not witnessed me passing out yet. She ran to the door and called the medical staff. When she turned around, my heart had flatlined. The ER staff immediately performed CPR, including shocking me with the defibrillator. When I came to, I looked at the nurse and said, it happened again, right? She asked if this is what I had been experiencing all afternoon. I confirmed it before passing out yet again. The episodes continued for the next several hours. When they finally got me awake again, the cardiologist explained that I wasn't passing out. I was actually going into cardiac arrest each time due to an issue with my vagus nerve. They decided that the best course of action would be a pacemaker. I can only imagine the pain and fear that my family went through that evening. My part was pretty easy. Heart stops, pass out, CPR and wait back up. The one benefit of dying more than 30 Times in one day is that I now have a much greater appreciation for life",

    "voice_to_text": "my mom survived a serial killer, and this is her story. okay, so my mom is attending college, and she was walking out of the library when a very handsome man with a beard approached her. it was raining really hard, and he complimented her cute polka dotted umbrella. anyways, they strike up a conversation and he mentions that because he's a photography student, he notices things like cute umbrellas. he's got an eye for it. but the university my mom is going to, they had a dress code, and beards were not allowed for students to have at that time. and so she had a little red flag like, hmm, if he's a student here, how does he have a beard? so the conversations winding down, and he offers to hold her umbrella and walk her to her car because her hands are full of books. she says that she really didn't want him to walk her. she just had this weird feeling, um, but felt awkward saying no, so she said yes. as she starts approaching her car, she said that her stomach started getting the butterflies, and it's like she just knew not to go to her car. and I think it's worth mentioning pausing the story right here because I work for a nutrition company, and I learned that your gut has 500,000,000 neurons, and your brain has one billion or a hundred billion, I don't remember. okay, I just looked it up. a hundred billion, neurons are in your brain. 500,000,000 are in your gut. and that's why they call your gut your second brain, because they are totally connected. so if you have a gut feeling, you have to listen to it. so they're walking in the parking lot, and he's asking, okay, so which car is yours? which. which direction do we walk? and my mom just can't take that feeling in her stomach anymore. she goes, oh, shoot, you know what? I just remembered I have to meet up with a friend. no need to walk me to my car anymore. I actually have to go back to the building. she then says that he acted a little bit annoyed, but he smiled and asked if he could call her later. that because it's close to finals week, he had one final project where he needed to photograph somebody and thought that she would be perfect and he would love to connect with her. my cutie mama is the biggest people pleaser you will ever meet in your entire life. maybe that's where I get it from. and she couldn't say no, but instead, she decided to come up with, like, a loop around where I just moved into my new apartment. so I don't remember the new phone number, but if you can look at my parents in the phone book, you can call them, and then we can connect. my grandma and grandpa have very unoriginal names. there's at least 10 people with the same names in the phone book. so she figured, one, he's probably not gonna spend the time looking in the phone book, and 2, she's not. he's not gonna figure out, like, which number is theirs. so my mom scurries off and thinks that she's avoided some weirdo, but, you know, didn't really think much of it until later that night.",
