I was just clicking in my target cart for these products to recreate this lip. Alright, so I'm gonna go beat my face and I'm come back, I'll show you all the products, and we're gonna see if we can recreate this. I love. Like, it looks super cute. I love it. Um, if you guys want me to go outside. As for part 2, let's see if this glass is actually blinging out there. But I think it's cute. Okay, so now let me show you guys what I used. I use the lip liner from NYX. The color is new truffle. This is what it looks like. This is from Maybelline, the lipstick. The name of it is born with it. And this is what it looks like. And then I actually use the. My little battery percentage cut me off, but I use the mix, um, butter gloss. Yeah, yeah. Your guitar. You love your guitar. Yeah, he got a guitar, you guys. He loves it. Oh, yeah. So beautiful. I should have bought another one before you guys sell it out. But yeah, if you want a little price friendly. Not saying that she didn't have it price friendly, it's just, I know MAC lipsticks kind of cost an arm and a leg in this economy. Um, but this one was like five. I Believe this was four. I think this was either around five or four dollars too. But yeah, you guys should definitely check it out. Bye.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you have super straight lashes like I do, or if your lashes just fall flat every time you put on mascara, her tips are great. Let me start off by saying that. But I believe mine is better with any situation with hair. What is better is heat when it comes to curls or waves, you know? So just like with normal hair, you curl them and they last longer. You put in hairspray. Um, cause at. At least with me, I have thin hair and not a lot of it. So if I braid my hair and leave it the night over, and I take them out and then I go outside for maybe half an hour, it's straight as a board again. And that's not what we want when we braid our hair and leave it for the night over. And the same when you curl your hair. If the temperature is too cold, your curls are not gonna last. At least not for me in my experience. So at least if that what she did works for you, maybe this will work for thin haired people. I don't know. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove the mascara from this eye, but leave it on here. And then I'm gonna do what I just said. Well, I think. I don't think I said it, but I'm gonna show it so you can see the difference. Because this. These are not curled right now, but I'm gonna remove this, and then we're gonna do it. So this is what my natural lashes look like. There's not a lot going on. Very straight there. Long. Thank God for that. But they're very straight. And for this, you need two things. You need an eyelash curler and a lighter. It's not dangerous, don't worry, if you do it correctly. So what you need to do is do this, but not for too long, because if you do that, you're gonna make it too hot, and it's gonna burn, burn your eyelid. And then you're gonna put it on, and you're gonna do how you normally do it. Like this. I'll leave you there for a little bit. Then you can see they're like that. Wait a little bit for it to cool down. Let it take its shape naturally. Then you're gonna grab your mascara and put it on. I have a. The Colossal Go Extreme Leather Black Perfecto from Maybelline, New York. So we're gonna put it on the normal way. Already? Look, what the hell? I'm gonna let this dry, and I'll be right back. I don't know about you, but I can totally see a difference. It's fuller and longer and not so clumpy. As if versus when you don't curl.",

    "voice_to_text": "Miss Rihanna, please explain this shade. 1. Nobody can convince me that this isn't in retaliation to black people saying that majority of makeup brands are not inclusive enough and do not have shades for black people. There's not a wide enough range because if you have six out of 10 makeup companies that have your shade, why are you complaining about the four that does not? Me too. Like please stop trying to create issues where there's no fucking issue. Because you didn't have to go to fancy beauty, there's someone else that has your shade that has a product that's very similar to what Rihanna is selling. But because black people get on the internet and complain about how the shades are not inclusive enough and how the darkest shade is still too light for somebody that's not considered super dark. Baby girl, this is not an issue and we're not gonna sit here and make it seem like it's an issue. Go find another motherfucking brain because I'm pretty sure when you turn to the left, there's another brand that got your motherfucking shade. When you look to the right, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. If you look to the left, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. If you look in front of you, there's another motherfucking brand that has your shade. You all do too much. Stop trying to be on the level and complain and have so much issue as Black people! You all don't have our problems! You all don't have our problems! You all don't have our problems!",

    "voice_to_text": "hey Grace um I love all your content I just want to make a stitch with you about tips for uh winged eyeliner for people hooded eyes um you know I have actually a pretty similar eyes I thought I could walk you through some of the tips that I've Learned over time some of them from pros and some of them from YouTube videos um you'll notice that I have this blue line drawn on me I'm gonna try to talk through um some of like the sort of technical stuff I'm a designer for a living so sometimes it's easier for me to talk about things in a really technical way maybe I'll use some language related to the work that you do but what I did is I basically connected the corner of my eye to the tail of my brow in a lot of the sort of western looks people are looking for the wing that lifts their eye like this and so this is the shape that we tend to go for hooded eyes sometimes that line gets a little bit stuck underneath our hood my hoods are actually be behaving pretty well today so that's not really happening that much um so what I actually wanna do is I wanna figure out how to get this line without drawing it so if I made a look um straight to the mirror with my eyes relaxed this is how you always do makeup for hooded eyes this is how other people see you it's not how we used to see ourselves I saw you doing some of this stuff when you were doing your winged eyeliner and that's actually restore your eye shape so we're gonna start off by looking in the mirror straight relaxing her hoods even if we don't like looking at her hoods but that's how people see us and I'm just gonna smudge a little bit on the outside just to kind of get what that anger looks like I'm gonna take this blue on the other side too and just kind of show what happens on the other side when you do that so see how on this side that actually basically creates straight line so like drawing on that outer third gives us like the trajectory for the rest of the wing to go on so that's actually a really good tool as a starting point as you figure out like what your shape needs to be so this is not a liquid eyeliner this is just a smudgy eyeliner my lashes on the lower lids are too long and whenever you use anything liquid or gel it could get gets come to my lashes and it looks horrible so I would I personally recommend using something smudger in the lower lash line um now I have a felt tip i usually end up using a brush with a gel eyeliner but right now I'm gonna use a felt tip one thing you always wanna do with anything is make sure that the bristles are laying in the right direction so I'm spinning it as I'm going to get it to lay down flat um when you're using your liquid that you have that's more likely to display out and I'm sure you know from painting if your brush is splay out you're gonna get little lines everywhere and that's not gonna be the clean look that you're going for so the felt tip sometimes as they get worn in they tend to spray out a bit more but if using a brush or that liquid one definitely you want to make sure that you are you're doing this little trick now what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually instead of using the point of it I actually wanna use the flat side the brush so same thing if we're thinking about painting a wall and use the very tip of a brush to paint the wall it's gonna take forever you're gonna get weird lines so you lay it flat on the side of it to actually get more surface area coverage as your painting so I'm gonna actually lay this flat same thing straight in the mirror relax my eyes now I'm gonna use that line I created with the smudge and actually just use the tip of this or use the side of it to Mark the direction I'm going in so you can see there's a little gap there it's not totally perfect that's fine um I'm gonna go back in and just like fill that in a little bit um so I actually have that line going now another thing that you would said is that you don't like that it swooped over your eyelid one of the things I found since I have very little eyelid space is that I actually don't like to put eyeliner all the way across I like to start in the very middle of my eye so right above my pupil is where I will first lay the tip and I'll just lay this flat as close to lashes as possible uh some people like to put on mascara beforehand cause then the mascara makes like a lip for uh the liner to go on I don't tend to do that I have really thick eyelashes so I already get a lip so I'm just gonna press this I'll drag just a little bit and so there we have basically we did step one smudge step two stamp step three just line the line the lid now this is where we're gonna do the tip you talked about where you don't actually go all the way to the end you actually wanna start about in the middle and this is where you still same thing you wanna keep your eyes relaxed and you want to use the tip to draw in your shape now it's a little bit messy now that we have the shape drawn we can actually go in now we can like distort our eyes tracer down and we can fill this in um and then last what more this actually if you get really close up until like a you know size 10 magnification mirror you're gonna get a lot of really good detail out of this um now what I'm gonna do is this is actually longer than I tend to like it but I'm gonna make it a little bit longer just so you can see um what the next step would be um so I'm actually just gonna take any of this in the very tip I'm gonna just draw that out just a little bit to get a little bit more of a point um and then so that way we're getting the skinny point kind of outside of her hood and then we still get the little swoop that goes on to top of our eyes but we're still getting a pretty small um wing out of it now there's a little bit of messiness underneath there that's totally fine I mean every makeup artist I've seen talk about doing wings says that makeup artists make mistakes too it's part of the process um I'm gonna take just a cotton bud with some micellar water and clean that up um if you actually want a really sharp line you can actually go back in with concealer here I I know how to eat know how to do both of those so whichever one you actually feel I drop the the bud whichever one you feel more confident in the Q tip is gonna leave it a little bit softer on the bottom and um the concealer will make it really sharp so I'm not gonna stretch right now because I don't wanna distort the shape but I'm actually gonna just hold it in place a little bit and kind of twist this as I go back so I'm not dragging the pigment anywhere and I'm actually this is a little bit longer than I like so I'm actually gonna go and clean off a little bit of that tip that I added um just to kind of shorten it up a little bit and there you go and if you already have eyeshadow on and the top is a bit messy what I would recommend is you actually just take a little bit of a matching shadow and put a little shadow on it just smudge it a little bit cause it'll make it look really intentional but you can get the really sharp line underneath um yeah and that's that I hope it was helpful and let me know",

We all need to see our skin tone when looking for new products. #makeup #makeupartist #makeupartists #mua #beauty #makeupexperts ",
    "voice_to_text": "so there's a huge difference between following working artists and influencers who are only working on themselves she is right and it brought up a memory do you guys remember Peroscope like before Instagram had Instagram Live and Facebook Live existed we had Periscope and this is still in the era when like beauty blogs were a thing right I was still a working artist and I got all of my tips and tricks in a way that I was never able to before because they were these incredible working artists from California going live almost daily teaching free technique I would get product recommendations of like hey this is how I cut  Coz I needed to know how to keep my kids small because oh my gosh you know what it's like to lug a giant kid it sucks I need to be efficient I need to be cost effective and it needed to freaking work for my client and Periscope was giving me the opportunity to learn from women who had been doing this for as long as I have and decades longer dude I Learned how to do the perfect blow out I am not a hairstyles but I finally Learned how to do the perfect blow out thanks to someone on fair anyways I'm not big into makeup anymore I know what I like I know what my skin needs but when I need to investigate something further I go looking for a working artist who is about my age and I suggest you do the same I'm going to tag some content creators who are working artists that I really like below in the in the description um but I would also love it if you guys could drop your favourite working artists and aestheticians now please hear me I do not want to discount the importance of the beauty influencer because it is a really big part of how consumers receive information it's important but you are doing yourself a disservice if you are not listening to people with experience okay",

I saw you talking about Isamaya Beauty my current favorite makeup brand despite not owning many of their products because it is behind a heavy price tag like you said I just wanna offer a little bit of perspective because I'm actually a fan of your content I find your content so informational and good quality that it's actually influenced my own purchases in my very in my real life Isamaya French is the makeup artist behind Isamaya Makeup she's worked with everyone the gender is Brianna Bjork she's worked for YSL Christian Louboutin she's currently the beauty curator for Off White I have worked as a professional makeup artist um in a variety of settings these are some of the most lovely and fun and easy to work with eyeshadows that I've ever I've ever used and I think that has directly to do with Isamaya and her legacy of disrupting conventional beauty standard the best of the best in the fashion world celebrities have sought her out specifically because she has this perspective so it is not for the everyday woman or consumer you also say in your video that women are soft beautiful velvet and uh velvet fairy like creatures and they are but I would also like to offer the perspective that if I know anything about women it's that they're incredibly complex they are capable of a multitude of polarities and the emotional intelligence to have the nuance to carry them women want to be soft and beautiful princesses like you said but a lot of them also want to be disruptive they wanna pave their own path they wanna express themselves beyond the conventions of traditional womanhood and it's because of this challenging of the status quo that Isamaya has gained a cult like following in the celebrity fashion and consumer based world because it might not be for everyone but there definitely are women who want to be beautiful fairies and very docile and light but also they wanna express themselves beyond those limitations well I might not personally purchase the phallic looking lipstick bullet brands like Isamaya makeup artist like Isamaya they definitely have a place in the world beauty high impact low effort versatile luxurious and creamy edgy we can really have it all and I think we should as consumers I don't know",

As the alcohol evaporates, the fixative forms a film on the face to lock makeup into place same way Hairspray works. That\u2019s why Hairspray is an affordable dupe for setting sprays. another example would be using Gorilla Snot as a eyeshadow. Just because a product is safe for one area of the body, doesn't mean it's safe for all areas of the body because beyond shampoos, hair products typically are not tested to be eye safe, so just be careful when using some of these dupes.",

Second time I tried, it completely failed. So let's see if the third time is good. Got this eyebrow. You can still see it, but it's okay because we're going to be putting face paint over it, so it doesn't matter that bad or that much. Um, so it's. And there we go. I put less concealer on the side so it's more color corrected, so it looks oranger. But now we're gonna put on the face. My face is blue. Now let's continue with the. And all the candies are drawn. Now I just have to fill them in. Hey. Now I am going to add some mascara. The person in the video had false lashes, but I'm not putting. I don't know really how to put this on. I don't wanna mess up the look we're not experiencing with that today, so. Yeah, there we go. Now we're gonna add some lip gloss. Great. Is the perfect color. Perfect. Okay. And this is the final look. Um, I hope you enjoyed it. Was based off the song Bubblegum Bitch by Marina and the diamonds. Hope you have a great day.",

    "voice_to_text": "I commented on this video thinking that it could just be due to the types of products used like silicone base water base oil based you know sometimes they just don't go together some people are saying as a myth but there are some things that I do think this could be the first one would be make sure that you're washing your face prior to applying your makeup this is me just after I woke up um I have dry to regular skin and last night I just use this lightweight aloe moisturizer and these are the oils you can see how shiny my forehead is these are the oils that my skin is produced um just overnight just throughout throughout the night um there's even more oil that you can't really see around my nose so if I try and go in over top of this with makeup it's just gonna look weird and it's gonna go all over the place so what I do is I just go in with a simple just foaming cleanser um whichever one doesn't really matter just find one that you like this is the fanny cream one I like this one because there's not like any weird bullshit in it so if you have sensitive skin or any kind of allergies it's probably not gonna set you off so I'm gonna use that and I'm gonna show you the difference in my skin so now that I'm looking at it I don't know if there's too much of a visual difference but trust me there is it just feels different my skin just feels cleaner it feels less oily this is what I want I want a nice fresh canvas after washing my face I'm going in with my morning skincare which is literally just SPF you don't wanna over complicate your skincare in the morning because sometimes products just wear really weird under makeup you also wanna save yourself time don't make things longer than they need to be um I'm going in with the Larose Posay SPF 30 this is the anti helos um I've used uh several I've used many different morning sunscreens um I've used the Elf Hello hydration I really like that one Cerave lightweight moisturizer like that one Cetaphil Derma Control like that one as well um yeah minimum SPF 30 is what you want and you should you should be doing this every day if you're not already um the other thing to is moisturizers that are marketed towards like am use are probably gonna be a little bit lighter weight than ones that are just like a general moisturizer like um like for example the Cerave in the tub is a super heavy moisturizer and it's gonna wear terribly under makeup cause it's so heavy so you want you want moisturizers that are gonna you know gonna moisturize but you don't want them to be super thick because then it's just gonna it's gonna slide all over the place so my moisturizer was drying I went ahead and did my eyebrows just cause I don't wanna apply anything on this while it's still kind of like drying into my skin now I'm gonna go in with my face primer I absolutely love the Elf Powergirl Primer it's so good I just use it under my eyes um honestly the safe product cause truthfully I don't really like I don't really care what my cheekbone what like my jaw looks like so I just don't I just don't really go over that part of my face with primer I just do it under my eyes and kind of on the sides of my nose so my primer sets I do my eyeshadow and my lashes now this is the part where I get to do all of my face products um normally I do like to do just concealer and when I do that I'll probably use the Elf Hydrating Camo Concealer but for the purposes of this video I will show you how I do my foundation um I actually really like the Maybelline Superstay Foundation and the reason why I like it I don't normally like full coverage looks is because I've been into concealer as foundation for a while now and I realized a medium to full coverage foundation is probably gonna have a very similar consistency and it's gonna cost a lot less because a tube of concealer like the ones that I get are like point o five fluid ounces for like $6 this is an entire fluid ounce that normally for $15 but I got this on clearance for $3 because nobody uses this color cause I'm pale um so it works out so I'm paying like no money for this basically it's free yeah that's my girl math um so yeah so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I use my my Beauty blender I do put it right on the sponge sorry I know this isn't sanitary don't come for me um it just take a little bit like very little and this is gonna cover like this whole side of my face I do it very sparingly cause I realized too you know you gotta have enough product but you also don't want too much product cause then you get cakey and then I'm gonna just do that much just cause I do get kind of rosy cheeks and I'm not even gonna worry about getting under my eye cause I have concealer for that I don't wanna put too much product in one area do about that much and this is gonna cover the left side of my face and I bring that down over my jawline bring it up by my nose on my temple for my chin and then a little bit for my nose and I love using the Beauty Blender for this I absolutely love these things what you wanna do is wet them first you don't wanna use them dry and I swear like I've never gotten my foundation to look better I I have I used one of these and I never looked back I was like people like no I hate brushes never using a foundation brush ever again okay so there we go that's the foundation part I just do it around pretty much everywhere except under my eyes um because I'm gonna go in with concealer I go in with the hydrating camo concealer I just want a little bit and then I have some problem spots that I'm gonna go over and I do a little bit of my nose a little bit on my chin cause I get some red spots on my chin and now we can blend that out up under my eyes really got into creases in the nose bring it up onto my bridge just like that I did get a little bit on my lashes but that's fine cute okay I add fake freckles you don't have to do that I'm gonna do those now okay freckles done I'm gonna go in and contour I love love love love the Elf Halo Glow Contour and I'm just gonna do that all over my face and use the back of my beauty blender to blend that out and get up onto my forehead and as I do this it's just a lot of quick padding motions no smearing just pat pat pat pat pat and then there and then we'll do on the sides of the nose I just kind of squish it a little bit to kind of get it up in there and then I get down the middle again with the with the light end of the the sponge okay so now that's done last step for complexion if you want sometimes I'll just do powder blush but I'm feeling ambitious feeling funky today so we're gonna do liquid blush this is the Elf Camo Liquid Blush and I just use the side of the sponge to do this if you wanna be really fancy yeah you could probably get a sponge for each color but I don't care that much so we're just using the same one boom okay now last important step important step important step powder I don't I don't argue with me I fucking love this air swung by Conty it's also $5 I factor cost into how good products are if it's like $60 then it's like uh the five dollar powder that lasts me like so long uh yeah that's a good powder okay so take that I just blend it out under my eyes again cause I do have like kind of my under eyes will crease if the products not set so I just go under there fix that again now I'm gonna take the powder puff that it comes with and just get all over this face all over I'm gonna do a cut here so I did a few more things just to finish up my makeup um this is what it looks like done you wanna make sure that everything is powdered you wanna make sure you don't see any shine peeking through from the liquid products and then I will come back probably in another video and show you what it looks like after the entire day"

    "voice_to_text": "hey all my friends um I really wanna talk to you guys about bullying here on TikTok and the beauty community um we are all grown adults and we are all here for the same purpose we are here to create content and do makeup something that we all love and enjoy doing and there is a far too much bullying going on in this community and it really needs to stop I don't understand the purpose behind it I don't know what you have to gain from bullying somebody off of this app and attacking them on a more personal level you know death threats false police reports other kind of stuff like that seriously what do you have to gain from it you know um a lot of us here on this um app in this community are doing this um trying trying to make a living from it we all we want to go somewhere and and become somebody there's a lot of us um that are doing that and then there's some of us small accounts that are just getting started and really trying to um just get their makeup noticed or just make new friends um when I first came on this app I didn't come on this app to be part of the makeup community I just happened into it because doing makeup is something that I love um I've struggled a lot myself being bullied growing up and everything never felt like I fit in anywhere and then I found this what I thought was an amazing community I was welcomed with open arms I grew my talent I done things that I never thought that I would be able to do and it has just been amazing but here these last couple of months it's just gotten really out of hand um brands are being bullied individual makeup artists are being bullied um and it's typically by the same person or the same people if you watch Caroline's video you will see exactly who we are referring to here um and I really just don't understand it like what what is your personal gain what are you going to get from it what's happening is you are showing the world literal world the type of person that you are you are a nasty disgusting person because you wanna bully people what what is that what does that get what does that get for you you know bullying is gonna turn around and it's going to it's gonna come back and it's going to not be good for you the thing that we all need to remember is just to spread positivity be nice to people encourage people if you don't like the makeup that they do just scroll on you are not required to leave hateful messages and mean comments to people if you don't like it don't look at it if you think somebody's talent is better than yours then maybe step outside of your own box and try to do something that you wouldn't normally do because I can guarantee that you are going to be proud of yourself for doing it and the rest of us in this community are going to be proud of you for doing it as well we are all here for support and to spread everyone's talents around all over the place you know and it's not right to harass people because you are jealous that you didn't get something that they did all you have to do is work a little harder you know I never thought that I would be a part of a PR team but I started going outside of my box I started working a little bit harder and I got myself noticed and that's what most people out here have done they have put in the hard work to get themselves noticed and when they get accepted on a PR team it is a huge accomplishment for them whether it's a small PR team for a company that is just coming up or it's the PR team for a multi million dollar company out there it doesn't matter the size of the PR team what it shows is that person's ability to work hard and be part of a team and anybody can do that as long as they put themselves out there but you're not gonna do that by bullying people and putting people down and being hateful this is not the place for it we are grown adults grown adults we are not in high school anymore we are not in middle school anymore bullying is not something that ever ever needs to happen I think those of you that are bullying other people and being hateful really could benefit from digging deep within yourself go find a shadow work journal believe it or not I have one LinkedIn my showcase because I have one and it will really teach you more about yourself and why you do what you do and bullying is not something that you do naturally bullying is something that you do because you are hurt and you are in pain and you are either seeking attention or you're trying to bring other people down to hurt with you and that is not right in any kind of way it's not you know so take a little time work on yourself and find out exactly why you feel the need to bully other people and certainly don't get your family members involved in bullying people either because they are not part of the problem they're not and it's not right it's not right for you guys to go around and doing this kind of stuff to people what do you have to gain from it what do you have from spreading rumors about people or contacting their places of business or the companies they work for and getting them removed what does that benefit you seriously if you can answer me honestly and tell me what you benefit from that sure I'll hear you out you know but it's not necessary and if you are one of the people in this community that is being bullied and harassed and you just don't know what to do my DMs open I would be happy to help you and talk to you if you need a wonderful community to rally behind you we have one there are a lot of amazing content creators on this app that will stand behind you and they will stand up for you and they will help you so if you are struggling with bullying from anybody or harassment from anybody just reach out we will stand up and we will help you and we will try to make this bullying stop in this community this is supposed to be a place of love and support and kindness and it seems here lately that it's just falling to pieces and it sucks it really does but anyways this video is long enough and um hopefully this message gets out to the people that are doing it and maybe it'll be a big wake up call to them that they need to stop they need to stop it's it's just unnecessary but anyways um I love you guys I appreciate you watching um if you want to share the video or whatever I would appreciate it it doesn't matter I don't care just help get the word out um because the bullying needs to stop here on TikTok all right love you guys",

    "voice_to_text": "Her feel like she was so ugly and horrible. This is kind of embarrassing, but whatever. I cried after three of my bridal makeup trials, and I'm gonna tell the story times. One of them, she just didn't listen to me or use the inspo pics that I showed her. I intentionally said matte eye makeup, and she puts all this glitter on my eyes. I told her, I want the tape look like the very, like, cut off line on my eyes, and she, like, smokes it out all over. She just did not put two and two together. Another one. I just did not look good. It. It did not. It did not go well. But this one, the last one, Sheena only, was so, so, so rude. She didn't do a good job. Like, it was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. She had the worst attitude I've ever seen. I walked in, she doesn't even say, hello, how are you? She doesn't try to get to know me. This is a bridal trial. Like, having a good makeup artist on your day is huge because you're spending the mornings with them. Like, their vibe and their energy is huge. She was so rude. Didn't even say hi. She commented on my skin and said I had awful skin when I don't have bad skin. Like, I may have had a few blemishes then, but she's like, I can't fix that. And I'm like, I'm not asking you. To fix my zits, I just ask you to do my makeup and it like literally melted off my face. It didn't last more than 30 minutes. And wedding makeup needs to last. It looked. It looked like a five year old could do it. And my issue is like, if you call yourself a professional makeup artist, you need to be professional first of all, and you need to be like talented. And at these rates that there trying to ask for three, 400 dollars for a trial, I spent, I don't know, probably two grand on makeup trials alone. And I look back at it and I'm like, thankfully I found my person and she's wonderful. Her vibe and energy is great and I'm really excited. But the process of this was just a horrible experience."

    "voice_to_text": "So I posted that video recently, and that was me using how I did my old makeup with all my old product. But I'm gonna use my old products, how I would use that makeup now if it really came down to it. Cause a lot of people are hating on me, saying how I wasn't trying, but that was how I did my old makeup. So now I'm gonna show you how I would do using these old products, doing my makeup. Let me go take off my current makeup. I'll be right back. I'm obviously gonna use the exact same steps, but I'll be more reasonable. Just. I don't like smoothies. I feel like this collects so much bacteria. And I'm using the exact same old products I use. Like, if I'm missing a step, it's because I didn't use it back then. So I'm using all my old makeup. So I'll use a brush this time, cause I'm gonna try to make this look new as possible. It's not horrible, it's just a little too light for me. You actually just could not make me like this. But we'll try it out and I'll see what y'all are. What y'all are defending glossy A for. So now I use a brush, which I think back then I didn't use a brush. I can use the bleed blender for literally everything. But, you know, we're trying, and I'm gonna try to make this look good as possible. It's Not like, horrible. It just. It either disappears or gets really patchy. Like, does it look like I just bronzed my face? This is just pains me cause I love the Rare Beauty blush, but this shade, I mean, it's a very teeny, tiny bit. See how far? Like, it wants a little bit more than that. And I wasn't saying necessarily the products was what my issue was. It was fact of how I used to do my old me. The creaminess of this concealer is honestly amazing. Like, oh my god, it's so creamy. It's just too yellow for me, and it's not very covering. But seriously, let me know what y'all think so far. Let's see if this concealer may be good. Like, see, it just doesn't cover up that much. And the Sheglam highlighter, which I literally used this for such a long time. There's just something about liquid highlighters in that container just did not work right with me. But it is really pretty. And this isn't horrible, but if I had the option to use my newer makeup, I would obviously use that. Just my makeup wasn't really fulfilled back then. Like, you can tell I'm already missing like 10,000 steps. My new makeup is a lot more, like, better, but this mascara is just. It's just like, this is using my old products, and if I try to my makeup, this is what it would look if I used all the old products. But now, that old video was literally me trying how I did my old makeup with my old products. I'm actually not that big of a hater on this. I actually don't think this looks bad. Here's the final look. Oh, I also forgot lipstick, but you get the point.",

So that way you're getting every single drop. Right. Um, did you see how short the. I don't know what it's called, but the little tube that the primer goes up to so it pumps out. Did you see how short that was on the primer? That's because the product, it doesn't have to go down into the bottle. It gets pushed up into that little tube, and it makes things a little bit easier. You don't have to go through and scrape the bottle when you're done. Um, it likes that. It just. It makes things a little easier. It's not a loss of product. It's not, um. You're not getting jipped.

Now,   I   might   have   to   respectfully   disagree   with   that   statement   Now I know that this looks like I bought it from a costume shop   know   that   this   looks   like   I   bought   it   from   a   costume   shop and it hooks on over my ears,   it   hooks   on   over   my   ears but it is actually the real thing.   it   is   actually   the   real   thing This is what I look like naturally   is   what   I   look   like   naturally if I don't do anything to my face.   I   don't   do   anything   to   my   face I get this.   get   this And it's the same for pretty much every single man out there.   it's   the   same   for   pretty   much   every   single   man   out   there Beards are not makeup. Beards are not artificial.   are   not   makeup   Beards   are   not   artificial They are what grows out of your face.   are   what   grows   out   of   your   face Now, I definitely agree with the idea that how you style a beard   I   definitely   agree   with   the   idea   that   how   you   style   a   beard or how you maintain a beard   how   you   maintain   a   beard is the difference between looking good and looking terrible.   the   difference   between   looking   good   and   looking   terrible And I also understand that some people think beards look great   I   also   understand   that   some   people   think   beards   look   great and some people really don't like beards at all.   some   people   really   don't   like   beards   at   all And their opinion of a man's looks will be dependent on that.   their   opinion   of   a   man's   looks   will   be   dependent   on   that So, yeah,   yeah I don't think this is makeup.   don't   think   this   is   makeup This is, this is as nature intended makeup would be.   is   this   is   as   nature   intended   makeup   would   be If I dyed it, if I trimmed it,   I   dyed   it   if   I   trimmed   it if I shaked it in some way or if I shaved it off.   I   shaked   it   in   some   way   or   if   I   shaved   it   off That's me doing something to change what I normally look like   me   doing   something   to   change   what   I   normally   look   like into an appearance that some people would find more attractive.   an   appearance   that   some   people   would   find   more   attractive But at the end of the day,   at   the   end   of   the   day if you think you look better with a beard,   you   think   you   look   better   with   a   beard grow the beard. You think you look better without the beard,   the   beard   You   think   you   look   better   without   the   beard shave It off. It's entirely up to you.

Everyone has hair on their face. Like, isn't that not normal? But I swear, some of you guys are so miserable that you guys literally hop on TikTok, watch somebody else make a video, and you study that video, and you find the most randomest, irrelevant thing, and then you make a comment off of it, and now the whole comment section is talking about it. Like, she's doing her makeup. You're talking about the hair on her face. But you, too, you have hair on your face. Matter of fact, you have a lot of it. Make a TikTok and let's talk about that. Hmm.

    "voice_to_text": "hi. I saw you went to prom, love that for you, you look like you had a great time and you looked great. um if you are still wanting to like learn how to work with your hooded eyelids, I would like to offer some tips as someone who thought for the longest time they had hooded eyelids, um but I've also done makeup on a lot of my friends who happen to have hooded eyelids as well. um also feel free to ignore this, do whatever you like. so one, you're gonna give yourself a higher crease. the easiest way that I find to do this is I'll put a dot of primer kinda in the center of my lid about like right here and I'll look up, like just roll my eyes up to the ceiling, and then when I look back in the mirror straight ahead, um wherever that dot goes, like however far it's reached, I make sure to draw whatever I'm trying to show over it, so that will be my new crease area. two,  I try to keep my eyeliner thinner. since you gave yourself more space by creating that fake crease, you don't wanna take it away by giving yourself a thicker liner, unless that's whatever look you're going for, like please do whatever you feel. I don't do this every every time I do makeup. but having a thinner liner again, not only doesn't minimize the space you just given yourself, but it also elongates the eye more. and three, if I'm wearing lashes I will either put my lash strip farther out towards the outer part of my eye rather than inner, or I'll try to get lashes that gradiate from smallest to large on the outside.  that way, again, I'm not closing off the inner part of my eye especially, but also it makes the eye look longer and it keeps it wider, and it helps build a shape basically. like I said, I don't do these all the time, I don't expect you to do those all the time, do whatever you feel and enjoy yourself cause it's your face, it's your makeup, do however you want, um but these are just tips again, like I said that have helped me especially when I am doing makeup um for people who happen to have hooded eyes.  and yeah. hope you have a good night."

Hygiene, skincare, hair care for African American women should be, you know, taught more. Luckily, I grew up during a time where, like, to. It was. So it was coming up on 2,016. Around that time, YouTube was just starting to get popping. And I remember I used to come home from school because I wanted to know how to do makeup really, really, really bad. And I came from a home where nobody really wore makeup. Like, my grandmother literally was the only person who had makeup in the house. And honey, when I tell you it was an Avon palette, baby, she used to sweep, sweep, sweep her shit. Is that. That was her makeup, honey, that was. She'll this makeup. And I will see these girls with like, full beat down and lipstick and the brows and I was like, oh my gosh, I want that. So I used to come home from school every day for hours, and I used to sit in front of the computer and I used to watch Alia Jay Star Milan, baby, time to infamous. Like, I used to sit and I used to like, purposely search on YouTube, um, foundations for medium dark skin girls or contour tools just so I can, you know, learn it, cause I didn't have anybody that was that Taught me, like, still to this day, the skills that I Learned back then, I still use them today. And every time I do my makeup, people, oh, my god, who did your face? Who did your face? I did my face. So I appreciate them. They help me so much, like, with makeup, skincare, like, what I needed to buy. Cause I mean, I didn't grow up in a house where people did makeup like that. Like, honestly, for a large part of my life, I would have to say I was a tomboy, so I was. I wanna be girly and. And, baby, I still have palettes. I have so many fucking brushes, so many fucking palettes. And contour palettes, the highlighter palettes, baby, I was a buying shopping fool for that shit. But I. Those girls really don't understand how much they impacted our lives. Like, y'all raised us and y'all ain't even know it."

    "voice_to_text": "To be the next big trend, my team are calling it complexion no eye. Let's get to it. SPF to my skin. Do not skip this because SPF is so important. Oh, my God. Oh, it just popped everywhere. It's literally all over me, guys. Very, very clumsy going ahead with this prep and perfect primer from Primark. It's quite moisturising, very soft on my skin. It's supposed to be like pop and tube, like a strobe cream Foundation. I'm gonna be using the H&B cosmetic. Little bit more warm on my skin and I like to wear it, especially during the summer. Blends so beautifully. Next, I'm going to bronze up my skin a little bit and contour using the made by Mitchell cupcake. This is actually the deeper shade. The reason I got the deeper shade is because I was obsessed with the blusher. Do you think that I should have got the medium as well? But I still make. It works. Just trust the process. Next, I'm gonna use these two concealers. This one's from Primark, and I really, really like it as an everyday concealer. It is so good. I'm just gonna show you guys how application is. It really, really works well with my skin. I'm also gonna use the H&B Cosmetics concealer just to kinda brighten it little bit. Now that's set for a little bit. I'm gonna use a beauty blender just to kinda blend that out. Just look at how amazing the Coverage is. I love it. For blush, I'm gonna be using the curve case. Again, look how stunning these blush colours are. I love the way it just melts into my skin. It's very pigmented, as you can tell. But again, just trust the process. Once it all comes together, I promise you, it's just gonna look. As you can see, it's not very blended. So I again, is just going lightly with my beauty blender and out the edge just so it's nice and smooth before we set it with powder. Next, I'm gonna set my face with the Huda Beauty Radiant Powder. Of course, my Fenty Bronzer to bronze my face a little bit more. Also use my NARS blush. This is the final look. I am super pleased with the way it's turned. This is something I've never done before and it will most definitely not be the last.",

    "voice_to_text": "Chanel has donated $4 million to southern Israel and specifically the IDF on top of the billions of dollars that have been given by the American government to support the genocide of Palestinian people the reason that I'm really disappointed by Darcy's choice to endorse the Chanel bag publicly is because she represents a specific population that holds Korean skincare beauty accountable for their mistreatment of people of color abroad so I know that she knows about the issue of the genocide in Palestine and yet it doesn't seem like she cares her videos garner millions and millions of views tons of followers and she currently sits at just over a million followers sorry a little under a million five I think she could spare one video talking about the Palestinian people and the families in Gaza specifically for something like this so for that reason she is celebrity No. 8 that I think that you should block for celebrity blockout or influencer Blockout 2024 furthermore if you'd like to support a family in Palestine I do have a family that I'm sponsoring that's Lara and the Abdalla family I posted multiple videos about that here's a screenshot of what's they're going through right now and if you wanna donate there's a \ud83d\udd17in my\ud83d\udd17\ud83c\udf32 and if you can't then I suggest that you follow like and share all of their posts they only have made \u20ac80 in a 24 hour span the other night I don't know how much they made since then but I know that they're very far away from their goal so do anything you can help thank you",

And then I saw Michaela unboxed her Birkin, and I remember thinking, hmm, they gave her a Birkin, gave Darcy a Chanel. And then I thought, well, maybe Darcy elected to. Maybe that's what's happening. But then I was like, well, wow, that's very interesting. And I must say that the only reason I purchased tear tear is because of miss Darcy. Um, she put it on her web page, and she talked about it being a great foundation, that they needed to expand the shade line. They did. And the shade line some somewhat. The first shade I purchased, it wasn't right for me. It was too dark. The second shade that I purchased, which was 40 Cinnamon, did work for me. Um, but I think that they could have did a little bit better, uh, with the equity and the handbags. They really should have sent them both the same handbags. And if it was a matter of Miss Darcy choosing the bag that she chose or that she got, then i'mma tell Miss Darcy, next time, i'mma need you to go for the gusto. Don't sell yourself short. Let them say no. Because Michaela could have just chosen the bag that she wants. She could have simply said, I want a Birkin. And that's What? She got no hate towards Michaela because I like Michaela. Yes, she photoshopped. We all photoshop, honey. I have the beauty filter on quite often, but. Miss Darcy, next time, I'm gonna need you to ask for the gold, baby. Ask for the gold. And tar, tar. Do better. Do better. She shouldn't have had to ask. You should have extended a Birkin to both of those beautiful young ladies. Until next time. Peace out. It just add tear. Tear. I purchase your foundation. I only have about 200 followers. Um, but, you know, I'll be down for a gift. Um, just hit me up. I'll take a Birkin. I'll take the Chanel. You know, I'm not picky. I did post video. Does that count? I actually purchased two items from. Does that count? I didn't, you know, help a sister out.",

    "voice_to_text": "About this 27 year old woman that dropped all of her children off to CPS a week before mother. Okay, I'm gonna give my opinion about this whole story. If you haven't already heard about it, go ahead and watch the whole first video. This is coming from a mom who's had a child at a very, very young age. And also, I had a mother who did not raise me, and my grandmother raised me. But we are gonna start off with this whole situation. Is this horrible? Those poor kids are suffering no matter what. Like, I could not imagine already going through a horrible and stressful situation, uh, with your mother dropping off at CPS, but then having it also go viral on TikTok. And it's gonna be like, they're gonna grow up and they're gonna see all this, and already they're probably seeing so much about it. So I know she's mentally unfit, and she just pretty much just had a mental breakdown over all this. But still, I don't think she'll realize she did the right thing in a way. But also, if she were to, like, fix up her life and try and get her kids back, it is gonna be very hard. Now, I'm not saying she shouldn't get her kids back. I just think it's gonna take too much time to rebuild her relationship with her children and earn their trust back. Because when you still think about it, what she did, She could have done privately. She could have not done all those lives and all those videos. And then maybe I would see more potential of her possibly getting her children back. But right now or anytime soon, I don't think she should. It's still better though that she picked to drop them off, because I could imagine possibly what their home life was going to be like if she already was that overwhelmed, that mentally stressed out, and she just couldn't handle anything anymore. And then they just feel like probably they're not wanted. Like it was it. And then like, who knows how much longer it would have just taken for CPS to come into the situation anyways.",

Powderpuff girl crimper. Pretty sure I got this in 2000. These foundations house fancy, so I had the concealer as well. Kiss massage or from Victoria's Secret. It does not still taste good. These are from the 1990s. My mama used to sell Avon, and I don't know why I still have them. Drugstore ass lipstick, and it's already lost its color. This Mark lip gloss that is brushed it together. The can. I can't get it open. Some trip Bondi's pants. But also this. This was my favorite skirt as a girl, and I saved it. I got it from Hot Topic and have a few that I saved.

The reason why I have a little tick towards Brandy in particular is because behind every ain't shit man is a sister and a mama that enables it at every single time and every clip. When Princess expresses that her brother ain't shit, it ain't doing his job as a man. Here they come, gun and hold. Like, how dare you talk about Ray J? How dare you say what the fuck we failed at to hold him accountable? The way Reggie acted on Malaysia is really him in real life. Now, I don't know him personally, but, yeah, if you know, you know.",

And he said that sometimes she would just come downstairs and he'd be like, oh my god, you look so beautiful today. And she's like, thanks, I'm wearing makeup. And he'd be like, oh. And then when they broke up, this girl goes and gets a nose job. Literally a whole ass nose job. And then he ran into her and was like, something's different about her, but I couldn't figure it out.

We then have real deal, which is more of a plum pink. And then we have got cutie pie, which I'm actually gonna put on my face cause I love the look of this. Let me know in the comments what shade of blush you like. Do you prefer a pink? Do you prefer a red? A peach? These blushes honestly blend like a dream. Just wait till you see them on. Oh. Oh, my.

Most of the time I will use TikTok coupons or I go directly to the brand website and use a discount code. Most of the time if you give them your phone number or your email address you can get a discount code. I do sometimes try to look for influencers with codes that work with the brand. I like to do that as well. You're going to save the most money when you buy directly from a brand's website. Sephora just does not offer affordable makeup in my opinion."

Whoever started this whole water based water based silicone silicone is like the biggest marketing scheme that's currently happening in like the makeup community. Number one. Most of your products have both water and silicone in it anyways, so if it can't mix on your face, why can't it mix in the product and be okay? Also, if you're moisturizing or using sunscreen, it's probably water based too, not silicone based. So why can you put silicone primer and foundation on that and it doesn't peel? Why does it only matter for the primer and the foundation if you find something spilling on your face? There could be a million different reasons why, but I'll usually take all my makeup off and exfoliate my face and then reapply my skincare and it'll end up looking fine for the most part. I use water based primer and silicone in this and foundation and it looks good. So moral of the story just don't believe everything you see on TikTok and don't fall into schemes where now you feel like you have to label all of your different products or go out and buy different one.",

As someone who has big lips, I never thought it gave the illusion of bigger lips, but it does give the illusion of hyperpigmentation around the mouth. Maybe it's just me, because I'm a person of color, and lots of people of color who do their makeup have to color correct around their mouths to get rid of the natural hyperpigmentation. But to me, when you put contour or, like, a liquid bronzer around your mouth to give the lips the illusion of being fuller, it just looks like a 5 o'clock shadow or it just looks like the hyperpigmentation that POC people have to conceal when they do their makeup.",

Anyway, um, they discontinued this, and I remember I loved it so much. Like, it's pretty well used, I went ahead and depotted it. But this is clearly like, my favorite black eyeshadow, like, ever, and is because, like, it's more grayer. Like, it gives you, like, that black pigment, that blackness that just love. And like, I feel like nobody's been able, like, make a black like this. Like, at least that is blendable, cause as you can see, like, it has, like, little faint, like, sparkly bits in it that make it, like, blendable. But I can't find any other black like this that's, like, actually, like, truly black, you know, like, I don't know. Anyways, pretty vulgar, please bring back the Angel palette. I love that palette. I literally depoted it cause, like, my mirror broke in the palette, so I had to depart the rest of my shades. Please bring back",

Expose myself right now because I used to wear makeup a lot, and then I went without wearing makeup for years and years, and now I'm slowly starting to get back into it. But I did not know that you're supposed to throw the stuff out from before. Um, so everything that I have is pretty old. A lot of the stuff I have is old. And this is really bad, considering I just watched this video, and she's throwing stuff out every few months, um, to a year. A year? Um. You know how people have depression rooms? I think I have depression. Makeup, makeup collection. Because the way I've been hoarding these products, just thinking it was normal. Um, and my skin is terrible. You probably can't tell, except for this. Um, it's tech. And this is probably why. This. This explains it. Okay. I've had this for probably eight years. This also probably eight years. There's a fucking ant on me. This probably nine years. Nine years. Years. Not months. Years. This prop maybe the same. Not maybe. This one's probably a little less. This probably like five years. This one Also probably like five year. This is all. This is all random stuff. Um, yeah. This I know I've had for 10 years. I used this in high school. Anywhere near high school. This also probably like 10 years, and I use the stuff. Oh, my god. Okay. This I've probably had for, like, 13 years. I remember going to buy this in high school or junior high, one of those, and. Oh, my god, this is terrible. Do you see this? That's. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Urban Decay. Like, that is. That is terrible. I'm clearly a dirty makeup girl. I'm sure you can tell that already, but this. That is even bad for me. That is just. That is horrible. Um, this I've definitely had for, like, 13, 14 years. Terrible. This incomplete Inglot palette. I love Inglot, but I've. I know I went to buy this in my first year of college, as. That was 2014. That was 2014, when Obama was president. This is when I bought this is that. I never even finished it. Oh, my god. This is terrible. This is definitely the worst. Um, question is, will I throw it out? Will I change based on this information? Um, that's a different story. But I'm just glad to know if you have recommendations for what I should buy from the drugstore, because I am not gonna. About to buy. I'm not. I'm not buying a bunch of expensive stuff. You have any recommendations, let me know, because that is awful. That is terrible.",

Youre not being helpful, youre not being sympathetic or empathetic so just stick to what you know and keep it pushing..This topic has NOTHING to do with another community or race that cant even address the BLACK community on terms weve EARNED how weve went through years and years of oppression to not only have a respectable title but also to NOT get disrespected by other races who dont know how to address us or the oppression we still face today\u2026You dont stand with us, you stand against us, and doing #blackface isnt making the black community feel as if youre on our side,,shouldve never even made such a hateful, disgusting video just for content,likes,and views\u203c\ufe0f#fyp #beauty #makeup #kevinleonardo ",

    "voice_to_text": "I don't think Lupita from us could even, like, match. This is dirty baboon booty pickle chin burnt from Elmo cucumber from Veggietales. Gargle your face, goofy goober power bottom. Still have a platform. You not only put on the darkest shade of a makeup company's foundation that looks like black face paint and did blackface, but you then tried to compare to Lupita Nyong'o. What is wrong with you? Money from the near video must be running on the last dime, because every time I see you on my for you page, you continue to bring up black people. Why? Last time I saw you on my for you page, you brought up black people, and I quote saying, blacks hate Taylor Swift so much. They have so much against her. I don't know that blase, blase lock that up and shut that down, because I know plenty of black people who listen to Taylor Swift's music. And actually, like, now you're on here doing blackface and slandering a black queen's name who can never be compared to the likelihood of your bottom of the barrel. You're colorist, racist, and you have a deep hatred towards black people that I don't know where it rooted from, but you need to do the hokey pokey and turn that shit around, cause we don't want it. Hopefully this can finally be the downfall of Kevin Leonardo, because I plan to slap something on the grill when I find that out. I'm not Playing",

    "voice_to_text": "No foundation makeup makes no sense. It makes no sense. There's nothing. All right, I've gotten so much backlash about this video, and I feel like there's a lot of people who don't know where it coming from. So let me just clear this up. Whenever I'm talking about no foundation makeup, right? I made that video at a point where I was talking about the people who smear concealer all over their face, and I mean, all the way up here, down here, down here, down here to here, and then smear a darker, shaded concealer all around their face and then call that contour. Um, I don't like that. I don't like that, personally. It's always been uncomfortable. It's a makeup pick of mine I don't like. And that's a personal opinion. Get it? Personal opinion. And I definitely just see the way kind of looks on other people. And y'all can say that it looks good, but again, when I'm seeing y'all say it looks good, I'm seeing on through a screen with retouch on real life. I don't know about that, sweetheart. Either way, if you make it look good, you make it look good. If you want to do it, you can do it. I'm not here to control you. I'm not here to boss you around. Do whatever you want to make. But there's something that's really getting on my nerves. The fact that some of you are coming and saying that, well, you Just don't have clear skin, so you can't do it. That's why you're mad. That's such a dumb way to think. Like, I want you want to hear exactly what you're saying. I want you to go back, look at your comment, and read it out loud and imagine saying that to somebody. You have hyperpigmentation. You're a black dot spotted hyperpigmentation acting face, bitch. And that's why you can't do. That's why you mad. That's exactly what y'all sound like. That's exactly what y'all sound like. So please spare me the whole, oh, but it looks good. What's that clicking such as? The funniest part, y'all will stitch me, trying to show me up, and I'm not showing up. You know, I'm saying, look, I'm sometimes just not, you know, some of the stitches have supported my hypothesis, some of the stitches have rejected my hypothesis. You know, I'm talking like a scientist, cause I need you to understand this. Like, it. It doesn't matter. It doesn't prove one thing or the other. It just says like, hey, this works for some people. This. This doesn't work for some people. You know, if you still disagree with me, by all means, do so. Right? Let's just all agree to disagree. Thank",

Hi Noelani from The Face Australia that was me 10 years ago in that last clip am I still modelling? This challenge was not like the America's Next Top Model where you can actually get a proper photoshoot and they pick the strongest this was one shot only so because of that one shot that aired I was essentially cancelled from the entire Australian fashion industry and I'm still cancelled I lost my agency I got dropped, all my potential work that I had overseas was dropped as well I lost our relationships with designers photographers was unable to do fashion weeks and I was unable to do editorials and even film work not many people know that there was another challenge which was the runway challenge I won that, it didn't air but that one shot did and unfortunately I'm still cancelled from the industry"

Gotta start with SPF before I do anything else. Also, how cute do these faux freckles look? I was so scared at first, but they actually look okay. We're going in strong with the by Ellie brow shape to do my brows. Her brows are quite full and dark. So we're gonna go in with the 3 in 1 from Primark, and we're gonna go in with this end. Now let's carve out those bad boys with the Pete Louise eye base, cause I'm gonna do some eyeshadow, too, just because I am not a typical hot girl, which I keep saying, but I'm not. Let's be honest, I don't see any reason why I can't look that good, because I am beautiful in my own way, you know? I was gonna use this to do that really neutral, gorgeous smoky eye. I'm gonna go with cool tones, actually, because I don't think the tones in that video are particularly warm other than possibly on her skin where her cheeks are. So this is gonna look so fire. Okay. So I don't think it's very cut. Crazy vibes. So I'm gonna go in with this gorgeous pink shimmer from the CRT palette just to give it a little bit of a glimmer in the corners. And then lastly adding A little bit of this pink heart highlighter from the Anastasia Beverly Hills Palette just here and added a soft brown wing cause I prefer the brown to the black. Base time and a bit of Coco Gold. I'm going over this today. Now, I have tested this foundation, but I've not actually fully used it yet, so it will be interesting to see what it was like. And don't worry, it is gonna match my neck by the end, I promise. Curve case mixed with the glow shine and I'm gonna put a little bit more glow shine over the top. I've seen people using this as all sorts bronzers, primers, neck thingies, so let's see if it works on top of makeup too. Yeah, it's giving a really nice shine over the top. She has the most gorgeous pinky blush, so I'm gonna go in with strawberry cream from the made by Mitchell Curve case and I'm gonna add something to it. I'm also literally placing that like right up to my nose and around you know it. It's the Beauty Crop Glow Milk Blush. And you do not need a lot of this. That was less than one pump. Look at that brighten the under eyes. Pink powder time has to be doll Beauty Blush. Bring it back to life. And done! I can relate to desperation. That's the only song that's been in my head for days and now.",

It should say secret scoop PR waitlist. And listen, I know I said everyone can get PR. And by everyone, I meant like, everyone ranging from zero followers to however many. So not everyone that fills out this form will get PR, but I will try to go for the smaller influencers because I know what it's like, and I know what it's like to be desperate for PR. And also, you guys don't even know what's gonna be in these mystery scoops. As much as I would love to give everybody PR, cause I wish I could, I really do. It's just this also is a business, and I have to make money somehow from it. And filling out this Google form will make it so much easier for me to pick the five first people. But yeah, obviously I'm really excited for this, but I'm also really nervous about it, cause I don't want people to get angry with me for not sending them PR. I just want you guys to be happy. I'm sorry. Follow the link in my bio. Thank you. Mwah, mwah."

    "voice_to_text": "She's been going to all these events without wearing makeups. And have stylist. As women, we are taught our whole lives that your beauty is your currency. It's really all that you are. Worth trying to be so perfect. Just let go. It's not necessary, it's not attainable. To be the prettiest woman in the room, you all need to be like Pamela Anderson right now. I respectfully disagree. To me, makeup, which I love, is a way to enhance natural beauty and a way to express the personality of the day. Because there are days when my personality manifests stronger and days where it communicates somewhat softer. There are days when I feel like a warrior. There are days where I feel like a diplomat, like an artist, like a storyteller. That also reflects in my makeup. The only times when I didn't wear makeup lately, or lately, I mean, in the last 10 years, were, um, during the pandemic and when I was depressed. And nobody forced me to do it, for instance, at work. But when I do, I can see their eyes lit up. They pay more attention to what I say. So is it really freely to give up on makeup? Or in a way, isn't it empowering by using the tools that they recognize and by them in the society? As for Pam, I don't know what her reasons are. That thing with being the prettiest girl in the room, of course, It's absurd to think you're the prettiest girl in the room. It's not about competing. She was definitely the most noticeable, though, right? Going without makeup at public events, like when. When the code is black tie and long dress, and you go in pjs, you're the most. You'll be seen. You're the most noticeable. What if that was intentional? I mean, all the respect for everyone's choices, but, you know, if she did wear makeup at those events, she would have gotten a quarter of the attention that she got. Think about that. For the rest, everybody does how everybody feels. I, for one, love makeup. I do. It's wonderful to feel so good in your skin that you don't need it. But it's nice, isn't it? It's nice to enhance what you have. Beautiful. The symmetry of your face. By the way, makeup, you know, it has thousands of years of history. And ancient societies worried. The Egyptians, men worried at the court of France, the kings of France. It has many functions. It's not just pressure on women. Come on.",

I don't think that this was calculated at all but 2. even if it was I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0it's\u00a0weird\u00a0to\u00a0saythat\u00a0creators\u00a0calling\u00a0themout\u00a0for\u00a0it\u00a0um to say that consumers calling them out for it are like gullible or falling for it and you didn't say that but to say that like oh you need to know better and know that this is intentional and\u00a0they're\u00a0doing\u00a0thisfor\u00a0attention doesn't make it where it's on the consumer to then just ignore it I think it's still very important to call out behaviour like this especially if you think that they're doing it intentionally one of your key points is that there's just no way that this wasn't done intentionally because\u00a0there's\u00a0somany\u00a0meetings\u00a0and\u00a0somany\u00a0touch\u00a0points where they test out a product 1. this product was not tested on a human like this particular shade she\u00a0made\u00a0a\u00a0video\u00a0withit\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0bottle saying\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0hadn't\u00a0found\u00a0anyone\u00a0that\u00a0matched\u00a0the\u00a0shade so it wasn't tested on a human 2. I just feel like um which someone in the comments said these meetings are not made up of diverse people like I'm not sure why you think that there was someone in the room that was like oh yeah this this\u00a0is\u00a0definitely\u00a0racist\u00a0andthis\u00a0is\u00a0definitely\u00a0going\u00a0toget\u00a0us\u00a0attention this is perfect I think that she was rushed I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0she\u00a0doesn'thave\u00a0the\u00a0resources and I think that she doesn't have the knowledge I\u00a0feel\u00a0like\u00a0you're\u00a0forgetting\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0key\u00a0point\u00a0of\u00a0racismis\u00a0ignorance like I think when you start learning about racism and doing anti racism work it is easier to see these things but at the end of the day most people don't care to educate themselves so she just said oh I need to come out with a more diverse shade range let's make something that's darker than all of these other companies have come out with which\u00a0she\u00a0comparesher\u00a0swatch her black face paint to\u00a0Fenty\u00a0Beauty\u00a0andstuff\u00a0like\u00a0that she thought she was better because she went darker she wasn't actually trying to cater to a human being she's\u00a0trying\u00a0to\u00a0cater\u00a0to\u00a0theidea\u00a0of\u00a0diversity and when you're going based off of that ignorance you're\u00a0not\u00a0actually\u00a0doingit\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0care and so you're not actually going to do the research to realize that you're doing something wrong and\u00a0you\u00a0use\u00a0Pepsias\u00a0an\u00a0example the Pepsi commercial again it was not calculated controversy did it make their name go viral yes but again there were people in the room when you're out of touch these marketing executives CEOs older white men when you're out of touch with actual social issues you think on a very surface level the solutions to it are you know hand a cop of Pepsi and we all dance around and celebrate and police brutality is solved it's very surface level and pandering you know so I'm not sure why you think that they're so educated they knew that and there are people arguing in several comments in golloria's comments about that they do think that people that dark exist so I'm not sure why you think it is just this known fact that no one is black actually black and no one um there's no human walking around that dark because there are plenty of people arguing that there are humans that are that dark and I'm really glad that you know that I know that um other\u00a0beauty\u00a0influencersknow\u00a0that but\u00a0I-\u00a0I\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0you're\u00a0again like\u00a0I\u00a0said\u00a0just\u00a0forgetting\u00a0the\u00a0ignorance\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0largepart\u00a0of\u00a0racism that\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0do\u00a0peoplenot\u00a0know but\u00a0they\u00a0don't\u00a0care\u00a0toknow\u00a0better and then you say that you feel like it's weird that people are asking you for your opinion that there are beauty influencers that are more educated and that you wish that they were asked to speak on it and I'm just wondering if you saw Javon Ford's video if you saw golloria's video I've seen a lot of beauty influencers calling them out and\u00a0making\u00a0very\u00a0goodkey\u00a0points um I mean the whole reason that we know that black was the only pigment used in the shade is because Javon went into the ingredients list so I just feel like it's weird to think that like you're the only one who has been asked to do this and I wish you had done some more research on that cause you also would have seen that golloria was involved in calling them out the first time for their lack of diversity in the shade ranges and\u00a0so\u00a0then\u00a0you\u00a0kindasay\u00a0that people like golloria and Sean is another creator I follow who\u00a0did\u00a0buy\u00a0the\u00a0foundationto\u00a0prove\u00a0to\u00a0people\u00a0justhow\u00a0black\u00a0it\u00a0is um you kind of say that like this is the point to garner sales I think a few hundred people buying the foundation to show that it is tar in a bottle is not going to translate to long term success it's not going to translate to returning customers and it's ultimately going to hurt the brand I wouldn't be surprised if Ulta did pull out if they were banned from Ulta at this point so I don't think that it is a good business decision to put out something that NBC puts in their headline as 'Tar in a bottle' quoting golloria that's not gonna be a good look I don't wanna buy something that's referred to as tar in a bottle so just because you might have name recognition does not translate to sales yeah I just really wanna hammer home the point of this whole calculated controversy thing I feel like always comes up when someone is being called out for something when something is going viral a lot of people call it clout chasing clickbaiting whatever it is I think that there are instances of that you know I don't I'm\u00a0not\u00a0too\u00a0familiar\u00a0withMikayla\u00a0Nogueria but I did see that video where she put on false lashes and apparently she came out later and said that she did that on purpose I mean first of all I think that you're giving people too much credit that like of course if I saw a bunch of people calling me out and saying that I was doing some on purpose I'd be like yeah gotcha like a lot of people do that and she may not have done it intentionally but I think that is at least an example of something that we can really say this is calculated controversy this is to drive attention and that's it because if you're doing calculated controversy where you're actually just doing racism it's still just racism and you still should be called out for it I don't think that people are falling for it by pointing out that no one is that black that\u00a0they\u00a0only\u00a0used\u00a0a\u00a0black\u00a0pigment\u00a0and\u00a0that\u00a0that's\u00a0nothow\u00a0makeup\u00a0is\u00a0made I think that that proves if anything that she has no clue how makeup is made how to actually test foundations because again like I said how do you fully go through the process and bottle something without finding a single human to match I don't think it's cause it was done intentionally I think it's cause it was done out of ignorance and it's interesting because you use her color changing blush as a point that she does know a lot about makeup and chemistry but again if you had been following -not following youthforia- but following black influencers and black creators you would know that they also called them out about the color changing blush because it did not work on darker skin tones I think that um you're giving her again way too much credit you think that she's this master chemist she clearly isn't because her products do not work for everyone you can be educated on certain points and still be ignorant of other things so clearly her um lighter you know light to medium deep all the shades before that are very diverse have a range of undertones have very um small differences in those first like 10 or 15 shades that are not represented in the five medium deep to deep dark shades that she's provided so to use the examples of her creating this color changing blush as her being an expert chemist does not translate to other things there are a lot more that goes into creating darker shade ranges and when you're creating a foundation in general a formula that works for a lighter shade is not going to work for a darker shade necessarily because when you add more pigments it um you know makes the formula work differently I\u00a0do\u00a0think\u00a0it's\u00a0good\u00a0tocall\u00a0out\u00a0and\u00a0say you know y'all should be mindful of who you're giving your money to don't go out and buy the shade just to swatch it for a video I agree with that but I also think that it's disingenuous to act like people calling them out isn't important I do not think that this is going to create returning customers and if you look into case studies around um that Pepsi commercial that you use in an as an example which you do admit it hurt their stock and it hurt their brand recognition I mean they were more widely recognized but not for good reasons and when you're trying to um market yourselves to a more diverse audience they're going to be the first ones to see these very uh artificial ploys for their attention and for their consumerism and so if you have notable figures like golloria that called them out it is going to signal to the community they're not making stuff for me and I don't think that any brand would want them want their foundation to be referred to as tar in a bottle and for them to be silent on this I think just continues to show how unintentional this was because you want to control the narrative when you do things like this yes you want people to speculate you want the attention but then you want to come in and control the narrative you want to say oh my gosh that's right I messed up like she did with the first time with the shade ranges not being inclusive"

But we're definitely gonna dip into it, and we're gonna see what he's talking about. Oh, look, he even signed it for us. This is the front, and these are the colors. Oh, look, we even got stickers. How sweet. We're gonna get these eyebrows right real quick. I pray my eyes. I'm not gonna lie. There's not a real color story to this. Like, it looks like we have, like, maybe one neutral color, and the rest are colors. So, I don't know. Let's see what we could come up with. So we're gonna go ahead and start with that neutral color. It's called Carmen right here. I don't know. I really got some high hopes for you, rich, so let's hope this works out. I'm gonna set this all over here, and then I'm gonna Blend, Blend, blend. So then we're just gonna go ahead and dip into that black color. Do, like, a little bit of a smoky eye with the color. Robert, I'm not the best at Smokey Eye, so we're not gonna blame him for that, so. Yeah. Hold on. What was his color story? I don't. I didn't really know what else to do, so we're gonna make it happen now. We're gonna go in with the one shimmer that he has right here, and it's called problematic. Hmm. Imagine that. Now we're gonna go back with Carmen, and we're gonna go underneath the eyes. What do you guys think? I really like the shimmer. However, for a 38 dollar palette, I think we're gonna give this a 6.5",

Okay, this is something I've been thinking about a lot, and if you're a guy, I feel like you need to be taking note, especially if you're the type of guy who, like, likes to dress well. Maybe you're, like, one of these guys who's, like, super into the moustache and the mullet. Like, you kind of like to be trendy and fashionable, but, like, you're also dating. But to be honest, even if you're not dating, like, if you have a girlfriend, she'll probably appreciate this, realising that what we kind of want is, like, feminine guys. Take Harry Styles for another example. Like, we all love him, so maybe you should be copying him. Like, I appreciate there's a lot of pressure for guys to be impressing other guys and, like, the toxic masculinity, even. Maybe not toxic, but just, like, that masculinity thing, it's pretty intense. So I appreciate why you might be hesitant to, like, wear pearl necklaces, paint your nails, flare jeans, fun prints. Like, sure, it might be a bit much. Like, Brad Mondo is a pretty good example of that. I mean, I think it's safe to say he's gay. I'm pretty sure. I mean, I could be overstepping with that, but I'm pretty sure. But he doesn't come to the table, like how I think we stereotypically have thought of gay people in the Past. He's just well groomed, trendy, takes the time to clearly think about what he's doing, what he's wearing, what he's saying, and not being afraid to tap into his femininity. Was also still saying pretty masculine. I don't know if anybody else agrees, but I'd maybe say that Harry Styles maybe sometimes is a bit more feminine than Brad Mondo is. But like, he's a good looking guy because he takes care of his skin, he probably does his eyebrows. It looks like he takes the time to like, make his beard really neat. Obviously he cares about his hair. And to be honest, as I say obviously, I realise that maybe some people don't even know who Brad Mondo is, but he's basically a hairdresser on TikTok who is very funny. So yeah, I think if you wanna be playing the game with the girls in mind, then that's just my advice. And also I should say yes, obviously there are girls who love guys who are super masculine. But I think. I really think you can do both. And I fully support finding your vibe, but maybe there's just something to experiment with.",

There is not one human being in this world that is the color jet black. Jet black. Look at my hoodie. There's nobody this fucking color. There's nobody. Have you seen your phone screen? There's nobody that fucking color. There's not. I'm so sick of these black folks trying to. Trying to take up for this nonsense. Take up for this nonsense. It's ridiculous. There's no. That was pure racist. They asked for a darker shade, and they just said, here, here you go. Literally, the bottle shows one pigment, and it's black. There's no undertones, there's no oranges, there's no, uh, neutral tones, no. No yellow undertones. Nothing in it. Just black. That is pure disrespect. And that's why you turned your comments off, because everybody was eating you up, because you know damn well there's nobody that damn color. Nobody. That's pure racist. I seen two of the darkest women on TikTok try that foundation. It was still too fucking dark for them. Rihanna set the tone for makeup years ago when she dropped that Fenty Beauty. And she made skin. She made foundations for all skin tones and skin types. Okay, did she create a pitch black foundation? Fuck, no. So what does that tell you? She has the darkest shade in foundation. Rare beauty has one of the darkest shades in foundation, and guess what? It fits those people talking about the Guinness Book of World Records. What are you talking about? When you find a pitch black man or a pitch black woman that's completely just black like this, you. You. You put them, you. You take a video with that or you post it on. On TikTok so we can see it, because I've never in my life seen anybody that damn black. Black people are not fucking black. We're brown. Your hair is not black, it's brown. Your eye color is not black, it's brown when you put light to it. Like, are you serious? Get it together, as a lot of y'all need to go back to school and learn color theory again and how to mix colors. You can't mix that with nothing. You can't mix it with nothing. It's gonna turn into MUD. It's gonna look gray. It's gonna look stupid. Nobody's that color. And if anybody's that color, then we need somebody to make a white foundation, pure fucking white. Cause there. Cause, I mean, let's be real. There's no white person that's pure white. Like paper. Like, let's be for real. It's ridiculous at this point, these arguments going back and forth. It's ridiculous. Nobody's that color. End of story. And if that's the case, then they need to be all inclusive and make a white person make a white foundation. Pure white for The whitest person ever. Like, are you serious? Let's be smart here. I had to come on here looking a mess because you're pissing me off.",

But I think we need to do a better job of picking and choosing who we battle and who we take sides and who we argue with online.

And then I got dripped out, and I got bring the bling. Just like this beige color taking off what I already have. We gonna start off with she got money. Hmm. That's really pretty. Um, kinda gotta get in there, but I like her. Let's zoom in. I like her. Okay, next one we're gonna try is dripped out. Okay. This one might be my favorite so far. I would wear this every day. This is so cute. Tripped out. Okay, and the last one we're gonna do is bring the bling. This one I'm kind of scared for cause it's like, beige almost. Y'all, at first I was thinking I would probably just wear this on top of my regular lip combo. I love this. It's almost like a frosty, like, Y2K kind of look. Okay, I think this one might be the favorite. I'm not even gonna lie. Okay, the girl that I stitch said that she felt kind of a plumping effect. I don't really feel that, but what do you guys think? Which one was your favorite? They're only $6, so if you are at Ulta, I would say grab you one.",

You're being racist. You actually haven't seen someone that color before because that's not a human skin tone. I hope this helps to this conversation. You do not have the life lived experience. You do not have the proper credentials to be giving a valid input.

And I'm pretty sure she said in one of the clips that she had no budget, and that kind of irritated me a little bit, because there's people who really would love to start a brand who don't have the money to, like, to do so.

The one thing I can always count on is for a black woman to get on here in Kanesha. Very sad word. Let me help you out. Nobody in the history of ever is black like midnight without any undertones. There are no red undertones, there are no yellow undertones. There's no undertones. That's just straight black pigment. So for the people that aren't seeming to understand that, and I don't even wear makeup like that, but I understand colors. I understand the color wheel. I understand blending of colors. It's not that hard. Why doesn't euphoria have a pure white foundation then? Like, you know, white out, the old school white out. Why don't they have that? It's the same reason that they should not have pure black. Because nobody is pure black. Even the darkest person in the world is not just pure black. They have undertones. Even if they have blue undertones, red undertones, yellow undertones, they have undertones in their skin. The same way with white people. There's no such thing as having white like that. Would. Can you imagine if there was a foundation and they came out with the color of my teeth? There is not a person that is the color of freaking teeth. Oh, well, I'll say white teeth. But how are y'all not understanding this? And to see black people, black women, Going hard again for an Asian company. Y'all make me so sick. Y'all make me so sick. Sick. Seek help. Because there's no way. There's no way that you're sitting on this internet acting like you are once again, once again running to the rescue of an Asian company who is clearly showing they're being racist. As a matter of fact, why does anybody even give that company any airtime? This is not their first Rodeo on their race racist antics. Stop wanting to be so involved with other companies that you beg for inclusivity and they throw disrespect. And then you're not the victim of the disrespect. If they show you that they don't want you, create your own or go to a black company. Stop wanting the acceptance of them so damn bad. Stop it!",

There needs to be reds, greens, even blues, whatever. That foundation has no undertone. A chemist came out and said, compared to the other foundations, this one only has black in it, has no other colors so that it has an undertone. That foundation was compared to black face paint because there's no dimension to it. It's just black. And, no, you can't mix it because it turned other shades gray because it's just black. I'm afraid that's just how color theory works, y'all. But what I'm not understanding is what you guys aren't getting. It was marketed as a foundation. You shouldn't have to mix it. You shouldn't have to use it as other things. You shouldn't have to use it as contour if it can't do this job. It's literally created and marketed as. It's. It's really that simple.

It's also that the range that they added, it almost seems like a Fu. Like they were like, oh, you want darker? Here is dark. That darkest color has no dimension, no undertone. It is. Has one ingredient, like, one color shade, and it is like a flat black. And people keep talking about Maya Kim. She tried it on. The last one looks like blackface on her now.

If we're being super, super technical, technically, the color black is actually a shade. And that's why, when it comes to skin tones, makeup, anything and everything, there's undertones, color theory. And I can grasp the concept of when watching Gloria's video and making it seem, or her making it seem like she is the darkest person, but I think. I think she knows that she's not and that there are beautiful people that are darker than her. However, those darker people are not making the videos that she is. And this is a series that not only brought her success, brought and shed light onto things that people have been trying to talk about for years in the makeup industry when it comes to brands and their lack of shades. The gist of it all is that euphoria did a shitty job. Not only was their darkest shade the literal color black, they didn't have a white color. There's no white like my color like my shirt. And then the shade before the black one. In between those two, they could have been easily a good 6, 7 shades, maybe up to 10. And then in this video, she also made a comment talking about how people could use that foundation to do, like, beauty marks or like, do like a country. I look you kind Of prove the point of it being literally black. And also to, like, from makeup artist, you cannot do that with foundation. It's gonna be a mess, because it does not have the formula and concept of eyeliner or eyeshadow stick. It's a cream in general, like, message of it all. What brands need to do is go to the. The point of it all. Go to these people, get darker skin tones to work on these shades. And also for brands, if this is also an issue for you, please learn undertones. Because I've seen foundations, working in Sephora and being a makeup artist, where it says, oh, yeah, this is neutral and it's warm. Regardless of it all, just a little euphoria fucked up. Like, that was straight shitty. And if they really thought that, they was gonna get a pat on the back for that. Come on.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is she the darkest woman in America? Because I don't see her in a Guinness book. A world record. Okay, so I think it's time to educate some people on what color theory is. In order for a complexion product to be a complexion product, it has to be comprised of at least three pigments. At least. If you want to go on my profile and look at the previous video that I posted, it showed the foundation for the darkest shade to only have one pigment. And what is that pigment? Nitrous oxide. Black. It's literally black. And please, I'm very aware that there are black women out there who have very, very gorgeous, very rich and deep brown skin. You hear those that you hear brown. But that does not mean they are comprised of one pigment. Honey, it is very incorrect to be saying that. It is very common knowledge that in the labs that they need to make at least three different pigments. They have to use at least three to make a shade, okay? Because even though it's not common to the eye, and even the black women may not see it themselves because they don't know about color theory, they just wanna get a foundation that matches them. It doesn't matter how deep you are. Does not matter how deep you are. You are comprised of red and blues in your skin. Even if you are that deep, you're gonna be more warm or More cool depending on your skin tone. And might I say, I saw on her profile. Not gonna lie, I was peeking a little bit cause I wanted to see. It's a chemist on there. I would assume that you would know that it is biologically impossible for one person to be one pigment. You have to be comprised of multiple pigments. It literally is telling you. We're giving you facts. It's literally a fact that it is comprised of only one pigment. So at the end of the day, you're wrong. Incorrect. Next.",

I do wear makeup I don't wear much makeup um but I can show you what I have before I go into that I did start a spreadsheet for all the makeups, skincare, and products that I've tried and if I have a reaction I add to the spreadsheet to try to come up with some sort of overlapping ingredient thing the the best of my knowledge I think I have an issue with propylene glycol or peg products which is a problem because it's in like everything and it's unavoidable so I try to limit it as much as possible the other thing is if it is like shiny or glittery like a highlighter it will make me itchy so I have to avoid that so with that um I use Estee Lauder's Double Wear foundation is concealer or cover up um I'm not using it correctly but I don't have any problems with it for blush I have two different options I have a Bobby Brown like illuminating bronzer but I'm a ginger so it is blush this is blush or bronzer for redheads my actual blush is by milk this one seems to be okay um for eyeshadow I don't do anything shiny and I don't do any of like the gel or the pens or the like the dips I stick with plain powder um and I have little powders from makeup forever I am a sucker for lipstick but I seem to be having issues with pinky or colours now like the pink colours burn um before that was the case I really liked NARS um the shocker that is going to shock everybody in this included me when I found this out is I really like the Gwen Stefani lip stain Gwen Stefani as a person, I have some thoughts I'm allergic to everything so I don't really have the luxury of paying attention to some of those thoughts if I want to wear makeup before Gwen Stefani got into music apparently she wanted to be a makeup artist her makeup is amazing I was shocked like this is my all time favourite lip stain um upon looking more into her she uses coconut oil as makeup remover so I suspect she also has sensitive skin then speaking of other sensitive skin problems um I can't use I I struggle it with moisturizers most of them burn and that includes products made specifically for sensitive skin like REN can't wear them um what I can wear is this intense rescue thing by Dior and this youth capture thing by Dior these are the only two moisturizer products I can use that don't make my face burn um I put them on my Christmas list because they're really expensive in terms of eyeliner I have three but I'm gonna say take them with a grain of salt because if I do not scrub them off my face with a q tips like I literally scrub my lash lines with Q tips I will get styes um I use the Tarte double take one I use this Glossier one this is the all time thinnest eyeliner I've ever found it's kind of amazing and then I have this really cheap wet n wild one um it runs like crazy so that's the look what you want, it's a good one but just know that going in the last one is that ah the only shampoo and conditioner I can use without itching or burning is Olaplex and it's amazing because I don't dye my hair I don't need Olaplex I just can't find anything else I can tolerate so very exciting it seems for like for some reason the higher end or more luxurious something is the more likely I am to tolerate it but I have no idea why",

It, in fact, exists for the brand to say that their entire makeup line is not actually for anyone with dark skin. They might as well have named the Damn Shade Shoe Polish. This shade was released purely out of spite and racism. You cannot convince me that there weren't at least, probably way more, at least three people at the absolute highest level in this company who fully intended this shade to be to be a joke about minstrel shows. Not only are they saying, hey, black women, are lines not for you, but they're also saying, even when we approximate your skin tone, um, it's actually for white people to, uh, then be part of the extremely long and horrific history of painting themselves pitch fucking black to mock your entire race. It's shoe polish. That was their intention. This is not a legitimate foundation shade. It is mockery. In response to being called out for trying to make a whites only makeup brand in 2024.",

So I'm reminded I used to work at the fast food industry, right? So sometimes a customer would come and then ask for ketchup, and I'm like, okay, whatever. You know, I'm trying to hurry up because fast food, right? When they come back again to be like, hey, we want ketchup. And I, like, I don't know. It's a petty part of me that I'd get mad and then I grab a whole handful of ketchup and then give it to them. It's petty, it's wrong, it's not right. Like, they're just trying to get their ketchup right. But that's what you, for years, like, seems to be doing, and it's bogus, because it's like, they're probably like, oh, we're just trying to be inclusive. We just want to make sure we get everybody, yada, yada. Nah, I. I don't understand really, what they're. What they're trying to do here. But people should not be punished or reprimanded for asking for the things that they want or they need. You can give it to them. Go ahead, give it to me. If you can't, then don't target. I mean, it's gonna be difficult not to target to that audience because you're in the US, and if your product is in the US, there's a variety of people that bearing, shape, tone, and you Should have kept that in mind when you made it. You're in Asia where skin did not differentiate all too much. I understand, but that's not the case here."
