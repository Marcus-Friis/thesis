Well, because we happen to live in America, and we don't have the burden of proof, and so there's not. That's not the point that should. That's a question that is a loaded question that should not be asked of a defense attorney or a defendant. The question that we asked the jury, and they ultimately obviously got passed, is why. Why the prosecution didn't call those witnesses. Right. You, as a defenser, you don't go into a case saying, um, I'm gonna fill the holes of the prosecution. Right? And. And Keith Schiller and. And some of the other witnesses that were not ultimately called, in our view, should have been called. Should have been called by the prosecution. And we asked the jury to take a hard look at that.

And everyone that watches my videos knows that I don't take a Republican side, I don't take a Democrat side, I don't take a conspiracy theory side. I just take the side of common sense. And common sense tells me that this is insane. I mean, we're literally living in Sri Lanka at this point. This is what dictators do of third world countries to their political opponents. This is what Putin does. And if this exact same situation was happening to a Democrat right now, any Democrat, I would be saying the same thing. Because it's wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it's also entirely hypocritical, because people that were a part of this trial were saying that the voters of Donald Trump deserve to know this information before they voted for him in 2016, in 2020. So why don't the voters get to know about Hillary Clinton's 36,000 emails then? That's so hypocritical. Why didn't the voters get to know about Hunter Biden's laptop? Why didn't the voters get to know about hunter and Joe Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and what 10% for the big guy meant? And again, I'm trying to come out of a place of common sense here as an independent voter. I wanna know what Joe and Hunter's emails were about now. I wanna know what Hillary Clinton's emails were about now. As much as I wanna know about this Donald Trump shit.

So that's great. Especially the party that says, therefore, law and order. That racist, fascist dog whistle. That's never been true. So, therefore, law and order. But they're gonna put up a 34 count felon to leave this country a fucking traitor. But let, let. Let's make one thing clear. This was not a hush money trial. Donald Trump has been convicted of fixing the election. Just like the Russia stuff. This is an example of how his presidency was illegitimate. It was stolen through illegal means. We all know this. Everything he did should be wiped off the board. All of those fucking judges, including on the Supreme Court, should be unseated. This is what should happen if this country had any sanity whatsoever. If this country had any sanity whatsoever, Donald Trump would be in prison and not threatening the health of our rights. So it's a good day. I mean, it's been a long time coming. We've been waiting for Donald Trump to be convicted of some sort of criminal activity for, it seems like, forever. But to me, it's certainly bittersweet because it doesn't take him off the chessboard, and it absolutely should. It remains to be seen what the political ramifications are for this, and so let's just take in this sweet victory and Recognize that this traitor is also now a felon. Right? I mean, the shit that's going on in Florida with Eileen Cannon is an embarrassment to anybody in the legal profession anywhere. Um, our legal system is a fucking joke still. But at least they got this one right. 34 count felony. Little Donnie the felon.",

So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date.",

And he said, they've got to get the hostages. They have to go get the hostages. Hostages have to be a priority.

He didn't get animated talking about the return of Israeli hostages or what was going on inside the Gaza Strip. He only got animated and energized when he was talking about the 2020 election being rigged and stolen. He doesn't care about that. He cares about the 2020 election, and he knows. He knows it wasn't rigged. He knows it was not stolen. He knows that. He has known that since the beginning. He has known that since the beginning. But, yeah, his grievances are the only thing that matter to him. That his grievances matter to him more than his own children matter to him. Certainly more than his own supporters matter to him. He's disgusted by his own supporters. He thinks they're disgusting people. He wouldn't. He doesn't touch them. He doesn't shake hands. With his supporters ever? Not unless they've got a membership tomorrow Lago or are a billionaire donor. Those are the only supporters of his who he will touch. He doesn't. He's a politician who doesn't shake hands.

And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions.

Yeah, people who have met an IQ standard that they cannot support humanity or support a normal job or are mentally disabled. What?

He went over Iran. Fear Donald Trump, Richard. He didn't fear Joe Biden. Trump went to Helsinki, right, and he stood next to Vladimir Putin, and he actually said that he was more inclined to believe Vladimir Putin than he was his own security services.

When, as Mercy Otis Warren would say, the checks of conscience are thrown aside and a deformed picture of the soul is revealed. The presumptive Republican nominee is the opioid of all opioids. An easy cure for what some believe is the solution to our myriad pains and problems. When in fact, with him, you end up re enslaved with an even bigger problem. A worse affliction and addiction a bigger delusion. James Baldwin would say, the author and finisher of our national existence, our national suicide. As Mr. Lincoln prophecies.

See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome.",

You have to have the political will and the muscle to sit there and say, they can call me a racist, they can call me a nativist, they can call me a xenophobe, a sexist, a homophobe, all of it.

Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights.

Literally, there are zero positives and a million negatives, because what are you gonna testify to?

And nobody believes defendants who testify on their own behalf, because why would they? Big brothers. Literally no positives whatsoever. However, there are a million fucking negatives.

I think there's an overwhelming chance of a conviction, a significant but much smaller chance of a hung jury, and zero chance of an acquittal. Why? Because they built a very strong circumstantial case. They built a building out of a series of bricks that really couldn't be crossed. And that circumstantial case, least in my experience, having tried a lot of cases, is very, very powerful with the jury. But my gut tells me, and had a lot of experience, that they'll be impressed with the way in which the prosecution connected it to broader themes, to an election, to the Trump's need, according to the proof, to suppress information, to conceal it from the voters. That kind of stuff rings loud, I think, in the minds of public spirit and citizens. And when you're on a jury, public spirit just flows through you. So that's why I think it's more likely than not to be a conviction."

You know, in the New York City trial, your defense rested its case without you taking the stand. You know, you said you would absolutely testify. Why did you decide ultimately not to take the stand? Was that a hard decision for you? Yeah, because he made rulings that makes it very difficult to testify. Anything I did, anything I did in the past, I can bring everything up. Then, you know what? I've had a great past, but anything but the other thing is, and the main reason, and I don't even mind that effect, I like talking about it, because we had rigged cases. New York is out of control, and they can solve it with a good appellant. You know, we won in the Angoran case, who he doesn't know anything about what he's doing and he's totally corrupt. That's a different case. We had that overturned. We had decisions overturned five times. I think it's a. Yeah. None of that is true. Not a single word. The judge in the criminal case against Donald Trump did not make any rulings to make it difficult for him to testify. The judge ruled that prosecutors could ask Donald Trump about a variety of things, and Donald Trump simply did not wanna answer those questions. He also claimed that He beat Judge Edgarron five times in the civil fraud suit against him in New York City, which is also not true. I don't know where he's getting this stuff. He's completely making it up. Donald Trump didn't testify because he's a coward. He's scared. He doesn't wanna answer questions under oath. He doesn't wanna answer tough questions from prosecutors. Instead, he wants to sit in court, fall asleep, then leave, go lie to the media about the case, and then go home and play golf at Mar a Lago. That's all he wants to do.",

This is absolutely not normal, completely out of the mainstream, but something that a lot of Republicans have fantasized about doing. Immediately there was enormous push back, as well there should have been. Donald Trump went to truth social to post the truth, saying that he didn't actually wanna limit contraception and that this had been a democratic lie. But we have video of him saying that he wanted to limit contraception or at the very least kick it back to the states. This is so out of the mainstream, and more importantly, it's wildly unpopular with voters. Remember, the right is pushing this idea that a fertilized egg is a person. And that will trickle down to stopping the birth control pill, making that illegal, making the morning after pill illegal. Because if a fertilized egg is a person, then birth control, theoretically at least, would be murder.",

He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today."

Because everywhere we look, we're looking up at leaders and. And we're creating these hierarchies. And so we have strongman leaders. We go to school and we look up at the teacher. We go to church and there's a priest. We go to work and there's a boss. So everywhere we're being conditioned to be told what to do. And so when times get scared, fascism always rises. If you notice, when technology spikes, when communicative technology spikes, right? The radio and the television movie specifically, like triumph of the will drove the Mustache Man and gerbils and. And propelled those guys in Germany to power, right? And. And there's a couple reasons for this. Number one, the world. You see more of the world, right? So the internet comes and we're starting to see all over the world, okay? People get scared. They see their power waning, that the. The barbarians are at the gate. They see all of these other cultures. And certain people are trained to. To be model culturalists. And the introduction of other cultures into their. Into their understanding makes them scared and wanna protect their power, protect their culture. And in order to do so, they turn to a strong man leader. But. But it's about fear and our conditioning and the fact that we're all created to be bootlickers. We're all trained to Look up at authority. What does that do? It creates authoritarianism. So everywhere, look. Think of Christianity. Christianity is a fascist religious template. There is an all powerful strong man, god, who you can't talk shit about. You can't take his name in vain. You can't have any other religions. It's a monotheistic, monocultural religious template. And it conditions people for fascism. If you don't follow the leader, you burn in hell. Let god sort it out, as they say. And so it. It. It. It is just human nature to look to somebody else to solve our problems when. When. When we're. When we're scared, I guess. Or at least western civilizations, nature is. Is. Is. Is a liquor in search of a boot. Basically, that. That. That's what we're conditioned for. And then we talk a tough game about individualism and all of this bullshit. But the difference between what we say and what we do as humans is where all of all. All of the truth is found.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the Liberal left tells you to follow the science. Okay, well, did you know you can scientifically prove this statement? Liberalism is a mental disorder? Yeah, see, 75% of a human brain mass is made up of a substance called myelom. Myelom is 100% made up of cholesterol. Now it's funny cause alzheimer's didn't exist before 1979. Which is funny, cause if you look right prior to 1979, you saw this big push during the 70s to tell you that cholesterol was bad. We didn't need cholesterol, we needed to get it out of our system. It's weird too, because that's when we started to see products like margarine and other things come onto the market to replace butter because they were low cholesterol or no cholesterol alternatives, and they're literally one molecule away from being plastic. We saw this massive rise in vegetarianism and veganism and we went from first finding alzheimer's in 1979 to today, in 2024, Alzheimer's being one of the leading causes of death in the western civilization, which is a neurological disorder, degenerative, where you kill brain cells. Now, where do we see veganism and vegetarianism where they tell you you don't need to eat animals, when in fact you do, cause that cholesterol that you need to keep those brain cells is in the animals and animal fats and butters that you eat. It's not in the vegetables that you eat that are devoid of cholesterol. So we can scientifically show that back In the 70s, to be called a Liberal was a negative thing for a Democrat to now liberalism is taken over the Democrat Party. And according to studies coming out of the psychological world, people who identify as Liberal have a higher instance of mental disorder. That's scientifically proven. Again, so we can definitively prove that liberalism is a mental disorder because you're devoid of cholesterol and you're losing brain cells.",

Nation in the history of the world, but now we are a nation in decline. Yeah, like 30 to 40 seconds of silence. He's not saying anything. He's just frozen there. It seems like he had a bit of an emergency there or something like this. Reminded me of the time that Mitch McConnell froze in the podium, and I disagree with Mitch McConnell, but I'm thankful that he's okay. That looks very similar to me. He looked confused. He didn't really know where he was or what he was saying. I think this is incredibly concerning. Like, Donald Trump's ability to serve is certainly in question. He's stumbling over his words. He's falling asleep every single day in court, and he's doing stuff like this at his rallies. It's just happening far too often. So I don't know. I mean, like, freezing while you're speaking for, like, 40 seconds, not good."

    "voice_to_text": "here's what's going on with the TikTok lawsuits in my meeting with John Kirby at the White House getting a one on one interview with John Kirby is something that most journalists would kill for and we were able to get it because of the power of TikTok now in the beginning I think he thought he was gonna be able to convince me that there were security implications that meant that I should support a ban but I was able to turn it around pretty quickly I talked about the people on this app because that's the part I think the White House is missing and banning TikTok would result in an economic apocalypse among other things I told them you have to understand and have some compassion for the fact that there are millions of people on this app that make 200 400 dollars a month but that's rent that's diapers that's food on their table it's not just about the big creators who could go somewhere else a ban on TikTok he's a former admiral would also directly affect our military readiness and reenlistment I met with military families back in September who said that TikTok changed their lives because the number one most unemployable demographic is military spouses but thanks to TikTok they've been able to become influencers or sell on TikTok Shop start small businesses that they could advertise here and do e commerce in addition to the work it also affects people's livelihoods TikTok is this place where you see something funny and you can send it to someone it makes you feel connected when you're away and so for many of our military families TikTok is something that makes them feel connected it's also a great benefit to their children who are able to meet other people like them and make friends off base or if they know they're gonna be moving start talking to kids from that area a ban on TikTok directly affects reenlistment and military readiness I also talked about for the people who don't even make any money on here this is a place that makes you believe in yourself there are folks who make like 41 cents I remember the first dollar I made on TikTok for a video that's what gave me the confidence to make another one to feel like I don't know maybe I can do this maybe maybe I am worth something you can't take that away from people when you don't have anything to replace it with not just the heart of the nation that is beating well here on TikTok but our connectivity and also our economic opportunities I also told him that I thought that the White House was showing a grave lack of compassion when it comes to talking about TikTok in the ban having President Biden hopping on a helicopter going yeah I'll sign it I I'll sign it I support a ban on TikTok stuff like that's gonna cost him the election in addition to a million other things he's doing that people don't like but stuff like that comes off just so bad and just heartless and uncompassionate I do believe that John Kirby actually listened to the things I had to say and was surprised by many of them now whether he takes action on them or not that's step two step one was getting in the door but I've been an advocate for a long time and I've taken White House meetings with people who were far less fun than John Kirby okay this is me at Trump's White House meeting Betsy Devos begging her to not cancel the food relief program that I was doing with kids in Detroit this is what I do this is my job I've been at it for a long time and dare I say I am very good at it when I believe in something I believe all the way and I will go to the wall for it I was there day one of the trials when they started trying to ban TikTok and I will be here with you to the very end I will continue to fight as I know you will as well because you are and TikTok themselves has filed a lawsuit so I've got the two lawsuits right now that I have a lot of faith in will protect us from a ban first up the TikTok corporate suit TikTok corporate has asked the court to issue a declaratory judgment saying that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act violates the Constitution and wants the court to issue an order that would stop Attorney General Merrick Garland from enforcing it and they claim that this act violates the Constitution in a couple ways first something called fire sale takings the government is forcing TikTok to try and sell this application for less than it's worth faster than it's possible the second is on Fifth Amendment grounds TikTok is being treated different than other applications even than other adversary owned applications TikTok is also suing for First Amendment violations not just of creator speech that would be affected but the fact that TikTok itself the company has speech thanks to Citizens United companies are people and money is speech and TikTok is a person using money as a form of speech they also have channels for which they distribute information and express themselves on as a company that is protected under the First Amendment lastly there's this thing called bills of attainer and those are unconstitutional in the United States Congress cannot make a Bill that convicts somebody of a crime without a trial so they're saying Congress essentially forcing this divestment is accusing TikTok of being unsafe to national security but never allowed them the trial to prove that and so thereby is violating Article 1 Section 9 and Article 1 Section 10 of the US Constitution furthermore if Congress can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down then how could this be used in the future in an even worse way TikTok also saying that it is impossible to move the apps underlying coding to a new owner it could take years for engineers to familiarize themselves with the code to develop and maintain the platform in addition the engineers would still need to access ByteDance software to keep TikTok functioning which this new law prohibits TikTok has invested $2 billion in security protocols sometimes called Project Texas and even given the government a kill switch to poll that would immediately pull the plug on the app if TikTok violated certain promises regarding security so TikTok's gonna try to prove that they have put $2 billion into shoring up security and that they'll even give Congress an automatic kill switch if by some chance some national security had been breached and they're gonna say that should be good enough because no other platform is doing the same thing no other platform has put that much effort into security now let's talk about the creator lawsuit eight creators are being represented by Davis Wright Tremaine a firm in Seattle known for its cases involving First Amendment and media law this is the same group of lawyers that was able to overturn the TikTok ban in Montana and that also got Trump's attempt to ban TikTok overturned their suit focuses on the fact that TikTok is uniquely different from other applications and that you do not need to provide a bunch of personal data to make your profile or to view content and the content you are served does not leverage understanding your in real life friends and family for connection but rather offers you a for you page and that success on TikTok is not easily replicated on other social media platforms proving that it is uniquely successful for speech they're claiming that TikTok's defining traits stem from the editorial decisions it makes using its proprietary content recommendation technology TikTok would no longer be TikTok without that technology and these creators along with the other hundred and seventy million people who create or view or comment on content on this app would similarly have their First Amendment rights violated if there were changes made or if there was a forced divestment I'm very confident in those two lawsuits meaning that TikTok is sticking around for a long time I'm also very hopeful that in addition to these lawsuits my conversation with John Kirby will be heard and will be considered because the lack of compassion that the White House and Biden in particular has shown towards tiktokers is in my opinion unacceptable in addition things like that continue to chip away at any lead Biden might have in this presidential election and it is his job to earn votes actions like this and being rude or dismissive of tiktokers is not going to help earn votes it is not my job to soften President Biden to tiktokers or to whip votes for the Democrats it is his job to do that which is why to this point I haven't said who I'm voting for or who you should vote for simply that the Electoral College doesn't allow us to really access a third party candidate even when Ross Perrow won 19% of the vote back in the 90s he didn't make any electoral advances he didn't get one state in the Electoral College Biden and Trump have 3 4 months to make their case on why they should be the president I'm gonna be looking at who they're putting in their cabinets what their policies look like but I'm also going to be looking at things like are you in touch with the heart of this nation are you listening to people and then we'll make up our minds in November right um in personal news I'm gonna be taking a couple days off of TikTok I'm still working but um we had a little bit of a family emergency with some medical stuff with my dad this morning and I need to be present for that so I'm not gonna be making Tik Toks probably at at least for the next day or two um so if you pray or if you have good vibes please send them our way um and I will be back as soon as I can be clear headed and present with you guys here and know that he's safe and taken care of okay I love you I trust you make good decisions",

In his announcement, Abbott said, Texas has one of the strongest stand your ground laws of self defense that cannot be notified by a jury or a progressive district attorney. Just complete disdain for independent legal proceedings from the party of law and order. Now, Republicans have sent a clear message in the violent figures they celebrated in recent years.

Tuesday, Tuesday, he said that the principal, uh, correspondence that he had was directly with President Trump. And only about the completion of this pay off to Stormy Daniels.

Well behind the Gen Xers you have the veteran Gen Xers, you have the Hardcore Gen Xers, the FAFO Gen Gen Xers if I may say. And you got to remember that we support the Gen Xers that are peace loving.

    "voice_to_text": "Well, it's official. Gen X is taking over TikTok and Facebook and X and every other platform out there. Something woke him up. And I keep getting the question, what caused Generation X to finally wake up from their slumber? And the thing is, that's not an easy question to answer. Because each of us woke up on our own timeline, each of us decided that we wanted to start paying closer attention to what was happening in the world around us. You see, we poured our blood, our sweat, and our tears, and we've had to fight for everything that we have in life. And many of us are starting to watch that slip through our fingertips because the ruling radical elites in Washington, DC and in the media and the celebrity class have decided that what's ours is theirs. Well, we've decided that we're taking it back. So I could go through a whole host of events, of single issues that have occurred over the last several decades that have caused each individual to wake up on their own time frame. But there's one thing, one thing that's occurred over the last couple of years that I think if I had to put my finger on, this is what's caused Generation X to wake up.",

You know, this is one of the most closely watched counties here in the key battleground state of Georgia, so it seems like the perfect place to come out and talk to Republican voters and see all of the coverage, all of the things that we're talking about. This New York hush money trial, how was it impacting them down here? So I spoke with about five different Republicans, and they represent a very wide cross action, a very diverse group of Republican voters here in this county. And I asked them, how are they being impacted by this trial? Are they paying close attention? And what impact might a guilty verdict have on their decision to support the former president? Here's what they told me. Take a look. Do each of you support Donald Trump? I do. Yes. Yes, yes. For all three of you, has this trial changed your opinion, even caused you to wave or question that at all? No, it's, um, actually caused me to support him more. Um, I. I just don't believe there's a coincidence that, uh, we have a trial happening in Atlanta, uh, we have one happening in New York. So the question people are beginning to ask themselves, like, ideas like, why now? It's pretty much everybody says they're picking on him. You know, people are tired of going after him. And you sit in so many areas, it's really not a big issue in the party. Actually, they're really making everybody mad and they look at a big bully and the government is a bully. This is gonna be your first time casting a ballot. Um, what is it for you that drives your support of the former president? Um, thing. Always fighting me, taking so much just defence from news and everything. But he still hasn't given up. He just. He keeps fighting to do his right. I've talked to many people who formally identified as a Democrat. They have changed their political persuasion to independent and they are looking forward to voting for Trump because now they find something in common with a political candidate at that level. When you say they find commonality, what. What is that commonality? They. They have felt persecuted by the system of American injustice and it's not a a stretch for them to think that Trump may be a victim as well. People see that there's. There's some kind of commonality between himself and maybe all the black men that have been incarcerated in the families that have been impacted by black male incarceration.",

Failure doesn't bother us that much. All we ever wanted in life was to find stasis. Just a nice, calm, balanced existence. And we were able to eke that out for quite a long time. We were well enough to be left alone and leave everyone else alone. But the last few years, we've seen it right in front of everyone's faces. They fucked with everything. And they're doing it on purpose, and they're doing it out loud. And it fucked with our stasis. And now we have no choice but to come out and get shitty about it. That's the answer. And before you add me, you can shove your red team, blue team nonsense right up your ass. Look, none of that matters. They don't care about you. Everything they tell you is a lie. Every promise they give you is empty. My entire life they've been running on these vapid, empty promises. You know, free college, student debt relief, universal healthcare, codifying reverse Wade. Look, they don't actually wanna do any of these things. You know why? Because if they get it done, they can't run on it anymore. That's a fucking lie, and we're sick of it. They fucked with our money. They pretend like money is real. It's not. It's not based on Anything, it's fucking fake. And we all know that. The whole game is a fucking weirdo game of monopoly that they do just to keep us surfs. And we were actually well enough just to ignore all that as long as we had stasis. But now they've made it impossible to just survive comfortably on a reasonable amount of effort. We're not here for that. So that's why we're pissed. And for those of y'all confused, you know, asking, what is this movement? What. What are your plans? You know, words like movement and plans and all that stuff, it's not really our thing. Look, the plan is to be actively disruptive. To be such a goddamn inconvenience to everybody that's inconveniencing us. They could. We can find something close to the status quo, but I think that ship is sailed. We are ready to watch it all fall apart and build something better from the fucking ashes. I know it sounds scary. We're all gonna have to give up a lot of shit that we like, but we just don't have access to that shit anymore anyway. So let's fucking party."

I don't know what you thought it was, but it was started for that reason and that reason alone. I just woke up to a bunch of really strange, very bizarre direct messages and comments on my videos. Um, and then. So I just wanna make it really clear that I am not in support of the elite. I don't support Donald Trump, I don't support Joe Biden, I don't support politicians, I don't support millionaires. They're the problem. They're the enemy. And these hashtags read Dawn and just say no. And I guess maybe, like, Gen X vibe are MAGA, and they're using the hashtags to represent something they're doing, which that's do whatever you want. I believe in freedom and free speech and. And following your dreams. But I can tell you right now what you're not gonna do. Send me messages, trying to bully me into being part of Donald Trump's gang. I'm not MAGA. I don't support that. The Gen X follow train is people from our generation getting together, following each other, so that we all get enough supporters, followers, views, likes that we can all make money, too, and we can use our voices to be heard. And if you have hashtags that have secret meanings about operations you're doing on behalf Of Donald Trump, that's fine. But when we find out that you're using us and recruiting a secretly, we're gonna reject it. If we don't believe in it, every politician, celebrity, and millionaire CEO is part of the problem. I don't follow the man. I stick it to the man. Sorry. Good luck, though.",

If you don't know what a Zorro spider is, they're basically a species of orb weaving spiders, which is a group known for creating highly symmetrical circular webs. Cute. Also saying that your host spiders can build unique webs that could be more than 6 feet long and appear golden when they reflect sunlight. Okay, just to make this a little bit better for you, whenever the eggs hatch in spring, the baby spiders create parachute like webs that enable them to fly up to 100 miles away from where they were born. Doro spiders are actually supposed to be in Asia, but they were recently found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Then by the way, experts are believing that these invasive individuals were accidentally brought to the US inside a shipping container. So as of right now, these spiders have been spotted in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. And they've also been spotted in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

While you're at it, don't forget to go block his brother, Logan Paul. One more. Who's it gonna be? Drum roll. Jared Leto. Let's go block him. Just like the rest of my list, in my other videos, there is gonna be one who is not subject to this. Today's celebrity who is gonna be granted Amnesty from our list is going to be Mr. Mark Wahlberg. Do not block Mark Wahlberg. He is a genuinely good person. Um, and he is spared.

Because there are actually individuals out there announcing to the entire world how delicate they truly are and have a definite lack of internal fortitude and do not even have the strength to deal with the opinions of others that they disagree with.

The predominant question in the Manhattan Huyshmani trial of former President Donald Trump is not one of guilt, but something far more basic. Is the District Attorney Alvin Braggs case a joke? Is it a prank? Is it a farce? On Thursday, the edges became clear. It's all of the above, but it's also an abominable abuse of our justice system and a wretched assault on the rule of law. As John has been. Charlie. And it just goes on and finishes. Although it's a long story. That's, uh, brutal about this case. This case is highly unconstitutional. It's presided over by a very conflicted judge. Conflicted like I've never seen before. He refuses to take himself off the case, and it should be a miss trial.

    "voice_to_text": "In 2018, Donald Trump traveled to the village of Mount Pleasant in Racine, Wisconsin, where he used a literal golden shovel to break ground on what he said would be the eighth wonder of the world. The project Trump was touting was a deal with the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn. Foxconn promised they would build a massive LCD screen manufacturing plant, investing $10 billion of their own money to do so and creating what they and Trump touted would be 13,000 jobs. In exchange, the state government of Wisconsin was prepared to give Fox Con $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives, which, if paid out, would have been the largest tax incentive given to a foreign company in US history. With the promise of that many jobs, the local government of Mount Pleasant practically destroyed itself trying to make this plant a reality. To make the plant possible, Mount Pleasant has ended up borrowing money to buy up land. Mount Pleasant is on track to spend close to $900 million in land acquisition and infrastructure. That's 38 times our annual budget. To clear room for the giant factory. The local government spent so much money buying up that land that the town itself had its credit rating downgraded. 100 homes and farms were bulldozed to make room for this plant. This is Prairie View Drive, and this road here used to lead into an entire neighborhood of houses. The Foxconn's building, they've been cleared out. Those residents are now asking, was it worth it? Kim Mahoney is One of them, she built her custom home in this subdivision with a dozen neighbors. The whole process has been somewhat of a nightmare. Now Mahones is the last house standing. Her neighbors took offers from the village government to move out and raise their homes. She says she received a low ball appraisal, so she stood her ground. I think this whole project was a scam. There's a real fear that we have been taken for a ride. Our only hope is that they build something. Unfortunately, the residents of Wisconsin were taken for a ride. Foxcon did build a small factory in racing, but it only employs about 1,000 people. The massive 20 million foot factory with 13,000 jobs never materialized. But today, six years after getting sold a Bill of goods by Donald Trump and his Golden Shovel Racing, Wisconsin got a new deal. Foxcon turned out to be just that, a con. Today, President Biden was in Racine to announce a 3.3 billion dollar investment by Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence data center in Racine. Project is expected to create more than 2,000 union construction jobs and another 2,000 permanent data center jobs. Jobs for which Microsoft is partnering with local technical colleges to train the local workforce. And this new data center will be built on the same land that locals cleared for Donald Trump's Foxcon plant. President Biden is quite literally fixing Donald Trump's broken promises. The question now is, will voters notice?"

And people are spending more on food and groceries than they have at any time, really, in the past 30 years. I mean, that's a real day to day pain that people. No, no, it, it, it really is and it's real. But the fact is that if you take a look at what the people have, they have the money to spend. It angers them and angers me that you have to spend more. For example, the whole idea of this notion that Senator Casey talk about shrinkflation. You. I think you know, it's on your phone. Same price for a smaller bottle of. Yeah. For example, stickers bar, they did a thing and it's like 20% less for the same price. That's corporate greed. That's corporate greed and we've got to deal with it. And that's what I'm more working on.",

She's currently being cross examined by Donald Trump's lawyers, and I got to tell you, it's getting a little contentious in there. But Stormy Daniels is holding her own. She's using humor and just her street smarts, and it's playing pretty well. She said to them, you're just trying to trick me into saying something that's not true. Yes, she's holding her own, and the lawyers are trying to discredit her. But here's the important factor. Whether they discredit her or not, the fact remains the crime is this. He paid her to keep her mouth shut. He identified that as a legal fee. That is fraud. And there in lies the problem for Donald Trump and his legal team. Donald Trump wants to try to prove that it never had an affair with Stormy Daniels. Well, the fact is he did, and the evidence is there. But that's not even the basis of the crime. He should be looking at the crime and trying to prove that he didn't commit fraud. It's gonna be hard, cause he did commit fucking fraud. I'm loving this. The cross examination is going to be entertaining when we hear all the facts and information about it. But remember that the prosecution team has a chance for redirect after the cross examination. They'll be wrapping some shit up, and Stormy Daniels will have done her job. Putting Donald Trump in his place. And all the while embarrassing that motherfucker all day long. Again. I love this."

Um, and Coulter told me flat out to my face that she couldn't vote for me, quote, because you're an Indian. Even though she agrees with me. The most other candidates, I disagree with her, but respect that she had the guts to speak her mind. Republican presidential candidates are completely lights on. No one's home.

He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order.

And I'm excited to give back to low inflation, low unemployment. Wait, wait, senator, yes or no? Yes or no. Will you accept the election results of 2024, no matter who wins? That is my statement. But. But is just yes or no. Will you accept the election results of 2024? I, I look forward to President Trump being the 47th president. If. Kristen, you can ask him multiple times, senator, just a yes or no answer. So the American people. The American people will make the decision. But I don't hear you committing for President Trump. That's a clear. I don't hear you committing the election. Will you commit to accepting the election? So many. This is why so many Americas believe that NBC is an extension of the Democrat Party. At the end of the day, I said what I said. I know that the American people, their voices will be heard, and I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It's that simple. But, senators, you know, the hallmark of our democracy is that both candidates agree to a peaceful Transfer of power. So I'm asking you, as a potential VP nominee, will you accept to commit to the election results in this election cycle, no matter who wins? Just simply yes or no? I expect. I expect President Trump to win the next election. I'm not gonna ask you answer your hypothetical question when, in fact. Yeah. Tim Scott was asked six times if he would accept the election results in 2024, and every single time, he danced around it. Would not give a straight answer. The obvious answer to the question is yes. Yes, of course we will accept the election results. Joe Biden would say yes. Every major Democrat would say yes. Except the MAGA Republicans want to continue their attacks on our democracy and say, well, you know what? We'll have to see. So they can plunge us into more chaos. Republicans like Donald Trump and Tim Scott, who's auditioning to be Donald Trump's vice president, are already laying the foundation to challenge the results in 2024. They answered this question in the same way in 2016, in 2020, and now in 2024. It is so abundantly clear that these MAGA Republicans don't care about our democracy. They never have, they never will. We must keep them out of office.",

    "voice_to_text": "Saying for a while now that your priority is to ensure a transparent election. And I see that the RNC and the Trump campaign filing a lawsuit in a battleground state to stop counting ballots past Election Day. What are you doing with regard to suing Nevada right now? Yeah, well, that's exactly right. You cannot have ballots counted, Maria, after elections are over. And. And right now, that is one of the many lawsuits we have out across this country to ensure that just that happens, that we have a free, fair, and transparent election. So in Nevada, as you pointed out, we are saying we want, on Election Day, that to be the last day that mail and balance can be counted. And we've been very successful in a lot of lawsuits. A couple weeks ago, we won a big lawsuit in the state of Pennsylvania. They wanted to take off dates from mail in ballots. Of course, the Democrats, in an effort to make it easier to cheat. We push back on that. We want, and that said, president for the entire country. So.",

That's a clear. I don't hear you committing the election. Here's the joke. Will you commit to accepting the election result? So many. This is why so many Americans believe that NBC is an extension of the Democrat Party. At the end of the day, I said what I said. I know that the American people, their voices will be heard, and I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It's that simple. But, senators, you know the hallmark of our democracy is that both candidates agree to a peaceful transfer of power. So I'm asking you, as a potential VP nominee, will you accept to commit to the election results in this election cycle, no matter who wins? Just simply yes or No, I expect. I expect President Trump to win the next election. I'm not gonna ask you answer your hypothetical question when, in fact, I believe the American people are speaking today on the results of the election. In the continue.

The most legislative, successful president in my lifetime. And, you know, I don't have to go through the list of bipartisan infrastructure law, the PACT act, the chip sacks, all that inflation. 15 million jobs looking. It's all good.

But I want to say once again how grateful I am, and it just shows You. That one person can be so influential and so positive in our lives. And again, thank you so much. And Peter Baker, I loved your book. Yes. Wow. Thank you for being here. What did you ask? What did you talk about with the president? Well, first of all, I only expected to be there for, like, five minutes. He showed us all his photographs, and, you know, it was really amazing to me, cause, you know, I was. I was invited to the Carter White House, and I came, and then I came to the Obama White House, but I never was invited into the Oval Office. And it was a large gathering, so this one was really extra special. All right, so, yes, I'm. We have Star Wars to sir. Well, you know, I called him Mr. President. He said, you can call me Joe.

The unipartey is make Ukraine great again. The unipartey is all about funding every single foreign war. They think this is the business model that needs to be done. There you go. Why is she doing with this, you ask? She hates Mike Johnson, quite obviously. And the Democrats have said when Marjorine calls for the motion to vacate, that's what this is all about. As if this weekend Congress, as if the hundred 18th Congress hasn't been a complete show, Marjorie is gonna call for the motion to vacate and make it privileged next week. She said people need to think about it over the weekend, what they're going to do. She said before upcoming elections, the Republican voters need to see whether these Republicans will side with Hakeem Jeffries at the Yuna party or with her. Because Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats have said if she tries to oust Johnson, they will try to table the motion to save him. I think the American people need to see a recorded vote of do they. Does Congress. Does the members of Congress support the unipartee? Is this what they support? I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may. And so next week, I am gonna be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again, having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative. I think that'll play well. I'm excited about it.",

    "voice_to_text": "My generation has never lived in a world without mass shootings or a world that's not getting hotter and hotter by the second. This is not the reality we chose for ourselves or the future that we want for the next generation. But the truth is, we're the ones who have to deal with a broken system we didn't create. We're. Our reproductive freedoms are under attack, and we struggle. We struggle and we struggle to afford housing, healthcare and Equality, education. And if we're gonna stand a chance at solving these issues, and we've got to remove the Republicans. Republicans, Republicans who are standing in the way and replace them with Democrats who will fight. Fight for our future. So this summer, we're not taking no for an answer. We're going on a tour. Going on a tour across the country, stopping in Republican health districts to flip them blue. Flipping these seats blue is key to fixing our future, and yours, too. Simply put, Republicans don't care. Don't care about our voices or our lives. And as we speak, they're coming for each and every one of our freedoms and blocking. Blocking all progress. But when we win, we can finally turn ideas into action and movements into policy. But it won't be easy. Won't be easy. It's gonna take every single one of us, no matter your generation. Yes, that includes you. You, you, you! That includes you. So please visit tour to save democracy.com to learn How you can get involved and help us build a movement.",

The Clothes Dryers Reliability Act. And maybe my favourite, the Liberty in Laundry Act. Liberty in laundry act. So while I appreciate the gentlemen from Wisconsins very passionate defensive liberty, I'm not so sure the American people had that in mind.

Um, also, uh, uh, these same red states are forcing women to carry eptopic pregnancies, uh, you know, once. It's gonna unalive them if they care in the term. Yeah. Uh, the law in those red states says Uh, tough shit. You're gonna carry it anyway, regardless of the consequences. Yeah, we did that. That blood is on our hands, MAGA.

We're doing that just to own the lives. Pretty sick bunch of people, ain't we? Maybe we should start caring about things that matter, MAGA. Maybe we should educate ourselves.

Weeks before she was sworn in, Boebert was in direct communication with senior White House officials planning to decertify President Biden\u2019s victory. And one of the first votes Boebert cast in Congress was to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election. We can't allow Republicans to hold the majority next January 6th, and we can't let Boebert stay in power. But we can end both of those threats when we flip this seat and flip the House. Our campaign is outraising AND outpolling Boebert already. Donate now at ike.run to give Boebert the boot and flip this seat in November! #Ike4CO #IkeforCongress #IkeMcCorkle #CO4 #HelpIkeFight #ILikeIke #BootBoebert #LaurenBoebert #Boebert",

    "voice_to_text": "you know that video of Kamala going around with Drew Barrymore where she's like you know we need you to be the country's mamala yeah yeah okay so the thing that's driving me crazy and then I can't stop thinking about is the fact that like now a lot of people are like talking about it but this is the thing when Drew Barrymore first started that show I immediately got the ick from the way she interviewed her guest cause have you seen it I haven't okay because the what she does is she builds the premise of her entire show as if it's a revolutionary act to interview people like barefoot and like with her legs crossed because she's basically unmasking from like you know office culture you know and thinking that that's like some new crazy vulnerable thing but the thing that gives me the ick about it is that it's so performative and it like drives me crazy because like I really liked you Barrymore but when I first saw that show come out I I I remember being immediately put off you know because I'm very sensitive to like body language and it's such a perfect example to me about how we are so easily duped by the difference between performative niceness and like the actual integration of being kind do you know what I mean that's what we get fooled by politicians all the time because we'd rather see them do these things like oh look at their displays of niceness you know their tones and all their promises instead of like when it comes down to action the reason like I get like so heat up about this is because she proved me absolutely right I thought I was going crazy when it came down to the strikes you know what happened during the strikes okay so whenever there's like all these trucks going on like writers blah blah blah I'm like I'm a member of unions you know above anyone else Drew Barrymore should have known better she basically like stabbed everyone in the back you know what I mean and she continued on with her show and did not stand in solidarity with like the fellow like artists that like worked for her you know and that's crazy because number one she drew Barrymore she's like an actor she should have known better you know what I mean but number two the entire premise of her show the entire point of her show is that but we're having these conversations and we're listening in a different way like we're having real conversations and so I'm gonna get real and so to literally be that performative about it you know what I mean to put on that display and then to go on like when the time came and it mattered with action to sell out your own people and step over the picket line and like that is that is so low key crazy like that's actually wild because that's when it matters you know what I mean like that's the actual integration of like your knowledge of intersectionality and like nuance and everything and that is what happens that's why we get duped by politicians all the time like that that's that is like so crazy to me you know and I remember thinking that I was this is why I'm so hesitant and like very like wary of people that are so performative about like being you know announcing the essence of who they are because here's the thing like if you really are the essence of something you don't have to go around like announcing it all the time kind of like how really powerful leaders don't have to yell they can just whisper because everyone knows they're powerful you don't have to go around being like oh I'm so vulnerable I'm so you know I'm so sensitive and I listen to people because the minute I see people do that it reminds me of church people that's the problem with religion you know what I mean like I don't need to know I don't need to tone police you like I'd rather just care about your actions you know what I mean I'm not going around getting offended by like your tone and it's also really crazy too because if you really think about it it's so emotionally manipulative because like you cannot demand emotional vulnerability from somebody do you understand what I'm saying like just because you're crossing your legs and just because you have a really sweet tone of your voice and everything that doesn't mean that like you're not also be some people are not ready for that you know like emotional vulnerability is not something that you can demand of somebody it's something you kind of have to earn there has to be like you know a transaction there right and so it is energetically and physically very akin to like asking these the manipulative and like emotionally leading questions almost trying to get somebody to have a breakdown like back in the days when they would interview Britney Spears and she would be asked questions like but aren't you really sad like you know what I mean it's the same thing body language wise we just haven't gotten to that point in like you know society yet to where you can see even on like some of the interviews she does people are uncomfortable because that is not everybody's like comfort level and like the quickest way to shut somebody down is to keep pushing and keep pushing especially if they're already climbing up you know what I mean and that level of unawareness on top of like these actions it's just it it it just follows my mind there's and you know what she said do you know what she said literally when people ask her why are you literally going against what seems like what your entire show is about your entire image and like not like going on with the show she's and I'm paraphrasing but she said something to the effect of either the world or like the country at this moment she was like because you know the world needs our show right now it it's needed like the grandiosity of that do you know what I mean like that's so dangerous and that and I call it every time usually the people that are that performative about like being like look at how I am look at how kind and vulnerable I am those are the ones that do those exact same kind of crazy things or when it comes down to like what really matters they like they don't stand behind what they stand for you know does that make sense to you it's like the grandiosity to literally be like our show is needed like that's that's why people do crazy things like we were just watching game of Thrones Khaleesi when you all of a sudden think that like you have like some higher mission and like oh it's different when I screw people over you know like like to think that uh it just and then to watch the amount of people all like on her show like in the audience just ooh and awe and fall for this performance like oh she's being so vulnerable and she's no actually she's invading like personal body space you know and if she really like understood the finesse of real journalism and like what it takes to be emotionally like aware and like then she wouldn't do that I don't know I'm just it just it's and my mom probably be one of these people not these members if she if she was still alive she probably be one of these people I'm not saying it's a bad thing like but it is crazy to me and it's not even about the Kamala thing and also like what did you think what did you think that Niffy was gonna do like",

Okay, so let's say customer service, for example. There was a whole thing about customer service in Atlanta. Keith Lee went viral over it. Because black people have terrible customer service skills, it ruins it for the next black person. So if a white person has an experience with a black girl named Tiana, and Tiana has an attitude, oh, you want a drink? I already gave you a drink. And just giving all this to this white customer, and then she goes to another establishment with a very formal.

We're not gonna allow that in this day and age. Thursday, the General Assembly passed a Bill banning marriage between lineal descendants of a grandparent. Currently, the law only outlaws marriage between just the children of a grandparent. The Bill passed unanimously in the Senate and drew support from most Republicans in the house, but not all of them. There's an additional risk, but it's not as significant some might otherwise be LED to believe.

So they, they lowered everything to 30% so that people of colour and black people can pass, uh, in schools and universities. So when they did that, they said, now South Africa is a democracy. It's a diversity. Now white people are equal to black people. By changing and lowering the passing Mark to 30%. 30%, my friend. That's why there are thousands, tens of thousands of black people in South Africa with master degrees, uh, universities, colleges. If you want a doctor, if you want an engineer, a black engineer, uh, go to South Africa. They. They are tens of thousands. And South Africa is also the highest unemployment rate in the world. Keep that in mind. And it's all due to the fact that they lowered the passing Mark to 30%.",

    "voice_to_text": "There are certain books that I've just had to say, hey, um, I don't know if this is a bad book, but I don't have time to read it, and so you're not going to read it either? We'll read it together. I remember recently my wife had a book, and I saw her reading it on the couch, and it was about pedo baptism. And I said, no, we're not doing that yet. We will become Pedo Baptist when I'm ready. But my wife's not gonna be a Pedo Baptist for three years before I am, and I don't have time to read it right now. I know the arguments will be great. I will agree and disagree. I'm not sure which arguments are better, but for the the time being, this is what I'm persuaded of, and you're not going to outpace me. And that's not. For the record, that's not lazy. It can be, and you have to be honest with yourself and discerning of your motives, but that's not inherently lazy. This is one of the problems that I remember experiencing early in ministry as a young man with lots of other young men filled with zeal, zeal for doctrine, zeal for theology, is that they would go around, they be reading something, learning something, listening to something, and they would go around the church and they be talking to every household and every individual in the church about this thing that they've been convicted of. For 15 minutes. And they would. They would try to be terrible. And they actually thought this was charitable. They say, well, you know, you don't have to agree with me in my position. I do think it's right. But you don't have to agree with me in the position that I've taken. But you have to have a position. Now, what that's called is tyranny. That's tyranny. Do you know why? You might say, well, they're not dictating the position. This is why it's tyranny, because what you are doing is you're dictating that person's study habits. You're dictating the very hours in their day. I do that with four people. I don't do that with you, and I'm your pastor. It would be tyranny. I do not have that authority. Pastors have a very limited scope of authority. Outline specifically in the scripture. I have four people in my life that I dictate the hours in their day. I dictate what time they go to the bathroom, when we eat, what we eat, what we wear. They are my children. Those are the people that I have almost limitless authority with. As just a rule of thumb, a general principle, if you're trying to understand authority, first start with spheres. There are three primary spheres that are all forms of government. There is civil government, ecclesiastical. That's the state, ecclesiastical government, that's the church. And familial government. And it is a government that's the home, the family, households, In these three spheres, they are not a hierarchy. It is not the state, then the church, then the household. Now they are three spheres that exist autonomously, side by side, and given God's Providence, in certain practical situations. At",

These loans do not accumulate interest and are free from monthly payments. Instead, they repay it when they sell the home or refinance the property. They are giving illegal immigrants 20% of the value of a home so that they can buy one. Illegal immigrants people who came into this country illegally. People that are not supposed to be here. And they are giving it to them instead of Californians. Their solution to the housing problem is to give interest free and payment free loans to illegals. People of California, your government is blatantly telling you to go fuck yourself. They are blatantly saying we do not give a fuck about you because you can't get these. These are just for illegals. Fuck the people who are voting for them. Fuck the people who are actually contributing to the country. Fuck the people who are legally here. No, fuck all you. I'm beginning to think you're better off being an illegal. There's money, cell phones, free housing, and now interest free and payment free loans. And you understand they only pay it if they refinance or sell it. So if an illegal uses this and gets a home, they are Getting 20% off the purchase price of a home in California. So you gotta think on like a 500,000 dollar home. They would be getting 100,000 dollars of the taxpayer money. Of your fucking money. And if they never sell it and never refinance, they never have to pay that back. They are encouraging illegal immigrants to buy the homes you can afford.

    "voice_to_text": "Have you ever heard them say if since we've been sitting here for I don't know how long? Yes, I. I, um. I've been taking a tally. Oh, okay. Can you show us? Can you tell me what the tally is? More than 35 times the Republican witnesses and Republican members of the committee have used the word F. Thank you so much for that. Cause, honestly, if they would continue to say if or hunter and we were playing a drinking game, I would be drunk by now. Cause I promise you, they have not talked about the subject of this, which would be the president. But let me tell you something that was so disturbing as I walked in to this chamber today, as I prepared, I said, what is the crime? Because when you're talking about impeachment, you're talking about high crimes or misdemeanors, and I. I can't seem to find the crime. And honestly, no one has testified of what crime they believe the president of the United States has committed. But when we start talking about things that look like evidence, they wanna act like they blind. They don't know what this is. These are our national secrets. Looks like in the shitter to me. This looks like more evidence of our national secrets, say on a stage at marilago. When we're talking about somebody that's committed high crimes, it's at least indictments. Let's say 32 counts related to unauthorized retention of national security secrets. Seven counts, Related to obstructing the investigation, three false statements, one count of conspiracy to the fraud the United States. Falsifying business records, conspiracy to the fraud the United States. Two counts related to efforts to obstruct the vote certification proceedings, one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights, 23 counts related to forgery or false documents statements, eight counts related to soliciting. And I could go on, because he's got 91 counts pending right now. But I will tell you what the president has been guilty of. He has unfortunately been guilty of loving his child unconditionally. And that is the only evidence that they have brought forward. And honestly, I hope and pray that my parents love me half as much as he loves his child. Until they find some evidence, we need to get back to the people's work, which means keeping this government open so that people don't go hungry in the streets of the United States. And I will yield.",

    "voice_to_text": "Initiate went on for a long time. Can you go back? Back one more. No white could ever rape a slave woman. The regulations of laws to the white race on the subject of sexual intercourse do not and cannot, for obvious reasons, apply to slaves. Their intercourse is promiscuous. We've now justified raping black women because they can't be raped. They. We aren't raping them. They're promiscuous by nature, so we can't do it. Uh, forward one more. The fact that white men could profit from raping their female slaves does not mean that their motive was economic. The rape of slave women by their masters was primarily a weapon of terror that reinforced whites domination over their human property. Rape was an act of physical violence designed to stifle black women's will to resist and to remind them of their surveile status. These become important instruments that you look at. Now, I give you some statistics as it relates to American history. By the mid 1800s, there was over 600,000 mixed race children born. 600,000. How many of you know what, um, miscegenation is? Miscegenation is a illegal marriage between people of different races. Actually was very profound here. That was illegal to marry someone of another race. So when you consider the fact that one of the greatest issues and one of the number one reasons why black men were lynched, beaten, and imprisoned had to do with the fear that they were gonna rape whom white Women. Now, the numbers. I mean, we're talking about pure numbers, numbers alone. It was who being raped, okay? It was. It was black women being raped. But they can be raped. This advance for it before we get into the casual Killing act. The casual killing act was written because of the number of people who were killed by while being corrected. Okay? And if any slave resists master owner, other person by his or her order correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction, it shall not be counted felony, but the master owner and every other person. So giving correction shall be a quit of all punishment accusation for the same as if such accident had never happened. So that means that if you happen to be correcting someone and you beat them to death. You know how hard it is to beat someone to death? I mean, I thought about that. I said it happened so frequently that they created a law so that you wouldn't feel anywhat, no guilt, because you were simply correcting that wasn't your fault. So I went back to looking who was beating folks to death. I wanted to know, and it was white women. White women were beating black children to death. That's who was being beaten to death. But it wasn't her fault. She was just correcting them. You see, what we do is we rob ourselves of our own humanity when we refuse to Look at this stuff. We rob ourselves of our humanity. And that's what people didn't know happen going forward. One more, then you had the mental health folks. This is how we got in. We got in to try to fix it. In the early years of the 19th century, a physician named Samuel A. Cartwright argue that two particular forms of mental illness caused by nerve disorders were prevalent among slaves. One was Draped Mania, which was diagnosable by a single symptom. The uncontrollable urge to escape from slavery. So now what we've done is we've now pathologized your desire to be free. Must be something wrong with them. Keeps keep trying to free themselves. And again, it would be funny if it weren't in journals. You see, all of this is to remove the cognitive dissonance. Now we have. Look at all the people joining in. You got the naish, you got anthropology, you got physicians, all of them saying they deserve it. It's not us. We don't need to adjust anything. And if they just tried harder. How about you people just pull yourselves up from your bootstraps? What's the matter with you? The playing field has been leveled. We're gonna see if, in fact, it's been leveled, or is that conjecture? Move forward. Now, I want you to look at this photo very closely. I want you to see who's in it more important than the man hanging. Because you gotta understand, the lynchings that occurred In America. Happened after slavery, not during. Thousands of lynchings happened after slavery. Because this is a reaction to white fear of what we would do once freed. But we didn't create a vigilante group to take out white people. But they did create a vigilante group to take us out now that we're free. See, that happened after slavery. They were called the what? The KU Klux Klan. They don't wear hoods anymore, they wear suits. But they're alive and well all over the world, even here. So look at who's in a picture. I want you to put. Look at this little girl in particular. You can't see her closely, but she's actually grimacing, like smirking. Now remember, let's go back to the puppy concept here. She would be loathed and torn up probably if this was a puppy. Which means he's less than that. Cause she's not disturbed. This little girl is not. Is not disturbed by this. But she should be, shouldn't she? People always ask me, go, joy. What was impact on white people? There it is right there. Can't feel any empathy for him."
