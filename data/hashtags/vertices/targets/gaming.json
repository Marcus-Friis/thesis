I didn't even have an opportunity to, like, sit with him on my screen and shoot him. I'm like, even if this motherfucker is this good at rust 1 V ones, there's just no way, with the fucking controller that I had in my hands, the way that I had to shoot with my gun and the fucking input delay, that this guy had that level of accuracy. I'm not saying something was up with that whole setup, but I do feel like I got set up in somewhere another. I can't, bro, if you gave fucking scump my fucking controller. I just wanted to see what Ricky setup felt like. Like, what did that controller actually feel like, bro? Because where I was sitting, I would like. I felt like I was in fucking quicksand with this shit.",

    "voice_to_text": "The Call of duty cheat maker forced to pay over $15 million to Activision, has refused to do it and vowed to keep creating exploits for Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. Earlier this week, the California courts ruled in favor of Activision in their lawsuit against engine owning, who sell cheats for games like call of Duty, Counter Strike, and battlefield in order to pay that massive sum to Activision and hand over ownership of their website domain to them. Activision first sued engine owning under DMCA, the American copyright law that Bungie also used in their own Destiny 2 cheating lawsuit recently. You won that one in Activision followed suits, or at least in theory, because engine owning is quite simply refusing to comply. They claiming that the people targeted by the lawsuit are long inactive and have even backed up their domain to try and circumvent the forced hand over to Activision. This might seem like a silly response, but it does put Activision in a biz of a bind. They'd have to spend even more of their money, or really your money that you gave them for a slightly shinier pistol, on further legal battles. Some of those could even be outside the United States, which put their odds at the same place as your odds of getting a refund from them. What do you think engine owning brave gamers for standing up against big evil Activision? Or should they finally put down the cheats and just get good Let us know."

    "voice_to_text": "Hey everyone, I'm Anna and I'm the studio head for valorant and I'm here to chat a bit about player behavior in the game. Player behavior is a complex problem space. Our systems cannot catch everything. They require constant attention and tweaking and improvement. Sometimes it has to be painfully manual or dependent on our players reporting things and on our processes staying well tuned. But at the end of the day, there are still some people in this world who want to take out their insecurity or their bad day or their whatever on some stranger through their computer screen. And that's exactly what we're experiencing and addressing right now. But I also wanna make sure that I say this out loud. We have no room for these types of behaviour in our game or in our community. Valorant is a team game. It's better played as a team. The strats are better, all of it's better. When you tell someone to just mute comms to avoid harassment, you are essentially putting the harassed person in a position to not communicate, to compromise how they wanna play the game to accommodate you. Muting is a tool for people who choose to use it, not something that is there to justify bad behaviours. Competitive games need to have room for banter. We believe this and I do understand the fear. The fear that we will sanitize gaming by over addressing these issues. We have no interest in doing that. We do believe that a person should not be in a position to have to grow a thicker skin or whatever other unhelpful suggestions have been thrown out there just to avoid threats of violence or literal hate speech. There's no room in our community for the most egregious behaviors, and we're not going to compromise on that point. If you need to make truly evil statements under the guise of regular shit talk to enjoy gaming, then please play something else. We won't miss you. Look, I know this message is intense, so let me say this. This is not just about preventing the worst. It's about promoting the best in each of us. It's about ensuring that people can share in the joy of the matches. One and the tough losses. And the amazing feeling of community that gaming can create.",

These are an extreme form of punishment so they will only be applied in the most extreme cases, with clear evidence and manual review, like we do with anticheat 3.

Who cares how many Queef Tilly and polygons my character has if it's some Ubisoft open world design that has me breaking out the nightcap and candle? When Elden Ring first came out, so many people were like dude, this looks like a PS three game. Yeah, Elden ring, the game where no matter where you go or where you look, you're in a living painting. Would seeing every single eyelash on the tarnished face or seeing real time ball sweat dripping off on the back of torn really make the game more fun? Even if it did look like a PS three game? Who gives a shit? Some of the funniest games I've ever played are on the PS two and they look like this. That's because the only thing that matters is gaming gameplay and art direction. Should anyone care about the ray tracing? Or the 30,000 gigacharts per fart if you have to turn them off to run the game? If you have a PC that cost less than $10,000. This is what's leading to the collapse of the triple A games industry. I just become so inflated every single person who's ever touched a video game in their life have to buy this one game for it to make a profit. So then They can't take a single creative risk. Here's why. Everyday you open up Twitter, it's like, oh, every single human that works in the games industry got laid off today. Oh, what else is"

There was no reason to ever do it beyond that. Just going back to world of Warcraft, in the beginning, world of Warcraft was, here's a bunch of skills and a bunch of talents. You can do whatever, like be the character you wanna be. What ended up happening? Someone just told you, this is the best version of that. And then people said, well, if you're not that, I don't want you in my party. I'm trying to get the highest damage possible. So when we start talking about MMORPG games and we discover the meta, the optimal, the efficient thing, is that no longer a choice that you're making because you enjoy the game, and a choice that you have to make because mechanically, you need other people to enjoy the game with you.

There's daughter's prom and riddling the daughter with bullets. And there's no other news towards other than the real Dax dot news. These AI photos. There's nobody from either side of the community. No local news, no community news, nobody sharing this story. This is fake. It's very obviously fake. You click on the con, the account, and all they do is post AI pictures with outlandish rage baiting stories. And I've seen several people, several accounts re share this story. But a simple Google search, there's no court documents, there's no news stories, there's no social media post outside of people reposting this story from the real Dax Dot news. Outrage baiting. And honestly, we have to be very cautious of this in United States. It is a election year. Stuff like this might seem like, oh, just rage baiting, just for engagement, just for revenue. But watch, these stories have more of a political change the closer we get to November. They're meant to do damage to a community. Be wary and please invest in a little bit of media literacy.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the people who defend skill based matchmaking are always saying stuff like, you just wanna win when you play online. All right, bring it. Yes, that is 100% the reason that I play competitive games, because I wanna win. I see it's already been brought in. For those unfamiliar with the term, skill based matchmaking refers, as the name suggests, to matching people up with similar skill levels in video games in particular. And I suspect even those who are not familiar with that specific term immediately recognize how this is an almost universal thing we do in competition. More generally, outside of an occasional exhibition activity. We don't see grandmasters in chess routinely beating up on new chess players or World Cup finalist beating up on elementary school soccer players. And we don't see these things because putting two people who are significantly different in skill level into a competitive activity prevents the person who is of lower skill level from actually learning anything. And it makes the win by the higher skilled player fairly meaningless. The new player not only learns nothing because the game typically is over so quickly there's not a chance to practice and learn, but the skilled player has not really demonstrated any sort of skill. And so for those who are against skill based matchmaking, I have the following question. What is it about winning that's so important that you'd be willing to sacrifice any of the intrigue or interest in the Game in order to avoid the opposite losing where is the enjoyment or even demonstration of skill when, for example, a world champion arm wrestler successfully defeats a toddler? At what point does winning lose all meaning in life? Cause for me, winning a competition that was never a competition at all isn't really a win either.",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, I'm convinced this is satire, but the amount of people that are hyping up Hellblade to and comparing it to like PlayStation exclusives that are actually treating it like it's a slam dunk for Xbox. Brother. What. What are you. What are you huffing right now? Like, I don't know if this is a troll or not, but the seer amount of it. I'm just gonna assume it's true and I'm not gonna be nice about it. So you're. You're comparing Hellblade to all? I'm just gonna say right now, graphically, it is one of the most impressive games I've seen ever. That's about it. It is a five hour game. Imagine being Xbox right now. You have already lost the console war. Okay? The console war has now become cringe because it's not competitive. They were outsold 5 to 1. When people ask the question why aren't there more exclusives being made, Xbox has paid a couple billion for Bethesda, a couple billion for call of duty. Why aren't there any more exclusives? Because literally every company that they bought has done everything in their power to have their games released on all platforms. Because according to them, it doesn't matter how good their game is. If only Xbox was able to buy them, they would fail. In other words, Xbox did so bad this generation that it doesn't even matter how good the game is, it'll still fail. So Xbox finally gets an exclusive. Hell, blade 2 Hell, Blade 1 was pretty good, so they make another one. Absolutely zero promotion for this game. You got to the point that people were actively feeling bad for Hellblade to saying oh, Xbox just want wants a reason to get rid of the studio to save some money. And that's what I think part of it was. Only for this game to come out. Graphically looks amazing. Let me preface that again that they won't stop glazing that. Other than that dog shit. If you like the game, you like the game. But guess what? Ain't nobody paying $70 for five hours of gameplay. But wait, it's actually eight. You paid $70 for eight hours of gameplay? Mother, you are either rich or in denial. Like the Copium is so strong around this game that to defend it, they're actually saying well I would rather play my eight hours of masterpiece then my 60 hours of over bloated content. Really? Okay, okay, come over, come over. Elden Ring is 60 hours. You think that's over bloated? I like. I'm with you. There is over bloated games. For example, Ubisoft Assassin's Creed Odyssey took 300 hours to complete. Severely over bloated. But to say the optimal masterpiece length of a game is less than 10 hours? Brother, I would hate for that to be the norm. Like I'm sorry, under no circumstances so the game under 10 hours be sold at full price. I don't care how graphically amazing that Game is. Oh yeah. Comparing it to Horizon Forbidden West is stupid. You can play this game on a PS four and was at the start of the console generation. And yeah, you would get more hours of enjoyment out of this game. Blow in all compared to this. But there you go. That's my thoughts."

Worst part is, it won't even take the whole team 2. These two motherfuckers will be chilling. These two motherfuckers handle everybody going on. That team is capable of taking on Bucky in a 1 v 1, and Ali is nowhere near as accurate as dead shot is with anything in his hand. And that's not even including the fact that bullets travel faster than arrows. This point is either dead shot is mowing the whole squad down his bullets. A Bucky does the same thing with his own gun, except as explosive to the mix. And that's if he's not getting jumped by everyone else and probably still winning. I will say though, a fight between Asian 47 and John Wick is definitely something I'd like to see, cause in my opinion these two are actually a good match for each other. As capable as John Wick is, I'd still give it to Asian 47. Cause that motherfucker was biologically engineered from birth to be a hitman. Trained to kill you in almost every way under the sun and moon since birth, and has easily came out on top against other motherfuckers like himself. On the question of who win in a fight between these two if they fought, i'mma go with the guy that was made to be The best",

Space marines are genetically modified and they got these big ass suits of armor. This game has a whole story campaign. You can play solo or co op with friends. Gameplay is straight up ridiculous. Brothers. Big ass swords with finisher execution moves on the what really has me hyped though. They just announced multiplayer and Pvp mode. But not even only that bro. The weapons and armor are all fully customizable. You can change the color, the helmet, the melee weapon, the ornament. Look at this shit bro. I need that and I desire that. Different melee weapons, like gauntlets. You could put booster jets on your armor to lunge at people. Dog, I need this shit. Indubitably held. Iris, you got till September to get your affairs in order. Dog, y'all gotta rework that armor system soon, cause this shit ain't it. Let me know what y'all think, but damn I'm hyped For this game",

Guys, so I just got killed in three seconds by a vehicle, by a turret, by some guy just literally seat swapping. And I didn't have a car to run away. And I didn't have a car to run away. Haha it's mostly cause people are not actually able to probably combat against the vehicles, which is understandable. The gauntlets are just overpowered. They're so annoying. But holy crap is the quote unquote pro scene just crying over everything. But I find the season so goddamn fun just cause of how chaotic it is. It is insanity and also very frustrating at times. But while personally say is stop crying about a game, just fucking enjoy it. Stop being a little baby about it."

    "voice_to_text": "The images coming out of Rafa right now are so genuinely horrific that I cannot even begin to understand truly how we will ever get the forgiveness of Palestinians. And people say this time and time again that these are the worst images I've seen. These are the worst images I've seen. But for my understanding of the situation currently, this bombing, this latest bombing took place in the Rafa crossing, located in an unretent where thousands, hundreds of thousands, of my understanding of people were sent there, were displaced to this tent. Again, this is UNRA. This is the UN. These are displacement tents that the UN put in place to keep people safe. Right. And those are the areas in which Israel just targeted. Remember all the claims about the babies that the White House has continued to make, even though not the White House necessarily, actually, Joe Biden himself has continued to make, even though now those articles have been disproved, and the White House itself has had to come forward and say that this is not true. I just saw a man carrying a baby, fully baby, and. And that is a image I will never get out of my head. The absolute sanction violence by the United States that we have been seeing take place in Palestine for the last eight months is due to the fact that lies were made about children who were, as well as great victims. These stories have now been debunked, but when you put information like This out into the world, it is very difficult to take it back. And so now we are seeing the ramifications of that. I'm going to strongly, strongly, strongly encourage you to interact with the videos and the images that we are seeing coming out of Rafa right now across all social medias. We have to make these stories, these situations, these horrors so undeniable that everywhere you look, someone is going to see this. Because there are still people today who have no idea what is happening around the world, not only in Rafa, but in the DRC, in Sudan. These are the atrocities that we are forcing upon people. Us in the west, we are forcing this upon people because we continue to put these violent, evil maniacs into office, and then they go and commit these atrocities. We have got to stop this, and we cannot stop fighting for the rights of people all over the world.",

Here's everything you need to know this CAR 98 is identical the one that we use back in Modern Warfare 2019, and is still in the marksman rifle category. But there's a few differences with this brand new CAR 98 in Modern Warfare 3. The reload is a lot faster than the original CAR because it reloads every bullet as a group at the same time instead of individually loading each bullet one by one, which is much slower. you could add new attachments on the CAR that make it much faster, such as changing the sling and even removing the stock, which was not possible before. And overall, this new CAR 98 handled very fast and clean. I had great movement damage and aimed outside speeds, but there was a huge difference in the hip fire. I was hitting over 90% of my hip fires even from a distance with pure accuracy. Which also makes this CAR 98 super good in close range. And it was able to one step on multiplayer consistently at most ranges from the chest up. Here's the CAR 90, a build that I was using in this gameplay.

You are below at your core excuse for a human being. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? Look at you! You're the one who put hands on women. Disgusting! You don't know. You don't know what happened. I'm fully trained as an MMA fighter. You don't wanna touch me. I'm a IDF. You don't wanna touch me. I'm a IDF soldier. I don't give two flying fucks. Don't touch me! I've been getting away. This is exactly the type of people Palestinians in Gaza have to deal with, and far, way worse than that. Imagine the victimhood complex they have. Actually cursing all the Muslims and then saying that they are being antisemitic. How many videos we have seen so far for IDF soldiers coming back to Europe or the United States and started doing exactly this? And this is what happened to people when they have the authority to do whatever the hell they want and they think that they are still in Gaza. I want you to look at this photo that was published by this soldier on his social media, holding a picture of a young girl from Gaza. And he actually captioned the video by saying, this naughty Fatima sent me a letter to the warfront. My loved one, I miss you. And I think about You everyday love Fatim. I'm not gonna comment much on it. I want you to tell me what do you think of this in the comments. And don't be very upset. Try to find words that you know can keep the video on the for you page because my previous one was taken down. But I want you to see the picture that he's holding. This is actually a disabled lady that you can see that she lost one of her leg and she actually lost one of her arms. And most probably he stole this photo from her house. And you know what I think they are being encouraged by their communities on social media. Like if they post more they are more considered to be like heroes and doing more thing. Cause for sure if your community is not encouraging such a, you wouldn't be doing it. Let me know what you think of this in the comments. Don't forget to share this video. Put it in your stories and do it. Please check the link in my bio. This is very important. And see you next video.",

And earlier this year we even got a much higher quality version of it without all the text and everything. This is actually one of the later iterations of the logo though, as there's an earlier one in existence which is a bit more elaborate. Though it seems back when they were using this one, the intent was to only use the logo for the box art. Now, one of my personal favorite details about the box art is if you zoom in on the star man, there's Ness reflected in his visor. What's your favorite video game box art?"

And I asked this question because I'm very against prison labor in all forms, but especially forced prison labor. And a lot of the time the response I get to that is people saying, okay, if you don't wanna do force prison labor or whatever, don't commit a crime. And like, having to completely disregard the fact that, you know, black people and people of color are wrongly convicted more often or often given harsher sentences and all of that kind of stuff. Ignoring all that, I still believe that people that have been convicted of crimes deserve rights. I feel like it gets complicated the more that people try to, like, segment what kind of crime someone has done or something. But I do think people deserve to be able to vote. I think people deserve, you know, safety precautions in their workplace, wherever that may be, whatever the conditions might be. I believe that they should be able to sue if they have gotten injured on the job. I don't know. I believe people should be able to say, hey, no, I don't wanna work. Maybe I wanna get my master's degree, or maybe I wanna do, like, religious studies, stuff like that. Do other things in jail. And other people don't think that way. I do genuinely believe a lot of people see people convicted Of crimes as slaves, which I think is problematic. we should all be alarmed that this is, like, the system we operate in. I think it's very scary and very weird, that's all.",

After last season I didn't think this could get any worse, but once again epic has outdone themselves and gave us a real stink the both. The cars have made them way too OP. Not only did they increase their HP by a lot, they know how mods so kids that grenade launchers and miniguns on top of them. And at first this sounds really fun and exciting, but once you play a couple of games you realize this season is really not enjoyable. And that is because every game is gonna be based around cars, build fights, and hell even gunfights are basically non existent unless you're fighting all spawn now. I won't have a problem with any of this rental separate from pubs because A. I'm sure there's people out there that love this season and think that the chaos is fun, but that isn't me. Personally, I like to play Fortnite. I like having normal fights where I get eliminated because I got played and not because they're using some item that requires zero skill at all. I'm sure they'll lift the cars, but since the season based around them I thought it's gonna be a crazy change. So it looks like I'll be spending most of this season in creative. But let me know your thoughts in the comments cause most of the community is not A fan"

And I know I'm not the only person who complain about this. I'm pretty sure there's plenty of Youtubers and tiktokers who complain about it. But my guy, we're paying 40 bucks for Black Ops, a game they came out in 2010. That's ridiculous. Why are you charging 60 bucks for Black Ops 2? It's an old game, ain't nobody playing it. I just wanna play it for myself to revisit the old call of duty campaigns and I might even wanna do an analysis. But I cannot in no way, shape or form justify paying in that much money just to relive a note experience. Well Josh, if you so worried about it, why not play the Xbox 3 60 things? But here's the thing. I can no way, shape or form justify reliving those games in the 7:00 20 p resolution in a 1080 p in the 4K display. It just ain't. It just ain't working for me bro. That shit is like Vaseline all over my screen and I can't get jiggy with that. So I hope with the Microsoft and the call of Duty Direct, if when they put these games on Game Pass or whatever, I hope they put these old games on the PC Game Pass as well so I can find a better alternative than paying Those, you know. Then paying all that almost fucked up my take. But you have a good day."

And when I got around the plane and I was like, nah, it's alright, it's alright. Like the game is. It's okay, the story is great, the game itself is okay. It's just. Whatever. I've said it before and I will keep having this discussion. Silent Hill 2 as a game is really not that good. It's a sloppy mess. The character himself is unlikele, but I understand why. And the gameplay loop that's in it is really not that good either. What stands out with Silent Hill 2 is the story. The story is really good, and the ending made me cry. I will always give that to them, that the story is really good, but the game itself just. It's not it. There's a lot other games that are much better. Silent Hill 1 and 3 are better games. In Silent Hill 2 as a game, though, the sloppiness in combat can be felt within all of those games. What? I recommend somebody to play Silent Hill 2 well, just for them to see for themselves whether or not they like the game and if they can Get past the sloppiness that is that game. And before you get all twisted saying that I'm calling it a bad game, not saying it's a bad game. I'm saying I don't think it's as good as everybody else thinks. Stitch, comment, all that fun stuff.

But because this game is one big General Mills marketing tool, when you go to the store, the brands you could choose from are their brands. This is the Fruit Roll UPS parlour, and at the arcade are tricks and Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Games like the Reese's Puffs, Snowboard Sloan. But you had your own house, you can decorate your bedroom, like, go to the store and pick out your furniture. They had a pet store, get new clothes. Then there was the famous Millsbury Gazette that would let you know what's happening in the town. And on November 21st, 2,010, it was announced that players would be graduating from Millsbury, which was a nice way of saying that Millsbury would be no longer. And everyone got a yearbook with a picture of their buddy and their house and their 15 favorite items. And that was it.",

Pirates, we got Black Caesar, who escaped his slave ship by stealing a rowboat, raided other ships to say, afloat in a mass. Such a large fortune and reputation across the ocean blue that the real life Blackbeard said, hey, you wanna join my crew? Cowboys, we got Bill Pickett, who literally invented an event that still hosted at rodeos across the nation. Knights, the Roman army had a black soldier who LED his own legion and was declared a patron site. And that's before we mention an entire continent's worth of warriors, legacies and inventions. All the people upset that Yasuke has appeared need to accept that we've always been here. Don't fight with history. Get some therapy.",

Reduce healing per second from 100 to 50. It will now be much harder to stay alive in your well, but you will get radiant for 8 seconds when a player exits your, uh. Well of radiance. Bubble is getting a buff as far as defensive capabilities go. You don't even have to be inside the bubble anymore, you just gotta be near it to get a void overshield. Allies near the ward of Dawn Dome now have a void overshield tickled trickled trickled on overtime, similar to the volume behind a bastion barricade. Weapons of light is getting removed by default, and you will only have weapons of light if you are using helm of Saint 14 inside the bubble. You will now have 60% um. Damage resistance.

    "voice_to_text": "This guy is not a gamer. That's what this guy said to me in a video talking about various different popular video games that I don't like for various different reasons. I'm just interested what makes someone a gamer, and what is the measurable disqualification of said gamer status? I streamed the Xbox 3 60 Classic from Raven Software Singularity last night for about four hours. Does that make me a gamer? I have a gamer score of hundred 55,073 points on my Xbox profile. Does that make me a gamer? My most recently played game is an indie title called indica, a game I'd be willing to bet that you've never heard of. Does that make me a gamer? So far this year I've completed Banishers, Ghost of New Eden, Suicide Squad, kill the Justice League, alone in the Dark, Dragons Dogma 2, Pacific Drive, Ultros, rise of the Ronin, Stellar Blade, I played through Borderlands 3 again, and I've put a good amount of time into Powerworld, Hell, Divers 2, hawked, and Fallout 76. Does that make me a gamer? My top five favorite games of all time are The Last of Us, The Witcher 3, Bioshock, Fallout New Vegas, and the Mass Effect trilogy. I'm wondering if that makes me a gamer. Truthfully, I have no idea what makes me a gamer. I mean, I'm caught up in this existential crisis and, uh, I. I. I don't really even know, like, who I am anymore. Jerebo here. Has declared it. Uh, I'm not a gamer. Because I haven't completed seven specific video games. Even though there's thousands of good video games that have come out over the last 40 years, because I haven't completed seven of them, and because Jerbo declared that I'm not a gamer, I've made the difficult decision to just call it quits. It's been a really fun ride, but I. I can't continue to lie to myself, and I can't continue to lie to you guys. So thank you for interacting with my content, but I'm done. I'll still be on TikTok, though. You can follow me at the Underwater Basket Weaver, where I truly hope you guys will interact with my new content. That's hopefully a little bit more true to myself. So thank you, Gerbo, for helping me realize the truth. And I'll see you guys later.",

A fan favorite weapon is coming to the game called the CAR 98K and it will be free in the Battle Pass. Random skins are also coming to M W3, and they can happily take my money for these.

    "voice_to_text": "So with a EA saying that they not only want to put ads in your favorite video games, they are actively putting money into developing it. The internet has kind of taken this as a. A last stand, and I don't blame them. Understand, EA is quite possibly the worst gaming company ever, just followed by Ubisoft. But the thing that makes EA the absolute worst is that you know how like every other gaming company tries to innovate? Like the make a better technology, making a better video game. Yeah, EA just finds new ways to monetize the products that you already kind of like. Like, I understand EA executives want there to be a commercial break in your favorite sports games. Imagine calling a time out and fucking mad in 2027 and then you gotta watch a Fucking Burger King ad. Understand that means that all sports games have to be connected to the internet 24 7. The worst part about it is last time I talked about this, there was really people in the comment section that said, well, it'll add to immersion. I'm sorry, I'm. I'm convinced you're either a bot or an active employee of EA. Or even there's like an EA executive holding your family hostage telling you that you gotta type this online if you want immersion in your sports game. And the way to get that is the watch commercials. How. How about this? How about you pause the game every two Minutes. Watch three Burger King ads in a row on YouTube and then there you go. Don't ruin it for the rest of us. But. Understand this won't just affect Madden games, this will also affect single player games. Like people have already done this in protest to just point out the obscurity of this dog. Imagine if you're playing Star Wars the last Jedi and you see a fucking billboard that says Nuka Cola, the favorite drink of the Empire. Understand there is already patents on this technology that is owned by Sony, EA, Ubisoft. They all have patents on this. The moment one company feels comfortable enough to do it, everybody's going to do it. Understand at this rate if nobody like does anything, there is going to be a day where games are going to come out at their normal standard version at $70. But then there's going to be a 90 to 100 dollar version of that game that is going to get rid of ads for you. And they are going to find a way to make it illegal to mod ads out of a game. Like, I'll tell you this right now. I've never been a huge EA fan, but I refuse to play another EA game until they walk this shit back. Understand they not only wanna put ads in your favorite video games, they want to decrease the cost of every game. Make it cheaper by offloading a lot of their programming In motion capture to basically chat GPT. Yeah, nah, fuck that. Bye bye."

Let's watch this experience. Hey, co pilot, how's it going? Hey, I'm doing great. And it looks like you're about to dive into some Minecraft. Ready to build, explore, and maybe dive a few miles? Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to make a sword. My son plays this game all the time and I have no idea what I'm doing. No worries. I'm here to help you impress your son. I see you've got a crafting table in front of you, which is a great start. To craft a sword, you'll need some materials. Can you open your inventory? Just press E on your keyboard. Yeah. Do I have what I need? Let's see, you got some sticks perfect for the sword's handle. But it looks like you're missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold or diamond. Alright, let's pause it there for a second. Did you see how co pilot not only could understand that he was in Minecraft, but he could also understand Ryan's request for help and assess the inventory on his screen? Well, it gets better as Ryan continues. He gets surprised that co pilot amazingly identified and it tailored interaction. Let's watch. Let's start by gathering some wood or stone. Shall we head out and find some resources? Yeah, that sounds great. Oh my god, what's that? Oh no. It's a zombie! Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach. If you can find a shelter or dig into the side of the hill, do it now. Just make sure it can't reach you.

You see, all you basic humans out there might go with a simple answer like Skyrim. Looking at you, honey. But I'm gonna go with a video game that I feel is a bit more esoteric. And people have forgotten about this, but it's so amazing and shouldn't be forgotten. The video game Freedom Fighters for the original Xbox. Freedom Fighters was a video game that came out in the early 2, and it was way ahead of its time. You could recruit fellow freedom fighters, and you went over and fought the Soviets. It was just great. It was a good, fun time. But then it ends on a massive cliffhanger. Spoiler alert. You repel the Soviets out of New York City, right? And everyone's jovial, everyone's celebrating. We're like, yay! We're not. We're not controlled by the Soviets anymore. The Soviets are just a not fun time. Let's all have fun and celebrate that they're gone. But the main character, Chris, he's all solemn, right? He's sad and. And yeah, I get that. He's, like, lost a bunch of stuff, right? Like his. His brother gets unalived, right? And he's had to see the horrors of war. But then when the other person comes over to comfort him, like, hey, why aren't you celebrating? He's like, well, they're just gonna be back. Like, Like, they're just gonna send their armies back here. There's no reason to celebrate. And that's when you, as the player, kind of like, oh yeah, he's got a great point there, and that's really sad. But then the credits come up and you're just kind of like, okay, well. Oh man, can't wait for Freedom Fighters too. Except I'm still waiting because it never happened. Where is freedom fighters too? Alright, are the Soviets actually gonna come back, or is Chris just kind of like, being paranoid for no reason? Did the Soviets invasion of America kind of just make them realize? Mulligan, we. We kind of just made a mistake. We're never gonna go ahead and try and rectify that issue ever again. Uh, you know, maybe we can all just kind of forget that that ever happened and try and move on. Uh, or can we finally get a sequel that actually ends the story? Freedom fighters, guys, it's a good game. Everyone should go out and play it right now. Like, literally go out, spend money on freedom fighters. Then. Then the higher UPS in video game land will be all like, hey, people are spending money on this game. Maybe we should do a sequel, because now it's worth it."

And I've had a ton of black people message me, stitch their, stitch my video to their videos, basically calling me an Uncle Tom, this and that. Listen, so for those of you who don't know, I am a game director. So I've been making games for like, 6, 7 years. I run my own gaming company. We've made every type of game you can imagine. So when I'm talking about this, I'm talking purely in a business standpoint. Making the first Assassin's Creed Japanese game and having the main character be a black guy is a bad idea. It's literally a bad idea in every single shape or form. When I say this, I'm not talking about whether or not the story of the samurai was real. I don't care. I believe or not, I don't give a shit. I don't care. I also know that there's another main character that's a Japanese girl, but most of the time, that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a main male character. But we all know that what we really want is a male Japanese character. And I think that's completely fair. The Assassin's Creed game that was set in Africa had a black guy. The game that was set in Italy had an Italian game that was set in London had Londoners. So why would You make an Assassin's Creed game that set in Japan and make it be a black guy as the main character? That's ridiculous. If you want to add Yasuki into the thing, add him as a DLC. Simple, everybody's happy. But making him the main character is a complete bad idea."

It's just lukewarm reception, not a masterpiece. It's just a casual Sonic things and what you expect out of a Fucking Sonic game, right? So I don't beat the main campaign and now I'm doing this whole another world DOC part, which is like another side mode. We can just collect shit, play with Tails, Knuckles, Amy, all that shit, right? So I'm at this part where I'm supposed to jump this fifth tower or whatever. And mind you, I've been probably invested about three to four or five hours into this shit, cause I don't collected everything that I was supposed to do. So tell me why after running this fifth tall ass tower, after trials and everything, and this shit is hard as hell. Once I get up to this bitch and I'm talking to this motherfucker when it's a cutscene, tell me why the after this cutscene, I'm stuck in this long ass loading screen, right? I'm sitting there waiting. I think it's gonna be a boss battle. I'm waiting for like two minutes. I'm waiting for four minutes, I'm waiting for seven fucking minutes. And nothing's about to happen. But once I close the game and I restarted it, guess what? Guess what happened? I started all the way to the fucking beginning.

Honestly, just coming up with 5 games for the PS two, that's kind of hard. But fuck it, let's give it a shot. Never played a PS two. You gotta go with NBA Street volume 2. Don't even worry about the first one, the second one is everything you need plus more. no sports game captures the essence of the 2 better than NBA Street volume 2. Once again hitting y'all with another EA Big game SSX tricky. Anybody who even still owns a PS two is mandatory that you got this in your collection. This goes without saying. If we talking PS two must play games, then the GTA trilogy is definitely on that list. I could just pick one of these three so I said fuck it, need a whole trilogy. If you're new to this console and you wanna know just how much of a technology leap that this console took over the PS one, you gotta play Middle Gear Solid 2. Where? This game came out in 2001. And honestly, looking back at this shit, these graphics are still impressive. The graphics in this game set the standard for damn near every game moving forward this generation. So we got a sports game, a racing game, action adventure game, and some open world games, but what we don't have is a Fighting game, and that's what I come in at with Mortal Kombat, Deadly Alliance, and I won't need that. Big of a fan of the 3D era Mortal Kombat, but Deadly Alliance was my shit. Honorable mention the OG god of war, because you cannot call yourself a friend of my boy Kratos unless you've been there from day one. So if you ain't never touched the PS two, you gotta touch the OG god of war. It's mandatory. so those are the games that in my opinion are must play PS two games. So if you had to put somebody onto that console, you tell me what game that you haven't played.",

    "voice_to_text": "You wanna know what makes The Last of us such a timeless classic? Is the fact that the difference between this game and most games is that when other games end, they just end. The story wraps up. There's nothing to debate or discuss. So when it comes to The Last of us, it's been 11 years and people are still asking was Joe right or was Joe wrong? Like, this man really had the key to potentially save humanity forever, but he didn't take the opportunity and decide to save Ellie. We watched Joe lose his humanity when he lost Sarah, but then we watched him regain his humanity when he met up with Ellie. And it took a minute too, cause he wasn't fucking with her at first. That's exactly why I say Bill is one of the most underrated characters in this whole universe. Because people don't realize he's part of the reason why Joe regained his humanity. We can talk about that in another video though. And what makes the game even more diabolical is the fact that it really took his time and made you bond with them too. The dialogue they shared. Especially when Ellie drop this line right here. Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking except for you. And that line is why this scene is so impactful. Instead of saving the entire world, he decided to save this one girl. But was it selfish? Was His own heartbreaking emotions more important than the survival of the human race. But at the same time, it also poses the question, would this shit have even worked in the first place? Because her death could have easily been in vain. But unfortunately, we never know. And then that leaves me into The Last of Us Part 2, and how this also is a time was classic. A game that y'all hate on a little bit too much. I will make a video about that, too. Because when Joe killed that doctor, who just so happened to be Abby's father, she did whatever it took to get revenge for someone who she loved. But y'all blame her for yet somehow don't blame Joe for this. So I ask you, put yourself in Joe's predicament. You play the game. You know the story. Was Joe right or was Joe wrong? The fact that we can still ask that question 11 years later just goes to show you that this game is absolute perfection."

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out."

Everybody else knows that they're boosted, but they don't know. And I can't tell if it's sad, if it's funny, if you wanna let them live and their ignorance. But this is the case right now with this person. My. My Kiriko, slash Zed. He was on my team a lot of times. He was on support, that when he was on the enemy team, he was on DPS. Um, this was 5 a M. Quick play, so there wasn't really a lot to pick from. Normally he would never be in my lobbies. A long story short, he decided to switch off Anna and goes then into Sombra and proceeded to get farmed. Now, look, it's quick play. You're allowed to play what you want. I definitely had games where I played into my counters, but we've still won. Sometimes we lost, but I wanted to play who I wanted to play, so that's fine. But when I'm doing that, I'm opening myself up to criticism by my teammates and the enemy team, and I have to be okay with that. He was not. And that's fine. It is what it is. So, of course, the very next game, he's on the enemy team, and this is pretty much how it went. Now, granted, I don't know if you guys know how my mama works, but my mama Is at least two wheelers higher than his. So I'm gonna get worse teammates, and that's, you know, it happens all the time. That doesn't really bother me. You know, you lose some, you win some. It's just a game. But it does make me wonder, like, do they choose to be oblivious? Do they genuinely think that they're the ones that are doing the work? Like, I think it's pretty obvious. At least, you know, I know when I'm not playing well, and I know when I look at a scoreboard and just how people are playing, who's the problem and who's not. And it's a little embarrassing that everybody else can see what you can",

This is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. And this is gonna be a big issue. So if you don't know, the newest Assassin's Creed was released. Well, the trailer was released, and then they were basically saying that it's set in Japan, and then instead of a Japanese protagonist, a Japanese main character, we have a black samurai as the main character now. Cool. I have. I have no issue with that. If you wanna do a black thing, that's fine, whatever. They could have done that as a DLC though, as a extra content, as anything else. But making that the main character of the series, of the. The game is a bad thing. This is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. First of all, it's gonna cause division. There's obviously gonna be people who don't like it because the guy is black or whatever. Cool, whatever. But making him a central character in the first Japanese game is one of the worst decisions ever, and it's gonna backfire badly once again. For those of you who don't understand, the main issue is the fact that he's. That he's a black guy in ancient Japan. That doesn't really make much sense in terms of, like, um, I. I know the story of the Samurai, I know that some people say it's true and all that, but you should have chose. They should have chosen a Japanese guy.

There's been leaks going around of lightsabers, jetpacks, and a new warzone map. It all launches on May 29th. We know it'll be Vanguard themed, but the CAR 98 and STG making a comeback. We're also getting a Gundam and fallout bundle. An in game event revealing BO6, a MIL sim operator from OGM W3, Sergeant Hammer, a Frank Woods operator, plus the Mustang and Sally pistols. Now if the new LTM in warzone is related to Gundam, you'll be playing rebirth with jet packs and lightsabers. You see, M W3 is around 200 40 gigs already, so we're adding another hundred gigs on top of that. The Halo Master Chief Collection is six games in one, and it's only 100 and twenty gigs total. Now this has got me thinking. Hey, they're bringing back for. Can season 4 be cottage just poorly optimized or see, they're bloating its size to fill up your console so you can't play other games?

I shouldn't have to play a game where all I say is hi and the whole game is thrown and I'm in hell for the next 40 minutes because men are being emotional about it. That is not normal and that's not how the old Cod days were. Because I promise you, as a man, you have never had somebody throw on the basis of your gender. That doesn't happen. You can say it happens. You're lying. I'm sorry. I don't know why that's such a common thing in the comments of my videos. You guys wanna be oppressed so bad that you look at a man calling me a telling me he's gonna tell me to get back in the kitchen and say it's not a woman thing and say that that happens to you too. It doesn't. There's a reason that historically male dominated spaces are known for being toxic and unsafe. That goes for gaming, that goes for sports. Any male dominated space is a bad one. That's not me being sexist. That is me saying there is an inherent issue with the way that you guys have your locker room talk that makes everybody else feel unsafe. I don't know how you could possibly find it fun to make other people feel unsafe. No woman is Asking men to make gaming a safe space with sunshine and rainbows and everything. But could you please be normal? Because I wanna be able to enjoy playing the game without my life being threatened, without my body being threatened. Because I'm existing as a woman and men are the ones making it unsafe. I do not care if you feel targeted by me saying men, or if you feel attacked by me saying men, you are part of the problem. If you feel attacked by that, you're part of the problem. If you say, just mute them, you're part of the problem. If you sit there and let them say that me and you don't intervene, you are part of the problem. Because I have a lot of male friends, a normal male friends who don't say slurs and don't threaten people and just play like normal. I understand it is not all men. But if you are not one of the men doing this, it is entirely on you to help stop the men who are. If you don't understand that, and you don't understand power imbalances and gender hierarchy, it's not my place to teach you. I'm not your mother, I'm not your teacher. Close the game for five minutes and educate yourself. But stop making this a bad experience for everybody else who's just trying to play the game.",

I would pretend that I was him going on the adventure, and whenever I was done close Fallout 4, get back on Fallout Shelter. Send that motherfucker back. Get back to business. That is never the answer. It's never. Man, this Elden Ring DLC doesn't drop soon if they don't put out like a new Resident Evil or something man. Fuck dude.

I was sweating and convulsing. I was hyperventilating. They don't even wanna play games with me no more. They almost didn't even watch a movie with me last night, man. We were gonna watch something. I don't remember what we were gonna watch. This movie by the dude who made a coyote. It's called like Z Ram. Motherfucker bailed. It's. I don't like what you've become, man.

    "voice_to_text": "The Assassin's Creed drama is crazy. Yasuke as the main samurai has people tweaking. Yasuke was not a real samurai. He was a placeholder for another samurai. Damn, I didn't realize there were so many Japanese historians. It's just a story in a video game, not a history lesson. When has Assassin's Creed ever been about historical accuracy? Y'all remember Assassin's Creed 2? Leonardo da Vinci was in that game. Wait till y'all find out he never built weapons for assassin's in real life. Or what about Assassin's Creed 3 where you play as a Native American during the American Revolution war? Wait till y'all find out he wasn't actually there for the declaration of independence. Matter of fact, bro wasn't there at all. He didn't fucking exist, bros. The first main character in Assassin's Creed to actually exist. This isn't the first time he's been shown as a samurai either. Yasuke's been all over game shows and movies as a samurai dog. I just think a game in Japan should have a Japanese main character. My brother in Christ, he's right there. Everybody's ignoring her. A Japanese Shinobi ninja sounds cool as shit. You don't even gotta play as Yasuke, you could play as her the whole time I watched. Y'all hate on this game because it was a ghost of Tsushima clone. So what do y'all actually want from this game? Y'all should be mad at a 130 dollar ultimate edition. Y'all should be mad at them locking Missions behind pre orders. They've always taken historical events and built their own story around them. I'm not saying it'll be good. These characters might be ass. But is this really that big of a deal to y'all? Like, for real?",

And why are you taking two promotional videos that I got paid to do opposed to the videos that I just do for fun? Like you post every couple of months? I post consistently through the month.

Can y'all go let him know he took an L, please? Wait, hold on. Let me give myself a prediction. This next video will be him still hiding behind an AI, yapping, and then projecting.

Some of y'all vanilla people really think that black people only spawn in the 1600s, and it's kind of sad. All it really took was a quick Google search to find out who Yasuke really is. And I did not know that there was a Black Samurai in Japan, which is newsworthy to me. Now, whether or not this game is gonna be good, I'm gonna buy it because I got to show support because we don't get these stories so often when y'all have so many other stories out there that Penarthy y'all, and we can't have one for us or anyone else.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, nobody else wants to say it, so I'll say it. I don't think this Bella Ramsey casting is going to work for season 2. Understand? Ever since the beginning, I never had a problem with Bella Ramsey playing Ellie as a child, cause to me, it fit enough. Like, don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna lie to you and say she looks like her. I am. I'm not gonna lie to you and say that some people were coping a little bit too hard. Like, her mannerism. She got the mannerisms down. Like, Bella Ramsey is objectively a very talented actress, but like, there's also a point where you lose me, understand? Bella Ramsey is going to have to play basically female John Wick. Like, the themes of season 2 are so much darker than season one for every single character. Here's the thing, Bella Ramsey can play a child, and she can play a child really well. Yeah, now. Now you're gonna have to play a Ellie who merks a pregnant lady. And I even say, I'm sorry, these look like you 14 year olds going on a school trip. Like, that would be okay in season 1. Season 2. No, no, no. Like, the themes changed and like, it wouldn't bother me if you didn't have people that look like Dina. Like, how do you miss on Dina too? And Dina is really cool in the site. Like, I don't want them to mess up Dina either. And, like, how do you miss with Dina and Ellie? But, like, you get a almost perfect casting of Jesse in the. Throw gasoline on the fire. How does the actress for Abigail look more like Ellie than the actress for Ellie? But, like, here's the. Here's the after part. This actress right here was offered the role of Ellie in season one, but they turned her down for Bella Ramsey. Like, I, I, I kind of understand because I'm, I'm sorry. This does not look like a 14 year old, but I'm sorry, now we have the reverse issue in this looks like a 14 year old trying to play an adult. Let me clear this up again. Bella Ramsay is a great actress, but do you know what the male equivalent of this is? This is like Timothy Salome trying to play Cal Drogo from game of Thrones. Timothy Salome is objectively one of the most talented new actors right now. He's not pulling off Calidrogo. That is the equivalent of Bella Ramsey trying to play Ellie in part 2. Like, I'm sorry, at this point, for anybody who knows what's coming, you are setting up Bella Ramsey for failure. She's gonna try her best, but I'm sorry, it's just not gonna hit.",

    "voice_to_text": "X defiant is about to be a top three FPS game, all thanks to a major decision that players have been begging to see from call of duty. The peak call of duty games and X defiant actually have a lot of things in common, one of them being the brains behind the operation, Mark Rubin, who worked for Activision as the executive producer during the Modern Warfare series. But more importantly, he understands better than anyone that skill based matchmaking has played a huge factor in a call of duty struggles. So today the team released a statement confirming there will be no skill based matchmaking in the casual playlist for X Defiance. The statement continues on saying skill based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive, constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and varied, similar to how prime call of duty was. X defiant will find matches in order of these priorities latency avoided, players, party size, region, input device, and then platform. Once in the lobby. Teams will still be balanced though. They also confirmed that ranked will be added in a future season, and those matches will be prioritized based on ranked points.",

It ain't no hating shit, nothing like that. It was just a challenge. Mainly for myself. Right? I'm just a person who loves Elder Ring and souls one games in general. There's a lot of people that were talking shit about Carson that the whole time, you know. I'm saying if we're keeping it 100, he's playing very well. People talking shit cause of how long it took him to Beat Tree Sentinel. But I know now they still haven't beat it in the game. Been out for 2 years. And as far as the main story, he's basically halfway through. And I know man. That have dropped the game. That haven't got half as far as Kai. So all in all bro, I hope Kai really finishes the game. I hope you can do this shit. I believe in you bro. Is definitely doable. Just gotta download the boss's moves bro. And sometimes it take a little time. But you gonna get that shit, bro.

I mean, of course, they're still generators, they're still exit gates, there's just more of them. Uh, we've made five maps bigger to accommodate all of the action, all of the chaos. And we're also doing way with perks in this mode instead, introducing a new sort of 2 v eight exclusive system called classes for survivors. That's right, yes. So when it comes to survivors, basically, once you've chosen your character, you can select and equip a player class, and this class is effectively your power for the match. And it helps players identify what your role is within the team. Instead of mixing and matching perks. Instead, we really wanted to focus on a particular playstyle for this, and whether it's generator, repair, healing, looping, speed, that kind of thing. That's what we're really going for with these classes. But we will be introducing a new mechanic, which is a team power. For example, if you are the Wraith, when you cloak yourself, if your teammate is within a certain radius of you, they will also get the undetectable status effect. We're doing away with hooks as well. There's no hooks into V8. Instead, once it was down to survivor, they'll be able to send them to a cage. This works very similar to Pyramid Head. It will teleport the survivor to another part of the map, away from The and of course, this still counts as hook states. So once you've been hooked three times, you'll be out of the match."

This game is honestly so chill and a lot of fun, and I love a chill, just sweet man. And that's literally every single man that plays this game. So he's husband material. Next up we have Elden Ring. Of course. I always talk about how amazing Elden Ring guys are, but seriously, if your man plays Elden Ring, you need to make him your husband. They are genuinely just the most sweet, amazing guys you will ever find. Third up, we've got Titanfall two. Men that play Titanfall 2 have to be so loyal cause there's not that many people that play this game anymore. Most of them have moved to APEX. So if he plays Titanfall 2 still, you know he's loyal and you know he's husband material. Next up we've got god of war. I love men who play story games. Men that play story games are honestly just the best. And if he plays god of war and is super into the story, he's definitely husband material. And last but certainly not least, we have Fallout 4. The story of this game is absolutely amazing. It is genuinely a really, really interesting game, and the guys that play it are super, super into it and I love that. So if he Plays Fallout 4.

    "voice_to_text": "Overwatch is the greatest shooter game of all time in my opinion. But you complain about the game all the time. Yeah, that's only because I like the game. Shut up. Overwatch is the best FPS game of all time because it's the only FPS game that I've ever played where the better team always wins. Whereas in games like Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant or CSGO, if you have one player that just pops off they can single handedly win you a game even if the rest of their team is worse than the enemy team. That's what I love about Overwatch is that it feels like if your team is better, you will win. Because teamwork and team play is valued much higher than individual play in Overwatch. That is also why I absolutely hate Widowmaker, because she is, in my opinion, the only character that makes this statement untrue. Widow is the only character that can single handedly carry her own team to a win when they do not deserve it. You could have Helen Kellers as supports. Hank and your other DPS in a widow could still win you the game. And I'm saying this as somebody who has been that widow player. I know it's so foreign for you to wrap your mind around the fact that someone can have an opinion on something that is not detrimental to them. It can even be beneficial to them at times. But still, they can point out that It's problematic to anybody that says all you have to do is go dive. Do you realize that you literally are reworking your entire camp just for one character, regardless of the map that you're playing on or the other characters on the enemy team? If that doesn't scream problematic, I don't know what does.",

Motherfucker, we paid the same exact $70 for the same game. Unless the game devs is cutting you a check for beating it on hard, shut the fuck up. Oh this one really pisses me off. Console Glazers. Just because you chose Xbox over PlayStation don't make you better than nobody. And just because you chose PC over console don't make you a fucking god. Just enjoy the game on whatever platform you wanna enjoy it on and shut the fuck up. This one right here really pisses me off. People who talk shit about games that they haven't fucking played. Or people who talk shit about games before they even get a chance to play it. This game looks trash. Bro, shut the fuck up. It ain't even came out yet man. This one needs to be addressed every single time. Male gamers who give female gamers a hard time just because they women like yeah bro, tell us you don't actually get no poom poom without actually saying it. Yeah yeah bro, I know girls Probably gave you a hard time for being a gamer. But it's probably cause your ass don't take a fucking shower. Y'all boys be swag, listen dirty as hell, and wonder why you don't get no hoes. That shit is preposterous behavior, my boy. Put the controller down sometimes, touch some grass, and learn how to talk to women. It ain't that hard, my boy. Oh, yeah, and honorable mention, if all you play is call of duty or 2K, your opinion invalid. All right, so those are a few gamers that I don't like. Y'all tell me some gamers that y'all can't fucking stand.",

There's a lot to be excited about with this one. When the trailer started dropping, everybody started talking about how this felt like it could be Xbox's answer to god of war. But it's totally not that. This game is going to be six to eight hours long, and it's not going to be a full priced game. It's only 50 bucks instead of seventy. Obviously we'll see how good the game actually is in a couple of weeks, but I'm all in on shorter games that pack a punch instead of companies always going for bigger maps and bigger open worlds with hundreds of hours of content. I totally get the concept of bang for your buck, especially with games being as expensive as they are. 70 bucks for a game like Dragon's Dog Mewtwo that you can play for weeks and still not technically feel like you finished everything would keep you busy for longer. But a game like Hellblade 2 that's about seven hours long, or even a Spider Man 2 that takes 12 to 15 for the story, or about a day if you're trying to 100% the game is the sweet spot. I love that. Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I've got other things that are going on in life. I Don't mind if a game is shorter if the content and the story that it's delivering make the time that I spend playing the game more memorable and worthwhile. I'm not saying that every game needs to be seven or eight hours long, because some games need to be hundreds or thousands of hours because of what players expect from them, which is totally cool. I'm just saying.",

Especially the Lost Legacy expansion with Chloe and Nadine. Because for some strange reason I like Lost Legacy better than the main game. I don't know, maybe that's just me since we own Naughty Dog. While I do wish that they would make a new game, I had no problem when they remaster The Last of us because The Last of us is another game that I will replay the shit out of. I played the original on PS three, played the remaster on PS four, and of course I had to get over PS five. I was a no brainer 11 years later in the replay value in this game is crazy. Whenever I'm feeling nostalgic but don't wanna go back too far, I go to a game like Max Pain 3. See, Max Pain is an old game that has very modern control so it's easy to play. This. Tell you, out of that whole PS three and Xbox 3 60 era, Max Pain 3 might be one of the top five most best age games. I don't care how many times me and my old lady beat this game, we will continue to replay it. It's kind of like a tradition at this point. We already do for like a third playthrough. What makes the Replay value on this game so great is because no matter how many times you beat it, every time you play it is still gonna be challenging. Hands down the greatest co op game ever made. Honorable mention. I don't give a damn how long this game is, I'm playing this shit again. It was crazy that every time I replay this game, I run into a situation that I didn't experience the last time. Alright, so those are the games that I love replaying.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, TikTok, what's a game that you play to just chill? Like, it's your chill game. You. You play it and basically you're just zoning out and just. Just kinda just playing the game. I feel like everybody has these games. And so I'm gonna go first. And of course, knowing me, I have more than one answer. So first answer is gonna be my, I guess, my original answer before the other game released. And so this game's been my, like, just chill game for the longest time for a number of reasons. One, it's a chill game for me to just stream because I get to just have conversations with everybody while I play it. And two, is a chill game for me just because I can sit down and I can play through the entire game in one sitting. And that game for me is gonna be RE 3. This is a very chill game for me. Like, it didn't used to be, used to be a stressful game, but it's very chill now because I've been playing it for so long that I could just sit down, play the game and have conversation with people on stream. Now, this other game is kind of a chill game for me because it's a world that I enjoy getting immersed into and characters that I love, uh, interacting with. And so that's gonna be Final Fantasy 7 rebirth. Like, that's a chill game for me because the open World is so vast and you can do a whole bunch of things in it that it's easy to just get lost and just enjoy myself playing the game. And most of the time I don't like that about open worlds, about getting lost and stuff. But because this is different, it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's universe that I enjoy being in the game. Like, I'm okay with that. Kind of want them to do the same thing for 5 98. As always, comment and stitch because I always want to see your responses."

And people are just signing this without reading it just to get a game key. So I'm not playing this game anymore. Don't expect me to play this game anymore. It's ridiculous. And I hope some much more popular people than me blow this up cause that is very not okay. I've just extremely not okay. Just for reference, that's just for codes. It's not for like sponsors. It's just to get a game code, man. Wow, so they want you to sign a non disparagement just to get a game code? You know, there's a word for that. It's actually two words. It's called access journalism. Hopefully, uh, some more people talk about this. Just how ridiculous it is. They ask you to be professional about the game. Nothing wrong with that. It says you are not allowed to give a negative review professional about the game. Bro, that is not being professional. Being professional is whenever you tell them they're good professional. That is the opposite. It's definitely like Marvel or someone big Korpa is going crazy. And that's not even a sponsor. Yeah, that's insane. Yeah, I think he has every Right. To be annoyed about it. And also, I don't think that he should stop streaming the game. I think stream the game and shit on the game if you think that there's something wrong with it. And if they shut you down, you are a martyr. And you're gonna get so much attention, everybody's gonna support you. Cause they're not gonna execute on this, and it's just gonna make you look good if this happens. And I understand, like, this is kind of like a bad way of. Of going about things, but, um, I'm just being realistic. Right. Like, this is kind of like. This is what my vibe of the game is, is like, this game just looks like Overwatch. Point 5. It doesn't piss with this way until they see my red box. It looks like. Yeah, there you go. You know what it looks like? It looks like if Nexon made an Overwatch clone. That's what it looks like. It's like a phone game company makes the phone game or PC game version of Overwatch. Like the game. It just looks cheap. So, yeah, Seagulls totally right about this. Makes sense now why lyric and shroud says they don't have access to the Alpha. I don't know what they expected from mobile game developer. It is textbook access journalism. There's nothing good about it. What a surprise. It looks like kind of a terrible game too. So, uh. Yeah, that's what you get."

    "voice_to_text": "This game is gonna actually Deebo Overwatch's player base. Marvel Rivals is doing everything Overwatch does but better. It's almost as if they have my guy Jeff Kaplan secretly working on this game. I cannot stress enough the abundance of parallels there are. The pacing is steady just like Overwatch. The game modes are the same from 2CP to pushing the old payload. The characters are even. All either direct reskins or fusions of Overwatch characters. Take Star Lord for example. His blicks shoot just like tracers, but then he has this move that's basically like Reaper's death blossom. And his ultimate is soldier 76 is tactical visor. Yeah, this game has tons of similarities. Enough to keep anyone who enjoys Overwatch satisfy. And then there's the several things that put this game a cut above. There's the obvious stuff like the fact that this game will be free to play. The fact that it has beloved Marvel characters who all just like an Overwatch banter back and forth with funny voice lines. There's the fact that Marvel rivals is 6 v 6, which is a revert back to the classic Overwatch, which I believe was the best time for the game. The third person perspective works so good in this type of game. So many characters flying and moving around. It feels a lot more controlled from this perspective. Not to mention the fact that you can actually see what skins are rocking. This game has the traditional tank Damage and support classes, but it also has these team up moves you can do. You put certain characters on a team together. It even has a built in clan system. They call it factions. As well as a built in tournament system. And overall, even with this being an alpha, this game is incredibly polished. You can tell that net ease is taking this game serious and leaving no stone unturned. Some of y'all know this. I worked really close with the Overwatch crew team for for years. I have a lot of love for that franchise, but that also means I had a front row seat to its fall from Grace as Activision and now Microsoft have continued to destroy the quality that Blizzard first put out. And now with this hungry Marvel back game that's doing a lot of the same stuff people loved about the old days of Overwatch and more. I'm not too biased to admit that.",

This is what it feels like to stop playing destiny. I'll go years without playing. It'll creep back in. Somehow my friends convinced me to get back on for lifefall. It was kind of ass, I'm not gonna lie. We all played for two to three months, then stop playing again. Now they're trying to get me back on again. I'm not doing it. Overwatch, man. Damn. I know. I hate on Overwatch a lot on here. Overwatch 1 was like that. I used to go crazy. Overwatch 1 was a different time in life. You had to be there for it. Probably some of my best gaming memories come from Overwatch 1. Then this right here dropped. I hate it. The whole release of Overwatch 2 was just pointless. The whole point is it was gonna be completely different with PvE and missions and shit. Never fully happened, bro. The new character skill trees out the window never happened. Now the game is more grindy and monetized than ever. I get back on to play with friends every now and then, but I quickly remember why I stopped playing. This one is bad, bro. The biggest chokehold on me for a decade. I have everything, bro. Apartments, a submarine. There's no need for me to get back on and play this. Game. But I just downloaded it last night. It's like every couple months I gotta get back on and play. I don't know why. Had to stop playing cause my character was living better than me. Shit was sad. For real. I got a friend that can't quit the Elder Scrolls Online no matter what he does. Let me know what this game is for you. Everybody's got one.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

The CEO said EA already has teams thing that right now within the company, looking at how they can do it very thoughtfully inside of the gaming experience. Keyword there is thoughtfully. I mean when it's done tastefully it can actually be fun. Like the old need for speed games. They used to have Best Buy and Burger King ads all across the map. But I hope you didn't forget that. They have tried this once and it definitely didn't go to plan back in 2020. EA put ads into UFC 4 for the boys that would pop up in the middle of fights. EA was forced to backtrack as players were rightfully upset. Especially since there was no mention of this before launch and they added the ads a month after everyone already bought the game. Although the CEO says they're in the very early stages of testing, it's clear EA is putting a lot of thought into how they can get ads into the games that you're paying for.",

EA has already put subtle advertisements in games like Burnout Paradise, but this new push could see more invasive targeted ads in full price experiences.

Yeah, or should I say EA, but the internet believes that this will sink the company completely. They're also saying that it's bad enough for all the DLC and the pay to win and the gambling that you have to do on EA titles just to get skins, but now they're gonna be adding insult to injury by putting gaming ads as you're sitting playing games.

He says this console is gonna be a successor to the Nintendo Switch. Could it be a switch too? I don't know. People have been speculating for Mad Long that Nintendo's dropping a new console. And would y'all believe me if I said the switch came out back in 2017, seven years ago? I didn't believe it at first, I'm not gonna lie. But then I remembered I have my switch since 2018. Yeah, this switch right here, I've had it since 2018, and it's been holding it down. I'm not gonna lie, the switch had a great life cycle, and I look forward to this newest console. If his back was compatible with the switch, i'mma sell my switch. Cause if his back was compatible, there's no point of having it. And the switch was announced back in March of 2015. I was a senior in high school. I was 18 years old, and I'm 27 now. It really goes to show that Tom really flaws. But. Yo, Nintendo, if y'all watching this, when it comes to this new console for the controllers, can y'all please make sure the shit don't got stick drift on it? I love the switch as much as the next person with the stick drifting. These fucking bum ass Joy Cons is fucking annoying. Bro, ain't no reason Why I should be moving the antelope stick up in my character. Go. Right. But, yeah. Y'all excited for Nintendo's newest console? Cause best believe I am.",

But if you're from one of those 177 regions, you can't play ghost of Sushi MA on PC anymore. But as you can see here, this is a refund email from Green Man Gaming specifically calling out we have to refund your money because you're from a country without PlayStation Network support. So far, developer Sucker Punch, surely wary of the backlash that hit Arrowhead a week ago, has confirmed that players will need to log into PlayStation Network to access the game's multiplayer features, but the single player content can be played without it. Sucker Punch implies in their email that this decision came from Sony, and that would track, but it's a shame that so many people will be locked out of a game for a problem that is solvable.

It used to be plus 5 on block, now it's only plus 2. That means you can actually play Tekken now. You got options. It actually feels fair to play against. You now is down back forward was cancer is the hatchet is that you used to have to respect that move, but now. Nah, you have to show me on hit. It used to be plus 7, but now it's only plus three. That's options. And if you block it, I guarantee you you got enough time to go to the bathroom, come back and steal punishment for it. They also touch his oppressive running too. It used to be plus 6 on block, but now you don't have to necessarily respect it anymore because now it's only plus four. Those two frames you can honestly, you can jab out of that now I don't have to respect you. I love the direction Tekken is going in. Some nurse was a little too much like June's nurse. Just a little too much. But I think we're going in the right direction. Do y'all agree or disagree?",

I can't wait to see all the videos that are probably gonna try to convince me to play games I've already played. But still, I wanna see them.

So, my brothers and sisters, when you've committed a sin, no matter what it is, quit it, seek the forgiveness of Allah, and you're totally forgiven. That's what Allah says. If you want the proper conditions of toba or repentance, Allah says, you admit your sin, you seek forgiveness, you promise not to do it again, and that's it. You're gone. Right? Done. I stopped the sin. I admitted it. I sought forgiveness from Allah. I promise not to repeat it again. There goes. May Allah, subhanahu WA ta'ala grant us the ability to turn to him at all times.

Israel was warned by the United States that if they were to commence with the ground invasion in Rafah, that shipments of weapons would halt. So today, this Israeli official, Talib Guth Liab, sent a message to the United States. She said, the US is threatening not to give us precise missiles. Then mockingly, she said, oh, yeah, well, I got news for the US. We have imprecise missiles, and we have the right to defend ourselves. So maybe instead of using a precise missile and taking down a specific room or a specific building, I'll use my imprecise missiles and I'll just collapse 10 buildings. 10 buildings! This statement was the official response of Israel to the halted shipment of weapons. All because the United States told them to not enter a Rafah and begin the ground invasion, and they didn't like that. So now the amount of unaliving and destruction will be on the United States's hands, as if it's all one big oops. 10 buildings instead of a specific room. Yesterday, images of specific rooms were released from Rafa, and the only people who were victims in those specific rooms were children. And let's not even mention the fact that maybe, just maybe, one of the hostages might be in one of those 10 buildings. Oh, wait, but that doesn't actually matter, does it?"

She's so mainlined into pop culture right now, even universities want in.

Even if the Collector's Edition is not that good, which I've been disappointed before. First in line to pre order that Collector's edition. At this point it even stems a little bit the shimmy gummy tensei. First in line to pre order them cause I got a problem. Yep. I have a couple others that I'll do that with too. It's not just those two, but let me know down in the comment section what's your day one purchase game, series or franchise?

Starting with the R9 Eruptor has increased explosion damage by 40 and removed shrapnel from explosions. This helps with players either blowing themselves up or their teammates around them. And over in enemies, we have increased shriekersight and hearing range. Then we have increased gunship hearing ranges. Well, we also got a list of gameplay fixes, such as fixing issues with damage over time. Firing the Punisher plasma while wearing a shield backpack will no longer damage. Helldivers fixed an issue with scopes not being aligned in first person view. The sound when stimming no longer plays, even when it's interrupted. Ager orders with the kill test now track scores correctly. Helldivers can no longer land on tall rocks in eradication missions. Helldivers can no longer land on top of bug pillars in terminative control missions. Fixed an issue for players not being able to reinforce after leaving and rejoining. And the list goes on. With the number of crash and menufixes, this will be the last update until May 9th, which is when we'll get a new Polar Patriots Warbond full of three new armor sets, three new capes, and four new weapons, such as the P13 verdict, the AR sixty one Tenderizer, the SMG seventy two Pummler, the PLAS one O 1 Purifier, and the Incendiary Impact Grenade. What weapons are you most excited for and what do you wanna see the mad next?",

Well, you should, because it's actually all the negative reviews that the game got when PlayStation announced PC players would have to connect to a PSN account. But now that they changed their mind, the community is rallying to create something to commemorate this victory for democracy. It really started to blow up when CEO Johan Pilsett tweeted this image of a quote accidental cape design, which got community members making other versions of the design. This one, dubbed the Prodigal Sun, even features a tall blue column referencing Operation Cleanup, the new campaign that the community is working on to reverse the effects of the review bombing. And it's working. As of now, the game's rating has moved up from overwhelmingly negative to mixed. What's even better, though, is that Arrowhead is apparently thinking about making the graph an official cape. They just haven't thought of a good name for it yet. What do you think it should be called? Let us know!",

I want them all kindly kick rocks. And that is the nice version of what I'm thinking. Me saying the mean version would get me on a list.

It was just shown via an internal email that Microsoft is shutting down four Bethesda studios Arcane Austin, Tangle Game Works, the people who did Hi Fi Rush, Alpha Dog, and Roadhouse. Arcane Austin was the people responsible for Redfall. That means there will be no further DLC. So yes, if you spent the hundred and like $50 for all the DLC content, you're gonna be compensated for that. You will not see that DLC. I feel like this isn't really that surprising. I mean, it's again, super unfortunate. This should never be the case whatsoever. I do believe Roadhouse is gonna be merged with another studio, but Alpha Dog is shutting down. But Tango Game works. What the. Hi fi rush is an absolute masterpiece. If you've never played The Evil Within, I could not encourage you more to do so. This is a underrated masterpiece. This team is such a talented studio. I would have never expected to see this. I mean, this just got added to the PS five. Also tweeted out. Just this super small thing. Super freaking tragic, man. I genuinely feel for these guys. This. This has absolutely nothing to do with freaking talent, which is absolutely baffling. I freaking hate this trend that we're seeing in the video game industry, but these are genuinely talented people and just get completely freaking cut. I Really hope that Microsoft is helping these guys transition into the new work. I pray to god somebody will also pick up Tango game works. What an absolute shame.",

Not because of the whole controversy that surrounded it, mainly because I've been playing this game for about two to three months straight, and it's been a fun experience even though it's the same thing over and over and over. I appreciate the fact that the devs have keep on updating stuff regarding the guns. I'm glad they made some balancing changes here and there, but at this point I really wanna see like a new enemy type or just something new besides the same thing regarding the terminus. And in the automatons, once you get past like level 20 and everything else, like you pretty much got everything you needed to take care of these, um, you know, these bugs and in these bots, once you done maxed out and all the ship modules and getting air, all the strategims, like, we're just basically leveling up at this point. Me personally, I think like the level capitals are could have been better at 60 or 70, but now is increased to 1 50. Is like, what are we doing at this point other than doing the same thing over and over and over? And I hope that we have like a big overall update or something, because this game really needs some new stuff going forward. I don't hate this game. I love how nervous to this game has done a lot. It has brought my me and my Friends. We play together, like, almost every day. And it's also like a good excuse just to talk about life and just playing it. But now with this other game coming, like X define, and it's free, I might be playing that a bit more often. You know, hopefully we get some new content. I just wanna share my thoughts at the moment.

There's a remaster I think on on steam, and it's half detective game, half martial arts game, and a little bit of an RPG game. And it's just legit, man. Like it's so good. The detail, the characters.

I've sided with all four of the main groups that you can get in Fallout 4, and this is what I Learned when siding with the Minute Men. The Minute Men are definitively the right option to choose when it comes to doing a good playthrough in Fallout 4. Not only are they just fighting for the good of like, the world, they just wanna make the Commonwealth a safer place regardless of if you are a synth or if you are a human. They're not necessarily racist by any means to ghouls or super mutants. While super mutants are obviously gonna cause trouble, if you're a good super mutant there's no problem. Preston Garvey, as annoying as he is, is probably one of the most morally good people throughout the whole entire franchise of fallout. He literally holds the ideas of the Minute Men and he wants to just help the Commonwealth, help it be a safer place and help people that need help. And I do think that the Minute Men are the canon ending of Fallout 4. It just makes perfect sense for the Commonwealth."

Last couple of days have been a nightmare, not only for people in other countries who just lost access to the game, but also with Arrowhead Studio who had to do massive damage control on a decision they weren't even responsible for. Even encouraging people to refund the game and review bomb it so Sony would finally listen. That plan seems to work, as PlayStation officially walked back the PSN requirement with this announcement on X. On the post they said hell divers fans we've heard your feedback on the Helldiverse 2 account leaking update. The May 6th update, which would have required steam and PlayStation Network account leaking for new players and for current players beginning May 30th, will not be moving forward. We're still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Hell Divers 2, and we'll keep you updated on future plans."

It's totally bait, but you know I'm gonna bite. Look, there's already multiple things wrong with this because like, who cares what people's favorite games are? Your favorite game is some top 10 best selling shit that was a game of the year contender. I absolutely adore games like Psychonauts 1. It's one of my favorite PS two two games and I feel like it doesn't get enough credit. I am also somebody who thinks The Last of Us Part 1 and part 2 are complete masterpieces. These things like changed my perspective on gaming. I love lesser known Metroid Vanias like Fist Forged and Shadow Torch. I also love the extremely popular Hollow Knight. This is like my favorite video game of all time. If they sold well, they were popular, and they were nominated for game of the year. Probably for a damn good reason. Your favorite game is some top 10 best selling shit. But put that aside, your argument crumbles cause you choose GTA, Vice City, Persona 5, and Metal Gear Solid 3. These are. These are insanely popular titles and Again, that's the point. Nothing wrong with that. I think games like evil within 2 are an absolutely underrated masterpiece and more people need to play it. Guess what, I also love Dead Space, the incredibly popular horror game. phrasing this differently would have been a totally different story. There's nothing wrong with asking people like, what their favorite obscure video games are. I swear to god, two things can be true on this app. Somebody can love the PS two version of Transformers and also have The Last of us as their favorite video game of all time. Genuinely get where you're coming from. You wanna see people talk about other games rather than Red Dead, Ghost of Tsushima, God of war. I get it. They're usually critically acclaimed for a reason.

We hate the bitches you fuck cause they confuse themselves with real women. Then notice I said we is not just me, I'm what the culture feeling. How many more fairytale? Okay, I'm glad we cleared that up. I'mma still use them though, because annoyingly, he is a really good Pokemon and has some great support moves and has great typing and. Yeah, not to mention he also has a really good ability and now has higher usage than my poor, sweet, innocent ghost fairy fluttermane. She's struggling in the current meta. Okay, the horse is here. Peter, the horse is here. I digress. So there is still that factor, but I still don't like him. He's still my least favorite. Why? He always moving and grooving like that? It's gonna be a no for me.

    "voice_to_text": "So I saw this post yesterday that said all hell Divers 2 players will need to make a PSN account. I really didn't think much of it and just went on with my day. Come to find out these PC players are heated their review bombing Hell Divers 2 just because they have to make a PSN account. Y'all are not real. This is some of the most crybaby shit I ever seen. Held average 2 has been one of the best games that dropped this year. They listen to the community, actively update the game, adding new weapons, strategies, outfits, natural disasters. They added all types of shit to this game and this shit's been peak. But because you have to make a PSN account. You talking about this the end of hell divers too? Y'all boys are pathetic. It takes no longer than 2 minutes to make a PSN account bro. What are you mad about? When I played Red Dead 2 I needed a Rockstar account. When I played Minecraft I had to make a Microsoft account. Even when I'm trying to play mirrors edge I need an EA account. But there's literally no reason to complain cause that shit doesn't take any time. Weirdest part is it's not even hell divers fault. They don't have control over that shit. The only people that have the right to be mad are people from these countries. They should still be able to play the game and Sony needs To handle that ASAP. But if you can make a PC account but don't want to because you're an almighty PC player and can never stoop down to a console account, just shut your lame ass up. But yeah, man, all the real soldiers keep fighting for the democracy. And yeah, i'mma see y'all boys next time.",

For the past few weeks I've been playing Fallout 4 and all my comments have been the same play New Vegas! So I decided to give it a try. New Vegas is obviously outdated, but I'm loving it. Turns out I noticed everybody kept saying the same thing. New Vegas is better than Fallout 4 and people were being so toxic on my live chat I decided to put it to the test. I made two videos, one about Fallout 4 and one about New Vegas. All the comments in the follow for video were super welcoming, excited that I was part of the community, excited that I found the game, and excited that I'm at least giving it a try. But the Fallout Vegas video? It has 3,000 hate comments. Listen, crazy thing is that I actually like Vegas a lot. I don't know. As a community, you guys need to realize that with the show, given the game's exposure, you cannot feel a certain way. When people have different opinions, that's their opinion. Did I say a few controversial things to get it started? Yes, I guess. I guess. But listen man, I just wanted to see it. And look, it came true. All the new Vegas fanboys came crawling out of Reddit all up in my comments. Do not believe everything you see on the internet.",

And you said, quote, it is not anti Semitic to hold you accountable for your actions. Senator, can't both things be true? There are legitimate criticisms of the Netanyahu government, but some of these protests have also clearly tapped into a deep undercurrent of antisemitism. Look, Donna, Anti Semitism is a vile and disgusting ideology which has resulted in the deaths of many, many millions of people in the last hundred years. And we got to oppose it in every form. And do I doubt for a moment that anti Semitism exists? That is growing in the United States? That is part that exists among some people in. In the protest movement, of course. But here is the reality right now. What Netya was right wing, extremist and racist government is doing is unprecedented in the modern history of warfare. They have killed in the last six and a half months 33,000 Palestinians, wounded 77,000, two thirds of whom are women and children. They have destroyed over 60%"

Cause if you are serious, I'm just gonna go ahead and say this. This is no disrespect, but that's. It's just really. It's not like they're forcing us to play for PlayStation. Plus, we don't have to do that. It's just created a PlayStation account. I already have a PlayStation account. Mine's already. This is one of those topics that I am oddly qualified to talk about. So if you don't know, I work in IT. I work specifically in a lot of secure locations. That's about all I'm going to say about the topic. And because of that, I have a lot of information and a lot of knowledge on why it is important to protect your data. And the reason I'm bringing that up is because Sony is notoriously bad with user data. But we'll get to the data stuff in a minute. And I just wanna say here, no hate to Japan. Amir, of course, me and him are mutuals. Uh, I just love having discourse with my mutuals. I think, uh, and having a discourse between your mutuals that's respectful is very good for the community. So I chose him as the person to stitch here. So the first thing I wanna talk about is how you say that you already have a PlayStation account and it's already linked. Well, simple Simple and easy. Not everybody has a PlayStation account, and not everybody wants a PlayStation account for this one game that they're going to play. That means they're going to get a bunch of emails and all of this different stuff. And you might say, oh, they can just create a new email and use that. What if they forget the information for that new email that they just created? And now they can't reset their password for the PlayStation account? And now they can't get into Hell Divers because it logged them out for some reason. Something else to think about is while it does say it on the steam page, it doesn't say it anywhere in the EULA and user license agreement. And that goes for the Hell Divers document I just showed you and Playstations only document for steam. Nowhere in this document does it say that you need to have a PlayStation Network account to play one of their properties. And wow, you always can be changed at any moment. And your agreement to that document is literally you booting up the game. It's a little weird for them to do some."

You guys really responded on the screen sharing aspect. Where you can play this on your screen. You said, well I want both screens on that TV. Well, that's super easy. First off, it's super easy to screen right over to your TV. But the issue is that it's one screen. You get the bottom screen right here. A lot of people don't like that. They want both screens up there. Understandable. Also, as far as the latency goes, there barely. I mean, I'm being honest, there's not a lot at all. First off, you can save as well. So look right there, you can save your game progress. You can put cheat codes in as you guys saw. But alright, all you do is you hit the settings button right here. You're gonna go all the way down until you see this right here. Nintendo DS gonna click right there and you're gonna put show top screen only. Now it's going to put both screens on there. Just like that, that quick. If you don't like it up and down, you can also have it horizontal. There you go. Which we will keep it like that for now. So you go there. Boom. Now you still have it on the bottom, so you can still scroll and look. Right here, but you have it over there as well. Look, there's a lot of new emulation stuff coming out for your phones, specifically iPhone on the App Store. And you can follow me right there to stay up to date because three DS is also coming soon. That's a little tip and trick. Honestly, this is amazing. So hit that follow button right there. And if you haven't, go to my bio. Delta game emulator is right there. And then we have a disco right here that talks about emulation and growing your own platform.",

All hell Divers two PC players on steam are now required to link their accounts to PlayStation Network. And that decision is going down about as well as you would think, with fans all across Discord, Reddit and X lashing out on PlayStation and Arrowhead threatening to abandon the game completely now. The whole reason for this big change, Sony says, is to protect players from griefing and abuse, and giving other players who were wrongfully banned the right to appeal, even stating that this was always planned to be in the game, but was delayed because of server issues at the time. Making matters even worse is that the FAQ on Sony's own support page contradicts all this, claiming that signing into PSN is optional when playing a PlayStation game on PC. Obviously now the rules have changed with the popularity of Helldivers too. How long you think now until Sony starts trying to charge PC players for PlayStation Plus to play online?",

You have gears of war. When did you ever think you would see that? You got Indiana Jones, a game that nobody cares about in Forza. And this is all coming from an insider. So most of this is probably true. Take it with a little bit of grain of salt, but man, this is crazy. Xbox is going to become a more stream like. Like, this is crazy. At least we're gonna get the games for affordable prices. You know, they're gonna have sales is more open to developers. So this is actually kind of a good. We're getting more of the beloved Xbox games on PlayStation. I actually like that. I do love that Sony isn't giving in. They aren't giving any of their first party games to Xbox because PlayStation is the king of the gaming world. We all know that we have the better exclusive games.

PlayStation Network accounts are free and easy to set up using this link. No, I will not be creating a PlayStation Network account. I have requested a refund for the game and I have changed my review to negative. That is not happening. This is not a troll, this is directly from them. I refuse to do this. No. Absolutely not. Not a little bit. Not at all. Not even one more. Steam will not refund you. Don't give it. I'm still putting in a refund request. I don't care if steam doesn't refund. I put in a refund request specifically because they are removing my access as a player. Unless I create a third party login account. I will be refunding. Whether steam says yes or not is up to steam. This is unacceptable. And yeah, you can see pretty quickly that the player base is not too happy about this. I expect this to get much worse real fast. I can't believe they did that. That's the dumbest thing I've seen a company do in a while. And to be real with you, the only reason that's happening is not for security. That's happening because PlayStation is the publisher. That has nothing to do with security whatsoever. You do not gain inherent security by tying this to a PlayStation Network account whatsoever. That is not inherent security to do so. If it was, then other PlayStation games wouldn't have as many cheaters as they have, which they do. So this is. This is not student"

    "voice_to_text": "Ever wonder what Nuka Cola Quantum tastes like in real life? Well, here's the official recipe. Mix together one cup of water, two cups of sugar, the zest of both a lemon and a lime for a burst of flavor in every glowing sip, two tablespoons of pomegranate juice and two tablespoons of fruit punch. Heat the mixture over medium flame, whisking until the sugar dissolves completely. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer gently for 10 minutes. Strain into a sealed container. Squeeze in fresh lemon juice and lime juice along with 1 teaspoon of citric acid for a tangy twist. Lastly, add 5 drops of neon blue food dye for that radioactive glow. Allow it to cool, cover tightly and refrigerate. Assemble with ice 9 tablespoons of the syrup and top with Seltzer water. Stir it up and voila! Your very own taste of the waistland awaits. Bottoms up!"

That is a lot of time in that world. I played this game over and over again. I played it on the different difficulties. I've played it on bunch of live streams. I've done speed runs. I've done no.

However, I do not believe in peaceful protest. Again, in my opinion, um, peace is a white man's word. We know that saying, and that saying is very true and alive. The reason why I don't believe in peaceful protest, however, I do go to peaceful protest and I'm okay with people having peaceful protest. I am not the one that is in charge of protests. However, I don't believe in peaceful protest because the people who are having peaceful protests will always be made out to be violent. People will always have. Such as what happened with the Zionist attacking the peaceful protesters and they got demolished, they got their face beaten in. Um, I don't believe in not fighting back. I believe that sometimes, and I think right now in this world, violence needs to be met with violence. I think we are seen as pushovers. And the reason why I say this is because I feel like a lot of, like, peaceful protests are LED by people, and then a lot of violent protests and those that are liberating are LED by people, black and brown people. And we always are subjugated to, um, having to suffer the consequences. Yet we are the ones who get the point across faster. We are the ones who understand that peace is A white man's, um. Uh, word. The ones who do peaceful protest are, to be honest, white. So it's hard to understand that. Saying that quote, um, I'm not against, you know, peaceful protest, I'm not. But in my opinion, I feel like we've gotten to the point in our lives where life, the world is in complete and utter shambles. We are watching the genocide happen. The world is not listening to us, we are not being listened to. Um, and I think it's time. I think it's time. But I think people need to be the ones at the front line at this point, because Zionists are the ones who are now taking and attacking people. Cause we are usually on the front line.",

What is wrong with y'all? Bro, genuinely, this was your chance to win us back, bro. You could have made up for this. This could have been the redemption our people have been begging for A new Batman Arkham game, and you guys make it a VR? At this point, put me on the phone with Warner Brothers. Bro, y'all are tweaking. You guys are getting too good at making stuff that we almost want. Imagine this game if it was a regular game in the Arkham series. They could have finally did Arkham Batman beyond. They beyond suit and Arkham Knight was so tough. Better yet, and what actually makes a lot more sense, we could have finally had fear toxin Batman. Imagine playing as for your toxin Batman. Look at this shit, bro. What if I saw this? I would never commit crime again. They could have gone crazy with the animations and had enemies running away from you. Oh my. I'm not saying that a VR game is gonna be bad. We haven't gotten gameplay. The trailer was just Batman chasing rats around the city. All I'm really saying is we don't want this shit. At this point, y'all are just using Arkham Batman to sell every other thing that's not Arkham. If that's how y'all kill this man, Off. Let him be dead, then. If you're gonna bring him back, bring him back right. For a real Arkham game. At this point, they just don't want money, bro. There's no way. I'm still not over them shooting down the Batman beyond movie. I didn't forget.",

    "voice_to_text": "Are you still playing Helldivers 2? Because they just made the game harder if you're playing solo or duos and the community is not happy. In the patch notes, Arrowhead said patrol spawning was increased when there are fewer than four players, but this was actually meant to correct a mistake. Arrow had released a statement in response saying that their intention was to always make the world feel more full, and that soul lobbies were previously experiencing 1 6 of the amount of patrols as four player lobbies, thus making them feel a little too empty. And the passion increases that amount to one fourth. So in conclusion, Helldivers 2 was unintentionally too easy for solo players, and now it's at the difficulty Arrowhead always intended. Is this latest past changing how you play or gonna change how you play? Let us know."

And this is tied directly to the next call of duty title that was gonna be called Black Ops go for. But it's looking like from this artwork, it's actually gonna be called Black Ops 5, so they're gonna keep the names going.

Just to give you an example, they did the same thing last year with Starfield Direct, and it was 45 minutes long. So that means we're gonna get 45 minutes or around that area. Brand new reveal for call of Duty Black Ops 5. What are your thoughts and opinions on this? Do you think this is a little too early for them to start revealing it? But once you get more information, I got you guys covered, so don't Forget to follow to stay up to date on all those call of duty news and updates!",

    "voice_to_text": "My gaming hot take for this week is more of a PSA, a call to action to return to the classics. Make sure you're going back and playing some old games. There's people getting into games all the time, coming in and playing their Fortnites, playing their, their war zones, playing their little battle royales. But I would assert that games are great now and they're fantastic, but I think that people need to do a better job of going back and playing pieces of history. I've experienced this over the last few years getting into retro collecting. I grew up on the PS two and in Onward. Going back and playing NES as NES games and N64 and older stuff and getting that more holistic view and more holistic experience with video games has made me so much better about understanding the overall medium and able to talk about in the way that I am right now and. And talk to you about it and have our platform or whatever. It's not about cred, though. It's just about really enjoying and. And really harnessing the whole picture of gaming. This last weekend, I played Guitar Man, Megaman 2, and I started manhunt, and that was an amazing weekend. But I'm also playing stuff like Stellar Blade and, uh, Final Fantasy 7 rebirth and getting the whole picture. And my opinions on those things are getting informed by the old things. So it is just a call to return to Retro. Even if it's a little bit difficult to get over the janky controls, get over how old some of these games look and play. You just played milligure solid for the first time. What an ugly game in comparison. But what great voice acting, what great cinematic experience that you can have with this game. I don't think you can fully understand cinematic gaming without playing the original Mill Gear Solid. And people will say that like that game is unplayable by today standards. You are out of your mind. That game is great. It plays fantastic. It's ugly, but it's amazing. Dude, I played it for the first time in 2023 and I think it's the 10th greatest game of all time that I've played. So return to retro. Go play some old games.",

    "voice_to_text": "So after the fiasco about breast jiggle physics, UM farm folks did post this kind of long winded apology. Just in case you didn't see what I was talking about or you don't feel like clicking through the video that I made on it. Literally yesterday, this was what they posted. It was an eight second long video of three different versions of breast jiggle physics, as they call it. They did say in this tweet that it was time for some serious game development talk, and they also said that this was a burning question. They also responded to their own Twitter post saying who wants to see 150%? Which is like, so much boob jiggle. I can appreciate the boobs are going to jiggle, and I can appreciate that you're putting, you know, like, a little bit of effort into an appropriate amount of boob jiggle in your characters, but I don't think that this was a thing that you needed to ask your community at all. This was asking for gross comments. Like, you had to. Like, I don't think you consulted with a single woman on your team before posting something like this. And then as far as the apology is concerned, I think that most of it is fine. It's your standard we fucked up apology. But the thing that bothers me about this apology is like, the first sentence of this is them saying that they've had people reach out concerned about The breast jiggle physics, which is why they posted this in the first place. No, you fucking didn't. Not who. Who. Who commented that? Who said that they were concerned about the lack of realism about boobs jiggling in a character in a cozy farming simulator? I don't. I don't believe I want proof of that. If they had just, like, not included that part of the apology, I think I might want to actually try this game again. But I don't know, something about, like, immediately passing this off to, like, will people ask for it just feels like you didn't actually care about any of this and you still quite don't understand why people are upset about this. Also, before the apology, after the original tweet, their community manager was apparently like, in their discord. I've seen the screenshots and stuff. I'm not in their discord, so I wasn't there to witness it personally, but their community manager just, like, didn't seem to get why people were upset about this and, like, really was doubling down a lot, and it just. It comes across as gross. So I'm still not into this game. Uh, to each their own. If you wanna try it when it comes out, by all means, please do. But, like, we're not hurting for farming simulators. We have so many to choose from, and I think I wanna choose one that has a team that maybe understands the type of people that will be Playing their game and like, how to not be weird about it, I guess.",

Oh, so it's basically one of the most advanced Tetris techniques in the whole entire world. Alright, so back in the 2, these are just hold the buttons left and right, but that was too slow. Yeah, so eventually we evolved to pressing it really fast, maybe like 10 to 15 times a second. But even that got too slow. So player named Cheese Fish invented a technique called rolling. Or basically, you put your thumb on the D pad and push the controller into your thumb. And this way you can get five fingers on the controller into the D pad really fast. And this can lead to really fast excessive inputs at over 30 hertz a second. 30 times? Wait, yeah, but I don't think that really looks like 30 times a second. Well, it's not actually 30 times a second, but the pace that I'm going at results in 30 times in a second if you extrapolate the data on the game. Yeah, yeah, we're actually smart and think about that. So wait, people just all use this now or something? Yeah, pretty much every major player uses the rolling technique now in NES Tetris tournaments. Hmm. I see. In the glove. What's that for? So basically this reduces friction. Cause if I'm rolling without a glove, it's easy to get caught. And for my hands, To get sweaty. But if I'm wearing a cotton glove, it actually glides really fast. Oh, okay. Thank you, bro. Yeah, no problem, bro."

From all the comments that I've received lately is people are not happy with Nintendo. So I'm wondering what will get you to buy their next console. If you took all my bias away, I would really just be looking at the games. I would need a new Mario Kart or a new 3D Mario to come out with the system. Or heck, even a new Zelda game, because the games are really what makes Nintendo great. Would being as powerful as a steam deck be enough? Or a more customizable experience like themes or music on the e shop. Or, you know, an online that actually works with voice chat in all the features that the other systems already have. I'm gonna buy it no matter what because I'm a Nintendo fanboy. They could sell me a rock that just says Nintendo Switch to on it and I'd. I'd buy it for whatever. Whatever they're charging. I'd buy it. But I'll be really interested to see how they come off of the success of the Nintendo Switch.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, what are some signs that a video game might suck? If the game's focus is graphics over gameplay, most likely. It's a L bro. Trust me, nobody cares about a pretty looking game that plays like shit. For example, I played this game recently and my favorite thing about it was the story because the gameplay was ass. Oh but them graphics. Beautiful. But then the exact opposite happened with rise of the Ronin because it looks like a late gym PS three game. But that gameplay. Chef kiss. I ain't gonna lie to you. If I see the words Ubisoft or EA and some folks would say but there's the two. But after they gave me high five rush, I don't know if I can hate on them right now. Here's another one when the trailer shows zero gameplay, is this for a movie or video game? Especially if it's for a brand new IP? Cause we don't even trust you yet. GTA 6 trailer show no gameplay, but it didn't need to because it's GTA. Meanwhile, I still don't trust Phantom Blade Zero because I have yet to see some gameplay. Trailer look crazy though. I ain't gonna lie, but without the gameplay I don't trust it. Another one is if it's an easily identifiable copycat. Like if I can clearly see you trying to cash in on another game swag, I don't know if I can fuck with you bro. Cause long gone are the days Of true crime, streets of LA and Sleeping Dogs. We trusted the GTA clones back in the day, but nowadays cut that out. And lastly, free to play. Is it always a L? No because Fortnite still going strong. However, nine times out of 10 that the game is free to play, you gonna be paying a lot of money still. You are finna be micro transaction to all be damned. All for a game that probably ain't all that great. Y'all know the rules man. Comment below and tell me some more signs that a video game might be trash."

And before you yell blasphemy, just know I've been to more Sunday services and youth groups than I can count. But right now I'm not too worried about my own salvation when I'm driving by homeless, intense cities every day, knowing that my 25 thousand dollar tax payment this year went to wars and death. I think god is a gamer and we all live in a save file that he abandoned a long time ago. No shade to the church, but I don't have a shiny collection plate. What I do have is a willingness to work hard to start a business, to post my life on social media, to tattoo myself for viral views and TikTok live gifts. To film the battery and the most intimate moments with my fiance and post them all for sale. Cause none of this gets built without money. And I don't know if you've noticed, but everything's unaffordable. Corporate agreed with political backing is buying up all of our residential real estate just to rent it back to us at a profit. So I don't really care what Jesus would Do I'll stoop to any level to say fuck the people at the top of this human food chain",

And I'm some money with a white leg horn to make a chicken called. Who knows the name of it? It's called a zombie chicken. Okay. What's really cool about these, I am Somanis, is they have a gene called fibromelanosis. What that means is everything is black about this bird. I'm talking about not only the feathers, the meat, the skin, the comb, the waddles, the feet, the toenails. Everything about this bird is black. Which really cool is you could cross it to that white leg horn and you're gonna get a bird that's mostly white feathered with black features. Okay? Feathers I consider primary feature, secondary features we're talking about the waddles, the comb, the feet, the toenails. If you can get a White Bird to have those black fiery melanosis features, that's incredible. I have about 18 in the barn and I wanna go ahead and show you those. Now introducing zombie chicken. How cool is that? Feet black, waddles coming in black, comb black. Look at that, it's white, got some black stocks on it. And this bird's incredible. It lays like a white leghorn cause that's its mother. It's gonna lay a large to a jumbo white egg almost daily. And it's got really, really, really cool genes to it. You there are other breeds out there to Make a zombie chicken. But you're gonna wanna want these two to be the most productive. The Leghorn lays almost every single day. So if you wanna get the bank for your buck and make these zombie chickens, grab yourself I'm smani rooster, white leg horn and an incubator and have some fun.",

Stop by the tavern to see the damage from last night. We went wild. Last night was a painting, bro. After that, filmed a quick music video. Stop by my boys to run a quick pod. Then I bagged out some tik toks in the town square. She's a 10, but she's got no dowry. Her dad's poor. Does she love to tavern? She loves to tavern. She's a bloody winch. Then to finish the day off, met my boys at the tavern. Fired off some pigeon chats. You know how it is. After a day grinding, you gotta just treat yourself a little bit. So I had a good time. Not a lot of maidens came out tonight. So I thought about hitting the brothel. I really got to start duck at pinching. I didn't mind watching my boys get after it though. Got a little too slosh, so my boys wouldn't give me my reins. Don't let that man have his reins. He's got my reins. It sucks cause I ride better drunk. But you know, they're just Looking out. After that, I walked home. And that's all she wrote. Then I'll run it back again tomorrow. Don't forget to follow your boy, yo",

    "voice_to_text": "Just a friendly reminder that Sony and Microsoft have both played with the idea of putting in game ads in your favorite video games. And I want you to understand something. The only thing that's keeping them from doing this are people that are hitting them with all the backlash. Like, understand that they have been trying to do this ever since the last Street Fighter game. I remember when that game was coming out and they played with the idea of all the loading screens were gonna be ABS, but they immediately ran that shit back. But understand, they play with this idea all the time. Put it in the perspective how out of touch some of these developers are. Let's look at a little guy from EA. This guy was an executive at EA seeing over battlefield, and this fucking guy had the idea of charging for magazines mid gunfight. And guess what? The reasoning that he gave for charging per magazine like that, that is him saying this is that there will be less by your hesitancy when they're about to win a gunfight. Dog, the entirety of gaming will be cooked. Understand, I'm okay with paying $70 for a good gaming experience, but putting fucking ads in a video game is insane. Like, imagine we went through all the tech of getting rid of loading screens only for them to have fucking commercials. Even if you're playing through the Kratos verse 4 fight and you're having The time of your life. You are fully immersed. You are getting into it. Then right when this happened, BK, I swear to all that is holy, if we get to the point that I have a Burger King ad in between my boss battle, we're done. Understand? If they could do it, they would. Two years ago, it was unheard of for you to have to pay for ABS on a streaming platform. Now that's the standard, dog. One of the first micro transactions in gaming was horse armor. That was $2. Now call of duty has micro transactions that cost more than the fucking game. You know, we're entering a slippery slope that, I'm afraid where it leads."

I'll go first. I was very excited for this game. The trailers made me excited. It looked really good. It looked like what I wanted it to be like. They marketed this so well, and then the game release and is like, what am I playing? That game would be Resident Evil 6. Capcom marketed this thing so hard, and they knew what they were doing with the marketing. They didn't show us the rest of the game when this got announced. The only thing they showed us was Leon's campaign. And they're like, oh, this is a return to form. This is what fans have been asking for. We're going back to how things used to be. And they tricked us by showing Leon's campaign, because Leon's campaign had zombies in it. And on top of that, Leon's campaign was darker, and it had more of the horror atmosphere that we wanted in Resident Evil. Lies. Complete lies. When I play the game, I was like, what the fuck is that? As always, leave your comments and stitch and make sure you guys are following. I'm trying to hit 50,000 followers. I'm very close. I need to get to that 50,000 Mark. Help me out here.

    "voice_to_text": "Question for you guys. What's a game that you will not ever play again? Doesn't necessarily mean it needs to be a bad game that you never play again. But what's a game that you won't ever play again? Here's my answer. And don't forget to go ahead and stitch this video so that way I can see your comments and your responses and all that. And leave comments so I can read the comments, cause I'd love to see those. And make sure you follow for more as we're trying to hit the 50,000 Mark. Game that I won't ever play again. And it's not because it's a bad game, it's because I don't want to ruin the experience that I had playing the game. And this is because the type of game that it is, it's a decision based game. You make decisions in this game and it affects your playthrough and affects your ending within the game. So the way that I see these type of games is that your first playthrough is your truest playthrough. Everything after that is just you trying to get achievements or trying to see the different paths that you could potentially take. So the game that I'm talking about is life is strange. I'm not playing this again. I love this game so much. I will not play this again. I got the ending that I got. I saved the town. Those you guys who know who played the game understand The sacrifice that I made to save the town. I cried so much on live stream. Like ugly crying on live stream during that moment. And I cried after the live stream. Mourning the loss that I took in that game. I won't play it again because I don't need to. I know the choices and I don't need to make the other choice to to get it. I. I don't. So yeah, I won't ever play it again. Don't forget to stitch, leave comments and hit that follow.",

During the most recent update, Fortnite brought back the Tactical AR, a new Nike collab, Billie Eilish appearance, and more. But this update also comes with some controversy. Under the social privacy menu, you'll now find a new see confrontational emotes setting. And when enabled, instead of user actually seeing the emote, instead they'll see the player who is emoting just standing still with no emote sound. Many players have been complaining about how sweaty and toxic Fortnite has become, so epic says that they're doing this because they want emotes to be a source of good vibes. This new setting applies to the laugh it up emote, whip crack, make it plantain, and the iconic take the out. It's also safe to say that we likely won't be getting any new confrontational emotes in Fortnite anytime soon."

    "voice_to_text": "We're in the middle of a mental health crisis, but Nashville has this place where if you're arrested you can get mental health help. It's something they're trying to create all around the country, but we found ours is almost always empty. Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall spearheaded the Behavioral Care Center -  tired of seeing mentally ill people locked up - he used money from his jail budget to build a treatment facility inside the jail. Daily jail logs reveal  the BCC has 60 beds, but many times over the last year only about 15 of those were filled. Some days the program had as few as 10 participants, meaning 50 beds in the highly touted program were sitting empty. And that's very concerning it runs at about 20% occupancy at best. Judge Melissa Blackburn oversees Davidson County's Mental Health Court. After seeing the numbers, she thinks there's room to help more people. NewsChannel 5 Investigates questioned Judge Blackburn about this man, Johnson Lloyd, who sat in the Davidson County Jail for nearly a year waiting on a mental health evaluation. When he was finally found incompetent, he was released. He then went up to Bowling Green, where he was arrested for raping a woman. I know they do not take dangerous individuals or very difficult individuals, but he may have been someone once medicated, he may not have been. Why are there so many empty beds? So it was never targeting to solve the mental health problem, and all the people who complain about bed counts, I wish they would call me. Some do, here's what I would tell you, you weren't around helping me design what we needed. So are you disappointed that it's only about 20 to 30% full? No it only is designed to treat a certain type mental illness. The sheriff says the center cannot treat severely mentally ill people. There are no locks on the doors. It's designed for people who need basic help like getting back on their meds  to keep them out of the criminal justice system. But projections from years ago when it was being built, calculated half of everyone arrested would qualify for the BCC and it's beds would be full. The sheriff says arrests are down dramatically. When he planned the BCC, he says 100 people a day were being arrested. That number went down during covid and it's not gone back up. He says now 60 people a day are arrested. The sheriff says it's up to the state to build more hospitals to treat the severely mentally ill. But I wanna know what you think.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, what's a video game that would have been perfect had it not been for that one thing? I'm talking everything in the game checked out for you, was almost there, but it just. Something threw it off man. Because LA Noir did not need to be open world at all. Overall story, the game was extremely linear and straight to the point. The open world added nothing of value to the game. Overall it's pretty big and nice, but there was nothing there. Listen, if you play the story of this game straight through and you do nothing else, I promise you you didn't miss nothing. Next I got Cyberpunk 2077. No, I'm not talking about the launch at all. They fix that and redeem themselves. There's no point in bringing it up over and over again. What ruined it for me was the fact that it was a first person shooter. I don't understand the point of me creating a character if I can't see him. The game is fire. Bragging like cook when they made this game. But if this game was a third person shooter, not a first person shooter. Not gonna lie, probably would have been a 10 out of 10 for me. Personally, I think Batman Arkham Knight is in the Mount Rushmore of superhero games. But them Batmobile missions made me wanna jump off a cliff. Dog, I swear I hate it driving that damn thing. I don't know if everybody else feels That way, but for me personally, I hated it. Bro, Arkham Asylum in Arkham City did perfectly fine without that damn Batmobile. Also, Tsushima, while an absolute masterpiece, had one of the most boring and empty open worlds I've ever experienced. Exactly why I don't like open world games like that. Bro, just let me do the story. Might get mad at me in the comments because I'm talking about your beloved ghost of Tsushima, but I gotta be honest. Bro. Lastly, Jedi fall. In order fight the countless bugs and glitches that was in this game. This game hands down has one of the worst map systems I've ever played. And that no fast travel was cooked. But again, had you going all the way to the back of the map doing what you gotta do. And you had to travel all the way back on foot. A lot of you breath. It wasn't for YouTube I probably would never beat this shit. Colorado. Great game. Replay value though. In the trash. So y'all tell me, what are some games that you think were almost perfect had it not been for that one thing?",

Bro what the fuck is this guys had me on board with this game. The first trailer came out like a year ago. I was hyped. At this point, being a Star Wars fan is no different than being a call of duty fan. You grew up on this shit, you're probably gonna give it a chance every time something comes out. And when the shit does come out, you're probably gonna be disappointed. Look, I'm not saying the game is gonna be bad. It could have great gameplay. I don't know yet. Like I said, the first gameplay trailer that dropped a year ago. I liked what I saw. But this is a single player story game with three different price points. And a battle pass bro why? Standard edition comes with the base game. Thank god. At least we still get that for 70 bucks. Old edition gives you 3 days early access. And a season pass. Again, why the fuck is there a season pass with this game? The ultimate. The Ultimate Edition comes with a season pass. Rogue infiltrator bundle A savac shark? What the fuck even is that? Petty and bring up helldivers 40 dollar price tag again, but I'm not gonna do it. Instead I'm gonna use god of wars my example. This game had a deluxe edition too. Ten more dollars, bro. That's it. There was no season pass. You just got all this cosmetic stuff and there's a lot more stuff to get. And they fucked around and dropped a whole ass DLC for free. This right here. Back this up, bro. We're done with this shit. We done with the 90. There's so much content and stories to be told in Star Wars, bro. It should be easy as hell. Bro, A game like that does not need a battle pass. That trailer definitely did some damage to my height, but let me know what you guys think.",

Here's everything you need to know. A big part of this game is making your own home. You'll build a chicken leg cottage and decorate the insides as you wish. You'll need somewhere nice and cozy to keep all those witchy recipes. The open world looks like a gorgeous autumnal land where you'll find and pick ingredients with which to brew your magical crafts. Better yet, you can discover animals that you can tame and bring home with you. The character customization. You can change your skin, your hair, your face, and your clothes, but you play as the same character. This is something they may develop later on, since the game is coming out in early access. And this isn't just an empty sandbox. As you explore the procedurally generated world, you'll discover settlements where villagers can ask you for help. They'll give you quests, and you can choose to help them or to hinder them. So will you be a good witch or a bad witch? The game is called Riker and we should be getting it this year on PC. Would you like to see it come to consoles? Tag that one witchy friend in the comments and follow for updates!"

This makes a lot of sense because we have the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 coming out with shadow as the antagonist. We have the video game Sonic X Shadow Generations, which was also announced earlier this year. If you go on the Sonic the Hedgehog website they have this whole page about shadow and cool facts and how cool he is and shadow is that cool. Other than the one game of Sonic X Shadow Generations and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie with shadow, what other shadow content do we think we'll see from Sega? Could be more games, movies, and shows, or just merch. I really hope it's more games because he's a video game character. Personally I'm hoping for shadow the Hedgehog 2 with more shadow, more guns, and more just edginess from the early 2.",

Things were gyrating, okay? Like grown women were on their feet hooting and hollering at the AMC and flashing the screen while their Diet Coke and popcorn with M and m's in it were, like, spilling over. This was revolutionary, this. Nothing like this will happen cinematically, I, I don't think ever again. You know what I mean? Like you saw those clips of when the Spider Man's all came together. No, no, that was child's play compared to what this did. And I think about it frequently."

The only souls like game that I really, really rock with was lies A. P. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a challenge, but damn, some shit is just too much for me. I command all my elder ring players as a huge, huge fan of GTA. I just cannot get with GTA online at all. And I tried. I've tried so many times. It's just not my thing bro. Dark cars, the micro transactions. It's just. I don't know bro. The mission is been milked to all be damned and that's really what turns me off. Care what nobody say. We could have been got GTA 6 had it not been for GTA Online. I'm putting these next ones together as one cause usually they have the same kind of community, but 2K and call of duty please respectfully go to hell. Again, no disrespect to anybody who likes any of these games. I just don't understand why I love paying for the same game every single year with nothing different. This next one. I ain't gonna lie. Y'all might slander me for this one, but breath of the wild and tears of The Kingdom. Sorry, can't ride with it. Never really been a huge fan of Zelda games anyway. Except for the 164. That shit was clutch. But everybody loves these games. And I remember during The Game Awards, everybody just knew that tears of the Kingdom was gonna take it, and it didn't. I ain't saying that it didn't deserve a chance to win, but when it didn't win, I didn't really give a damn. Now this next game is gonna be a throwback for my OG gamers. Kingdom Hearts. Never really fucked with it, bro. Everybody growing up love Kingdom Hearts, and I was like the eyeball out of the bunch, cause I was just like, I guess in no hate towards anybody who like the game. It's just not my thing, bro. So y'all tell me, what are some games that everybody else loves, but you personally, you just don't fuck with like that?",

It seems the FBI and the department of Homeland Security are gonna be partnering with gaming companies to fight extremist gamers. Sorry, call of duty fans. Government Accountability Office says that the FBI and DHS should use the same strategy that allow them to police extremism on social media to regulate the gaming industry. And the Anti Defamation League Super Reputable says that 20% of adult gamers and 15% of kids playing games report being exposed to white supremacy while gaming. What constitutes extremism, you may ask? Racially or ethnically motivated violence, anti government or anti authority sentiments, animal rights or environmental extremism if you're pro life, apparently. And all other domestic terrorism threats, which the FBI has already said includes going to church on Sunday. This is super constitutional."

I don't mean men who support women's rights, I mean men who make a show about it and actively talk about how feminist they are. Because it's almost never genuine and either at best a desperate attempt to get into a woman's pants, or at worst hiding their darker nature. Boy moms. This classmate became a mom a couple of months ago to a baby boy and I think he was maybe 1 month old and she was already posting about how he belongs to her and no girl would be enough. Every once in a while she posts things like that. Being persistent, not just asking where someone lives, but after the person tells them the general brought her area where they live, the questioner then Asks them to be more specific"

The Hail Davas 2 community wants the dares to add melee weapons to the game, with many believing the addition will help them further in their fight for Super Earth. One of the players had posted and read it the number of melee kills they had gotten, jokingly saying they won't stop until the devs add a proper melee weapon. Currently the only melee options players have at their disposal is their gun, which can be used to blungeon enemies. Somebody said a swore for quick slash and through mobs and a hammer for cracking armor would be extremely democratic. Joke. One player somebody says sometimes all the aliens need is a good bunk, but the butt of the gun ain't satisfying enough. Reply one comment to give me a hammer or a fucking lightsaber. It's important to note that the dev still have loads of content from Hell Divers. One to add with the illuminate Faction and Sabres amongst the most hype additions. After all, Sabres were usable. And Hell Divers one proven grounds unique missions where players could try out new gear. Yeah, they need to go ahead and bring all that old content over to the new game. Man, I need to go ahead and do that shit ASAP. We need All the swords, all the hammers, whatever melee ideas they could think of, we need that shit. I would love to see something like the gravity hammer from Halo inside of Hill Davas. That would be fire. Y'all let me know what y'all think, man. Do we need melee weapons in Hill Davas, too?"

Then stand in the video and jump into a cannonball and then land on your feet. We're just using the free features in CapCut. On the clip of your cannonball, hit remove BG, Auto Removal. If there's any spots that messed up, like in mind you can see the tree for a little bit. Just scroll through the footage and see if there's any mistakes. Then in remove BG we're gonna hit custom removal and select eraser and then you can just cover over what you don't wanna see, like the tree. Now the clip that looks pretty good. It's me with no background. Tap on that clip to select it and then hit overlay and drag it in front of your blank background. Go to the moment right before you start tucking, and you're gonna hit on that keyframe diamond to save the position. And then go right before you start untucking and you're gonna rotate this with two fingers all the way around in the 3 60. So now I do a full backflip, but it looks weird cause I'm rotating around the middle of the frame, not around the middle of my body. So to make it look good, we need to use a reference video. So insert a clip of you doing a backflip for real. And this is gonna replace Your blank background. So now you can see where the body should be during each part of the flip. Now it's a piece of cake. Whenever you see that your body is going off of the reference video, just rotate it. And since it key frames are turned on, it's gonna save each of these positions. Take your time. And then this is the final result."

Got portable vrs that are super realistic now. I'm staying away from them things for at least right now. Ready Player One showing me a lot when it came to VR. I don't know, I don't think we're ready for that stuff. And when it comes to these new handheld gaming system, not only do they give you better graphics, they give you better games. Two reasons why you should leave the switch for the children. Because that's the thing with the Nintendo Switch. All of his games are made for kids. And I know someone's gonna say, wait a minute. All the games 99.2% in. And it's something weird about a 38 year old man playing Kirby. It's just something weird about that. And of course, this is no knock towards Nintendo, because look, bro, they. They boom me like Metro. When I was working at Best Buy, the Nintendo Switch ran sakuras around PC, Xbox, and Sony. I'm telling you. My manager used to always say, women and kids make businesses rich. But hey, this is just my opinion. At my big age of 31, I don't need to play the Nintendo Switch.

Now, when I'm thirsty, the process is I go and obtain some fluid. I then ingest said fluid and all is well. Let me introduce you to the ADHD drink trifecta. Gonna talk you through it now. So firstly, we've got one drink for energy. Uh, in the Pokemon cup we've got coffee. Uh, that can also be an energy drink. Um, and actually it can also have the opposite effect on some ADHD people. We've then got one drink for flavour. Now this can be any real flavour you like. As you can see here, we've gone for a carbonated sugar free Apple Tango. Actually does sound delicious. And thirdly, we've just got some water for hydration. That looks like fizzy water. She's obviously in a spicy mood."
