black person in America it is so dehumanizing to get on my phone every single day and just scroll scroll scroll and don't get me wrong I don't see I don't scroll past a single atrocity that comes across my for you page every single one gets some kind of engagement from me it'll never fit whether it be Kongo Sudan Palestine t grey you name it I'm giving it my attention of some capacity someone I'm going to be putting my energy into it nothing gets past me without me trying to engage with it with that being said the amount of time and energy I have to put into seeking out African content versus Palestinian content exclusively right now upsetting dehumanizing even even more so when like I probably for like maybe every five Palestinian videos I see I might see the DRC and then I'll maybe every like every five Palestinian videos three DRC videos I might see one 2 damn video and then every once in a while I'll see something about like Cameroon t grey some other place that's experiencing atrocity I see more about Palestine than I see about cop cities here in America and we've been talking about Cop City for years now like I just don't know like y'all can't expect respectfully you cannot expect black people to be wanting to stay this committed to global liberation specifically in the case of Palestine and then you can't even turn around and give a a reshare and a comment and a follow to people that are talking about what's going on in African countries or black Americans cause for some reason when are we often talk about the fact we don't talk about black America like I don't know why everybody suddenly thought black America was okay as if we're not still suffering we are silently suffering and I'm and I'm gonna say silently because like it is pretty much silent y'all have isolated us on our own communities you give us no media attention you give us no actual like ability to amplify our own voices when we do go outside we're pepper sprayed we're arrested we're detained what are we to do you know and then when we claim complain about it y'all say racism is over or you say you have Dei now why are you still talking please eat your scraps and shut up before I put you in a cage again like I don't know what we're supposed to do but it's disingenuous to believe that black people are gonna stay committed like for the long haul to advocating for Palestinian people and non black people atrocities when y'all don't even give a fraction of the attention to black people and their suffering you have black neighbours who are going through nonsense and like struggle on a daily basis and you're scared to even engage with them but you can spend hours and hours posting videos of you standing in front of a video playing a sound that's dedicated to Palestine or you can repost a bunch of things or you can put a little watermelon next to your name on all of your social media platforms but you can't you can't do anything to talk about the DRC meanwhile the DRC gives you the lifestyle that you choose to live on a daily basis you can't talk about Sudan like we this whole like we always say everything is connected but y'all aren't y'all aren't marinating with that and it's bothering me and I know I know for white people it's like to come to terms with it and recognise that like you are complicit and like the silence means you're also perpetuating the silence and the harm but as sometimes you gotta move past it like black people like the black people that are genuinely doing the work and fighting the good fight and trying to like educate and liberate people they I promise you I know you think that we're all gonna be angry at you because you've taken so long to wake up but we're not I promise we we are not worried about that at that point we are not trying to stay mad at people for eternity on end we have so many better things to be talking about you why would I care to be mad at you why what do I gain from being mad at you and holding animosity towards you cause you decided to take 22 years decide to start talking about black struggle what does that gain what what does that do for the conversation like I just think I think that like y'all genuinely just think black people are just waiting for y'all to mess up so we can like jump on you and attack you but it's the polar opposite the most we want is for you to speak up and say something and maybe it is something that's like a little ignorant a little like baseless but then we can at least call you in and maybe you've had bad experiences with people you have said something stupid or you said something that is ignorant or just like not factual and then you've had a black person or a person of colour call you racist and maybe that put you back in your shell but I promise being racist is the least of your worries it is like being labeled a racist only serves your white comfort because the only person that you're worried about being the only reason you're worried about being called a racist sorry my nose is so running the only reason you're worried about being called a racist is because you don't want other people to you don't want other white people to hear you being called a racist by a person of color or a black person or an indigenous person cause guess what if a black person calls you racist and then another black person hears it they're not like damn they're like that tracks very likely moving on how do we change this how do we like improve the situation anyway like we don't care like most of us are most of us that have most of us that have a good heart it's gonna be it's gonna this is gonna gonna sound very like mind boggling but most black people that have empathy and are actually about global liberation we already are with the notion that you are racist and we're just simply tryna have you unlearn that most of us aren't waiting for you to do a racist thing the presumption is that you are racist is and if you're not outwardly racist racist we are assuming you're racist because you're probably complicit and you're silence and you're probably leaning into your comfort and you think that you being pro Palestine or you bring pro anything that's not somebody black you think that that alleviates you from needing to do any other work elsewhere but it's like no you still have to you still have to go the extra mile and just because Palestinians aren't saying bring up black voices doesn't mean you still shouldn't connect the two situations just because people here in the United States are still talking about Cop City doesn't mean are saying like hey you should also like just because they're not saying go talk about the d R C doesn't mean you still shouldn't like these things do still all matter just because just because queer people are saying like talk about queer rights doesn't mean that isn't them also saying don't talk about black people like all these things black people are integral to every movement every single one sorry this is such a long video but I'm I'm getting genuinely exhausted I'm getting exhausted from not seeing my people and I know my people are hurting loudly and it's not a silent genocide it's not like a silent anything like it might be suppressed we might be silenced you got the reference you get my point"

It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in the sky. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls insurrection to storm the capital. Patriots! Patriots! If re elected, he wants to pardon, quote every one of them. Let me ask you, what do you think it would have done on January 6th if black Americans had stormed. Think about this. What they would have happened if black Americans had stormed the capital. I don't think he'd be talking about pardons. It's the same guy wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five guilty even though they were exonerated. He's that landlord who denies housing application because of the color of your skin. He's that guy who won't say Black Lives matter and invokes neo Nazi third right terms we all remember. Trump is the same guy who unleashed birthism, the birth of his lie against Barack. Thank you, President Joe Biden, for pointing out how racist Donald Trump and his supporters are. You all know it. If black folks would have assaulted The democracy the way you Trump supporters did. You would have demanded they bring the electric chair if it was Barack Obama who did. You would have insisted they take the electric chair to the White House. So spare me this fake outrage you got about oh, doing a little jail time. You're all a bunch of liars and hypocrites. Addition is treasonous traitors! Trump supporters, get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready cause Jack Smith and funny Willis and Leticia James and Alvin Bragg. Haha, that's funny! Are coming for you. It's over. MAGA.

    "voice_to_text": "What the fuck going on here? I beg your finest party. Y'all heard about Project 2025, huh? Huh? Have y'all been keeping your answer the streets? Roll the footage! Roll the footage! Project 2025 is a far right manifesto. It is a 1,000 page bucket list of extremist policies that would uproot every government agency and disrupt the lives of every person who calls this country home. The Department of education would be eliminated, cutting students off from civil rights protections and ending essential Title 1 funding for K through 12 schools. Every child has a right to an education, goddamn it, and I'm standing on it. Like, I don't think. I don't think I really understand what's going on here. They really trying to cut funding for schools, K through 12 school? Like, do y'all not understand Title 1 funding? Do y'all not know how many kids are gonna be affected by that? Now, understand, these are policies and priorities for the next conservative president. The mandate outlines policy priorities for the next conservative president. Is that correct? It does. You've done a great job. I just want to let you know. I gotta listen. Y'all gotta understand what's going on here. They are trying to eliminate the entire department of education. The whole thing gone. It calls for eliminating the department of education, eliminating the department of Commerce. Project 2025 recommends abolishing department of education, whose programs would either be transferred to other government agencies or terminated. Scientific Research would receive federal funding only if it suits conservative principles. Now, when I was trying to stress to y'all how bad it was with y'all kids not knowing shades, y'all was calling people trying to have me terminated. Now they trying to terminate the whole department of education. Are y'all calling them? Y'all calling up? I just wanna know. Y'all calling up there? I just wanna know. Yeah, we gotta do better by our kids. We have to do better by our kids, cause they're not trying to do better by our kids. They don't give a fuck about our kids. The link is in the bio summer intensive curriculum coming out for third through 8th grade next week. I'm telling you, y'all, we have to do better by our kids, cause they do not give a fuck about our kids. I'm telling you, they trying to cut out the whole department of education on how these kids gonna learn. Who gonna teach them? Also, get out and go vote, y'all see what they want for the next conservative president. So get out and go vote. That's what you want? God, do you? Do you? But that's not what I want.",

I'm sorry, but it has to be said, these older women who are in their 40s, 50s, even 60s, wanna be seen so bad and want attention that they are in competition with these younger girls. These women wasted their years, wasted their youth, and are doing any and everything to be seen. And they're not teaching the young girls. So instead of teaching the young girls to do better, you're trying to compete with her. You are in denial that you're getting older. You're doing things with your body, driving for attention, over sexualizing yourself at that age, all because you don't wanna accept the fact that you mess up your life. They don't have husbands, which they really wanted. They're realizing that, oh, wow, I'm at an age where nobody's checking for me. The men are not checking for me at 50, 60 years old. Unfortunately, they're looking at the younger women who do desire marriage, who do desire to have children, who are not just out here. So instead of. Again, I'm gonna try to find a way to be seen and encourage the young girls to do what I'm doing, because I don't want them to. To surpass me. That's what's actually happening. These older women are sitting around telling the young girls, no, girl, live your life, do you? Because you're intimidated by her. You don't want her to do better than You. You don't want her to have a chance? You want the chance because you see the. The men are looking at the younger girls, that the men are more attractive and. And more desirable of the younger women. And it's sad. This. This is the reality of where we are. The older generation is jealous and intimidated and in competition with the younger generation. And it's unfortunate.",

difficult we don't look at us as high class the interesting thing for me of course we look at Spanish pretty low class especially if we think you're from Mexico South American Spanish we look at a little more high class um and Portuguese you know everything from Brazil we look at as sexy but that's its own kind of fetishization um but what was interesting was when I was be in public speaking Portuguese to my daughter and people would look at us and immediately say oh is it French and I would say no it's Portuguese and I'm like oh you're from Portugal so I had to start saying all of the time Brazilian Portuguese and then every once in a while some would be like isn't it just called Portuguese and I'm like yes but you know otherwise people just go to like the white country that speaks Portuguese even though it's much smaller right but then something really started standing out to me amidst this hierarchy of language was that people were so so impressed when my little white blonde child spoke multiple languages and I like at first it's great you know like every mom likes to be commended on their child and told their child is so cool but people would go on and on and on about how cool it was and these are white people right because obviously she's speaking Portuguese and Spanish so Brazilian people appreciate that Hispanic people appreciate it right it was this great cultural bridge on the one side for white Americans it was unexpected and so they were very surprised and very kind of complimentary about it and after you know by the time my child is about three I just gotta start looking at people and being like but do you compliment kids with brown skin this much when they're bilingual or trilingual cause somehow I just don't think you're that impressed by it right and then there was like the flip side of that and remember I was talking about this one day how impressed people were with my kid and a friend of mine who was an officer in the army and she's a black woman and her mom is a white woman from Germany so she speaks fluent German it's her mother tongue and people are so shocked so it's like the opposite right people see a black woman and they do not expect her to speak a high class language like German so just another little thing as we're thinking about all the stereotypes and programming and stuff that we've had one of the best tips I've ever had which I keep repeating on this series is just pay attention to where you're surprised because when you're surprised by something about someone that's usually because the stereotype of whatever they look or present like was in your head it's kind of like when people tell me they're so surprised that I'm a cult survivor they're like oh you don't seem like a cult survivor and it almost feels like when people are like oh you're one of the good ones and it's like what do you think about cult survivors like you're going to a stereotype and that's why you're so surprised that I'm one I also get this as a woman veteran right people are so surprised because they don't expect soldiers to be women and they don't especially don't expect soldiers to be feminine forward presenting women and so they'll be surprised and this has been one of my things that I've really clung to as I am deprogramming deconstructing what I was taught under the myth of white supremacy was just you know I'm awoke from that cult I don't wanna be a part of it but I've been programmed under it for decades so it's gonna take time to find all these things and get them out of my life and my practice and so the whole see what surprises you has been one of the I think the most useful tips and then once you figure something out talk about it to your white friends because a lot of the stuff I've been talking about so many black people have been like all the time this is all the time and a lot of the stuff is stuff that I figured out I never heard it from anyone else so we need to be talking about it to our white friends did you know that we take up the whole sidewalk did you know that we don't you know compliment brown black children for speaking multiple languages the way we do for white children like do you know etcetera etcetera right I think it's just something we can all do to change our little part of this system because we didn't start it but we do benefit from it thanks",

Now, I honestly was very happy that I saw people walking away from this damn rally. That people were not paying attention because he's a freaking blow heart. But I was expecting a riot. I was expecting a pushback. I was expecting kind of protesters. Where you at? Why you even allow this man to step foot in the Bronx? He don't like you. It's a damn shame.

    "voice_to_text": "This is Jasmine, not Jasmine. This is how mixed kids are raised to think they better than black people. This is why Queen Nausea was hopping on that video one time with Chris and was like, oh, girls was bullying me because my. I had good hair and they didn't have long hair, so they. They hated me for my hair. Don't get me wrong, no hate to the little girl. She is precious. Her hair is long, luxurious. But I don't like how much emphasis the mom is putting on her long, gorgeous. So I believe the reason the girl made the video, I think that's her dance coach. And people were saying in the original video where they showed her hair, that it was fake, that it was tracks. It couldn't be her hair. Um, cause I don't think the little girls like it. Doesn't matter, but it's interesting to do. Like, this is why people think they're better. They think they're better. They makes kids think they're better and all this stop making up damn excuses. Stop. Stop doing it bullshit. Because when I started my locks, I had maybe three or four inches of, you know, hair, so I really had no hang time. And that first year, the amount of people that said, aren't you gonna cut it out? While is supposed to look like that? You sure you wanna lock it? The amount of comments I got on that. On my journey, the first Year, it was just like, thank goodness. I was told as a child that my hair would not grow because I was so mean. Because I was used to the nappy hair comments. I was used to the bad hair comments from my own people. So them saying something about her hair, that doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me, because she's probably been told that her whole life. But I was told my whole life my hair was nappy, that it was hard to work with, that it was thick, that it was this and that, and you know what I get now? Are those extensions? Are those lock extensions? Or when I. When they find out they're not lock extensions? When you gonna read a retwist? You never fucking happy. No hate to this. no, no. There's hate. There's hate all the way around. Don't tell them their hair is pretty. Tell them their hair is nappy. Well, it's not nappy now, because now it touches your ass. Now you can sit on your hair, so we're fine with that. However, you need a retwist. Y'all can't make up your mind now. This is hating because that girl's in middle school. That's a baby. She's probably had hair like that all her damn life. She can't do nothing about that. Your insecurity is showing. You're insecure because that baby got, you know, nice hair, and this is why they feel this way. So why is it I don't feel that way when people talk about my nappy ass. And it's my own damn family and own damn people saying my hair is nappy and all this other shit. And now all of a sudden, when I can sit on it, that still ain't good enough. Yeah, it goes both ways. Y'all don't like nothing, you're gonna find something wrong either way. Either damn way.",

And I know that some girls, like for me, for example, I'm a little darker, conflicted, so I feel like darker men normally hit on me, which is fine, I don't care. I am open to all of all avenues of men, okay? However, the white girlies that go out of their way to only date black men. Dead ass have racist parents. And I literally know from just having friends. Like, I've had friends that would like. And I'm like, do you even realize you're doing that? And me personally, I've dated all different types of men. I've dated white, black, foreign, name them, I've dated them, okay? But my parents never gave a fuck. Whereas homegirl Sally dated only black dudes for like five years because her dad was screaming slurs all the fucking time. I'm not saying it's fucking right, but like, it's not right either way because I feel like in my head, if you're a snow bunny. Sorry if that term is offensive. I don't really know, I'm kind of old. But if that term is offensive, my bad. Like, no shade, no tea. I respect everybody. However, I kind of think it's fucked cause You're only doing it to kind of like, prove a point. So do you even really like them? Like, why don't you just open it up to everybody? Like, that's how I am. If I. If the love of my life happens to be white, cool. If the love of my life happens to be black, great. Like, the love of my life happens to be Asian, I don't. You know what I mean? Like, it doesn't fucking matter. Why are they only king in on 1 1 specific ethnicity? I think it's kind of like, racist. Just as well. I might be controversial, but. Yeah, the girl was asking, please don't cancel me.

I make these Uncle Ruckus videos. It's a haha joke. We all know that. There are people who believe it's true. There are people behind my back calling me a goddamn tar donkey, knuckle dragon, African baboon. That's what's happening. They cannot stand the side of us. They hate the way we talk, the way we walk, they hate the way we dress, they hate the way we talk. They hate everything. And I feel like we downplay what was really going on in during Jim Crow and post Jim Crow. These people could not stand to be around black people. You know why we have private pools? It's because when integration happened, these white people were like, Yo, I would rather die than to swim with a black person. That pool water will be so goddamn dirty. So we're gonna close all these pools down, we're gonna close all these parks down. We are only having private property. These are your grandparents. And it gets taught.

    "voice_to_text": "I see a lot of people have a lot of things to say, differing opinions on how Cameron conducted himself during his interview with CNN anchor Abby Phillip. Uh, and I'm still gonna say it was absolutely unprofessional and it was disrespectful for people that don't understand how media works. Cameron knew what he was coming on CNN for. He knew what they wanted to talk about because that's the hot topic. He's a rapper from New York. He knew exactly what they wanted to talk about, but he still chose to come up there and act the way he acted. Dude is 48 years old, but he still up there with that I'm a tough rapper persona. I don't do this, I don't do that. Man, you 48 years old, dog. We're supposed to be setting a positive example now, but he chooses not to do that. And I'll be honest with you. See camera, and it may really ain't gonna get too many passes from. From me, but I'm still gonna be fair in anything that they do or say that I wanna criticize or anything they do or say that I wanna uplift. And I said it because they called me a house N word because I criticized Deion Sanders when I asked him to keep the same energy for UCLA that he had for Jackson State when he thought his stuff was stolen. Anyway. So, yeah, I'm still on that, but I'm still gonna be fair. But My thing about is Abby Phillip didn't deserve that. She conducted herself as about as professional as you can in that kind of situation in live television. In live TV, they have a block set aside for how long this interview supposed to last. So she has to keep asking the questions because that's what they were on there and he was booked to talk about. And they have a time frame that they gotta meet, cause if they don't, the show is gonna be extremely light. But for him to come on and talk about something atrocious and disgusting that P. Diddy did to a woman and disrespectful, and him come back right back and disrespect that woman. Why? She was doing her job, that's little boy stuff, that little boy stuff, and ain't nothing cool about it. But that's just my opinion. Y'all can have your opinion. That's my opinion. I wouldn't have conducted myself like that. Dude, almost 50 years old, you showing up like that on the interview with shades on. You ain't on your podcast, dog. What? You trying to get eyes to your podcast. But that's just my take on it. All praises to the most high.",

    "voice_to_text": "Big controversy today over a 30 second video that was posted on Truth Social by Donald Trump's campaign and it references a unified Reich if Donald Trump wins. That appears to be a reference to Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. And so the Biden campaign is pouncing on this saying Donald Trump is not playing games. He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today.",

You know, this boy have the nerve to say he don't like me and don't wanna come to my house. And that he missed the times with his family. Speaking of his mama family and not his daddy side of family, like we don't exist, right? So he say he. This is taking up time. He said the two days that he spent over here feel like a whole week. And then he's not even looking forward to the 30 days he had to spend over here. For some, he said he don't wanna come over here at all. Like I'm a bad person. Like I've traumatized him and did anything wrong to this little boy. We have done so much stuff, so much fun things. Spend time together, play basketball together, go amusement parks, go swimming, take riding in toys like this. He had the nerve to choose his mama. Look at the camera, gay. Choose his mama over me. Like I'm around here. Treat him wrong. What kid don't wanna be around a daddy? Please tell me. And as a daddy, is hurt because I know his Mama got something to do with it too. But still, he's old enough to make his own decisions. And he chooses mama over his daddy, his flesh and blood, somebody that can teach him how to be a man. But he wanna be up on a woman all day. Look at the camera, gay. Tell people how you don't love your daddy and how you rather be with your mama and time over here is boring and you don't want to spend time with your daddy. Tell people how you don't want to spend time with your daddy. And you, he act like I. I haven't been picking him up all these years. Like what? What is the problem? Like this not your first time at my house. But yeah, he hurt my feelings, world. He really hurt my feelings. And you can't take that back, gay. I'm gonna give you what you want. And I'm erase myself out of your life. I'm give you what you want. Gay, that is so messed up on so many levels. You know, I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. My dad was in my life. I would never tell my dad because I know that were hurt my daddy's feelings. I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. Ever."

    "voice_to_text": "remember when OK Boomer was a meme like a lot of other millennials and Gen Z I thought of it as a very justified response to hearing well Boomer nonsense but something has been on my mind recently that's probably gonna sound like Boomer nonsense to a lot of my followers or other people in my generation so here's my skelding hot take can we stop pretending like teenagers don't understand right and wrong I know I'm about to sound like a conservative boomer uncle going this generation's too soft but legitimately I do feel like we're infantilizing teenagers too much now here's what I mean by that once in a while a new story will come up of someone doing something terrible and there will be a strange amount of people justifying that action or saying he shouldn't be in too much trouble because the action was done by a teenager for example this teenager stole eight cars and I came across a lot of comments of people saying well he's only 17 you did stupid things when you were 17 and well yeah I can partially agree with that but my stupid thing was calling my parents while I was stoned this is like actually damaging but he's just a kid he needs help he's really scared I'm sorry but if by 17 or 18 you don't know that it's wrong to steal cars you probably should get some serious consequences here's also something more recent Parkland student who slapped a teacher in the face I'm about to sound like your conservative boomer uncle but honestly I don't have a problem with this oh but he's just a kid he shouldn't have his life ruined over this do I think someone should have their life ruined over this no but even a 5 year old understands that you probably shouldn't slap people in the face if by a certain age you don't see this as wrong you probably do need harsh consequences and look I get it the brain technically doesn't finish developing until about 25 now if you think instances like that are fringe or not that common try spending some time on the r slash teachers subreddit there are a lot of teachers talking about how people just don't wanna give kids or teens consequences for their actions I remember people getting mad when I saw this and said you know what that Dad's pretty based I have no problem with this for one thing I have like zero sympathy for bullies but also if by 16 years old you don't know that it's wrong to make fun of people with a terminal illness you probably should have this happen to you anyone who's been seriously bullied like myself can attest that teenagers don't do these things because they don't know it's wrong they do these things because they know they can get away with it or at least they'll think they'll get away with it they don't see the long term effects that their actions can have now I'm glad that we live in a world where we understand development of the brain better I'm glad we live in a world where there's a lot more discussion of mental health but even psychologist will attest that teenagers do have a sense of right and wrong the real problem is decision making kids and teens need a supportive environment they need guidance but on top of that they need consequences for their actions because remember adolescents who don't take responsibility eventually become adults who don't take responsibility and is that what you really want",

    "voice_to_text": "Bad built, butch body, which I had to look at my notes to read. Any regrets about that kind of language, especially given that you were trying to make a point, frankly, about decorum in the hearing room? I have no regrets, and I'll tell you why. Because Marjorie Taylor Greene is the type of person that if you give her an inch, she'll take a mile. And the fact that they continue to allow her to break the rules of decorum over and over and over, whether it's the state of the union that the president is delivering and she's wearing a MAGA hat or otherwise. The reason that she didn't have committee assignments before was because she did not know how to conduct herself as a member of Congress. And so if I just sit there and say, oh, well, Marjorie said it about me, what's to stop her to continue to do it again and again? And at the end of the day, I was elected as a representative of Congress, but that doesn't mean that I'm supposed to be somebody's doormat. But Michelle Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. Are those days basically over? Um, I don't know that we can even call this a low. I mean, she goes to hell, and then I do my best to remind her as to why she should not cross me. So one of your colleagues, Jamie Raskin, actually suggested that some members might Have been drinking. Others have said that as well. Making that suggestion. That's a pretty serious allegation. Do you think that that played a factor here? I think when Marjorie Taylor Greene. It doesn't require alcohol for her to be unhinged. I'll be perfectly honest. I don't know. I don't have any facts to that, so, you know, I won't say and I won't participate in rumors when I don't have any facts behind it. So you also called Greene racist, what she said about you. Why is that? Yeah, because as I've received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress, a lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factful way, what they would try to do is say, oh, look at her hair, or look at her nails, or look at her lashes. And they would all then associate anything that I do as a form of beautification with being, quote, unquote ghetto. And so to me, she was just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there. Because I am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she's never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me. A black woman who sits On the committee. And then of course she went after AOC and called her unintelligent. A brown woman that sits on the"

We're all getting phone calls right now. Baby girl with the pink hair. I don't know what you're doing. I mean, I think it's a great thing, because I've been waiting forever for the rest of the Gen Xers, and if you are here right now, time to check in. Technically, I am a baby Gen X. I'm the youngest Gen X in 1980. And supposedly I'm, like, a cusper, because I'm, like, in this weird little gap of, like, five years and a millennial cusper or something like that. So I have, like, the older generation millennial traits and then, like, the younger generational X traits. I don't know. Look, I'm here for all of it. We're the Goonies generation. We knew how to handle grown adults, like the fertelities at the age of, like, seven. Okay? Nothing that's going on right now scares us. You little videos don't scare us. We used to watch the gremlins when we were five. The kids from Stranger Things. That's us. You see them? Scared to fight a Demogorgon? Nah. No, neither are we. We are the ones that will literally just run into a dark alley. We don't care. We will just do. That's what we do. We were taught never to start a fight, but to finish it through shows, movies, our Parents. That's what we were taught. Be for real. Right now. If it's gonna be anybody, it's gonna be us. We don't have organized lists of what we do. We just do. And that should scare a lot of people. We just do. We watch as well, which is something you got to be careful about. I saw somebody tonight talking about how Gen X is literally Beth Dutton and rip combined. That's it. That's all you need to know. That's all you need to know about. About us.

    "voice_to_text": "Become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Holemaker. In case you were wondering how the crowd reacted to that statement. Then he goes on to say that Isabelle, his wife, has no regrets about giving up her dream of having a career. Isabel's dream of having a career might not have come true, but if you ask her today if she has any regrets on her decision, she would laugh out loud. Now, his wife is truly happy with that decision. I absolutely support her. I think being a wife and mother are beautiful things. I think addressing women specifically and saying, this is your purpose is really unfortunate, to put it mildly. You know, she is happy and healthy. They have a great marriage, great family. Then I'm all for it. For them. I fear that may not be the case, but I. I pray that I'm wrong. Also, by the way, this is his company, MD Keller, for which he is a co founder, and the college where he gave this commencement speech. It is listed as an organization that his company fully endorses. Now, there is something he said that I actually agree with. It has to do with men being absent from their homes. But I'm sure we have different thoughts on why that is. Here's that clip. Absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other Countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the. He also spends quite a bit of time arguing for traditional Latin Masses. And I understand he's talking at a Catholic church. Seems a little odd to me. Why is he arguing so hard for this, like at a college graduation? It just seems kind of out of place. I don't know. Just like, a little odd. Last clip about cost of living is extremely important that you actually think about the places you are moving to. Who is the bishop? What kind of parishes are there? Do they offer the TLM and have priests who embrace their priestly vocation? Cost of living must not be the only arbiter of your choice. That's pretty rich coming from a multi millionaire. It doesn't have to worry about the cost of living all that much. Anyways, just wanna share some clips with y'all.",

No, please, please, black men, immigrants, please come have babies. Without women, they can't have babies. Now, here's the thing.

I don't think that must have crossed the sheriff's mind at the time. When he was knocking on the door, he said he was shouting, Sheriff, but he had the people covered up. Interesting. Hmm. So Roger says, let me go get my piece, because somebody's banging at my fucking door, okay? Wanna protect yourself? And in the state of Florida, want you to not need a license to carry, but you do have stand your ground. You have a right to protect yourself. So he was within his rights. Okay. Roger opens his door, cracks it just a little with his peace pointed to the floor, and still got shot six times. Interesting. That's interesting. And they just released a body cam footage. You know, that the sheriff is on administrative leave, and they're doing an internal investigation, yada, yada, yada. It will see where this comes up. But honestly, to my people, to the people who share the same sentiments, who know where we are right now in history, with everything that keeps repeating and happening, we keep sitting down and watching shit happen, just happen to us.

But he made this exact same claim in the Brianna Taylor case, and it was an absolute lie. We know that police officers had a search warrant for Brianna Taylor's apartment. That's a fact. But despite that, Ben Crump made that claim for years. But let's go down this rabbit hole, because the idea of police officers going to the wrong apartment could mean a lot of different things. So in this case, we know that the leasing office from the apartment complex called and reported a domestic disturbance. Did the leasing office hear a disturbance and then gave police officers the wrong apartment number? If so, that's not really the fault of the cops. Or did police officers have the right apartment number, but for some reason got confused and knocked on the wrong door? Or is Ben Crumb saying it's the wrong apartments because there was no disturbance, the leasing office got it wrong, and they never should have sent cops. But the bigger question, why did the cops force entry?",

    "voice_to_text": "So I wanna talk about the Black Wife Effect because it's been on my timeline. I know it's been on others, and I feel like there's so much to break down about it. So for me, as I'm watching The Black Wife Effect, what I'm thinking is that everything black woman touch, they elevate. And that's not just on a partner scale, that's on a societal scale. When you look at the foundation of any social justice movement, you will find a black woman there. And that is not a coincidence. When you look at any industry, at the top of it, there will always be a black woman there. And that is not any coincidence. And every time I say this, people get mad. Click the link tree in my bio. I already have the notes. But anyways, I thought the fascinating thing about the black white effect is not even that they look better, their styles better, but it's also like, you can visibly see their confidence get better. And that's something that not. Isn't like a physical change. That's something of, like, being properly cared for. I feel like black women have been socialized to be deep carers. And a lot of time people put us on this pedestal of like, their goddesses, their otherworldly, but it is a little bit exhausting. people hold us to this standard where we have to go above and beyond, like, to be pretty as a black girl. You Have to be above and beyond. To be smart as a black girl, you have to be above and beyond. To be kind as a black girl, you have to go above and beyond. You know what I mean? That's why when they exceed in these industries, when they exceed in these fields, when they exceed in these foundations, they do that because the standards is, exceed or not exist. And so if this trend should show you anything, it shouldn't just be like, oh, my gosh, let's see how we can exploit and use black woman, and how can we get a mammy to elevate us? It should be, let me try and take notes so I can be on the same level, or let me see what they do that really does it, you know what I mean? Like, a lot of times, people can appreciate what black women do, but they don't know how to properly support us to keep doing it. I think that's all I need to say for now."

And stories like this are the exact reason why I look at you funny. Man makes miracle recovery after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and he was left underwater. After being hospitalized for more than two weeks, a 26 year old man from Louisiana is officially off life support. Doctors described Christopher Gilbert's survival as a miracle after allegedly being pushed into a lake by his friends and left underwater for nearly ten minutes. Gilbert and a group of his friends were at a lakefront restaurant when he ended up in the water, leaving him with significant rain damage and on life support. His friends, right? Family attorney Claudia Payne said Gilbert's friend group initially reported to police that he had fallen into the lake. However, after an investigation was conducted, it was said that he was allegedly pushed into the water by a girl in the friend group. Gilbert's legal team is demanding and arrest be made. They also want the restaurant owners to be held accountable for not keeping him safe. So far, no arrests have been made and activists are demanding justice and answers. I'm not even an activist and I need answers. I want answers like now. But let's get into the real story, you feel me? A white woman pushed An aspiring black doctor into a lake knowing he couldn't swim. The woman also lied to his parents and the police saying he fell into the lake. They also watched him for 10 minutes struggling before bystanders who did not know him intervened. Uh huh. And I know when said friends concocted this little plan, cause this was definitely premeditated. I'm not hearing it was premeditated. When they sat there, got together, and made up this little plan of what they was gonna do, they did not think of the possibility of him surviving it. They thought he was going to drown that way. They already had the story that they wanted to tell. It was already set in stone. This man was on his way to be a doctor. He was on his way to make a change in this world. A black man on his way to greatness. And they tried to stop him from that. You would like to donate to Chris's cause? I've already donated. The link to his gofundme is under this thread on Twitter is still up, so just type in that name and you'll be able to find it. Mr. Chris, we see what's going on. We know what's going on, just like you know what's going on. And we are behind you. We as in black people. We are behind you. I promise you."

Equality under the law, Equality in our institutions, Equality in our economic and educational systems, Equality in our judicial system. So what is it that white people need to do? Quality is the foundation of any nation. And in order for us to survive, in order for us to thrive, we have to be willing to change. And we cannot change what we refuse to acknowledge.

I just want to ask you I want to invite you to this if you are mad about that question if you are feeling vitriolic about people saying that white women are doing as much harm as white men where do you feel that in your body??  where is that coming up for you??  if you are angry about this if you are feeling powerful emotions about that where are you feeling that??? because that is where you are holding misogyny and racism in your body and deconstruction is not just a matter of the mind it's a matter of processing it in your body that's an invitation to learn about yourself",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm a sexual assault survivor when I was 15 a 55 year old woman assaulted me and three of my friends at a party where she served a bunch of 15 year olds alcohol way to go Granny and I don't hate women I've stepped in to defend women against attacks from men in city streets or bars I can't say if they're all sexually related or sexually motivated they probably were but when we get to the question of this I mean like I do empathize for victims I get that but the question isn't real and we all know the question isn't real it's hypothetical I was just at a store there are hundreds or thousands of people at this Walmart men and women walking around doing their thing minding their own business not a single woman in there was shifty eyed dysphoric or afraid of any of the men in that store I was just at a restaurant I was at a bank I was at a coffee shop I was walking through a park no one was afraid of men replace any of those men with one bear and see what happens so because we know it's hypothetical let's have an adult conversation ready the existence of the question at all creates bias against men I can trick you just the same way I'd say what do you think Islamic men use more to murder their wives with guns or knives or rope the fact that I asked the question you go well why is he asking that question do they murder their wives a lot the question is safety bear man alone right those are the four real words in that question it is embedding a bias against men every woman that has answered that question bear has stepped out in public sense has interacted with hundreds of men the average woman will interact with 300 men per day maybe they'd up for the bear just cause they wanna mix it up they're like I'm getting so bored with the thousands of men that I see every week then maybe I just wanna see a bear I don't think you understand the gravity of this question as a abuse survivor I'm standing up against a false claim against the nature of men where one in a thousand men or maybe just a hair over one in 1 thousand men will commit a crime of this nature it's a very thin number of men and as a man whose family was responsible for starting World War 1 you know the assassination by the Black Hand the Archduke friends Ferdinand my family paid for that assassination we started World War 1 which is why World War 2 happened because I'm so closely tied to that genocide I've studied it and Hitler and the Germans use the same type of questionings and comparative logic to wage war against Jews I'm literally trying to stop thousands of women who don't know any better but then to participate in a trend from creating this wave of propaganda against men someone is trying to use this question against men and women think it's a cool dramatic way to say I'm afraid of men but they're really actually not afraid of men cause they wouldn't go outside they wouldn't go shopping they wouldn't walk through the park they won't do anything they'd be so actually mortified of men the question appeals to a logical fallacy called the fallacy of relative privation they're trying to say that because a single man could do more harm than a single bear that all men are more dangerous than all bears on average regardless of the context of the interaction that strips away all sense of goodwill or truth to the fact that women interact with 300 men per day on average that strips away the truth that a woman per male exposure if you walk down the sidewalk and you see a guy you have a 1 in 35 million chance of being forcibly graped in that walk by on the sidewalk that fallacy of relative privation strips all logic to the fact that men are bienlarge safe but yeah 81% of women will report being sexually harassed or assaulted 43% of men just the same the number of people who will experience unwanted sexual contact men and women are roughly the same men will under report at three times the rate of women men are victimized just as much but we're stigmatized against talking about it both sides are victims but men are not doing this campaign to smear women to try to damage the entire like gender of women except for me now I'm doing what's called logical parallels my whole argument for the last two week has been such since women assault children their children their biological kids at 2.5 x the rate that all men assault all women sexually then women should lose custody of their kids until they stop it because the phrase going around online right now is all men until no men so until no women or women women do not deserve custody of their biological kids if any of them are capable of harming a child because children are innocent and honestly all parallels aside it's the abuse of children that is propagating people who are becoming monsters later on in life so if anyone could make a decision right now to make the world a better place in the next 15 years it's women not abusing their kids it's already too late for us as adults we're already screwed we all have our trauma that we have to work through and that's gonna be a dog fight but if we wanna guarantee the world's gonna be a better place let's stop abusing kids so the reason why women are choosing the bears cause it's not a real question and they won't have consequences if they answer in a dramatic way for effect just like the 30 something percent of boys are like well dude if like there's no consequences I totally take advantage of a chick see yeah maybe people are bad people by nature but people still obey the law and that's why if 32% of college men would commit essay if there's no consequences but then only one out of every thousand men will commit that crime that shows how much people have disciplined over their nature and you cannot say the same thing about a bear",

    "voice_to_text": "The black community has used romantic love to gaslight black women into dealing with men with very limited resources. One of the main reasons why women used to get married back in the day was access to resources. Because women couldn't have their own bank accounts, on their own homes. They weren't their own person. They had to partner themselves with men to gain resources for survival. And because black women have never had the privilege to not work in this patriarchal society, and we've always had to help our men pay the bills, they are now convincing us that we should continue to do that and that we will only be loved by black men, which is not the truth. So it got me thinking, why is the black community, specifically the black church, so dedicated and so fixated on black women having to be obsessed with romantic love? And I realized because of black women decide they're not going to deal with romantic love, decentering men for be movement, then black men don't have access to any sort of legacy or really lineage. They don't have access to women's resources because they don't have very many resources of their own. So if black women aren't convinced or aren't aren't obsessed with black love, there is no black community.",

And you may have seen my daughter in a video or two. And half the world has heard my daughter in a video that went semi viral and went around the world a couple of times. Hey, Ava. Yeah. Knock, knock. Show me the warrant. But odds are you've probably never seen my son. And that's because he's just no fan of TikTok. He's no fan of the attention. He is, um. He. He's a little bit shy. This is my son. We adopted him at 2 years old. And the picture you're seeing is from prom, which was last weekend. My wife and I were 35 and 36 years old when we adopted our children. We had real simple criteria. We wanted a boy and we wanted a girl, and we wanted an older brother and a little sister. We wanted a big brother, little sister situation. If you know anything about adoption, it's kind of a you get what you get and you don't throw a fit situation. There is no inventory, there's no warehouse where they're keeping these children, and you get to put your order in. It's a. It's a let's see what we have available, and let's see what would be a good fit for your family. Look, we did not set out to adopt A mixed race child. We got the call from CPS saying, hey, we've got a little man needing a home. And we said, what a coincidence, we've got a home needing a little man. And to be quite Frank about it, he could have been purple with three eyes and I would not have cared. He is my son. He has been my son for 15 years. And truth be told, he was always my son. I just hadn't found him till he was two. So another question on the table is why do white people adopt black children? Can't speak for all white people, but for us, we had a home needing a child and we were connected with a child who needed a home. That's simple."

Your wife actually has more in common with Drake than she does with you as a white mother. Just like Drake, she did not grow up with her father, she has no ties to the black community and she struggle with her identity just like Drake did. Not only that, Kendrick Lamar lied and said that he loves dark skinned women. Meanwhile he's been married to a biracial, light skinned woman the whole time. Like your wife is the female equivalent of the person that you're dissing, so stop trying to act like you so down for the community. It's the hypocrisy for me. I just don't like that shit.

Maybe if black mothers would stop having random children with random men without being married and having a family to keep that child in, there wouldn't be so many black children to adopt. Also, while you're on the internet running your mouth, how many children can you adopt? Probably zero, because you don't qualify. Because you have to have a family. You have to be financially sound. See, this is how the process works. First they reach out to the immediate family, any blood relatives, and try to get somebody to take that child. That didn't work. Then they try to find a child which a family they can connect with. Same race. That didn't work, and they had no choice but to put the child with a white T family who was willing to take the child. So instead of asking why are YT people adopting black people, why don't you ask why there's so many black children up for adoption? Aren't y'all the most educated? Aren't y'all making the most money that any other group of black women have ever made? So why aren't you adopting black babies?"

Remember, we're not talking about a gift to anybody. We're talking about mending what was broke. We're talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans. And just crossing out a racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver Equality. Harm's compound. Just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time, so does the value of a dollar stolen. And that is why the United States must act immediately. With investments in minority owned businesses, with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs. And on the longer term, look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken.",

Because Donald Trump came down that gold escalator, you cried, you told us he's racist, and we told you, no, he's not. Hey, we just went on, y'all, 30 years of co signing for him telling us he wasn't racist. It's gonna take more than a because I said so to convince us. Come on, it ain't too late.

Because I know exactly what it is that you're implying. You're implying by having a son, I don't have the parent as hard. And because we have normalized in society neglecting boys, and it starts at home, we have generations of men my age, younger and older, who lack foundational things that they needed at home because it was believed at home they needed nothing at all. Oh, he's a boy. He. He don't need me checking up on him all day. Yeah, he been in his room all day. He's good. I know what he's doing. When is the last time you asked that boy, how are you? And it was genuine. When was the last time you saw your son cry about something that was really devastating? Because that's what a human being does. But, oh, if he gets emotional, he need to toughen up. If your daughter cries, you rub her back. When was the last time you supported him in self discovery? When was the last time you asked him what he wanted out the world and what did he want for himself? When. When did you make sure you foster the space where he was connected to the universe and connected to himself as a human being? That's why we have men today. Who don't know how to communicate, who lack EQ. Who don't know how to turn for help. Who don't know how to go through things because they were never supported. They were neglected. And that's why boys, that's why young boys are the highest rates of suicide in this country. But you went in jail with her daughter. You make sure she's good. You make sure you see what she's wearing so she's safe. When she navigates to the world, you need to know where she at and if she's okay. And she's been in that room too long, you peeking through the door. It's only easier to have a son, because with a son, you have been told that you don't have to parent. You don't have to do much. Just let them rock. But what they needed was to be parented like a daughter. You gotta relinquish that mindset, because we're continuing the cycle of men not knowing how to be men. And they delayed into childhood because they still need a mom to do things that Mama didn't do. They still need a dad to do things that dad never did. And they navigate through the world, searching through it through friends and relationship, when that's nobody else's responsibility but the ones who put them on the earth. And the funny part about all of this is you always hear people say, girls mature faster than boys. No, girls are supported. Girls are supported from birth. Boys Are neglected at adolescence.",

    "voice_to_text": "I feel like y'all talk about jealous friends a lot, but nobody ever talked about these men would be dating. Sometime they become jealous of us. This is why I'm so big on having people in my corner who kind of come from like the same backgrounds. Because like, for instance, me and my mom, we like this. I had to break my fingers to show you how close my mom and I are. We even share the same birthday. Mom used to real life warn me. She be like, you know, you need to find you somebody who come from the same background, a household like you do, cause if you don't, they're going to be jealous of the relationship that you have with us. And I used to think to myself like, now that's kind of shallow thinking. Nobody's gonna be jealous of that. And said another. And I'm saying, and I be dog on if my worst nightmare did not start to unfold. I've talked about my previous marriage on here before. I remember one night waking up, I mean, one night I went to sleep with my cell phone. I woke up the next morning and my phone was so called stolen. Now, I know we had had people over to the house, um, and I don't think any of those people would have stolen my belong. When I woke up that morning, I could not find my phone. Um, decided to take me to ATNC. To go get another one. And instead of getting me an iPhone, came back with the LG. With the LG, I could not Facetime my parents anymore. So I went out, I got a laptop, um, and I started to Skype them. I came back from work one night, and my laptop was no longer working. What's so crazy is I went about this whole time possibly thinking that, yeah, maybe the phone was stolen. I don't know. Maybe somebody picked it up. It just is what it is. And after I moved back here, and then a few months later, he passed. When they shipped out his stuff back home, in a box of electronics, there were my cell phone again. Nobody talks about the way that partners can also be jealous of you and be jealous of the relationships that you have when they lack those relationships. This is why, like, now I'm so big on us having to come from, like, similar backgrounds, because you're going to be able to understand family when you come from a great family. Like, that's the way I feel.",

You also have to understand there are vast parts of the US where you can go without single person, period. A lot of people don't realize black people make up only 12% of the US population. We're not spread out evenly throughout the US at all. What a lot of people actually don't realize about Alaska is the fishing industry there makes it for a very diverse population.

A double dredge is necessary for that extra extra crispy skin. Insert your meter probe and deep fry in oil. Set to 3:50 until the internal temperature is 1 67 and it's nice and golden brown.

Me, flea markets, cool shit. I'm in there. I go to this flea market in this very rural area in Indiana. Now this is deep red Indiana territory. Fits perfectly down there with Alabama and Mississippi. I walk in and I see it is a large crowd of older white people, 50 and up. They are looking at me like I just walked off of a UFO. As I'm walking around, I'm seeing a lot of Confederate flag themed memorabilia. So with all these white people here, I said, I'm gonna buy one of these flags because I wanna see what their reaction is to a black guy buying a Confederate flag. So I got it and I'm carrying it very visibly so everybody can see that I have it. And I definitely got their attention. I'm in line and this younger white dude says, man, I gotta ask you, why you buying the Confederate flag? And I can tell he asked what a lot of people were wondering. So a lot of ears start to tune in. And I asked him, what do you think I got it for? And he said, hopefully to burn it or wipe your ass with it. I got a teammate, the room was full of people that were like, His racist grandparents he didn't like. Immediately after he says that, an older white lady says, that's so unpatriotic. Why would you wanna be disrespectful to American heritage? And I'm like, youngster, stand down. I got this. Ma'am, you are right and you are completely wrong about something. You are right about the fact that it is American heritage, but it is a side of American heritage, and that side wanted to preserve the institution of slavery and felt that blacks were subhuman. So it is American heritage, but it is reflective of the team that you are playing on when it comes to American heritage. And what you are completely wrong about is the Confederacy is the most un patriotic group of people in American history. Patriotism is loyalty to your country and the person chosen to run your country. In this case, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, and the United States had chose a direction, and the Confederacy did not agree with that and wanted to succeed. From the United States, they engaged in an act of war against the government. If the Confederates were patriots, they would have followed the direction that the country was going and the leader that was elected to run this country. What they did was they chose to pick up arms and go to war against the United States of America. That is the most treasonous, unpatriotic thing in American history. Then an older white guy chimes in and he says, this Well, why do y'all always blame America for slavery? Slavery was in Africa. Slavery was in Rome. Slavery existed a lot of other places outside of America, youngster. They fucking with the wrong one, sir. There is one ingredients in American slavery that made it completely different from any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. And that ingredients was based on a pseudo saying that the people being subjugated were not even a part of the human race. They were not Homo sapiens. They were subhuman. So the people being enslaved were not even being considered human beings. Slavery and other places never had that element. In Rome and Africa, the people being subjugated were not seen as not being human. It was based solely on might is right. I defeated you. You can't beat me. Go take care of my cattle. But the idea that Africans were not even humans made American slavery totally different. It was more dehumanizing than any other form of slavery that existed on the planet before. This is an American ingenuity. If I own you and you have a kid, I own your kid. And if your kid has a kid, I own that kid. I own your whole bloodline. It is an egregious miscalculation to equate slavery in Africa, slavery in Rome, and what the fuck was going on in America then? I hear this, and I got a lot of those flags around my house, and I don't Understand why people get all in a tizzy about this? Okay, ma'am, let me ask you this. If we was in Germany and somebody was flying the little mustache guys flag and saying that it was a part of German heritage, do you think that would be right? It is a part of German heritage. I don't see why it would be disrespectful. Youngster, this bitch, super racist. She had a little boy with her, and I asked her, was that her grandson or something? She says, yes, he was autistic. So I told her, ma'am, do you realize that if you lived in Germany at that time, your grandson would have been euthanized under the Nazi regime? Shut her ass up. The rest of them are looking dumbfounded and youngster looking like, we just won the super bowl. Got to the parking lot, chopped it up with youngster. He's super cool. He invited me to his bonfire where we burning this damn thing.",
