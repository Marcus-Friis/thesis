I grew some pumpkins on a very small balcony, and they ended up growing like crazy. And I had to make this little bag contraption to make sure that nobody got a pumpkin on their head on the way out of their house. So I'm very excited to try this little guy. It was super cute. You would just put some water to the soil, and then all of a sudden, it started growing. And then you add the seeds. There was a bunch of seeds in there, but I only grew two because, like I said, I have had experience with crazy pumpkins before. I found the perfect spot for them, and now I'm super excited to see if they start to grow. Just wanted to share with you guys, and if it goes well, I'll make another video. Okay, bye."

I am a mother to about 200 plants, and there are a couple plants that are literally in the corner dying. Let's talk about it. There are some plants in my collection that just do not like me. We just don't 5 like, it's fine. I don't take it personally. It's totally fine. I don't care. Through some of my sadness and despair, I have chosen to be super vulnerable about this. I'm gonna show you some of my plants that are on their way to heaven. Is my fiddly sick? I have had her for two or three years now, and every year she looks worse. I generally don't do good with ficuses, so, like, this is no surprise to me. She's just one of those problem plants that I'm gonna put outside when it warms up. Up next are my ravens easys. I don't know why. They grow super leggy. I don't encounter this issue with any other ZZ in my house. It's just Raven ZZ's. They're beautiful plants, don't get me wrong, but they just do not like me. Up next is this pot. Those that I was supposed to be rehabilitating. Here she is in all her glory. This what I'll probably end up chopping and propping if she has any good growth points. And last, but certainly not least is my fuzzy Petio philodendron. She's crusty, dusty. I probably need to stake her up. Just one of those plants. And I'm like, oh, I'll get around to you. And I never do. If you ever have plants in your collection and they're not doing too well, don't beat yourself up about it. Just plans to give them a little extra TLC. All right."

Go ahead and trim all the way down. It will take longer to regrow a stem, but it will grow back. That will encourage bigger and larger blooms. If. If you don't want to do that, then trim it. See these little buds here? These are opened. Ooh, look, it's closed in between the last open one to the closed one. You have any black roots or mushy roots, snip those off. All the rest of these look great. The one from this size pot to this one orchid mix he roots in, and you have that soil for every single time you do it so it can settle. Shimmy, shimmy.

And I have all 3 of my collection now so I can show you. In terms of care and growth, habit would say that all 3 of these are incredibly similar. And as you can tell by the foliage, they look a lot alike. So if you're trying to go just based off of the leaves, you're probably gonna have a hard time. The secret and telling the difference with these babies is going to be looking at the stems. A philodendron White Princess is going to have green stems with pink variegation along the margin. It is rare, but it can happen that a white Princess pushes out pink variegation instead of white, but it usually is going to fade to white eventually. The White Wizard looks really similar, but the stem is going to be completely green, no signs of pink. And lastly, the philodendron White Knight is going to have a darker red kind of burgundy stem, and that's going to be really apparent, especially on that new growth. Let me know what's your favorite!"

Perfect companion for basil, cucumbers and brassicas such as kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, turnips, radishes. Their aroma deters cabbage pests. That\u2019s what I had growing in these beds last year. This year, I will need to clear the space to make room for gourds (squashes and melons). She attracts a lot of pollinators. I\u2019ve seen lady bugs and bees visit her a lot. The one bunch of seedling actually multiplied to 2 bundles as seen here. I spread her a little so it doesn\u2019t suffocate the Thyme near her. I am calling her Camilla as she is becoming a force in my garden. Looks like she\u2019s is a German Chamomile as supposed to a Roman Chamomile. The German chamomile is about 24\u201d, prolific bloomer, an annual, dies after flowering but set seeds that comes back the following year while a Roman Chamomile is a perennial and shorter in size. I actually saved some seeds last year but learning now that I may not need them. Will save for the flowers for loose tea instead. Chamomile is known as a good herbal tea for calming the stomach and anxiety and promoting sleep. However it may not be good for people with asthma especially with allergies to ragweed or the asteraceae family (ie. aster, daisies, chrysanthemums, etc.) \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude33  I\u2019m afraid if I don\u2019t relocate or cut her back soon she will sow her seeds everywhere and will grow all over my beautiful rock bed.
