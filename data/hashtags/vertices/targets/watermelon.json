One of these safe zones, zone 2, 3, 7, 1, was designated as a safe zone four days ago. They bombed it 60 times. This Arabic post is translated here. A journalist from Gaza says, I saw a child enter the burning tent after it was targeted in order to help his injured mother who could not walk. And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it. That's what John Kirby said. Biden has no issue with this, with bombing a designated safe zone that you lured children into four days ago 60 times.",

This is Nikki Haley, as in US presidential candidate Nikki Haley, writing a message on artillery shells that are in Israel, that are going to be fired into Gaza. Let's take a closer look at the message that she's written, shall we? It says, finish them, exclamation point. America heart Israel. Always Nikki Haley. I checked. This is being reported by many, many reputable sources. As you and I know very well by now, the US has continued to arm and fund this genocide that Israel is enacting upon the Palestinian people. Just last week, remember, the ICJ ordered Israel to stop its invasion of Rafa. Who continues to arm them anyway? The US. I need to remind us all that this is a legally binding order from the International Court of justice. When Israel, as well as the US as a boils, the 191 other countries that are member states of the UN, signed the UN Charter and became member states of the United Nations, they agree to be bound by the rulings of its court. So I just need to revisit all of this. Former US presidential candidate Nikki Haley writing a message and signing it on these artillery shells that Israel is using on Gaza. Finish them, exclamation point. America loves Israel. Always, Nikki Haley. This is a level of depraved. I do not know how To wrap my head around.

And I kind of take a little offense at the question. No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties. And this is not something that we've turned a blind eye to, nor has it been something we've ignored or neglected to raise with our Israeli counterparts, including ED this weekend, as a result of this particular strike. Now they're investigating it, so let's let them investigate it and see what they come up with. But the president doesn't have, like, a personal limit to this. The president has been very clear and very direct about what our expectations are for Israeli operations in Rafa specifically. But in Gaza, red large. We don't support, we won't support a major ground operation in Rafa. And we've again been very consistent on that. And the president said that should that occur, then it might make him have to make different decisions in terms of support. We haven't seen that happen at this point, why not have him come out and say that himself? The president has been speaking to leaders throughout the region on a regular basis. He has been addressing you guys in various forum. You've got plenty of opportunities to talk to the president, including, I might add, in a press conference last week.",

    "voice_to_text": "so this is my random thoughts on some of the media that I've consumed over the last year I love the fact that so many books are being greenlit that's great that's wonderful the only problem is they're greenlining weird stuff and just casting anyone to be in it um some good ones that I saw was like turtle all the way down turtles all the way down um I think they acted that well and I think the story is really sweet um and there's someone struggling with anxiety I 100% related to the character maybe even a little bit too much I don't know some bad ones that I saw uh Copa Mia I know that everybody was really feeling it no hate no shade if you liked it um I just thought it was overacted like the guy just knew that he already looked the way people wanted him to look so he spent the entire movie like leaning in stuff or doing the raised eyebrow or the cheeky side thing and I was just like boy stop stop no we're not doing that just wasn't feeling that one and while I actually do like um the summer I turn pretty the one thing that I absolutely did not like was two things really one um that belly was doing the whole flip flop between brothers I think both brothers are valid in the way that they feel Jeremiah is valid to be angry at Conrad for keeping him a secret for so long Susanna shouldn't have done that to them in the fucking first place and I think um Conrad is okay to be the way he is even though it's a jerk move even though it's something that I definitely didn't like on her birthday being shitty I don't understand why he felt the need to do all that or mess it up her first date I kinda get it but at the same time no it was unnecessary you can't have your cake and eat it too if you want her to stay awake cause you don't feel well um because of everything going on with your mom fine but then you don't get to dictate who she can and can't date or mess up her dates so that that was messed up but his mother is actively dying I'm not gonna get mad at him for making stupid mistakes in his grieving process a lot of y'all either had a not great relationship with your mother or a lot of y'all are acting like his mother died seven years ago and he's just still feeling some kind of way no she's dying right now like right now like she this is during her death like he's not okay I thought that would be an understandable thing I don't know maybe that's just me um so yeah I think both brothers are valid in the way they've been acting but she did there's just no excuse other than I think that she was in denial for a long time and maybe that's what is messing her up she's jumping so much into guys instead of just accepting that Suzanne is dying and that she needs to deal with it um uh my life with the Walter brothers saw that and I feel like it's it's Netflix being cheeky because the author went to Amazon with the sunwriter and pretty instead of staying with Netflix for it so they scooped up my life with the Walter Brothers cause basically a gender bent version with a lot more boys um I thought the acting was okay and some of it was actors that I actually recognized so um from other things so that was cool um as far as the show goes um like I said she's she's grieving this is right after the death of her parents so she's not making the best of decisions I like that unlike belly she took herself out of the equation she realized that this wasn't good it wasn't good for them it wasn't good for her she wasn't in that kind of place and so she took herself away she should have never started anything at all with Alex in my personal opinion um because like I said she's not in the right place for that right now she's not looking to start a relationship she's trying to mourn the loss of one of the biggest relationships of her life so no she shouldn't have been she shouldn't been with any of them um I think Cole was sweet but I think people are hating on him because he's a player I mean he's a kid that's what they're supposed to do he's only in high school he he's not marrying any of these people but it was foul for him to mess with the best friend that was so foul but he did tell her like in his defense better than all the other ones better than than Conrad and all of them was he actually did tell his girlfriend I'm not looking for a relationship and she actively knew he was smashing other people so I mean to each their own I guess I don't know um and then one last thing to like I guess sum it up I guess I don't know something I just remember about the summer I turned pretty that irritated me was the eternal version trope where she's not just a version she's like the ultimate version like it's kind of excusable because belly supposed to be really young but I'm so sick and tired of main characters being virginal and like super virginal they've never kissed they never hug they've never had held hands they never had a date um and everyone around them is so experienced and but they just never they've never done anything like that it's like come on come on like a woman sexuality isn't tied up in whatever guy she likes she could have her own sexuality outside of the boys that she likes it's not necessary for it always be because of that certain guy that certain crush whatever it could be awakened because of him maybe but it could be a whole factor of things like there's guys who get hard due to fucking a curvy piece of driftwood oh girls have sexuality too you know come on now we don't need to constantly be putting in the eternal virgin trope every time and they always have the friends and the friends are always telling them wild stuff they did the main characters always like oh I was like come on just come on that's my random pop culture feelings right now",

Let me say that again. A father was holding his child and the child had no head. And that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg of what I saw. I saw a charred, lifeless, unable to move body. I saw a child who was still alive with half of his skull gone, taking a couple of his last breaths. And you know what these so called Israelis decided to do? Like. Like to scream, I'm not my government, I'm not my government. They took the picture of the father with his toddler, that his headless toddler, put it in a group chat and was laughing and cackling. The same so called Israelis who say, I am not my government, I am not my government, however, I'm going to block aid, I am not my government, I am not my government.

    "voice_to_text": "Every Saturday night it's movie night, and there is no movie night that's complete without a good selection of snacks. So I started by making some cookies and cream ice cream. Combine some milk and sugar with some vanilla and heavy cream before putting it in my ice cream Turner to churn. It reached soft serve consistency. I added in my cookies, let that go until everything was incorporated. I don't know what it is about cookies and cream ice cream. It's so good to me right now. Pop that in the freezer to chill while I got started on making some pretzel dough. He loves pretzel bites, so I made these for him, combined all of my ingredients, and then kneaded the dough for letting it rise for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, I got started on making some gummy worms, so I blended up some strawberries and raspberries. In the meantime, I heated up some apple juice and gelatin in my pot until it was all dissolved for combining the two and then spooning it into my mold. I let these set in the fridge while I worked on my pretzel dough. After about 30 minutes, I cut it up in six pieces and rolled those out into little ropes. Once I did that with all of my six pieces, I cut them up into smaller bite size pieces. They don't all have to be perfect. And I drop them in some boiling water with some baking Soda before pulling them out, salting them, and then baking them until they were golden brown. All those were cooling off. I got my gummy worms out of the fridge. I wanted them to be slightly sour, so I sprinkled them with some citric acid and then moved on to the last thing I was gonna make with some popcorn. No movie night is complete without a big bowl of buttered popcorn. Drizzled it with melted butter and some flaky sea salt before I pulled my ice cream out and served us up a bowl of that as well. At this point I was so ready to go watch the movie and eat all of the snacks.",

    "voice_to_text": "So let me get this straight. Last week it was fuck celebrities, fuck the Met Gala, fuck anyone who dared participate in that ostentatious show of wealth, regardless of what sort of work they've been doing for Palestine. But this week, for the Cannes Film Festival red carpet, it's, oh, my god, slay queen, make a stand, treatment, free Palestine. This week, we're defending celebrities because of the obvious, like, racism and things that they experience and the way that they were mistreated within the industry. Last week it was fuck celebrities. This week it's see celebrities as human. I only got two questions. What the fuck are y'all smoking, and why aren't you sharing? Like, what's happening? Are we actually going to be divesting from celebrity culture? Are we just temporarily pissed off at celebrities and trying to leverage social power to make them do what we want? Are y'all just pissed off and you want a target to aim your anger at? That is socially acceptable? So we just decided to hate on celebrities for a week, even though y'all aren't actually serious about untangling the social position of celebrities and how they function and what we can do to make things better? Is that what it is? Y'all just pissed off? Like, I personally think reactionary politic is bad, but apparently that's just how things are going to be on social media. So can we at least acknowledge and embrace that's the way things are? And then Work more strategically around it. Cause I'm personally tired of having like, a different moral purity shit test every week. How about y'all? last week's moral purity shit test was around capitalism and wealth. If you don't hate celebrities, you're wrong. This week's Moral Purity shit test seems to be more based around racism. If you don't defend people of color, you're wrong. Yo, I. I wanna get off of Mister Bones wild ride. I'm tired of this stupid fucking game where we choose a different marginalized identity to put on the pedestal in the Oppression Olympics every week. I'm fucking tired.",

So I'm gonna teach you how to not buy one of these watermelons by what this post is saying to look out for. So, number one, if you cut the watermelon and rub a cotton ball on it or paper towel and it turns dark red, that means that the fruit has been injected with this chemical. Also, if it has white dust on the rind. I feel like I've definitely bought a watermelon with white dust. I just kind of, like, figured it was from, like, the transit in the watermelon trucks. And apparently you should look for ones that have the yellow patch, which I have always been told make your watermelon sweeter if it has a yellow patch on it. You know, like, you always see people tapping the watermelons, right? Isn't that how you learn to pick a watermelon? That's how I Learned to pick a watermelon. So it'll be naturally sweet and flavor and. And ripe if it has yellow on it. So here's how to not eat chemicals 1:01.",

But the administration repeatedly has said that the US will not support a large scale ground invasion. So how do you define large scale ground invasion? And then secondly, um, has the president's broken promise to visit Africa created any challenges as you try to deepen relationships with the countries there? The president would really look forward to visiting Africa. He intends to do so as president of the United States. I obviously don't have anything to announce today, but if you look at the breath of his personal engagement on this issue, including being a president, the first in 20 years to actually host an African leader for a state visit here, I think it shows, along with the specific, tangible policy actions that he has taken, including most recently, by the way, an overlooked part of the national security supplemental was funding actually to help emerging economies, including in Africa. Um, you know, his record will stand for himself. And. And we believe that what today will showcase is not questions about the US commitment, but answers that the US is actually delivering for Africa, for the African people, in this case, for the country of Kenya, but also with Kenya, for the broader continent. In terms of how we look at Rafa, as I've said before, the key concern that we have is major maneuvers into dense urban areas. And that continues to Be something that we will look at. What we have seen so far has not been that. What unfolds in the coming days is something that we will review closely day by day, and will continue to take briefings from Israel about how they are refining their approach, in part based on concerns that we have expressed to them. So this is something that will be a continuing source of engagement and conversation between the two of us. And I'll keep you posted as we assess how things are unfolding. Yeah."

Respectfully, I don't need your support. I appreciate it. Genuinely and whole heartedly, I love you guys so much, but I'm not going to change the way I do things just to accommodate you.

You are more than welcome to go advocate for Whatever cause you have and whatever way that pleases you, you're more than welcome to have an open dialogue with me about the way that I do things. But you're not going to do this. On top of the fact, I'd also like to point out, if somebody says something wrong very publicly, then I'm going to very publicly correct them. And I expect people to do the same to me. Because when you publicly spread misinformation and then only correct it privately, you are letting that misinformation spread and grow. And I will not be accommodating Hamas misinformation campaign against innocent Israelis. So Miss Rachel felt comfortable saying what she had to say publicly. I feel comfortable calling her out publicly, and that's just what it's gonna be.",

You can see that Apollo Global Management CEO Mark Rowan regularly uses his money and influence to try to silence Palestinian voices, labeling any criticism of Israel as anti Semitic. This has gone back way before October 7th. But guess what? We have 22 alternatives on this occupied and one of my favorites to order from in bulk. As an art teacher.

A friend from the flotilla, quiver Butterley, has asked us to keep the pressure on when it comes to Minister Jack Chambers and asking him to flag the flotilla. The uplifters would have received the email here in the background. You can pause to read it there. You can follow the red buttons there to get to the email link, or you can click on our profile picture just over here, which should take you to a profile. Sometimes you're gonna have to press a little button here that will drop it down and then our linktree is just here, the link above Instagram. The top link on our linktree should be email Jack Chambers to let them sell. I can take you to the email to target page here on the uplift website where you click next. So just confirm who you are, your details there and about you are. You can put in not in Ireland if you're not in Ireland and then finally you can send the email as we've written it, or you're welcome to edit it and change it yourself. There is a lot of moving parts when it comes to getting the flotilla flag. However, we are doing our best here and we're asking everyone for their support in both sharing the petition and sending on the emails to Minister Chambers. That petition is at nearly 19,000 signatures. It would be great to see it get to 20. It's always together. We are uplift. And together we can be the people. Power change. Good luck.",

Watch the moment Al Jazeera White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett challenges the US national security advisor after he said the US does not view Israel's killings of Palestinians in Gaza as 'genocide'. #news #breakingnews ",
    "voice_to_text": "You said at the start of this that you don't believe what's happening in Gaza is genocide. What criterion are you using? We're using the internationally accepted term for genocide, which includes a focus on intent. It's not just me standing here at this podium in the context of this International Court of justice case at The Hague. The United States actually made a presentation backed up by legal analysis, which I would invite you to read, because it lays out all of those criteria. Francesca Albanese, especially you, in repertoire on human rights and Palestine, presented one in March. She presented it in Geneva. The three criterion she used. Setting international law, three acts. Israel's intent to destroy national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Serious bodily or mental harm to a group. Inflicting on a group conditions of life. Calculate to bring physical destruction in hole or in part within. Imposing measures intend to prevent birth within the group process of erasure of the native Palestinians. So those three things are happening. How can you say genocides not being committed? As I just told you? I think the best way for me to answer that question is actually to ask you to look at the lay down that we gave, which saying, this isn't happening. I'm sorry, I thought you asked me how I can say it. I'm saying I'd like you to look at. The United States is asking you saying this isn't happening. Do you mind if I finish answering Your question before you. Are you saying that she's a liar? The United States is laid down at the International Court of justice in writing in detail its position on this issue, and I'd ask you to read it. Thank you. Are you saying that it doesn't line up for them with what she's saying"

Explain what's going on inside the synagogue. Is a real estate sale. Is it? Real estate sale? Selling stolen property which was stolen. The stolen land that was stolen from the Palestinian people. As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief. And especially when this is happening while this genocide is taking place in Gaza. This mass murder of the Palestinian people is unacceptable. And the danger that the occupation of Palestine is causing for Jews. And on top of all, why in a synagogue? Why in a holy place? This is either a political move or a financial move. All of this is embarrassing for Jewish people, and as I said, dangerous to Jewish people as well. We should be very careful. Never allowed the completion of Zionists, would you? If one criticizes Zionists. I appreciate that, and I'll tell you why. Because I appreciate the people that define the right definition to what they criticize. Rather than criticizing Jews, which I discouraged to do. I visited Gaza. Yeah, and they did meet me. We are here to teach the world. We are here to teach the Palestinian, the suffering people of Palestine. We are here to teach the Jewish religion and to teach the Masses that this is criminal and this is wrong",

And the circumstances are really unusual and crazy because it was in the alleyway of just a huge apartment complex. There's like, apartments everywhere, and people were home. And she's screaming for help and screaming for help, and no, there's no help. Later, when they interviewed all the tenants, they were like, why didn't you call 9 1 1? And they were like, oh, I thought somebody else would call 9 1 1. Thus, to get the spy standard effect, which is literally thinking, somebody else is gonna do it, so you don't do anything. Now, it's interesting cause we're having this, like, online version of this now with what's going on in Palestine. You're just thinking, oh, somebody else is gonna donate. Somebody else is gonna do something. I have 1.7 million followers. Every single one of you donated 14 cents. Literally the coin sitting at the bottom of your bag right now. The family that I've been paired with through the past, the Hat Project, would have enough money to flee to Cairo with all 14 members of their family. If you stay for this long, you'll notice this bar, and if interacted as the bar is telling you to, you've already given me 14 cents. If you can donate more, the link is in my bio. So far, we raised almost $7,000. A lot of the donations are small, but they're impactful because 400 donations made $7,000. You can make a difference. You do not have to be a bystander. Thank you so much for watching. Love You. Bye.",

Every time I rented an apartment, upwards of 100 Congress members actually sleep in their office cause it's expensive. Washington's expensive. All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this. Do you want it to still be the house of the people, or do you want it to be only wealthy people? I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments. I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment. I think it should at least keep up with inflation. It. It should probably go up with the cost of living. Congress works better when you have a broad swath of the American people being able to run and get elected. I really believe that."

I'm gonna screenshot it and save it to my favorites because I keep asking you, okay? And I keep forgetting. So the video where I thought I got an orange watermelon but it was organic got like 23 million views and people are still commenting on it telling me how stupid I am. But like, it's okay because that video made me like over $5,000 just in views. But still, I'm like, they exist. People are telling me they don't exist. They're like, do you mean cantaloupe? No, no, no, no, I don't. Hi. I mean orange watermelon. They exist. I tried a yellow one and I was not the biggest fan. They didn't get like a sweet one because I'm sure there's ripe and unripe yellow watermelons also, so maybe I'll try A yellow watermelon again this year. Alright, you guys ready? Bon Appetit, you guys. It's pretty good. Maybe like an eight and a half out of 10, but it's pretty.",

    "voice_to_text": "So Donald Trump just got some terrible news. And it shows you that even people in the Republican Party do not like him. So the Republican presidential primary took place in Indiana tonight, and with 76% of the votes in, Donald Trump won. He got 404,000 votes, 78.1% of the vote. But the problem is Nikki Haley, someone who dropped out two months ago, is not campaigning for president, got over 20% of the vote. As things stands, 113 thousand Republicans said, no, I'm not gonna vote for Donald Trump. I'm gonna vote for a candidate who's not even in the race. The Republican Party is not united behind Donald Trump. When you're losing 22% of the vote to a candidate who hasn't been in the race for two months, that shows you that this guy right here, not that popular. There are a lot of Republicans out there who won't be voting for Donald Trump in 2024, or will even be voting for President Biden. These numbers are devastating for Trump in his campaign.",

Did you know that posting one 1 video about a family in Gaza or about Palestine, you could have raised tens of thousands of dollars? Because followers with one tenth of what you have posted and they got 20,000. But you didn't. You're at the Met Gala wearing a dress that again cost thousands. That could go to the people of Gaza that are currently actively going through a genocide. In fact, they invaded Rafa during the Met Gala. Well, thousands of people protested outside the Met Gala and I know you saw them cause they were there. And now you post this video with this sound. And my thing is, what's the point? Like, I'm going off the Assumption that you have a lot of followers cause you're a cool person that people like to follow and you're a good person internally. So. So why did you do this? And I don't mean like you can't do anything cause bad things are always happening in the world. The invasion of the only safe place that happened while you were posting this video. And an act of genocide that we can all see. And of course it's not your responsibility or job to speak up, you don't have to. But why don't you want to? And instead post this video the same day?"

    "voice_to_text": "I'm coming to you from Rafa, Gaza Strip. I am a midwife from the United States who has been in Rafa for the last week to provide healthcare support at Emirati Maternity Hospital, which is the last maternity hospital in all of Gaza Strip. This hospital was originally built to support the small community of Rafa, which was just a couple of thousand people. They had, on average about 70 births a month. And now, as there have been over a million people internally displaced to Rafa, 15 births a month, the staff here also has been displaced. There are not a lot of supplies. There is not enough of anything for anybody, but in particular for mothers and babies. The Israeli forces have started attacking East Rafa, and they have also taken over the Rafa border crossing. The Rafa border crossing is a really important place for Palestinians to receive aid, as Israel has blockaded most of the aid coming into Gaza. Rafa border crossing has been one of the only places where healthcare workers like myself have been able to get across the border to provide help and care. Most healthcare supplies going into Gaza have been from healthcare workers coming into volunteer with. The closing of this border means a large exacerbation of the siege on Gaza and is a direct and eminent threat to the healthcare of all people, but in particular to pregnant and birthing people and newborns. What we are seeing is that pregnancy during Genocide means no prenatal care, a lack of diagnosis of prenatal conditions, a lack of diagnosis of congenital issues with babies. A lack of diagnosis and an increase in intrauterine fetal demise. Women are coming in to the hospital to deliver with us, and it's the first time they have seen a healthcare provider in their pregnancies. They're very upsetting things that are happening. We're seeing babies being born with congenital anomalies and the mother had no idea. We're seeing mothers who have lost so much, they've lost their family, their lives, their homes. We're seeing mothers who are too small, too skinny, too thin to be full term in pregnancy. We're seeing babies that are too small and too little to be full term. As I sit here now, sitting outside, I am hearing what it sounds like in Rafa, which is essentially a playground. There are six hundred thousand children in Rafah, and you can hear it. It's constant. They are so cute and they are running around and they are playing and they are making the most of this. But there are so many children. If Israel continues to attack Rafah, Israel will be massacring children. Anything beyond a ceasefire will be a direct attack on children, on pregnant people, on birthing people, on newborns, on babies, on the innocent and on all innocent Palestinians, a dignified people who deserve so much more respect, who deserve health care, who deserve autonomy and who are not getting it. It is now the time for you to do everything you can to call upon your governments, to call upon whoever you can for ceasefire and also an end to the siege on Gaza, so that humanitarian aid can really get into this country, which is what is needed, what is necessary, and what is deserved. Palestinians deserve dignity, and it is our job to fight in every way possible to make that happen."

For the last six months, I have to wake up to messages of my cousin being shot on his bike, of my aunt going blind because she can't get medicated for her blood pressure, of my entire uncle's house falling down on them. Everyone in that home died. Jesus. I like to see photos like my family and body bags make the rounds on Twitter. I have to see my last name scroll on them in black ink. This morning I got the news that the home that's been sheltering part of my family for the last 6 months has been fully evacuated. Last night, pamphlets drops all around their neighborhood. Last night, their next door neighbor was bombed, and everyone in that home was killed. The pamphlet said, you have to leave now. You have to evacuate now or face the violence of the Israeli occupation. My ox foot's been broken for 6 months. She's never received treatment. Most of my cousins are sick, hungry, tired. There's been no food, there's no water. They've been drinking sea water since week 3, trying to survive. And they've now evacuated the structure that was keeping them Out of the fucking cold, by the way. No windows, no doors. All those are pulling off my bombs now. They're headed to Morossi, a coastal, quote, unquote safe zone in Gaza. Hoping they'll find a tent to sleep in.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I'd like to announce, after eight long hours of negotiation yesterday with Chancellor Wilcox, Provos Elizabeth Watkins, and Vice Chancellor Haynes, in partnership with Doctor Christine Victorino and Hibba Naslaud, we have decided that we have gotten to an agreement that robustly meets our demands, which LED to the dissolution of this encampment. Today is our love letter to the people of US up and to the people of Palestine. We have watched them stead, fastly, and patiently and bravely stand in the face of the oppressors, in a way with Grace and in a way with faith. Inspired by them, we decided to do the same this Monday. And I can say that we are the first in the UC system so peacefully we have on this campus that shares our vision of justice, that shares our vision to be progressive, that shares our vision of protecting our students. We have decided to dissolve this encampment without a single arrest, a single one of you being put in harm's way, so we will no longer be complicit in the crimes perpetrated against my people. Yeah! We have four very clear demands going into this. First, we demand a transparency. We needed the university to disclose all of their investments and endowments, specifically as it relates to arms and weapons manufacturing. We can say that the university has agreed to make it entirely transparent which companies we are investing in and the size of those investments. And we will Continue to call for transparency moving forward. Following that, we called on this administration to end their silence. Chancellor Wilcox has recognized the death toll and Liza. And we will continue to figure out ways for this administration to support you students here. Next, we called on divestment. I am confident that we have outlined concrete, legitimate steps for us to no longer be complicit through our financial. Through our financial engagements at this university. We are going in the right direction, and I am confident we will fully divest from weapons and arms manufacturing by the end of next year. Actually, I'm not gonna make any promise. Lastly, we call for our full academic boycott. Students at UC Riverside will no longer be able to walk the lands that I am prohibited from. At this university. Will no longer be able to see my Holy Land that I embarked from. As long as there's an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, students at the university of California, Riverside will not walk the land that I am banned from. Yeah. I just wanna thank every single person who has invested in this encampment anyway, materially, emotionally. To the people who Venmo, to the people who dropped off food, to the people who slept here, to the people who sent words of support, to the medics who volunteered, to our legal observers, to our police liaisons, our media liaisons, to every single person who offered support, every single person who visited, to The children who blew bubbles. To the people who drew the talk, to the people who put up the signs, to the people who stood that fast with us. I want to thank you, because this is your win. No, this is all yours. I want to. I want to also say.",

Guys, like, at this point, are you just, like, lying for fun? The top comment on this article, thank god. Was a great MLK quote. To sum it up, it's over the last few years, I've been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. The great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the this thing that I'm not gonna say, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action. There's another line in the article that stood out to me and many commenters. You know, I admire your empathy for Gauzens, but what about the risks to commencements? Oh, goodness, you're right. Commencement speeches in G Slide clearly carry the same weight. Shut up, Nick. No meaningful changes ever come about by asking nicely. Nice to know you care more about property damage than human lives. Isn't this the exact same thing every old white pro war dude Has said about activists ever. The New York Times has had a lot of fumbles recently, but this guy saying that it's useful for universities to have exchanges with places whose policies we disagree with has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever read."

HR 6 0 9:00 0 known as the Anti Semitism Awareness Act will redefine anti Semitism as set forth by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance for the enforcement of federal anti discrimination laws. What does that mean? Well, if you say that Israel is a racist state, that's anti Semitism. If you draw comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, that's also anti Semitism in practice. If this Bill also passes in the Senate, it would be illegal for Americans to voice opinions such as how Israel cannot be by definition both a Jewish state and a Liberal democracy. As this op ed in the Jerusalem Post points out, this would be anti Semitic and illegal to say. Or how it's racist for there to be segregated roads that separate Palestinian and Jewish settlers in Jerusalem. Criticism like these would also be considered anti Semitic and therefore would be legal to say. Even though this is in harats. Or if you wanna criticize the IDF, their shoot first, ask later policy, that is also anti Semitic and therefore you would not be allowed to say it. It's funny, you could bash America all day long, but if you dare voice criticism of Israel, then that would not only make you an anti Semite, but in the future that could also mean that You could be sued, persecuted or sanctioned by the federal government",

What you just saw was a video of an Israeli quad copter being recorded in Gaza. A quad copter, for those of you who don't know, is sort of shorthand for one of these small Israeli drones that are used by Israeli occupational forces. Those drones are generally tasked with multiple things, ranging from surveillance to the outright murder of Palestinians. And in fact, recently, the organization Euromed Human Rights Monitor released a report claiming that Israeli occupational forces are systematically using quadcoppers to kill Palestinians from a close distance in Gaza. They note that the IOF has been using these small drones to fire directly at Palestinians, killing and injuring many. And from the data and testimony they were able to obtain, they found that Israeli sniping operations, killings and executions primarily target unarmed civilians in shelter centers, hospital streets, and populated residential areas. These civilians posing no threat or danger to anyone as they are not participants in any hostilities. Really critical to understand that, right. Israeli occupational forces are using snipers and these quadcopter drones to execute Palestinians in places like shelter centers, hospitals, just around the street and within populated residential areas. In effect, Israeli occupational forces, in the midst of their ongoing genocide in Gaza, are waging a systematic mechanized campaign of extrajudicial killings. And these quadcopters are playing a major Role helicopter is being used for an even more nefarious purpose, as it was playing the recordings of a crying child. The intent there is to get Palestinians to come out of the areas in which they're sheltering and or hiding because they're, you know, wanting to help a child in need. So that Israeli occupational forces can murder them. I want you to really let that sink in. Israeli occupational forces are using the recordings of crying children on their drones to lure out Palestinians so that they can murder them. That is a sort of twisted, undeniable evil that many of us will likely struggle to wrap our heads around. But it is just one part of a much larger, brutal genocide being waged against Palestinians in Gaza in across occupied Palestine. As Palestinians in Gaza are hiding and trying to avoid Israeli bombardment and invasion, Israeli occupational forces are upping their strategies in order to essentially hunt Palestinians for sport. Something really, really worth thinking on. But he has always free Palestine. Salamo. They come. Until next time."

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, we have to have a talk. We really do, because I'm looking at my for you page, and I haven't made a video about it yet, but, like, Iran is doing a lot of stuff, um, launching missiles to Israel and stuff like that. War 3 stirrings are happening again, even though World War 3 is basically already started. It's just that your empire hasn't announced it yet. But I'm seeing a lot of glamorizing of war, and I need you guys to understand that war is never good. It may be necessary, but it's not something to be happy hype about. I saw a creator on here saying, let's get ready to rumble at the news about Iran launching missiles. Do you understand that there's a genocide going on right now? What the fuck are you happy about? One, Israel already has the Iron Dome, so it's gonna take a lot more than what Iran is doing to penetrate and actually inflict real harm upon Israel. 2. The Palestinian people are still going to be affected in a negative way regardless of what every other country is doing to Israel in the United States. So again, I'm not saying it's not necessary to get to this point in which we're potentially going into a World War 3, even though War 3 has started. Like I said before, but it's not anything to be happy about. So please, for the content creators that are making major money off of this news dissemination, Put down the sensationalism and go back to talking about the people that are being affected. Or at the very least, if you're gonna talk about the potential of World War 3, don't be happy about it. It's just a request, bro. Just a request."

First I just cut a watermelon in half, throw the other half away, and now you just put a bunch of slices in it vertical, and then flip it the other way and put a bunch of horizontal slices in it. And you'll get these right here. Put a popsicle stick in it just so it's easier to hold. Now pull out your fruit roll UPS, and now it's pretty simple. You just wrap it. The hardest part is when the watermelons wet, keep slipping off. But you'll get it and it'll look like this. I made a bunch of them. I made blue, yellow, orange, all types of colors. Now we're gonna grab our chamoy or Tajin. And I'm making a bunch of them because my little cousins told me to make these. Somehow they always know the trends before me. I dipped it in my chamoy, dropped it in my Tajin, and now these things look insane. Squirted some lime on top and took a bite. It was sour as hell cause I used so much Tajin, but it was. Now see what my little cousins think about it. They threw some lemon on it, and Jake just dipped his whole entire watermelon into Chamoy. But for the most part, that look fire.",
