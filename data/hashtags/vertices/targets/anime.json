I was waiting for so long, but I finally got to say because I didn't wanna like jump the gun but still I knew was hitting on the trajectory to get there. My hero is officially the best new gen out and it's not close. JJK just simply does not have the depth in the layers of my hero. And if you think it does, you only read JJK. You don't read my hero. JJK is simply cooler and more mature. But there is no tone presented in JJK that's not presented in my hero. Along with other tones that Horikoshi does perfectly, yes, it's passing. Demon Slayer 2 Demon Slayer will always hold a high spot in new gen because it brought most of you to anime in the first place. Demon Slayer started the whole anime boom when people was bored during lockdown. This got a lot of people either back into anime or into anime. Demon Slayer definitely has the entertainment value of my hero, but it doesn't really have the complexity of my hero. Boruto I can't say much on cause I'm not caught up, but from what I read of Boruto so far, my hero is clearing. Yes, even chainsaw man? Of all popular new gens, my hero has to be the best. Even Fire Force? Let's be honest, Shinra and Benimaru carry. They don't have characters like all might Shigaraki twice Toga, Midoriya, Todoroki, Mirio, Bakugo. I can go on. Fire Force has characters, but if we keep listing, they can't go bar for bar with my hero. It's just not gonna happen. So shout out to my hero for officially becoming the best new gen, at least in terms of super popular manga. It's a well deserved spot, and I hope these final chapters wrap up the story beautifully."

He got his, he reactivated his account, and my boy ND he was talking about him. So I sent the live to him. Unfortunately, he respond. He responded very quickly, went in the live and have us talk about the fact that he did have evidence. Cause the entire time, Draco was talking about, um, no one has evidence. Um, you know, like these burner accounts. I would never make something like that, even though. But you could say all the shit that you've been saying. Andy comes up and it's like, let me in the live, let me up, let me show the evidence. And then Draco, funny enough, says, I will only let you up on the condition that you don't swear. Even though he was swearing the entire time before. Andy says, I will be civil. But then Draco goes, um, let me think, actually. And then goes on this whole rant about how everyone's out to get him, that those accounts aren't his, kind of backs down and says that he's going to sue and d. Take him to court or that they'll box, which, uh, yeah, let's be real that that wouldn't happen. Draco, I knew from day one that you could never stand on business, because the way you talk in your videos just completely projects the fact that you cannot do Anything to defend yourself. The fact that you had the nerve to go after my mutual ex saying, the fact that, oh, you're in the military and I refuse to go live with you, and you honestly tried using what's happening in Palestine, you had the nerve to use that as a reason why you can't defend yourself. X has nothing to do with what's happening over there. Him serving in the military, which, by the way, I wasn't even aware. So, X, when you see this, no, thank you for your service, but I just find it revolting that you not only use that, you're trying to out be out here defending yourself against the shit that's publicly out of everything that you've been saying, all the aces you are talking so big about someone, but the moment I send this to them, they come up, say, let me in the live, and they agree to your terms, only for you to back down and start being scared and start going after him, saying that you'll either take him to court or boxing, which, let's be real, you're not gonna do either. I just find that revolting. I find it just even more revolting that there's people defending this, which. Come on, dude. Anyways, I just thought I'd make that update. I just found it atrocious and TikTok in no way. This is not harassment. This is me simply documenting what is going on."

No, cause I was almost named Theo, and I like that name. Okay, well, my reason, bro, it's not about you. I was about you because I really like Theodore Roosevelt and I wrote like a big paper on him.

Because outside of the fact that this would be a subversion of expectations, what good would the writing do if sukuna won? What it would mean for the story is that sukuna was right the entire time. Throwing everything away for the sake of power is the correct way to do things in the world of jujutsu society. That being alone is better than being surrounded by those you love. And I'm not saying that you can't have a different ideological perspective, but why would that be the perspective that you guys would want to win in the end? There's a reason that the power of friendship is such a trope, not just in shonen, but just in media in general. Because in real life, there's no part of oh yeah, let me just be alone always and forever. That sounds like an actually legitimately good idea, and even logically from any kind of media. Whenever you're battling somebody, there's literally strength in numbers. That's a saying for a reason. So despite everything, I don't think Tsuka is gonna win in the end. Utes being inside of Gojo's body is definitely going to lead them to a victory eventually. And thank you anonymous for the sponsored video. But yeah, I don't think that Suka is going to team wipe, and I certainly don't want him to team wipe.",

And when I tell you cold heartedly this shit on Tokyo revenge windbreaker, when I tell you the fights, the hand to hand brought out fights are incredible. Behind that all, there is a true story about each character and the characters we presented thus far. I'm just like, wow. And I'm only anime only, only I don't read the manga. There's a manga for this? Or you know, whatever, this. I don't read it. But what we've gotten thus far from the characters that have been presented is Incredible. And the last episode. The last episode was was honestly probably the best anime episode of the of the week. That shit was incredible. That shit was incredible. Anime has has heart. This anime has rawness. This anime has kick ass fight choreograph. This anime is good. I'm looking. I'm so happy to see where this anime goes and it caught me off guard. But you tell me TikTok, what's an anime that caught you off guard that you did not expect to be as good as it is? Like for me with windbreaker. I wanna know. And are you watching windbreaker? If you're not watching",

Like, I just saw an article that was talking about how light is one of the smartest people in all of anime, but like, even in his own show, he's kind of a dumbass. Like, on one hand, I kind of get it. We're watching the story from his perspective, and we constantly hear his internal monologue as he talks about how he is the most brilliant person to have ever lived, how no one can hold up to his rigorous intellectual might. But, like, objectively, if you look at his actions throughout the story, he's an idiot. He is given a perfect, untraceable weapon that can kill anyone, anywhere in the world any way he wants, and he has wiretaps in his room. Within seven episodes, light does nothing but make blunder after blunder, mistake after mistake, all while monologging about how smart he is. Light Yagami isn't a genius, he's just a narcissist. He's a high schooler with a god complex, and the only reason he ever had the upper hand on anyone is because he was the only one who knew the rules to the game that they were all playing.",

Let me show you what it is and let me see if you've seen it before. So it's called A regular at Magic High School, and I've only watched the first two episodes of it and it's not looking really great for me. So I thought this anime was gonna be more like how classroom delete is, but it feels more towards like the mad guys grandson, which that was a terrible anime by itself, but I'm not sure. I've only watched the first two episodes so. So if you've seen this anime before, let me know. Let me know if it's worth watching. But if you guys really want me to like, kind of watch it just to see how it is so you guys don't have to watch it, I'll do so.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so I got tagged in this post showing all the characters that Saitama could beat in a fight, so let's talk about it. First slide we have Gojo, Naruto, and Luffy. I'm not sure how Saitama is gonna bypass Gojo's Infinity, but if the battle lasts long enough then I can see Saitama growing strong enough to defeat Gojo. As for Naruto and Luffy, Saitama absolutely washes the both of them. Next slide we have Meliodas, Ryuk, and Adam. Even though Saitama scales above Meliodas, Meliodas is immortal and in his strongest form he has all the commandments, which is just an insane set of hacks. So Saitama loses with Ryuk? The battle can honestly go either way because Saitama can definitely defeat Ryuk. But Saitama is a human, so Ryuk can just write his name in the death note then. As for Adam, Saitama just destroys him. In the next slide Saitama destroys Deku and Boruto, but then loses to Krillin. I don't even know why this is a debate anymore. Like massively outscale Saitama. Next up it's absolutely ridiculous to think that Saitama could even touch Anos or Saber. Both of these characters would toy with Saitama. I haven't watched Mashle yet, so I'm not sure if mash would lose to Saitama or not. Then in the next slide Saitama will lose to Geronimo and Yuhubak. Their hacks are just too much for Saitama to overcome. However, he will beat Asta because anti magic is just useless. Against someone who is just pure physical force. Next up, Saitama defeats mob. I already said that. He loses to Geronimo. And then Saitama versus Alucard. Honestly, this battle would end in a stalemate. Or alucard will pull it off because Saitama has no way of defeating this immortal. Being the next slide, we have Zarif, Gilgamesh, and Goku, and all three of them would absolutely destroy Saitama. Moving on. I have no idea who this first guy is, but if he's anything close to featherine or Hajime, then Saitama is getting one tapped. And then the last and final slide. I mean, it's gotta be satire, because no way is Saitama defeating all of the anime verse, all of the Marvel verse, or all of fiction for that matter."

That was, like, the best channel. What do you miss most about that era? The fact that you could be nerds in secret. Like, nerd culture is, like, too open now, and, like, everybody can watch. Watch. I found a YouTube channel with every anime I've ever watched, and it's just. You should have access. You should go to a VHS store and have to look for it yourself. Like, you shouldn't be allowed to just have access to all the anime. Do you feel like anime has become too mainstream at this point? I do.

Now y'all know I love Demon Slayer, and I'm not one to downplay the Demon Slayer verse, but kokoshibo is getting cooked. Now. The Demon Slayer verse in terms of speed is not too far off from Jujutsu Kaisen. In terms of speed? Because Jujutsu Kaisen characters aren't really known for their speed besides my glorious King Kashimo. With that being said, speed alone is not going to be enough for kokoshibo to win this matchup, especially since he's still slower than sukuna. Not only is Coco Shibo just straight up slower, but sukuna is just overall stronger. He has better strength beats, he has better abilities, better hacks. All around he's just better. The only thing Kokoshima really has going for him is his regeneration factor. But his regeneration factor is not gonna matter when he gets hit with a malevolent shrine and gets obliterated into dust. So yeah, high and air Sukana absolutely takes this.",

Everybody else is regrouping while Naruto is getting his ass. While they're out here regrouping, getting their shit together. And then she decides to go after, but luckily a tailed beast inside him pushes his shit to the map, helps him get out of a tough spot. And then she goes back to whooping his ass. Continues to whoop his ass. Continues to whoop his ass. Finally they get to the dimension. I mean, are you really just gonna leave out the fact that Naruto can just overpower blatantly here with boy release and literally send her flying into a fucking cliff? Uh, what about Naruto literally chopping her arm off? I mean, this is literally illustrating to you that, yeah, Naruto is indeed relative to Kaguya the fucking delusional. You're getting your ass whooped, but because you got too good lick. Oh, oh, you're. You're relative? No. Not to mention, I think we're. I think we're missing apart. Naruto was not only amped in that fight. What part of he had help did you not understand? This is crazy. Y'all take him being amp you're like, oh, well, he was relative, so he. No, he's not, because he doesn't have all this anymore. Even when he did, it didn't help him. The only reason why bro got out. Of that is because again, one of the jinchuriki pushed his shit to the limit and gave him immense physical strength. Which is said, oh, got one good lick, and that was it. And she went right back to tool in his shit. Y'all is lame! Y'all are a bunch of lame! That bad enough with Naruto Sasuke I sent to that gravity dimension. They were going to die. If it wasn't for Kakashi and oh boy, Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't be here no more. They would be gone! That's how trash y'all are as a fanbase. You take him cutting off one arm and getting one good lick, and you're like, oh, he's right. No, he's not. If it wasn't for everybody pitching in to help Naruto, he be dead. He wouldn't even be here no more. There is no world or a dimension where he could have fought her by himself. He had all the tail beast. He had all his friends. He had Kakashi, he had Sasuke, he had Sakura, he had everybody. And if everybody didn't help, he would be gone. Matter of fact, he didn't even beat her by himself. If it wasn't for Sakura, they never would have sealed her. Because even with all that power, he can't kill an immortal. Hey, bro. Punched her one time and all she did was flying to a mountain. It didn't even destroy the mountain, just put a little hole in it. That's your physical strength, you Punched her into a mountain and there was a hole. Y'all are trash."

A lot of the times people try to shoot for a job that's gonna give them all their financial stability and their emotional stability in one place. That is rare. That is incredibly rare. Your dream job is incredibly rare. Do a job that pays the bills. Do a job that pays the bills and use your hobbies to emotionally fulfill yourself. It's the easiest route and you will be able to have a fully complete life without having to worry. Because if you lose the job, you don't lose your dream job. You just lose a job and you keep all of your hobbies, which are emotionally fulfilling you anyway.",

But nobody really picked up on this thread about this right here. So I talk to a lot of people, and whenever I ask them why they wanna be a content creator or an influencer, they almost always say something like that, right? Obviously not that harsh, but, like, they want the money, they want the status, they want the notoriety, they want free products. There's gonna be a time where your dreams come true. You get the money that you wanted, you get your body done. You buy the presents, you buy all the, you know, the house, the car, then you do the nice travelling. And then just like anything else you buy, that loses its shock value. And all of a sudden, the fancy car you bought just becomes a regular car, right? Everything loses its shock value. So then what. What I'm doing for y'all right now is teaching you a life fucking lesson. You don't get to bully no fucking body and then be mad. When the rabbit got the gun. It ain't no fun. When the rabbit got the gun. And I'm Bugs Bunny, bitch. And what happens is some influences get lost on the core of business, which is to provide a solution to a problem. She could have totally Flip this around, right? Like, turn it into a series like on the road to pretty privilege, exposing how society treats fat people or whatever. Bigger people, like second class citizens. And she could have created a whole community around that. And brands would love to get behind that. That's a real message that brands would love to empower. And she would get the brand deals that she's complaining about. Right? And even if the brands didn't come, she can create her own community. It's not too late. But this is not the right angle. All the money that we want is in other people's pockets. If you wanna make more money, put people first. I know it sounds so cheesy, but do not let this world turn you hard. Do not let bullies win. Do not become the bully. Do not become anything that you hate. Transfer that energy into helping people.",

didn't say certain things because she was fat and although portions of that might be true the reason why you're talking now is not because you want to bring attention to the wealth disparities and the pay disparities amongst black women and white women in content creation that's not why you're doing it you're doing it because you thought that these white people loved you for who you are and they and because you wear this token black girl you thought that your tokenness was going to get you a seat at the table when really it just got you a seat in the room but you they over there having a conversation and they not letting you know what they talking about you got on this app misusing intersectionality and misusing code-switching to manipulate people to make people think that this was all purposeful when really you're just angry at these people that you have wasted your entire life trying to appease now you realising that they don't like you now you're realising your tokenness your tokenness is only gonna get you so far period so what we're witnessing right now is Fannita lashing out she's lashing out and the reason why she's doing it over social media is because that's where she's gonna have the most casualties you're lashing when you do when you are not in therapy and you do not have the proper coping mechanisms to deal with the anger that's inside of you due to the injustice that you feel like were brought upon you you're going to lash out and because she has 2.3 million followers she's going to lash out in front of these people because that's where the most of her attention is gonna come from that's where she's gonna feel like she's getting all of this relief off of her chest Is if she lash out in front of all these people because that's what mass majority of her people are and during that lashing out you are attacking other black women first of all leave Mecca out of your mess because Mecca didn't do nothing to you second of all you're going a Decadent Dayne for something that maybe her delivery was poor but what she said was absolutely true and you're mad at it and then you started to make fun of her accent and it's just so problematic is so problematic and instead of you looking on the inside putting your phone down and saying maybe it's not these people's fault maybe it's my own fault you're lashing out because you're mad because you're not white you thought that you was gonna call out Alix you thought that you were gonna lose weight and that was gonna put you right next to Alix Earle because you thought that your only issues were that because you were fat and that was it you're not understanding that your blackness you you are black before you are anything so please don't get on this app trying to make it seem like \u201cI'm talking up now because I just I I'm tired I couldn't say things before cause I was fat\u201d you didn't say anything before because you thought that your issues were stemming from your fatness that's what your you didn't care about the blackness you don't give a fuck about no paid disparities amongst black women that's why you sitting on these videos talking about people in the projects and with roaches and eating noodles or whatever you were talking chicken nuggets spinning them far away whatever you were talking about you don't care about black women you don't care about the pay disparities you don't care about economic justice your issue is because these white folk are looking at you like um yeah we liked you when you were fat because we could poke fun of you being fat but now you're just black and a woman and we can't out loud poke fun and things like that so um your services may no longer be needed that that that's why you're upset it's insane then you get on this app talking about \u201coh my best friends are white\u201d we know Fannita  we know we know your your best friends are white we know okay at the end of the day you thought you were gonna lose weight put on that Versace robe and sit next to Alix Earle because your whole life you have been evading the fact that your blackness is the number one contributor to the way you get treated and now you are angry now you are mad you did that to yourself whatever schools you went to whatever your whatever you who put you on what that's on you and like Decadent Dayne said you were okay with getting the scraps and now you mad take your anger to somebody else cause honestly Fannita we do not care we don't care I'm sorry I'm not sorry we don't care"

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so I already have a lot of responses on that video, so let's address some of the most common one. For starters, it has been a long time since I watched Gordon Lagan, and I didn't remember that he could apparently use his powers without the mech. In my memory it was him in a mech the whole time, so I was like, yeah, that's just a dude. But if he can indeed do all that stuff without a mech, like throwing galaxies and shit, then yeah, absolutely Simone. But that even further solidifies what I was saying in that video, that the people who make these lists have no fucking clue what they're doing. $2 for a guy who throws galaxies? You put the galaxy man next to a boy with swords and some ziplines. Then up next, a lot of people were saying that picking light is ridiculous. You're ridiculous. Light doesn't know my name. If he doesn't know my name, he can't kill me. But I can kill him. I don't even need one of these people to kill him. I'll kill light myself. And then finally, the character that I think is a wild card in the scenario, Ichigo. Ichigo is either a very dangerous threat or not really a threat at all, depending on how his powers interact with different verses. Cause like if you're doing any sort of like verse equalization or shit like that, Ichigo gets nerfed pretty hard. But if he Has his canon ability of instantly killing anyone who doesn't have the same powers as him. Yeah, that's a bit of a threat. All in all I stand by what I said in that video though. The people who make these lists have no fucking clue what they're talking about. And apparently sometimes I don't either.",

    "voice_to_text": "Gojo Glazers are not gonna like this. But believe it or not, this fight was almost for no reason. Maybe asking bro, what do you mean? Gojo made him get rid of world cutting slash and he made him not use a domain expansion keep game. In order to activate the world cutting slash, the same hand sign used from a leveling shrine in Mitten was required. However, with only one hour remaining prior to their transformation, sukuna was forced to impose a binding valve to the activation conditions for all preceding uses of the move in order to cut Gojo. And now that I look at the damage sukuna took from hollow purple, the only thing he is missing is his fucking arm. So you're telling me if it wasn't for that little bit of damage on his arm, if that damage would have went somewhere else to like his leg, he would have been able to perform the world cutting slash whenever he wanted, even after he transform? Mind you, this is after a black flashed amp Gojo using purple because he was missing a little bit of his arm. Not even the whole thing, just a part he needed to fucking do the slash. That was enough for him to use a binding vow. Gojo is extremely lucky that that hollow purple did the damage where it was supposed to. If it hadn't, this battle would have been for no reason.",

I've watched them. I have. You all aren't safe. I mean, first off, you like fairy tale. Alright, like that. That already tells me enough about you. But like, you have to ask yourself, of all the ones you could watch, why fairy tale? Why? There are so many out there that are just infinitely better. So why? You got AOT, Dragon Ball, JoJo, one piece, JJK, Fire Force, Tokyo Ghoul, my hero. Just to name a few. So I just can't understand why anyone would willingly, willingly watch Fairy Tail. Yeah, I get it. I'm only five episodes in. But that's all you really need to realize. It ain't that good. No amount of explaining is going to convince me to watch that show. None. Oh, but the first episode is getting to know. I don't care. I don't. Should have made getting another characters better. Should have built the story up better within those five episodes. You should have. The characters just weren't interesting. They really weren't. Once Natsu used the same attack like 20 times in those five episodes, it kind of just became repetitive. And I just knew that was gonna be the case for quite some time. And really, I don't wanna sit through all that. I didn't. Now I know you guys Are thinking out loud right now. If you even made it this far into the video or typing in the comments. You said one piece. One piece is longer than fairy tale, so make that make sense. Here's the difference. One piece is actually good. Unlike Fairy Tale, one piece has everything it doesn't. A consistent story that's actually good, characters that you can actually vibe with, pacing that isn't life draining to watch, and a main character that I actually like. So doesn't really matter what you say. I hate Fairy Tale. It's not good, and you're never gonna convince me to watch it.",

Joey starts the series as someone who doesn't even fully understand the game of dual masters. He goes from just barely knowing how to play the game to topping in the Duelist Kingdom tournament and go into Battle City. And not only is he in a new tournament with higher level players, but he's also got to learn a new rule set alongside those other players. He's holding his own, he's working his way up through the ranks. He gets possessed by Merrick and forced to fight against his friends, but makes it out because of the love that they share. Gets into the top four of the Battle City Tournament and goes against Merrick where he is winning the game. If things continue as they are, Joey will play his last card, his gearfree, the Iron Knight, and he will finish off Merrick. Just like the other three people in the top 4, he has something special that he's gonna use to cheat. And in his case, it's using the wing dragon of raw to burn away Joey's soul. Joey deserves that win. How is that legal? Not to mention, before Joey finally collapses, he plays Gearfree, the Iron Knight and he gives the command to attack. So not only did Merrick cheat, Not only did he physically and spiritually assault his opponent, but even after that attack, before it finally took Joey out, he did what he needed to do to win. He played the card he needed to play, and he gave the command he needed to give. And because of the fact that he passed out, they said, oh, sorry, disqualification because he can't move. That is ridiculous.",

I'm gonna have 4 and still keep going. I am, of course, talking about the legend herself, Rumiko Takahashi. Urusei Yatsura, mice, Nikoku Rama 1/2, Inuyasha. Any of these four works alone would be a career highlight for the average manga artist, but Rumiko Takahashi was able to replicate that magic four times. In fact, I would be pressed to find an anime fan that hasn't at least heard of one of these works.

    "voice_to_text": "If Mushoku Tensei isn't supposed to be a redemption story, then what's the point in making Rudius so awful? You know, the kind of guy who constantly harasses women, and when two girls are bullying a friend of his, his solution to the bullying is to kidnap them and tie them up in his bedroom. If you're going to give a character flaws that glaring, or indeed any personality traits, they need to serve a purpose in the narrative. That's why I had assumed that Mushoku Tensei was supposed to be a redemption story. You know, a tale of someone overcoming those flaws and then atoning for the damage they caused. Because if it isn't, then what is it? Because I'll tell you what Mushoku Tensei is not. It's not a tragedy, the kind of story where the heroes own serious flaws end up leading to his destruction. Or even a comedy like South Park or it's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where you're supposed to laugh at the protagonist for being a terrible person. No, Mushoku Tensei maintains the tone of a fantasy adventure. It's just one where the protagonist touches children. And if that's not meant to be a crime that he needs to face justice for, then either this story sees that only as a flaw on the same level as being unemployed, or it's just included as pandering to the edgy kids who enjoy subversive content for its own sake.",

    "voice_to_text": "Who's the strongest anime fight user here? Let's go straight into it. This is a semi repeat from the last one that I did. People weren't happy with what I said, so let's go again. And the weakest is Roma Stank. He's just a regular human that can shoot fire out of his hand. That isn't like literally. I think I could beat this guy in a fight. I am the honored one for the next start of the Roma stank. Give me Sukuna! Are we really counting Sukuna as a fire user these days? Although these hand signs are low key cool as you go, low key it's cold. I'll be honest, people love to deride ace because 1. He's from one piece and 2. He's from one piece. But ace was not all that strong, at least from what he showed, and I refused him to put him any higher. And now to No. 4. Gimme Dabi! The only thing that gets in between him and ace is the fact that ace is a low gear. But in outright strength Dobby is strong with the top tier of my hero academia. They would be able to deal with ace outside of the fact that he's a Logan. And then out at No. 5. Give me Mary Leona Vermillion of her just being a Btech Yamamoto now. Apparently her reincarnating the dead with hell flames. Not bad. With her speed and, I don't know, raw strength and ferocity. I Would love to hit. I would love to hit if you look like Marilyn Monroe. Come here baby. Come here baby. But anyway, then out of No. 4, give me escanor. He's more durable than Mariano, physically stronger, his flames are just more likely hotter since he uses the sun. Honestly convinced Escanor could. I can't say that on TikTok. But anyway, top 3 Benimaru, Natsu and Yamamoto. And this is where people weren't happy in the last video. So I'm going to say No. 3 Yamamoto, seeing as his Bankai release was going to destroy the whole of the soul society. That's fair then in No.. 2 and 1, Natsu or Benimaru? Benimaru easily one shot at someone that was going to destroy the whole planet, so he's well above planetary. Not so. I don't know these feats for fairy tale bro, but the fact that Natsu can eat flame, there isn't much that Yamamoto can do. You guys tell me who you would put to No. 1. I'm going to guess and say Benimari. No. 1 No.. 2 Natsu. No.. 3 Yamamoto. Goodbye. Mwah!",

I'm gonna show you how wrong they are. But we need the full context. How was she able to pull this off? Now, this is what is important. It's not just the fact that this is how it's created, but it's how she was able to do it. This route. Time space is mother's exclusive domain where she can directly extract Chakra from Shinobi trapped in the Infinite Tsukiyomi. The Biju are now stable. Plus, mother has even produced a truth seeker orb. So the reason why she was able to create this true secret or was because she took the chakra from all of the people from the infinite tsukiyomi. She was gathering their chakra so that she was able to create this. If you've seen Naruto, you would know that Kaguya absorbed the chakra into herself before creating the truth Seeker orb. Now, why is this important? Kaguya was only replenishing the chakra she had already lost. How do we know this? Kaguya used the amino Minako total of four times during her fight, swapping two universes, each time, moving a total of eight universes. This, of course, got her fatigued. Now, if you've seen Naruto, you would know that if Kaguya didn't scale to the amount of chakra she absorbed, she'd have exploded. Which is exactly What happened to Madara when Kaguya's chakra went inside of him? I will say again. You cannot absorb more chakra than you scale to. You will explode. So for those who don't know anything about Naruto, Kaguya totally scales the trucycle. Does anybody have rebuttal to that? Anybody? I've delivered my rebel, and I'm curious to what you would say to it, actually. Will you even respond? Or will you block me? Or maybe you'll say in my Ra. So perhaps I was wrong. Regardless of what it is, I await your response."

Like, when you really think about it, Marco has been pulling out insane feats from the moment he was introduced to current. Like, not only is this man trading blows with all three admirals at Marine Fort, not only was he holding off big mom briefly, my man's can even stall Kaido while running on E after everybody is pretty much defeated at the end of Wana. And people might try to bring up but he got beat by Kizara at Marine Fort. Listen, was fighting Kizaru perfectly fine until he saw his father have a heart attack in the middle of the back. Look at Marco's face right here. He's the doctor of the crew. This is where he got caught off guard. And it's understandable. And even then, that encounter was a 2 v 1 for Marco cause he was fighting Vice Admiral Onigumo and Kizar. If onigumo didn't put the cuffs on him, Kizar wasn't doing this to him. And once the cuffs are off, he's back at it again fighting the kind. So put some respect on Marco's name."

I would rather be subjected to gay gays inhumane ideas when it comes to jujutsu Kaisen then have to sit through a single episode of fairy tale. This is still going on? I could not tell you. I dropped this entire show after the fifth episode. It is quite literally the same thing over and over and over again. I don't care if it gets better later on. When you say that, I can only assume considering it's fairy Tale, it gets good around season 5. I'm not even sure if Fairy Tale has five seasons, but I'll tell you this much, I'm not willing to find out. And the fact that this whole thing is trending on Twitter right now is crazy. And the glaze for this show itself is astronomical. People are already claiming it's going to be the anime of the year, as if it's ever been the anime of the year and it's entire existence. There is no hope for this. I don't care who's working on it. Fairy tale is about as predictable as wondering if the Sun's gonna come up in the morning. We already know it's going to. And in this case, we know it's terrible. There was quite literally no substance, any of this at all. I couldn't care less that there was a new season coming out. Nothing about this will change. Nothing. It's still as bad as it was In the first episode, as it is in the last episode of whatever this is.",

    "voice_to_text": "Miles does not scale to Blackheart. He left out miles needing to use Captain America shield. Let's stay consistent with that line of logic. Naruto needed Sakura. This downscale's Naruto significantly because he was never gonna seal her without her help. You could argue that Naruto failed where Sakura succeeded. So it was more or less Sakura that be Kage, not even Naruto. He just had the sealing technique that was given to him by the sage of six Paths. So without that, he's not relative to Kaguya whatsoever. Like current Naruto and Boruto where he doesn't possess the nine tails Chakra. He lost his state nowhere near Kaguya. Doesn't scale to her whatsoever. He also needed Obito and Kakashi just to bring this individual down again. Tripling quadruplet down. Naruto is not relative to Kage in any shape, way or form. Especially when he himself stated this chakra is even stronger than the 10 tail. This dark chakra that was coming from the ground was from all the people stuck in infinite tsukiyomi. All this chakra that she obtained in the rebirth. Who stated that the Ten tails has almost infinite chakra. And this is how we know every statement in power scaling in Naruto is hyperbolic. This is why there's only statements in Naruto. Because they're supposed to build up these character. But you're never gonna see any feat because all these statements are hyperbolic. Ten tails possesses infinite chakra. The 10 tail. First they plant the 10 Tails in the ground, it grows into a divine tree, consumes the planet, and eventually bears a chakra fruit. Kaguya eating that chakra. First off, the 10 tail is not just a divine tree. It's mother herself as well. This is saying Kaguya scales to the 10 tails supposedly because she ate the chakra fruit that was beared by the divine tree. But one thing does does not say Kagi is gonna have the same durability as the 10 tail. If you assume that just because she ate the fruit, you're a man. Unlike when Obito became the 10 tail, Kagi has always been the one more dominant, more in control because she ate the chakra fruit. But this is how we know just because you ate the chakra fruit means absolutely nothing. Here's a sage of six pads saying he's out of chalk. The man that defeated the 10 tails the first time around, saying, I don't have infinite chakra. I don't scale to the 10 tailed. Kagi needed to extract chakra from the Shinobi align, proving she doesn't scale to the ten tailed or the ten tails. Infinite chakra. Because if she had Infinite chakra, because she's one with the ten tail, she wouldn't need to extract any chakra. And no, I'm not missing any contact. Yes, I'm talking to you. It's Brian. Now, if there are any power scalers that have a rebuttal to that, I would love to hear it. Even another don't pick and choose What parts you want? I want. I want you to let me. I wanna hear every part like I'm being serious. Any power scaler or any Naruto fan, I would love to hear a debunk for everything that was said. Besides that, you guys have a great day. And as always, we'll be waiting. Well, we'll wait right here.",

And if I need to name drop like 15 other anime characters that were just born into fighting and, you know, training since they were children, I can because it's a plethora of them. Best believe if Ichigo knew about his powers and was training since he was 5 years old, his kid would look differently. Come on now, that's a no brainer. So he may only use gets a good 10 show or some version of gets a good 10 show. That's all he knows. He hasn't had time to develop new powers to explore his genes. So I just think we need to back off of Ichigo and and just give him some Grace.

I'm going to go over the issues that I have and let me know what you guys think. To start off using taking over gorgeous bodies a little bit weird narratively, because what is it telling us? There is a heavy emphasis placed on us by sorcerers of the past that, you know, discarding your humanity is the best way to fast track your way to power. If this is not something that you subscribe to or this is not something that you do, you will hit a glass ceiling. You will not be able to grow. Passes again according to the old age sorcerers. Now, Gojo is kind of the proof of this, but he's also kind of against this. Gojo's kind of proof of this, but he's also kind of proof against this as well. Gojo lost a little bit of his humanity when he was willing to slaughter civilians who were cheering on Rico's unaliving. Using ghetto as a more compass. He was able to realize that that was the wrong thing to do. And then he kind of goes on not really living like Sugona. Gojo instead uses his power to cultivate the next generation who he has high hopes for, expecting them to surpass him. A lot of Shinjuku showdown was a battle of ideals. Who had Gojo's ideal using his strength for his purpose. And Suguna's ideal. Using his strength for hedonistic tendencies. You did not wanting to leave Gojo alone make sense? But also at the same time, it's not really what Gojo would want for them. Instead of a battle of ideals. Yuta has already subscribed to Sukana's ideals. And now he's fighting him. This is not irredeemable. Yuta has to be punished for this. Okay, if he's not, then I do think it's a little irredeemable. The series should treat Suguna's ideology as wrong. Now, so far, Suguna hasn't received any punishment for it. But if you think as rewarded for this, well, then Suguna has the more victory. Guess what? Suguna? You were right, and this cannot be the case. Another issue that I have with this is that Gojo is expecting the new generation to surpass him. Now, I don't mean literally. I don't think he thinks Yuji, Toto and Yuta will eventually become stronger than him. But I think of the sense that they will be able to achieve something that I wasn't able to. Such as defeating sukuna. Using Gojo's corpse to do this kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm gonna be completely honest with you. Because was the way you were expecting this all along is for them to actually discard their humanity? Cause probably not, right? But like, this is just. What? I don't know. I don't know. It just. It just doesn't really sit right with me.",

They literally say it's inhumane. But you two is talking about people like you and the other Gojo fans. How long do you guys want Gojo to suffer being the monster that he is? I love this chapter because it was just a wake up call. I've been telling these Gojo fans for months! Gojo is dead! He is not coming back! But I told you guys if Gojo didn't come back, people were gonna say it was the the worst chapter of all time. It's almost like throwing away your humanity is part of getting stronger. Let me put y'all on game, cause a lot of you Gojo fans may not know this. The more and more this fight goes on, the more Sukuna's ideals become true. Just like sukuna said, you have to throw away your humanity. It's almost like hanging on to those human emotions makes them weak. I wonder who said that. Hmm. You guys love to dissect everything Gojo related, even if it doesn't make sense and contradicts what's going on in the story and how Gojo actually feels. No one said that was supposed to be a positive thing. But you guys know. Gojo fans."

Again, I already know how she does. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to make a video and explain how she makes one, while also explaining how she created her universe and how she's able to destroy a planet. Also, also, I would like you to explain how she gets the power to do all of this. Again, Naruto community you don't have to answer it, but I just wanna see if someone's going to go out and explain it. Oh, and when you. When you explain it, you have to use only the manga panels, nothing else. Only the manga panels. Okay. And don't worry, guys, I'm gonna wait. Okay, I'll be right here, waiting patiently.

I make these Uncle Ruckus videos. It's a haha joke. We all know that. There are people who believe it's true. There are people behind my back calling me a goddamn tar donkey, knuckle dragon, African baboon. That's what's happening. They cannot stand the side of us.

It's because when integration happened, these white people were like, Yo, I would rather die than to swim with a black person. That pool water will be so goddamn dirty.

    "voice_to_text": "This is going to blow your mind. A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

    "voice_to_text": "so when did cosplay become more about being conventionally attractive than actually I don't know cosplaying and why was it because of TikTok let me explain if you go to any cosplay hashtag on this app like hashtag character name cosplay if you go to any of those tags on this app you will see a lot if not all of the same exact thing you will always see white skinny conventionally attractive people at the top of every single cosplay hashtag regardless of what series it is regardless of the character obviously I'm quite white so I don't know what it's like to be a person of colour who is a cosplayer on this app however I know that I am frustrated being a plus size trans cosplayer on this app because of the way that I have seen this app treat white skinny conventionally attractive cosplayers and take them and put them on pedestals above everybody else and it's basically so that like the same genre of cosplayer is at the top of every single character tag don't you think that's messed up also frankly a little boring and if I'm frustrated I can't even imagine how frustrated other people are like I cannot imagine how frustrated people of color cosplayers are because like of the of of how this app especially has turned cosplay into who's the skinniest whitest hottest femme usually femme presenting person if I'm thinking of the most popular cosplayers on this app in my brain all of them are white skinny and conventionally attractive all of them are and I have other cosplayers I can think of in my head that aren't white and skinny and who do their makeup in a more alternative way who are popular but they aren't the top of every tag they aren't the most popular cosplayers on this app you know what I'm saying there is just more to cosplay than being hot if you want to only cosplay because you wanna be hot feel free that is your prerogative I don't care what you do with your life at all cosplay isn't just for conventionally attractive white skinny people cosplay is for everyone and if you're gonna take absolutely anything from this video I hope it's this your attention as a user of this app and apps like this app means something TikTok especially is known for this like it will push your video to other people that aren't following you and to the for you pages of other people if a lot of people like and comment and repost it and share it and all of that jazz like that's why when people are like want people to see their videos they go like comment repost and share because that shows the TikTok algorithm that you liked this video and that it show it should show this video to other people you know your views and your attention mean something on social media so are you gonna give it to a white skinny conventionally attractive cosplayer who is already getting so much attention and has like a hundreds of thousands of followers or are you gonna give it to a cosplayer who maybe isn't white maybe isn't skinny maybe does their makeup in a way that isn't conventionally attractive to do your makeup but is really artful and cool like the choice is yours we're called the cosplay community and a community means that we have to support each other so if you are a cosplayer and you relate to any of the things I was talking about in this video comment down below and people like please look at the comment section to find some cool new cosplayers to follow that you may not have seen otherwise like it is our job to lift up each other because if we don't lift up each other then no one will all cosplay truly is is nerdy people who like dressing up like their favourite fictional characters it's truly not that deep and it's definitely not a beauty pageant so as long as you're having fun that's truly all that matters and please please please stay safe and be respectful thank you"

Now, since we've established that the 10 Saigon basically has planetary lows of energy, or large planetary lows of energy, Naruto basically one shot it, like with the base Rasengan. Just one shot it. This would utterly get him to planetary, since he one shot is something that is planetary, you know, in terms of energy. Now, I know the logic that we're going off of. Oh, you show him destroying a planet or affecting a planet, I mean, he basically just essentially one shot at a planetary energy source. So this feed would. And this is why the Naruto community is effectively trash, because y'all are disingenuous. First of all, that wasn't a base where I sing on. Secondly, the clip that you showed showed that he couldn't do it by himself. Now, why could he not do it by himself? Thinking not to explain that, she stated only somebody with her bloodline could even touch it, cause it would have drained them of their chakra. I mean, his verbatim stated. So Naruto said, hey, infuse your chakra with mine. And we know chakra not naturally is blue. And when Naruto's chakra turns red, it means he's using the nine tails chakra. But ultimately, this was a feat that both of them needed to come together to do, while at the same time. That power source is made up of byakugan eyes, and once they disrupt its energy, it pretty much took its Normal shape. It didn't even explode. It just turned back into Bakugan eyes. And then for you to say he did it by himself or that he one shot it with a base Rasengan when it. It. It explained it. It. It literally explained he couldn't do it without. And it took both of them, because if he had did it by himself, it would have drained him. This is. This is sad. This is really sad. Wow. You. You really wanted to use this to say that made him pledge? That's crazy.",

Not fucking one of you! Cause the fucking feet doesn't exist! You know why that bitch don't fucking exist? Y'all remember when Naruto and Sasuke clashed? Do you remember what Sasuke said? He said this right here was his most powerful fucking attack. I'mma say it again. Sasuke himself states on that page that this is his most powerful attack. And when that attack collided with Naruto's attack, not only did it not threaten the planet, crater, the world didn't do any of that, but what it did do is almost kill him. Again, an attack that was not planetary affected a character that y'all said is multiversal or planetary. Again, an attack that didn't threaten the planet was not planetary in the slightest. Not only almost killed both of them, but at no point did it threaten the planet. But I'll tell you what power scale is, since y'all love the power scale so much. If none of you can either provide Naruto killing a planet or threatening a planet and every feat that you wanna use, like trying to say because he hurts character A, then that means he scales to it. Your words, not mine. At the end of the day, power scales ultimately lose. Point Blank simple. What was asked was to show Naruto either Killing a planet or threatening a planet. None of you have yet to do that. And instead of simply saying with those feats do not exist, so we can simply move on, but you're incapable of doing it, which is why the community has basically been turning on y'all like it's crazy. Cause you won't believe the phone call that I got today. This whole debate is ending up on people's dinner tables. Like I said, if you can't show Naruto destroying a planet, or even being able to threaten a planet, he's not planetary. And real quick, we're not saying he has to destroy the. I said threaten the planet or destroy the planet, because honestly, he has no attack that allows him to do that. But I'm pretty sure you all knew that. But other than that, you have a great day.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the results for UTA versus Kashimo may actually be different because of the latest chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen. It used to be that Kashimo would win because he had some of the better speed feats in Jujutsu Kaisen, and even though he only lasted a chapter and a half, he fought the strongest version of sukuna outside of Gojo. And that's what I used to think too. But the latest chapter may have changed a couple things. Whenever UTA first showed up to battle Sukuna, Sukuna still had all four arms, and he stated that these overall amount of cursed energy is about the same as the possessed brats or UTA. And keep in mind this is still after Yuji landed one or two punches. the common thought was that even though it's only one or two punches, it's still enough to drop Sukuna's curse energy, which means he's still not as strong as whenever he was battling Kashima. Except it turns out after Yuji has landed eight different black flashes, Sukuna's efficiency with cursed energy is still so efficient he still has as much as UTA Akatsu. So the current sukuna is weaker, obviously because of his physical state. But UTA may have battled a sukuna that was just as strong as the one that Kashimo battled. So with domain expansion, UTA could take this now. And people will argue that Kashimo's hollow wicker basket, but as we saw, UTA has counters against hollow wicker basket and Unlike Sukuna, Kashima doesn't have forehand, so he can't use two hands to keep up hollow wicker basket and use the other two hands to attack, just like sukuna. So I don't know, but UTA might take this now. Let me know what you guys think. And Peyton Coombs, thank you for the sponsored video. But I think UTA might be able to take this now.",

Bankai is a materialization of the highest form that your zanpakuto can achieve. So when someone says your bankai or a bankai, they are talking about the level that they have achieved. It is the final upgrade given to the zampac toe and a name that was given by Ichibay. Bankai evolved zanpakuto. It's not like Super Saiyan. It's not like Sage mode. Can go look it up yourself. It's very easy. The problem is a lot of people have misconceptions and they don't understand what it is. They think, oh, a bankai is a transformation, oh, bankai is a technique, when in truth, it's neither. Hope this helps.",

Here, when Naruto's fighting Delta. Delta tries to pull a fast on a Naruto by attacking Himawari. But the scene starts right here. You can see everybody's position, and you can see Kawaki right there. And in the next page, Delta fires the beam right here. Naruto jumps after the beam has been fired, because, again, the beam was fired on this page. And Naruto says, god dang it! Here. And then jumps on this panel. Then we see a kaboom. And afterwards, we see that northwest caught Himawari. But what nobody mentions is the fact that Kawaki is the one who tanked that attack. So Kawaki, who was standing right here after the beam was fired, after Naruto jumps, see the beam sailing through the air as Naruto jumps to catch Himawari. Then we see the kaboom. Then we see the Kawaki tank the blast. As you can see, he's not in this frame. After the beam was already fired. He hadn't even jumped yet. He was still over here. So at the same time that Naruto catches Himawari, wacky tanks the attack. Now, this is a clear As daylight speed feat",

    "voice_to_text": "Something that seems to confuse a lot of people is the idea that dodging a light speed attack does not make you light speed. Let me break down why that is with this diagram right here. Let's say you got Person A and Person B. Person B decides to fire a laser beam at Person A. Person A responds by moving their head out of the way, allowing the laser beam to just pass right by them. This laser beam is moving at light speed. However, that person's head was not moving at light speed. Hopefully this makes it, like, easier to understand. But let's say that the laser beam leaves the person's hand and travels 10 feet to get to their opponent, and the person that moved their head out of the side moved their head 6 inches. It took the same amount of time for this laser beam to move 10 feet as it did for this person's head to move 6 inches. Since this covered less distance in the same amount of time, this movement is not relative, speed wise, to the movement of that laser beam. Now, this is also assuming that they started moving their head when the laser was fired, but that's not really how our brains work. Good analogue for this is pitchers and batters in baseball. On average, it takes less than half a second for a fastball to leave the pitcher's hand and make it to home plate. And yet the Average reaction time in the MLB is point seven, five or three quarters of a second. The way that they're still able to hit these fastballs even though their reaction time isn't fast enough to do so is by predicting where the ball is going to go and starting to swing the bat before the pitcher even throws the ball. In the context of a fight, this would be someone looking at the opponent's weapon and determining where it's aiming and preemptively moving out of the path of that projectile. How would you take a situation like this and make it a light speed feat? Well, let's take the same situation. You have two people 10 feet apart. One of them is charging up a laser beam. Person A is being attacked. Person B is charging laser beam. So Person B fires their laser. Now, in this situation, in the time that it takes that laser to travel the 10 feet to the target, that target is able to move 10 feet out of the way. Because they moved 10 feet in the same amount of time that it took that laser beam to travel 10 feet. That would make this feet light speed, because the person is actually moving at the same speed as that laser beam."

I will say one of the funniest things I saw was this. This man said Lion doxes people and has files on people like Batman. You goddamn right I do. Specifically when I have people threatening to R word my wife telling me I don't deserve human life and low lives. Who threatened a child over comic book characters. This is my thing.

Maybe if y'all don't do that, things like that won't happen. Did you think I was gonna have some type of shame? And. No. No. Once you threaten my wife or me or the kids on this app. Oh, baby. Oh, no. You deserve whatever happens to you after that. My thing is, that's been known about me. Say it again. The minute you threaten me, threaten my wife, or threaten a kid on this app, baby, it's over for you. And I make sure I keep a record. Information is king, baby. I Tell you what, you have daddy's permission to go do another one. What? I mean permission. I'm ordering you to do it again. Go do it again, babe. Make me proud. Oh, by the way, um, it's still a no for an audience. Nah, you. You knew that. Nah, you knew that.

Fun fact Vic I actually defended Gojo defeating Goku for the first year I was on TikTok and didn't lose a single debate on that topic. All loved my Asian brother Vic. But no, it is surprising to me that is 2024 and people still think that Goku has a Kai. Goku has self admitted that he messed up whenever he tried to copy Beerus's Hakai. If you try to do a backflip and then you failed and landed on your neck, did you do a backflip? No. No you didn't. And narratively this wouldn't make sense either, since the entire point is that Goku is going to train to use the Angels technique, which is massive alter instinct. And Vegeta is going to train to use the destroyers technique which is Hakai and destruction. Which is as we know, why it's actually different energy to use Hakai. It's destruction energy, which Goku does not use to move and talk and avoid where time doesn't exist. And Goku is able to move faster than Granola's clone, who has stayed to be faster than instantaneous travel. And again, just overuse scales that have been debunked for years and yet we're still using them. Goku was faster than instantaneous movement. Then he wouldn't still be using instant transmission. Instant transmission wouldn't still be catching people Off guard! And again, absolutely no hate to my boy Vic whatsoever. And I'm not even trying to convince anyone that Gojo wins or Goku wins. It's just the fact that a lot of these Goku skills are severely outdated.",

Basically, um, as long as you can hurt the character, you scale to the character and your durability scale to their characters. You know, durability and attack codes. I'm fucking loving it. Because let's really keep it 100, right? Like. Like, let's. Let's really think about this for a minute, right? You got a character like Miles Morales, right? Miles Morales. Blackheart. Blackheart is the same character that is fought. Ghost rider is the son of a Festo and pretty much solo, the Avengers, Iron Man, Mrs. Marvel. You know, I'm saying Captain America, you know, Jane Foster, Thor, even fish and Miles Morelli beat Blackheart. He was able to hurt black heart using a power that's generated in his body. You know, just like Chakra was the Venom. The Venom strike. Venom blast is something he generates, right? And then miles was also able to hurt. No. Isn't that crazy? Like, I'm really loving what the Naruto fans have basically shown up, you know, I'm saying this. This AP scaling shit is amazing. I mean, with this we can pretty much get any base level character to uni, multi, etc. Hell, we can get characters to boundless like miles. We can pretty much get him to multi. Probably boundless because the Ghost Rider is considered boundless, and Blackheart is a villain for the Ghost Rider. He's also the Son of manifesto and miles beat, you know, Blackheart, even Captain America. We can probably get him to multi, knowing the fact that, again, Captain America has beaten Thor. You know, I'm saying. And with everything Black Panther has done, all that's a wash. But yeah, I'm really loving this new AP scaling. You know, I'm saying, as long as you can hurt the character, you scale to that character. Or at least, you know, if you're able to fight on part with that character, then you scale. I love this. I absolutely love the man. I love this shit. We gonna use this shit for everything. Matter of fact, I got one that you probably didn't even expect. Armor. When Catwoman beat Wally West, Barry Allen, and Kid Flash at the same time by herself while they were using their super speedy. I remember that. Bro, this AP shit is amazing. If she could beat Wally West, Barry Allen, and Kid flash by herself at the same time, then, bro, she solos the verse. Hell, it says she can hurt them using Newton's 3rd law. That means her AP equals her, you know, Durabel as crazy. I love this. I love this. Yeah, we finna use this shit for everything. I am not kidding. We're using this for everything. I love it. I'm telling y'all, we gonna scale Batman next. This shit is amazing. I love it. By the way, any power skill that tries to argue any of This shit? Yeah. You would just be dooming your entire fandom. Just letting you know, at this point, we're only following your rules. No, but you. You knew that, sweetie. No, you knew that.",

    "voice_to_text": "Can someone tell me why jobless reincarnation fans are still trying to gaslight us into believing this anime doesn't encourage Drake tendencies? You guys know what I mean by Drake tendencies. You know exactly what I mean by Drake tendencies. I made this comment saying jobless reincarnation would be perfect if it didn't do that, and this person tried gaslighting me and being like well, maybe it's a you problem. Maybe there's something wrong with you. No, this show actively encourages that type of behavior, and I have bona 5 proof of that. Remember how in episode one Rudy is got kicked out of his apartment for unexplained reasons? This gunner planted secret edging cameras in his underage niece's room and then was caught mocking to those videos he secretly recorded of his underage niece, which is why he was kicked out. Now here's an actual screenshot from the anime. As you can see, it's a camera clearly out of sight and it's recording someone that don't really look of age, do they? Now I know why they didn't include that in the anime. Because it would confirm everything we've been saying about the show. There are three bona five things in the show that proves it's encouraging Drake tendencies. Outside of the fact that half of the first season was just Rudy as being a sex offender, let's discuss the fact that Rudy is consistently lusted after and sexually assaulted all the underage girls in the show, especially Ares Who he slept with at the end of the season. I bet you he was imagining his niece. Even his mentor, who supposed to be 40 years old, looks like a child. Who he also sexually harasses. Or how about the 7,000 year old demon god who I can never show a full image of cause she spends the entire show dressed in half naked BDSM gear. Reason number two rudious is mentally an adult. The entire first season makes it painfully clear that this is an adult in a child's body. Throughout the entire first season they are highlighting how mature Rudy is is for his age. Cause he's actually an adult. It would maybe barely be one thing if Rudy is actually had the maturity of his age, but he doesn't. In fact, he scolds his dad because he's more mature than his own father. So they established that Rudy is consistently sexually harasses minors. The show also litters their characters with underage looking girls. On top of the fact that they established in the first season that Rudy is has the maturity and AIDS of a grown man. And number three Rudy is talks to the man god. This is how he sees himself. He doesn't see himself as a child, he still sees himself as this grown ass man edging to his niece. So yes, Rudy is Drake and the show encourages it. How is Rudy is rewarded for his blatant sexual harassment of this character? He gets to sleep with her. How does this show not encourage that"

    "voice_to_text": "Do you guys know why I love the Naruto and one piece fandoms? Is because you guys are one the same. You don't realize it. Two sides of the same coin. So now people are saying that Naruto and Luffy are the speed of light, or many times faster than the speed of light. Out to my mutuals. You know, I love y'all, but y'all be saying anything in this app, just know if you can go light speed, you can circle the globe seven times in one second. So that's the type of speed you guys are just casually throwing out. So on a Naruto side, people are saying that the first light speed feat is Haku in his crystal ice mirrors. And the reason why they're saying is because there's a databook out there that states that Haku is moving at the speed of light in this crystal ice mirrors technique. But do you guys know how impossible that is? So, yes, Naruto and his nine tail transformations able to catch Haku. But we don't have to go that far. I want to talk about when Sasuke was adapted to Haku Speed. This is right before he hits hand Sharingan. So, yes, he was trying to memorize Haku's movements. But Haku says something that's very interesting here. Baku says he's gradually gaining speed, beginning to catch up to his own technique. And this is before the Sharingan. This is the same Sasuke who has a better grabs of Sharingan that's getting whooped by Rock Lee. Are you guys really saying that carries like Rock Lee edgy tinted? All these people are light speed, bro. It takes them days to travel from village to village, bro. They. They really aren't light speed, man. And that's okay. I don't believe there's any light speed feats in the word of Naruto. But we have to stop using anything in part one. Like, you have to go to the very last battle Naruto to make any type of argument. And for the one piece community, please stop using Kuma as an example of light speed attacks. Just like with the Haku thing, it is definitely exaggeration. I want you guys to really just think about this. Like, go in your room and turn on the light. Like, just. Just turn on the light switch in your room, bro. Light is so fast it can engulf your entire room without you even seeing like, what happened. Like in this fight we never find a pacifist. The entire crew is able to perceive what was happening from when the pacifist is standing to where Luffy and Zorro and Sanji are. Light would be instant, but it took them a few seconds to get to him. And what I mean get to him. What I'm saying is it took a few seconds for the monster trio to get to the pacifist. I have to say this every time, but in no means am I saying That Naruto or Luffy or one piece in general and Naruto in general are slow. These characters are speedsters. But are they the speed of light? No, bro, that's. That's actually ridiculous.",

Mais en tout cas, garder en t\u00eate que \u00e7a, parce que le chapitre est long, qu'il est nul, c'est \u00e7a qu'il fallait, qu'il faut vraiment que vous arrivez \u00e0 comprendre. Pour le coup, je suis pas du tout d'accord car je pense pas qu'un auteur choisisse volontairement d'\u00eatre lent.

Quelque chose qu'on consid\u00e8re comme lent, c'est quand il y a pas du tout de d\u00e9veloppement, ou alors qu'il est et bah bah tr\u00e8s long pour le coup. Et bah \u00e7a c'est-ce qu'on reproche \u00e0 One Piece. Y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de chapitres dans One Piece, et m\u00eame parmi les r\u00e9cents qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9s en beaucoup moins de pages, car le reste malheureusement, euh. \u00c7a raconte rien \u00e0 part du contexte qu'on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 et que Oda nous redonne en boucle. Le plus grand d\u00e9faut de Oda, avant m\u00eame le d\u00e9coupage, c'est la narration. Moi personnellement je trouve One Piece long et je pense pas \u00e7a. C'est 1 volont\u00e9 d'Auda, car pour moi l'an c'est 1 d\u00e9faut. Et je repr\u00e9cise, l'an est pos\u00e9, c'est pas du tout La m\u00eame chose pour exemple, friren c'est pos\u00e9, c'est pas du tout l'an, car pour reprendre ma d\u00e9finition, mais le d\u00e9veloppement d'un friren, il est l\u00e0, il est pr\u00e9sent, mais la narration, soit comment l'auteur le raconte, euh bah c'est fait de mani\u00e8re pos\u00e9e. Alors que One Piece, m\u00eame quand on est dans des moments d'action comme le chapitre mille-cent-treize o\u00f9 on est cens\u00e9 avoir 1 grosse r\u00e9v\u00e9lation, c'est l\u00e0.

    "voice_to_text": "Just because said robot charges up the light speed attack does not mean it's not light speed. And Zorro still clearly dodge the light speed attack. I'm not arguing semantics at all. I'm simply saying that I am not convinced at all that this is a light speed feat. Yes, the beam of energy is light, but again, he's charging up the energy blast. As I annotated right here, Zorro is looking at him charging up the energy blast. Zorro makes the oh shit face, then he goes from looking up to looking down, and he is moving to the right, as we can see in the change in position. So before the blast is even fired, he has already ducked his head, going from looking up to looking down, and has already started moving when the blast is fired, it just barely misses him because he had already ducked and moved before it was fired. So ducking out of the trajectory of the blast before it's fired is not a light speed feat to me. I am not convinced by this. Again, nothing here to me is a light speed feed, because not only does it take time for the Pacifista to charge up the blast, at least a couple of seconds, giving them ample time to move out of the trajectory of the blast, the Pacifista also has horrible aim here. Sanji did not dodge this because the blast wasn't even directed at him. Same here. The blast Is in between Sanji and Zorro, and here we see Luffy jumping before the blast is even in the frame. So nothing here is indicative to me of light speed. Because even just a couple of pages later, these characters who are so called light speed are all of a sudden not light speed anymore. The light speed Luffy can't even outrun sensemaru. So I maintain that none of the Straw Hats are light speed until after the time skip. So I maintain this is the first and only clear as day light speed feeds that we get from a straw hat character. But I will agree here that really intercepting kizaru here make some light speed. That just further proves my point that Rayleigh, who is a proficient hockey user and a character who is leagues above the Straw Hats, is the only one in this scene who is light speed because he's the only one fast enough to react to and keep up with Kizaru. So the idea of the Straw Hats have been light speed since, like Thriller Bark, I remain uncommenced.",

Like, they want a nation completely run by Christians with leaders, make decisions through their faith, but they don't think about the fact that Christians don't like each other. I grew up deep in the church, okay? Like, we got bust from school to church every Wednesday. We went every single Sunday. If there was a potluck, there we were. It was childcare, it was community, it was everything growing up. But when I was in middle school, we moved from a Methodist church, Missouri Senate Lutheran Church. Do you know how different those are? Totally different belief systems. Like, you think you want a Christian making all the rules until it's a Southern Baptist, and then you can't drink at your wedding. You're not gonna like that very much. You think you want a Christian in charge of the schools until it's a Pentecostal and suddenly the kids are speaking in tongue. You think you want a Lutheran in charge until it's one of the Liberal ones. They're not all Missouri Senate Methodists don't even get along with each other. Go look at the live streams of the most recent meetings. And now the Catholics are involved. When I was growing up, we were told that they weren't even a part of the same faith. And I had a Catholic tell me the same thing. You guys think you can get along well enough to run a Country, you're out of your fucking mind. You can't even sit politely at a dinner table, okay?

Go after people personally just because they said something about the anime that they didn't like? Everything I'm doing is completely satire, and I said that before I started doing this. So everybody getting angry and crying about it is just proving my point more. Which is exactly why I'm gonna keep doing it."

    "voice_to_text": "Out of these four characters, who do you have winning? And if the character that popped in your mind wasn't gone, then you're wrong. But let me explain. If I give you a good enough argument, make sure to subscribe to the YouTube and follow me on Instagram. So first things first, gon would have an ability from the character named Prince. Camilla has a Nen beast that doesn't allow her to unalive. If she were to unalive, the Nen ability would activate, which is this black cat. And it would basically take the life of the attacker and revive the person that has it, making the user effectively immortal. On top of having an ability that makes him effectively immortal. They wouldn't be able to touch him because gon would receive the ability. Hide and seek. Only the user of this ability can enter an exit at free will. That means if any of the other three characters were to follow him into hide and seek, they would not be able to leave no matter what. Now, a lot of you might be saying in the comments, Deku's just gonna one tap him cause he's so fast. He's gonna speed blitz him. He's not even gonna have the chance to use hide and seek. But let me show you one more ability that's gonna ensure that he's able to use hide and seek. That would be the Nen ability. Perfect plan. Because as long as gon is holding his Breath he is completely undetectable in all senses. You can't smell, hear, see, not even detect his Nen or energy. God holds his breath and goes into hide and seek. They can't do anything to him. On top of being effectively immortal, having a pocket dimension that only he can access and he can use, he could just trap them all in hide and seek and just win the fight like that. Not to mention he would also have Nautica's ability, so he could just wish them all into hide and seek. There are so many hacks in Hunter Hunter that there's no way that gon doesn't win this fight. But if you have another character winning this fight, let me know down in the comments and obviously like and follow for more.",

    "voice_to_text": "You need to pick an anime character to fight alongside you in two 2V ones. Now what do I mean by this? I mean you have to pick someone to fight alongside you in purely hand to hands. So for someone says Goku because he could just punch the planet. No, no, no, no. All of his strength, his speed, everything is brought down to a human. Like the peak human level. Not saying level. So you can't just say, I'll pick this person cause he'll fight bust a hole through universe. No, no, no, no. It is just hands, martial arts, anything like that. You have to pick someone that will fight two battles. One with you against one person, then one with you against another person. I'm gonna give you the two villains now. Or, well, the two people you're going to fight now. And you have to pick someone to file with you against these people. Here's villain No. 1. First one, ghost of the Uchiha, Madara himself. He doesn't have his rinnegan, his sharingan, his any of his chakra based abilities. He doesn't have Susano, he doesn't have anything like that. It is purely hands against this man. So that's gonna be your first opponents in your two viewing. Your second opponent is gabimaru himself from Hell's Paradise. Those are your two opponents. So let me know who you would pick to fight alongside you against these people in 2 v 1 fights. If any of You try saying I'll take this person cause powers. No powers, no like nothing like that. We're not having any spiritual presence. We're not having any key, any chakra, anything like that. You are peek human level in both these fights. You have to try and fuck up these guys though. Pick wisely."

    "voice_to_text": "Bro, just say the first light speed feat in one piece was in Egghead Island. Y'all are really bad at this so now I gotta disrespect you. This is the clip that you showed. In the clip that you showed, the pacifista charges up the beam. Luffy sees him charging up the beam, makes preparations, and then jumps before the beam fires. And then he lands after it connects with the ground. That is not a light speed feat. Amfu or frozo as it is. Now let's debunk your nonsense. And that was in the manga too bro. ND you are not beating the allegations you showed this the pacifista charging up the beam. Zoro is looking at the pacifista while he's charging up the beam. He literally sees him charging. The beam is making preparations and already started moving before it's fired. This is where it connects. That is not a light speed feat. This is a light speed feat. As you can see, Sanji is not in the frame. Kizaru charges up the beam, fires the beam. The beam has been fired. That is why there are speed lines here. And Sanji, after the beam has been fired, moves from out of the frame into the frame and kicks the beam away before it connects. So he went from outside of the frame into the frame and kick the beam away faster than an already fired beam could travel from Kizaru's hand to Bonnie. That is a light Speed feat. This is not so. Again, let's do a little thought experiment. If you point a pew pew at me. I see. You point the pew pew at me, and I duck out of the way while you pull the trigger and it just misses me. And a pew pew bullet travels 1,000 miles per hour. Does that mean that I can run at 1,000 miles per hour? Please answer that question. Now, let's do a different one. Let's try a different one. If you point a pew pew at someone, then you pull the trigger and the bullet is travelling through the air. And I run from where I am to the person who the bullet is travelling towards and push them out of the way. Which one is a faster than bullet speed feet. I promise it's not that hard."

What's crazy is the fight that y'all wanna lean into with Goku and Khalifa is one that actually proves my point better than anything. Because we absolutely tells you the same shit that I'm saying. Reese explains very plainly. The reason why Kepler is getting fucked up is because she's not fighting smart. She's not using skill. But the minute she starts using skill, she starts putting hands on Goku again. He loses that fight. He loses the fight, and then he has to transform. When he transforms, eventually kale joins. He loses that fight. Eventually has to go Super Saiyan. God. He doesn't have enough skill to beat people who are stronger than him. Especially if they also have a little bit. A tiny bit of skill.

Like I heard about it for a long time that the manga was actually very good and people were very excited about the new anime that was coming out and you know, I have very high hopes. I thought that it was actually going to be entertaining, and then I started watching it in. The first couple episodes actually had me wanting more. The committed effect on top of the animation that is actually very good. The action that is happening, the storyline is actually very entertaining as well. So all of it caught me by surprise, but today's episode just was the tip of it for me. After that finished that episode I had to go and continue reading the manga cause I needed to know what happened that bad. Not only did I go and I continue reading the manga, I ended up reading like six chapters within 10 minutes because it was that good. Not gonna lie, I'm probably going to continue reading some more so I'm just letting y'all know right now. Expect to see some Kaiju No. 8 content from me just because I enjoyed it that much, but I love to find out for you guys. Are you also Enjoying Kaiju No. 8 as much as I am?

I seen people saying he blew up all these meteors and no the fuck he didn't. Both him and Sasuke tried to stop them. Emphasis on both of them, cause they were working as a team. Naruto only blew up one of them. Sasuke tried to chop some up too. He does cut up like a few of them, but he says damn, there's no end to them because they can't destroy them all as a team. It didn't even matter cause Madara was just using the meteors as a distraction. He could activate the Infinite Tsukuyomi and I see this chakra cannon and with like 100 people it could destroy the moon. Naruto has more chakra than 100 people. But I got news for you, he's not a fucking chakra cannon. He cannot do this shit. He has no way to compress these massive amounts of chakra into a beam and then fire it. He just gathers it and then throws it. Even if he could, there's no way for him to withstand compressing all of his chakra into one beam. Again, he's not a cannon. He's not an advanced technological ninja tool. He's a person. No, I have not Been convinced in any way, shape or form that he's blowing up a planet",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, so my boy straw hat would, like, prove that why Yamamoto would be considered star level. And I'm gonna hear to try to explain my case. The easiest case to explain why Yamamoto is star level is Yamamoto's punk eye is. Punk eye reaches the temperature and level of the sun. His whole body is the embodiment of the. The sun. As we all know, just because your body reaches a certain temperature doesn't inherently make you star or star level. It says ace creative star. So that would make a star level. Isn't that like a hyperbole? Like, what proof does it show that young motor is actually star level? Here we see the after effects of young motor releasing his bankai. The after effects that shows why he. Is there some ability to his truth in saying, yes, I have the power of the sun? He evacuates all the moisture inside the Soul Society. And you know how the comments that if you keep it out this long, you will destroy the solar system, which. So society is at least planetary. So at bare minimum, you got your motor planetary. Hold the fuck on. Let me put my cookie down. This is a planet. This is a continent. It's a floating fucking continent. This is a planet. This is a continent. He evaporated all the moisture in the atmosphere. Oh, I guess Yamamoto doesn't scale to ace from one piece. Who arguably performed a greater feat in Base just by showing up to this island, an island that snows all year round, and on that day didn't snow. Snow is moisture. Water isn't wet. But ace outskills Yamamoto for sure. Yamamoto also stated that he kept his bunk eye out. Any longer, that he would destroy himself and the entirety of the Soul Society. Interesting. Very interesting. He would destroy himself. Well, that ends it right there. He doesn't scale to star. He doesn't scale to his ability. He doesn't scale to his bankai because it fucking kills him.",

Sukana doesn't get to know what Gojo's techniques are, and he's at 20 finger strength, and he gets to train for one month. Right. Okay. And Gojo gets 10 shadows added to his techniques, and he gets full knowledge on what Sukana can do. With the exception of, like, Sukana gaining fucking domain amplification. Gojo wouldn't know that.

What kind of stupid shit was that? You literally stitched my video. When did Goku is not a master martial artist come out of my fucking mouth? He's not that good at fighting. That's like. That's like his whole stick is that he likes fight. You and people like you are the only ones worried about Goku Stick. I don't give a fuck if he likes fighting. Is he good at it or not? Does he win fights or does he lose them? Some martial artist and he trains and meditates. Like what the fuck you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about? I don't give a fuck if he's training and meditating. Does he win fucking fights? That's the. That's. That's all there is to it. Fuck some meditation. He trained under Grandpa Gohan. Fuck Grandpa Gohan. He trained under Master Roshi. Fuck Master Roshi. And he also trained under King Kai. Fuck King Kai. Also trained under Beerus and learn like some sort of alien martial arts along with weed. Fuck Beerus and Fuck Wiese. What the fuck do I care about them? Ultra Instinct is a martial art in itself. Is a technique, not a form. Why the fuck are y'all like this? Read the fucking manga. Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter 71 when Wiese asks Goku what the difference is between Goku and the angels, Goku says some stupid shit because he's a fucking moron. But we just clarifies that the angels are always in the Ultra Instinct state, and Goku says that he has to transform first to use it. Wees further clarifies that it is possible to learn how to use the Ultra Instinct in his normal form, but Goku isn't good enough to do that. Even in the second most current Dragon Ball Super chapter, to use Ultra Instinct easily, he still needs to transform, so what the fuck are you talking about? So you have to be a very skilled martial artist to even use Ultra Instinct, the caliber of which Goku is not, because when he tried to use Ultra Instinct without transform, he was beaten. Which is why he told Vegeta that he could still whip out Ultra Instinct at full power, which he did so here. Which granola acknowledges as a form, and Goku explains that it's one that he can't hold for very long. You clearly do not know what you're talking about, so do not speak, do not stitch my videos, or engage with me. It is ridiculous and a waste of both of our time."

You mean to tell me this child, this little baby, on his first time ever being on TV, because his first time being on cinema was a movie? So you mean to tell me it took one movie to solo your verse? You've been written since I was a kid! It took one VHS. That's not even a DVD, that's VHS! You mean to tell me Jimmy Neutron, Nickelodeon, Jimmy Neutron is stronger than you, you trash! If I wanted to say Jimmy Neutron would become the size of a planet and kill Naruto, you couldn't argue it, because Naruto has not shown any attack that would kill or threaten a planet. But Jimmy Neutron's breath, his lungs. His lungs scale higher than you! You're trash! You got all these chapters! It took him one fucking movie? Like, because Jimmy Neutron can become the size of a planet, he can grab the moon and throw that bitch at Earth, he can. He can grab. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He could grab other planet. No, no, fuck other planets. He could just grab the moon and increase its size. You're. You're cooked. You're. Y'all got soloed by Nickelodeon! Nickelodeon!

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out."

Like, even, even, even, bro, right here it was. This is your account. You. You were saying it only last for five minutes? You. Do you think the fight with Kaido lasted five minutes? Is that what you think? Cause see, this is what I don't understand at this point when it comes to Gear 5. You don't even have to read the manga to know that that isn't true. Like, if you have Netflix, you can watch 1099 all the way to 11:01 and you would know that that's not true. So this is what's crazy to me. You guys are willing to lie to try to get a win. My bro said you can literally just go watch or read the manga. I'm telling you, you don't even have to read the manga to know that that isn't true. Like if you got Netflix, not only can you watch the episodes when he goes Gear 5 most recent, but after he pretty much demolishes old boy. This is what I don't understand. Even after this fight, even after he puts hands on him, right? Right? Even. Even. Even after he does all of this, Luffy is literally still in Gear 5 with no issue. No problems, no nothing. Looking around, chilling out, You know, say he's good. He's good. So with that, I just wanna know, why would you lie? Really answer the question. Why would you lie? Like I. From both of you. I want both of you to explain to me why would you lie? But for everybody else, gear 5 runs the gauntlet. How far does he go? And don't forget, Naruto no longer has a 9 tail. So his healing factor in super strength is pretty much gone. And his extra chakra reserves are also gone, besides the chakra he already has through genetic. But yeah. Who do you guys think wins?",

So apparently people have found the voicemail of him saying the N word and telling the person to go back to the plantation after losing a debate. I remember hearing this voice tip like last year or some shit. And if you're a part of the anime community on discord you know that this is nothing new. People say bunch of out of pocket stuff like random shit all the time. And the things I heard from Draco sounds mild to the things I've heard on discord. It's just how they operate on discord. In my opinion, Draco should just apologize and take accountability for the things they have said and just move on from the past. And I'mma start making content again.

    "voice_to_text": "Ah, so I see I finally have to have the conversation with people now. Naruto community, I want you to listen to me very closely. Let the chakra flow up to your ears so you hear what I'm about to say. There is not a single feet from the beginning of Naruto Boruto to show that Naruto is planetary. Majority of the people that like to argue that Naruto is planetary try to use statements from the data books as if they're accurate. Like, let's be for real here, the data books said the 10 ten could create a universe. They're not reliable. And then you have the people that try to argue that stage of six paths is planetary when it's not even remotely close to that. Then there's the people who say Kurama could destroy the earth when he couldn't even destroy the leaf village. And don't even get me started on baryon mode. In the entire time I've done content creation on here, there hasn't been a single person that could prove Naruto was planetary. The entire time, no one has done it accurately. There's like thousands of scalers who come up with scales that make absolutely no sense because they're trying to be pseudo death battle to get views. Y'all not realize how bad it looks for y'all? The king lion called all of you out, and none of you have proved him wrong. All these random debaters in the Naruto community, please just, like, stop And actually think about what they're saying, cause they're making everybody else in the community look bad. And can y'all stop using Naruto hitting the moon as a planetary feat? It's not a planetary feet. It's barely a moon feet cause the moon was hollow. Unless any of y'all can definitively prove Naruto's planetary, stop saying he's planetary."

    "voice_to_text": "Which one of these two characters do you think the internet has a problem with? I just want you to take a wild ass guess. The new Assassin's Creed game called Assassin's Creed Shadows is about to come out. And on paper it's giving us exactly what fans have been wanting for after shanking people all over the Nile Delta, becoming a Greek goddess, girly pop, and a literal Viking, we are going straight to Japan. It's supposed to be taking us to the glory days of the original Assassin's Creed mechanics. That's why you get two playable characters. One a Shinobi and the second one a Samudai. These are some of the descriptions that they already gave us. The Ninja Assassin can use Kunai Shurikans and basically use distractions to get everything done. Or you can play as a samurai, full on ghost of Tsushima style. Katana, bows, arrows, and all of that crazy shit. So you wanna guess where the problem lies? Is that they're giving you the chance to play as Yasuke. As in the Yasuke. I don't even need to tell you what people are complaining about in this picture, because you already know. Oh no, they're giving us a black samurai! My childhood is ruined! Let's cut the bullshit, shall we? This is Yasuke, a real life person. The first and only black samurai who was alive during the Sengoku period. Google hair. They're giving you the opportunity to play as the baddest man on the Planet to ever wield a katana and you're complaining? The crazy thing is that they can't even say that it's forced because you can choose to not play as. I mean, just take up, you know, the original Assassin's Creed style. Just shanking people with the hidden blade. That's all good. I just find it funny that the internet is hating on historical accuracy because this already happened. He was turning people into sashimi just as hard as she was. Honestly, the only thing that I'm mad at is the fact that they're locking a mission behind the preorder wall, which is, you know, not great. But i'mma give you the same piece of advice me abuela once gave me. Unless they deserve it. If you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all, homie.",

    "voice_to_text": "I would never hate on another creator. And a big part of that is because obviously I understand the struggle of it, all of the barriers, rather. That's financially in your life, in the creative process. It's very difficult. And the honest truth is I see no benefit in hating on another creator. It doesn't hurt me to show love to somebody else. There was a bit of a negative comment, not this one, obviously, but on the same post, trying to kind of put a wedge between me and another creator. And I had to publicly say I support this person and I would never go against them. One thing about TikTok is TikTok can be a very toxic place, especially in the comic and anime space. But because that video was so positive, the positive side and the great side of TikTok showed up and showed out to show love. Just like this comment. What I've Learned is the positive people usually don't speak. Not for a bad reason. People just have their own lives, their own things going on. They'll give you a follow, they'll give you a like, but they don't always stay in chat. It's usually toxic. Toxic more people that wanna have arguments and stay in your comments and harass you. And all the positivity on this post kind of reminded me to remain grateful, remain humble. You know, I'm doing something that I would do for free. Fortunately, I don't have to do It for free anymore and that's a blessing before the people who have always been following me, always been supporting. Maybe it was your first time speaking on this post. Thank you for speaking up because I needed that reminder for those who've been supporting me or just started supporting me based off that post. I do wanna use this as an opportunity to let you know we do have a lot more content and a great place where you can dive into our universe and I encourage you to go do that. And right now we are doing a massive push on YouTube. We are almost at 20,000 subscribers. So go over to YouTube, search Impound Comics or click the link in my bio and make sure you hit that subscribe button to get us to 20 k. Also we have a mini anime on our page, audiobooks, a podcast and much much more stuff that you'll never see on TikTok. But again, thank you for the support from everyone in that post.

    "voice_to_text": "This is BS. It's just glazing the woke demographic now. This comment is in response to himori being revealed to be a jinchuriki of kurama, possibly better than that of her father, as Kurama revealed that her chakra has more affinity with his than even Naruto's. But because girl woke. How the fuck is this appealing to the woke demographic? Oh yeah, anime fans historically woke. Kishimoto was well known for possibly putting pen to paper and creating some of the worst female characters known in all of anime and manga. You wanna know the real reason that Himawari ended up with Kurama? Boruto was originally supposed to have Kurama. This is the first graphic we ever got from Kishimoto as it pertains to Boruto as a story. But then Kishimoto realized, oh, I don't just wanna make Boruto a hollow copy of his father, so we took the byakugan and Kurama from Boruto and gave it to Himawari. This is why Naruto is the only person in Boruto with two children. Is your argument here that he should have had two sons? Himawari is the third generation of Kurama Jinchuriki in her direct bloodline. How is it crazy that she's the best one yet? I don't see you making us think about the fact that Boruto, over the course of three years of training, managed to figure out a Rasengan that was stronger than anything Naruto ever created. But girl, climb back into your fucking damp hole, you incel!",

I said neither of them have ever been stronger than the 10 tails jinchuriki individually. All you're showing me is them jumping him. They overpowered him as a team. You said they did it casually bro. They combined their most powerful forms just to damage him. They could not really hurt him or kill him. Best they could hope for was to disrupt his control over all the tailed beasts. So instead of taking this Chidori Rasengan combo like a man, he runs away. That's my point. They're jumping him. If it was a one on one, both of them are losing. Neither of them are as strong as the ten tails jinchuriki at any point in the story. Went up to Boruto. Neither Sasuke nor Naruto has the power that these motherfuckers had access to. Ten tails itself is the only one that could possibly have enough chakra to maybe destroy the planet. The jinchuriki of that thing are the only ones that have ever had access to that big a pool of chakra. Because of the truth seeking orbs and other six path abilities they're granted. They don't just use the chakra to blow shit up again. At no point have Naruto or Sasuke been stronger than the 10 tails. Not here, not back then, not never.",

This is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. And this is gonna be a big issue. So if you don't know, the newest Assassin's Creed was released. Well, the trailer was released, and then they were basically saying that it's set in Japan, and then instead of a Japanese protagonist, a Japanese main character, we have a black samurai as the main character now. Cool. I have. I have no issue with that. If you wanna do a black thing, that's fine, whatever. They could have done that as a DLC though, as a extra content, as anything else. But making that the main character of the series, of the. The game is a bad thing. This is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. First of all, it's gonna cause division. There's obviously gonna be people who don't like it because the guy is black or whatever. Cool, whatever. But making him a central character in the first Japanese game is one of the worst decisions ever, and it's gonna backfire badly once again. For those of you who don't understand, the main issue is the fact that he's. That he's a black guy in ancient Japan. That doesn't really make much sense in terms of, like, um, I. I know the story of the Samurai, I know that some people say it's true and all that, but you should have chose. They should have chosen a Japanese guy. Bro, imagine a game set in Africa and the main character's a white guy. It wouldn't work.",

Gosho Colony aka the colony that Kenjaku was in when he was snuck by UTA. So it is confirmed UTA Akatsu did not speed Blitzkenjaku. Todo switched him. I used to pray for times like this. I stood here, I told you guys Kenjaku wasn't speed blissed. I was called a madman, a Copa. I was put on fraud watch. The UTA agenda is truly dead. He didn't speed Blitz Kenjaku.

    "voice_to_text": "So this lady right here, Giza Kim, was recently introduced in Lichism Chapter 5:02, and a lot of people are theorizing on who she could be. So from what we know, she's a part of Jin Yong's faction back during his time in the Gabriel Gang. And it looks like she's the current leader of that faction while they're in Chan Yong. And my theory is that she is somehow related to Gabriel and Kim. The reason I say that is because her last name is Kim. And now, you might be saying Kim is a very common Korean last name, like Lee, but look at her first name. Also, look at the context, right? Gabriel has a son named Guite, and now we have her, gija. Oh, they have similar names. That doesn't mean they're related. It's just a coincidence. And I would have said the same thing, too, but that's not the only similarity. Not only do they have similar names, but she's affiliated to Gabrielle through Angie Young Park, two members of his gang, and and Jerry's dad, Big Hoe. Somebody pointed this out last video that she might be the reporter Kim that Jeong was talking about to Jerry, and that she's the one that's a fan of his dad and recorded all of his fights. Not only is she bad, but she also has a strong relationship with both Big Hoe and Jin Young, who are both top members in Gabriel's gang. Now, I don't Know exactly how her and Gabriel are related, but it's most likely Gabriel sister. I don't think PTJ is gonna say that's his daughter, because he already did the secret child storyline with GT, and if he did it again, it'll be a little bit cliche and repetitive. So it's most likely his sister. About 10 to 15 years younger than him, which explains why she spotted a zero generation. And she may have rode around in his crew during his days as the gang leader. Gabriel. And then maybe she eventually fell in love with Jean Young Park, which explains why she's a part of his faction. Or maybe had a love interest. And Big Hill Quan, Jerry's dad. But yeah, I was completely right about Jin Young being Daniel's uncle. I called it, like, a long time ago, but that I said five months ago in my video, because that was only proof I had that I said it. So I was right about that theory, and I'm positive that I'm gonna be right about her again. And also my chante Jin is vengeance half brother theory. So, yeah, let me know down in the comments what you guys think about my theory. Let me know if there's any holes. I could still work on it, but, you know, this is what I'm putting out for now. If you guys wanna see my chapter reactions for lookism, go ahead and click the link in my bio. It'll take You to my YouTube channel where I have all my reaction videos. The newest one is Chapter 5:02, so go ahead and check it out. Thanks for watching. Leave a like and subscribe.",

Am I actually happy right now? Like, is this. Is this actually happening? I'm gonna savor it. I'm gonna enjoy it before gay gay takes it from me, because, um. I know gay gay. The sun has never been brighter. The birds have never chirped louder. The air has never been crisper. For once, I got in my car, and I didn't think I was gonna die.

These power scaling discord rules are all predicated on fake science. None of it makes sense, none of it is logical. The vast majority of it contradicts what the author is even trying to communicate in the story in the first place. And most of the people using it don't even know what they're talking about. Newton's laws are laws of motion. The force applied to set something into motion is also applied equally to the thing setting into motion. What it doesn't mean is that if you can do something, you can withstand it. So you're trying to tell me that if a baseball player can throw a stone at full force, let's say 90 miles per hour, you're trying to suggest that the same baseball player can take a stone being hurled at his face at 90 miles per hour and not die? What are you talking about? Feats, statements, narrative implication, and how strong characters are relative to other characters. That is it. Everything else is nonsense, fake science.",

Because of Newton's Third Law, which is for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction with this means is that whenever Narcissus, able to match Kaguya, simply injured Kaguya fatally, Narcio was exerted the same amount of force that Kaguya is. And how much force is she able to exert? Will Kaguya is able to make dimensions with what she's capable of has nothing to do with him chopping off her arm or damaging her. Let me explain. Newton's third law has nothing to do with this at all. You shoot a gun, it recoils. You push off the ground. When you run, it's like the grounds pushing off you. But this doesn't have any further implications for the subjects in question. I'll be an example. Imagine I'm Naruto and my car is Kaguya. I can damage my car. I can punch and break the window right now. That doesn't make me as strong as this car going full speed and crashing into somebody like you. See the leap in logic? What Kaguya is able to do is completely irrelevant to Naruto being able to damage her. It's not like they're Dragon Ball Z characters that are surrounded in energy Shields. Like these dudes are swimming in lava. Just name dropping Sir Isaac Newton isn't enough to make this shit make sense. Everybody already admitted he doesn't have the destructive capacity to blow up a planet. So let's stop adding on to the laws of Physics to try and make Naruto something he's not. What y'all are saying is for every action between two objects, there is an immediate equalization of power potential. Y'all just making that shit up. This has nothing to do with Newton's third Law of equivocal force. Basically, just receive whatever you're giving out. Like, if I punch you, I can knock you out and break your jaw, but I can also break my hand. The force is coming both way. He being able to exchange equivocal force with your jaw doesn't even make me as strong as you are. If Naruto can damage her and she can destroy planets, all of a sudden he can destroy planets. Like, no, that's not logic.",

    "voice_to_text": "I hate to say you guys, but it might not be Gojo now. I had this thought after the hype had died down from the stream, but there were multiple reasons to why this could not be Gojo. And for the record, I hope it is, but I have to be unbiased here. For one, because of where the students are currently, it wouldn't make much sense. One of the entire premises of Gojo coming back prior was the fact that the students weren't going to defeat Sukina, so Gojo would need to come back for someone to stand a chance. With Yuji not only landing another Black Flash directly to Sukina's heart, but with Todo being around and discombobulating him with Boogie woogie, things are looking really good for the heroes right now, so it seems like really weird timing that the heroes are winning and that's when Gojo comes back. Reason 2 it was purposely ambiguous. If Akutami wanted us to know that Gojo would come back, I don't feel like he would be as ambiguous as he was. Ending it on a cliffhanger allows Akutami the option to not have Gojo come back and this actually be a fake up for something else. And as we know right? When someone's about to lose, they have visions all of the time. And Gojo was the strongest opponent Sukan ever faced. I can see people arguing the fact that they weren't in a good spot because Sukan was About to open up his domain expansion. But remember, they can't resist his domain for a small time because both Toto and Yuji have a simple domain. Not only that, but if the Fire Arrow were to come out again, because Toto can swap things so fast with his new instrument, he could easily swap Yuji and Toto out with the crows again to keep them safe from Tsukana's domain expansion, basically making it Nolan void. So again, in a lot of ways, Yuji and the heroes are in a good spot right now. And again I state I want Gojo to come back, but one, I have to always stay unbiased, and two, there's a lot of evidence pointing to the fact that it could not be Gojo. Now in the same vein, I'm going to make videos to all the reasons why I think it could be Gojo, but let me know what you guys think!",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker."

Story time about when I was in high school and I ended up befriending this kid who had no friends, and he ended up kind of ruining my life. I went to a pretty small high school, and like, it was kind of a weird school, but, like, there was this one kid who had absolutely no friends, and I had a few class with him. We didn't interact till like junior year, when we got seated assigned next to each other in class and we started talking and I was like, oh my god, this kid is actually interesting, actually liked him, whatever. We became friends in class, and then one day I invited him to sit with my group at lunch. And my group of friends were like the cool kids at this weird ass fucking school. And everyone was like, oh, what the fuck, why are you inviting. Let's call him Jason. Why are you inviting Jason to sit at our table? And I was like, just get to know him. Like, he's actually really cool. And they did get to know him, and everyone actually really ended up liking him. And he integrated as hell into my friend group. All the guys were friends with him. I was super happy. I was like, this is great. At first, then a couple months, and he ended up being a complete fucking dick to me. Started bullying me, making these jokes to me that were just like, over the line, just, like, really mean shit. And I would like, call him out on it. He just continued to do it, including making a song about me that, like, Loki went viral and like, are, like, the entire school knew about it. And he played it in music class. And he was like, calling me a hoe and was like, about how he wanted to get with me or something. And like, a teacher came up to me and he was. She was like, you know, like that song, Jason me like, you could have him suspended for that. Like, do you want that? And at the time, you know, I was still trying to, like, we all be friends. I was like, no, no, no. But I slowly distance myself from him. But I couldn't stop him from, like, being in these social gatherings because he was friends now with all of my friends. Everyone liked him. Fast forward to that summer. He asked me to play tennis, cause we both play tennis. And I only said yes because I did wanna like, hit, like, not be off my game. And then afterwards, I was just gonna go home. He basically, like, begged me to come over to his house and, like, hang out. And I did, for A little bit. And then I left and he was super upset about it. And at when I was at his house. This is an important detail. I logged into my IG once on my own phone and I had to type in the password."

    "voice_to_text": "He might actually be back. Like, I cannot believe that I'm saying this. Gojo might actually be back. Let's go over the chapter. It was insane. The time begins with Toto revealing that his missing left arm is replaced with an instrument called the Viper Slap. I'm probably saying that wrong. The narrative explains that Toto has changed Boogie Woogie's activation from clapping his hands to the collision of the metal piece and the wooden box. Using this, total can now swap people 50 times per second. What? And then the battle commences. Total uses boogie woogie, and he switches places right behind sukuna. Did you guys expect anything else? This is a fight with Boogie woogie! Sukuna, you're getting jumped! Total has imposed a binding vow to limit the number of swaps and proportion to the collisions of the Viper slot. Toto has successfully expanded the curse techniques target to multiple targets and expanded the effective range of his curse technique. The narrator also reveals that Toto successfully evacuated the sorcerer from Sukuna's domain. Let's go! Everybody safe! Sukuna says that out of all the sorcerers, Toto is the most self centered and difficult to sway. He honestly appeared at the timing that I least wanted him to show up. He was trying to break Yuji, but you can't do that. Toto then goes to strike sukuna, but sukuna is easily able to dodge it. He's still sukuna. Todo is reminding us again that tsukina can just jump off Of the air, bro is like Maki for real. Yuji then grabs a gigantic rock and then hurls it towards Tsukina. Toto then obviously changes Yuji's place with the rock, and then Yuji goes to land an attack on tsukina. However, sukuna sees is coming. They both collide with each other, and sukuna grabs Yuji by the face and then just starts tossing him. Toto senses that this is the case, and he switches Yuji's place again. I'm not sure with what, though. Sukuna says that Todo and Yuji are now like in a roulette. Sukuna realizes Todo can change the maximum minimum values for the number of swats per single tap. Sukuna thinks it's practically impossible to get used to boogie woogie since Todo can switch so many times in one second. Yuji then lands a punch, or kind of. He pushes sukuna back into a pillar and sukuna goes flying through it. As this is happening, sukuna goes to clash with Yuji, but before that happens, sukuna notices there's a crow right beside him. And of course, boogie woogie, baby! Todo switches places with Yuji and the Crow, so sukuna ends up hitting the crow, and Yuji lands another black flash right to Sukuna's chest. Yuji, using his claws, begins to gash at sukuna, and he starts to try to, I guess, pull out his heart or something along those lines. Sukuna goes to expand his domain expansion, but he looks to the side and he sees a Ghost. The ghost of the strongest Sorcerer is now before him. The editor's note is those eyes are unmistakable. There's a couple of conclusions that we can draw here, but I'll save that for my next video. This chapter was insane."

    "voice_to_text": "But that doesn't really make any sense. Just cause you have the power or chakra to destroy a planet doesn't mean you have the durability of one. That is actually wrong. If you have planetary AP, you automatically have planetary durability. Reason for this is Newton's third law for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So in Kagia's case for example, the amount of force she puts out to create a planet is also the same amount of force she can take in due to that third law. Meaning that if she has enough force to be able to create or destroy a planet, she also has enough force to tank an attack of that same caliber. Now he goes on to say that there are plenty of anime characters whose durability does not scale to their attacks. However, a character's AP is always going to scale to the character's durability unless proven otherwise. Example is Deku. His attacks in Season 1 and season 2 were way stronger than his durability was. That's why he was getting hurt by his own attacks. So unless it's a case like that, Kaguya's AP is going to scale up to her durability because that's just how it works. Now another example he brings up, which I knew was gonna come sooner or later, was this example of Himawari knocking Naruto out. Asked does Himawari doing this mean she scale up to Naruto? And the answer is no for multiple reasons. First off, Himawari uses gentle fist, and gentle fist ignores all durability. It operates in a very similar fashion to Ryo from one piece, which also just completely ignores any and all durability. Second, Naruto is completely off guard here. Now he brings this up and then says it's still a speed blitz. But that doesn't make any sense. If Naruto is off guard, then this doesn't even count as a feat for Himawari. So 1. Himawari does not scale to Naruto because Gentle Fist ignores all durability in the question, and 2. She did not speed blitz Naruto because Naruto was not even expecting this to come out of Himawari. So is Naruto still planetary star level whatever? Yes he is.",

    "voice_to_text": "We want an Azula redemption arc. And how do we feel about villains turning into heroes in general? The Avatar creators have said in the past that if they continued the series beyond book three, they would wanna give Azula her own redemption arc. Apparently, that's the trajectory that the comic books have been taking. I haven't read them, so I don't really know how well this is being handled. And apparently Kavira was redeemed in the comics as well, although nobody really liked how it was handled. Personally, I love a good redemption arc, I don't think we need to see every single antagonist go through one, especially when it comes to Avatar the last Airbender. Or any redemption arc is gonna inherently be compared to Zuko's. Azula is already incredibly sympathetic and a super complex character. I think seeing her turn into a quote unquote good guy would just feel forced. apparently in the comic, there's this dream sequence that Azula has, and once again, I haven't read the comics. I take this with a grain of salt. In it, there's his dream sequence where Zuko doesn't have his scar. And people interpret that as, like, how Azula sees Zuko. Like, she doesn't see him as being disfigured. And I'm like, that's kind of lame. I kind of like the idea that Azula loves that Zuko has that scar as, like, a visual representation that she is more loved than he is. Like, if she Experiences a redemption arc that's anything other than five years of intense therapy. It's gonna feel cheesy, and it's gonna feel unrealistic to me.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, I got a question for y'all, bro. What do y'all determine to be stakes in anime? And a reason I'm asking this question is because it's like a common thing for people to be like, oh, I don't really like this anime over this anime because it doesn't have stakes. I think that argument goes more than splitting hairs. I think it's actually just ridiculous because every anime that has a problem has stakes. Start here, for instance with the sale games. Oh, the Dragon Balls are there, they don't have stakes, unfortunately. Sales plan was to destroy the earth after everyone was killed, meaning that it wouldn't matter because either will be no Dragon Balls. And if there were Dragon Balls, there be nobody to use. Is a common argument made for my Hero Academia. People say that there's no stakes in my hero are fighting a war for the world right now, right? This isn't just Japan, you feel me? Now that the entire world is involved. United States number one hero got killed trying to stop this person in Japan. If all for one wins, he's gonna plunge the world into nothingness. But even then, stakes don't have to be that dire, bro. Like you could be playing a game of rock, paper, Scissors with your homie and the stakes are if you don't beat him, you're gonna lose. Losing is a stake. You sports gamble on your favorite basketball team. One of the stakes was on The line money. Y'all let me know down in the comments what y'all think about this, cause this shit is confusing to me.",

They jumped the shit out of Obito, could not kill him or really even hurt him. It took the entire alliance, Naruto and Sasuke past Hokage's everybody even be capitalizing on a chakra tug of war to beat him but really just separate him from his power. And there was a talk no jutsu going on. They could not beat him. Was the same with Madara. Naruto and Sasuke were struggling against him as a team and then Zetsu just stabbed him in the back. But they had to jump him anyway. Same way they had to jump Kaguya. And where they had to jump momoshiki. And where they had to jump Jigen. Or Ishiki. Whoever the fuck this is. At no point have either of them show me that they're stronger than the ten tails jinchuriki. I admitted if anything can destroy the planet, it's the ten tails cause of the sheer mass of Chakra that it can hold and use. And no, I don't think Naruto or Sasuke has this much chakra. You should neither. The ten tails is the progenitor of chakra. Drinking oceans, splitting the earth, lifting up mountains, dropping like 10 city size blasts at once just for fun. As a one piece man, I wanna know where you skill Luffy. I don't really. I look at What he's done speed wise? I look at his feats of strength. I look at the fact that he's made of rubber. I look at the fact that he has Tune Force. I look at the fact that he can see into the future. I look at his durability negation and also his insane amount of durability and say that he beats Naruto's ass. And every time I say this people start talking about planets and stars and whole bunch of shit that has nothing to do with the fight. These are also feats of power that he's never actually shown.

The first episode was really good. Like it gave us a little bit of everything. It started out with the battle between the wind Hashira, Snake Hashira, and a bunch of fighter demons. Then we got a lot of interesting plot development. The Hashira found out about the Infinity Castle, the news of Nezuko being a day walker spread and sending shockwave through the community, and now our favorite characters get to train with all the Hashira. Like I know the Hashira training arc is kind of like upper middle of the pack as far as the other arcs go, but I think it's anime adaptions gonna be really good based on what we saw in the first episode. Not to mention the episode was like 50 damn minutes. I really can't believe it's starting to feel like demon slayers and underdog anime. Like I swear a few years ago when the new season will come out the world will stop. Now it's just like okay, demon slayers back. Since anime fans are so fickle, I have a feeling that it will get back to that by the next art. This must be what Kanye meant when he said they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again.

    "voice_to_text": "X defiant is about to be a top three FPS game, all thanks to a major decision that players have been begging to see from call of duty. The peak call of duty games and X defiant actually have a lot of things in common, one of them being the brains behind the operation, Mark Rubin, who worked for Activision as the executive producer during the Modern Warfare series. But more importantly, he understands better than anyone that skill based matchmaking has played a huge factor in a call of duty struggles. So today the team released a statement confirming there will be no skill based matchmaking in the casual playlist for X Defiance. The statement continues on saying skill based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive, constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and varied, similar to how prime call of duty was. X defiant will find matches in order of these priorities latency avoided, players, party size, region, input device, and then platform. Once in the lobby. Teams will still be balanced though. They also confirmed that ranked will be added in a future season, and those matches will be prioritized based on ranked points.",

He can even use full counter after the attack has happened or before the attack. I think I need to prove that. Okay, I got you. Here's the first attack. He swings and there you go, countered. Now what about the second attack? Here it goes. The attack has already happened, and boom, full counter. As I said in my video, he can use full counter on physical, non physical, pretty much whatever he wants as long as it's an attack. And it's not just him that he can use that attack, his brothers can also use that attack. And because Meliodas is a demon, they all pretty much share the same abilities. But since he's a high ranking demon, he pretty much has all their attack. So Emilio just wants to take your soul out of your body? He can do that? If he wants to force gravity on your body, he can do that. He wants to counter your attack without even saying full counter or without it even being a magical attack. He can do that, as you just saw him do. He can even counter an attack that's already happened, as you also just saw him do. But don't worry, somebody's gonna argue and somebody's gonna cry about it.

    "voice_to_text": "Best this video is gonna get reposted on my channel. I'mma say it again. The best. This video. Don't ever let a Naruto fan tell you that Naruto's best attacks are a rasengan variation of something. I'm gonna tell you his two most effective attacks that work almost every single time. Number one is jumping. Naruto relies on jumping so much that it dates back to when he was a kid. And it's not his fault. His sensei even taught him this. They both did it to dadara. In fact, most people in his village and other villages love using this technique. In fact, they made a jutsu over it, and it was to help them jump. But it's okay. Sometimes jumping isn't the most effective for Naruto, but that's where his second biggest technique comes in, and that is being bailed out by the nine tailed fox. But again, this dates back to when he was a kid in several of his fights. And you know what? It's not even his fault, because even when Naruto tries the Batman route of using prep time by having prior information fed to him about the enemy he's about to fight, by setting up clones to help him with Sage Mode in that fight, by having a slug give him information and help him during the whole fight, it just doesn't work out for Naruto. So of course he has to go back to Old Reliable and get bailed out by the Nine tailed Fox. I know what you're thinking. The Rasengan Shuriken or something should be his third most effective technique, but it actually isn't. Human Shields are actually his third most effective technique Hinata uses against pain. Neji did it during the Great Ninja War. And this is something that he's been using since he was a kid, whether it was Sasuke or even with a Ruka sensei.",

He is saying that Naruto is planetary or universal because he was able to beat Momo, Shiki, and Kaguya. Or that because baryon mode is stronger than all of them, than his universe. Sweetie, let me help you real quick. He didn't beat momoshiki by his fucking self. When they fought Kaguya, he didn't do it by himself. Um, yeah. If I'm correct, he had the entire village just for Madara. And then when it came to her again, it took everybody. It was an everybody thing to stop her. And they didn't even killed her. They sealed her away. So why are we still using this shit? And when it comes to bury him on a fucking Bluetooth, last longer than that goddamn form. Furthermore, the only reason why he was able to beat Jigen with this form was because of the effect that his punches were having on Jigen. That, plus the speed and strength increase. Other than that, that's pretty much it. By the same time, Naruto doesn't have, uh, the nine tails, so. So it's. It's done. You can't say he outputs XYZ when he doesn't have any of that. So let's go over one more time. This was a team effort! This was a team effort! This shit was trashing! Only reason why you won was because the speed and strength enhancement that he Gave and the effect your punches had on Jigen. Pretty much it. This shit is trash. Your whole fandom is trash. I don't know how many fucking times I gotta say this shit. The only people have the right to either challenge me or debate me or those who show they fucking face because I've made it very fucking clear. I refuse to argue on my fucking live with a goddamn picture. It's not fucking happening. You can catch this ratio all fucking day, but your whole entire fucking verse is trash. Your character is trash, your fucking series is trash. You can't fight nobody one on one, so y'all jump. That's all the fuck y'all do is jump. And even when y'all jump you still get your ass whooped. It was the one time you really fought somebody by your fucking self. No help. And it didn't last longer than a fucking Bluetooth. Your whole verse is trash."

But you don't have that like you look because Naruto has no feats that show that case. I don't think he got it the first time, so it may make it more simple. If it says George did 20 push UPS, you have nothing to contradict this statement that George did 20 push UPS. So this is a fee for George. It is stated that momoshiki created a universe. Unless you have anything to contradict this statement, momoshiki created a universe and this is a universal level fee. I absolutely love that line of thinking, cause that gets Luffy the boundless. I've been pushing this agenda for a while and I'm glad the Naruto fans are starting to realize. Because you have no feats, the statements are just as valid. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "The best written character from each anime. Follow for more. First of we have Naruto and he has Sasuke. Valid pick. I mean the going Sasuke retouching. I don't think there's anyone else to pick from. Sasuke's representation of revenge being the second best in any manga. It touches whole philosophy behind reality. And his loyalty to the Leaf Village and his depth and complexity behind all that. Easy one piece is not Law. Luffy representation of freedom clears most of Law's character. Sanji's insecurity that stems from his childhood clears most of Law's character. It's either Sanji or Luffy. Bleachy as Aizen. And I agree Aizen's God complex is top tier. Of course each goes a pick, he's the main character. But I'm saying Aizen. Hunter Hunter Krollo. I haven't read the manga so this could be right or wrong, I don't know, but I'm going to say meruim or Killua. Marilyn was definitely short lived, but his character development and ideologies were top tier. Phenomenal Jujutsu. Kaisen Maki Gojo Gojo Gojo's representation of strength, loneliness, and his internal external conflicts in the Hidden Inventory. Arguero the honored one me Gojo A 0 T it's Aaron, easily. Black Clover is not yummy. Best written yummy. What? That's crazy! Lucius is better written than yummy. Oscar is better written than yummy, you know? Is better written than yummy. Noel, even though I don't like her, is better written than young Dragon Ball Z. I agree every single day. Especially with His character development and Tokyo Revengers. Mikey all day, bro. People hate on Tokyo Revengers because of the reason how Mikey got the dark impulse, but, bro, like, Mikey is literally in mainstream like Annie Monger new gen. A top 5 to 10 side character. And he's so good with his depth and complexity. Bro, I don't care. I just had to get that off my chest. That's what I've got. Full of more. Who's the best written character from each of these animes?

So he wants a feat of Naruto destroying a planet, universe, etcetera. And I love how that didn't come out of my mouth. I said show him destroying a planet or threatening a universe, or simply just just destroying a star. But you don't have that. Like you look cause Naruto has no feats that show that. He's. He's never done it and he can't do it. Like, I just. I think it's crazy. I said provide this. You can. If someone says hey king, can you show Silver Surfer killing a planet? I can show him doing. If someone says hey king, can you show Superman killing a planet? I can do that. If someone says hey king, can you show Silver Surfer or Superman maybe affecting a dimension or something like that? Yeah, we can do that. You can do that for a lot of characters. Rather it be anime or comic book. But it seems like this is the one fandom that when you say hey, can you give me some cold hard fact? Can you show him doing X, y and Z? Can you show him affecting? You can't show none of that when it comes to debating. Y'all are so trash that if you would have just came out and said he has no feats that Show him doing that, then we could have had a different argument, we could have had a whole different discussion. But you can't even do that. You can't even just admit, well, king, he doesn't have any feats that that show that. Y'all go off the statements like, oh, well, it states right here that he can destroy the world. That doesn't mean you can kill the planet. A disease can destroy a world. Nuclear bombs can destroy a world, not a planet. But they can destroy the world because they can scorch the surface of it. And even at the height of the nine tails power, Naruto has yet to show the capability to threaten that planet. He doesn't even have an attack that threatens that planet. Maybe an island, possibly. A continent, possibly. I mean, but you wanna only keep it 100. I mean, what are y'all gonna do besides cry? That's all y'all gonna do this point. I'm not going to listen here or care what any of you have to say unless you can either one admit he has no feet. That shows him destroying a planet, a universe, or a star. If you can't do that, I don't care about anything else that comes out of your mouth. Please listen to what I'm saying. If you cannot show Naruto either killing a star, destroying a universe, or destroying a planet, or threatening the existence of any of those three, I don't wanna hear anything. Because Let's keep it 100. What is your fan base going to do except what they've always done? Cry. That's. That's all you gonna do? That's all you gonna do is cry?",

There are actions I don\u2019t take not because they are inherently evil, but because it is my responsibility to build relationships that set emotionally and developmentally appropriate expectations for kids. Transference is natural, but this teacher\u2019s behaviors consistently invite a transfer of parental or romantic emotions from students to him.

Ichigo is talented, but he is also extremely hard working. People always talk about how Ichigo is so talented because he was able to unlock Bangkai in the span of three days, whereas it takes other Shinigamis decades to unlock Bangkai. People don't bring up how this technique that Ichigo used to unlock Bangkai in the span of three days was created by the smartest man in the entire series. And it also came with the extreme risk of Ichigo dying. Ichigo also have to trade in the dawn guy for 3 months straight. 3 months with no breaks, no rest, no food, nothing. Just 3 months of straight fighting to use final Getsuka 10 show is definitely talented, do not get me wrong, but he is one of those characters that is both talented and hardworking.",

And Haki lets you see with your eyes closed, see attacks coming, sense all the life on the island you're on. This is just the basic shit that anybody can learn. Not seeing into the future, not knocking people out with your willpower. That's with the basics. There's no equivalency cause they're not the same. I said it before and I'll say it again. It's only with Naruto and Luffy people try to act like the shit is the same. We was talking about bleach. I promise. You would not say chakra is the same as spiritual pressure. I know you wouldn't dare say that chakra is the same as Dragon Ball z's key. He lets regular humans fly and make raw energy blasts. There's no equivalency. But why are we trying to act like there's one here? There's not. Fuck the versus battle. Just stop acting like this shit is the same."

Obviously that's why I keep seeing people bring up Goku. Cause he's never destroyed a planet. This just shows the length of willful ignorance Naruto fans participate in to glaze him. Cause why are we comparing an alien from a race of people that blow up planets for fun? And look, this is King Vegeta, a weak ass character relative to now why are we comparing Saiyan to a human enhanced with Chakra? Like he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to blowing up planets. And with the whole destructive capability conversation. He put all his chakra into this move. After he did this him and Sasuke had to fight hand to hand cause they had no chakra left. If not even destroying a country is what most of your chakra is gonna do, where is the leap and logic coming from to say he can destroy a planet? I've never seen this many gymnastics done for a character to make them more powerful about statements and chain scaling and all this other shit. He put all his chakra into a punch and damaged the moon. He didn't even destroy it. But where are the calc man? Where. Where are the statements? Where. Where are y'all pulling this shit out of your ass that he can blow up a planet?",

They got bro in the flag Bandana. They got the shades on. He wears shades all the time. Studded Jean jacket. Bro, come on. So I used to fucking hate bandit Keith. I used to hate that motherfucker. Bro was cheating. Bro was arrogant. Bro was mean to yugi. Yeah! Guess what bro's strongest card was? It was a card called slot machine. Slot machine! Who else loves to gamble more than us? You got like, Funny Valentine from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Stan's name is dirty deeds done dirt cheap. That's an AC DC song. This character's name is stars and stripes. He gets to call in jets on her command. Like the Air Force. And of course there's a super obvious one of all might, right? Bro's ultimate move is literally called United States of smash. All of his moves are named after states. I don't know if it's weird to say, but it warms my heart that it's still happening in animes today. Yeah, Shit's mad funny and I hope it doesn't stop.",

    "voice_to_text": "You said for you know, you would have to be able to scale to them to hurt and and the manga she broke that bitch's horn. So. Okay, let's throw in a little thing called context and see what I actually said. Now what did I start with? 3 means that somebody has the ability to destroy a planet. It doesn't mean that they have to have destroyed a planet, because it would make no sense in the context of the story for Naruto to destroying planets. But through feat statements, chainscaling, and logic we can figure out how strong would the strongest version of a character be and what they would be capable of. Notice how I said using feats, statements, chain scaling, and logic we can figure out how strong the strongest version of a character would be. What I did not say is using one out of context feed while ignoring all of the statements and chain scaling that points to the contrary. Now, because I said this is shown and stated to be able to create and destroy entire dimensions, complete with entire solar systems. So even if Naruto and Sasuke jumped Kaguya, being able to fight somebody who has the ability to create and destroy entire dimensions with entire solar systems, to even be able to damage this person, you have to at least be able to scale relative to them. Now again, if you apply a thing called context. I'm not saying that to Be able to damage Kaguya, you would have the ability to create and destroy multiple dimensions. Because the question at hand is is Naruto planetary, not is Naruto multidimensional? And the argument I was making is that Naruto is planetary, not that Naruto is multi dimensional. If we take this same logic in the context of what I just said, it logically follows that because Naruto was able to damage Kaguya, but also has statements putting him a planetary, has fought characters with ten tails powers, who is confirmed to be a planet destroyer, has easily defeated characters who are stronger than Madara and Obito maxed out with ten tails powers, and has gotten considerably stronger since the end of Shippuden. It can be reasonably argued that Naruto is planetary or would have the ability to destroy a planet. So yes, Sakura being able to damage Kaguya confirms that Sakura is a top tier, but all her other feed statements and chainscaling prove that she is significantly weaker.",

So my aunt lives in the Jersey Shore, and, like, she has a, like, beach themed bedroom. Like, is this what people do in Nashville? Okay, hot take. I kind of like this one."

This isn't even destroying a country. How are people saying he's galaxy level and universal and all this other shit then I see people say oh, he fought Kaguya and she can do this, so he's now on this level. But he didn't really fight Kaui. They jumped her and none of them had the power to beat her, so they sealed her as a team. I don't know how this affects Naruto scaling at all in baryon mode. Gives him a solid boost of speed and strength in combat. Can't even use big attacks cause it'll exhaust the form in one move. Even then, he ran out of chakra before he could beat a shiki. The when I put him against somebody like Omni Man and the responses are just oh, Naruto's outerversal, he's galaxy level, so I'm the man doesn't stand a chance. Sounds like bullshit. We have never seen Naruto destroy a planet. We have never seen him do some shit like this. Look at his home. Not just this, the zipping back and forth destroying the whole shit. Guy. Get the Naruto, be your favorite character, but damn, ain't no way y'all really think he beat on me, man?",

And the main argument that people say here is that Demon Slayer is a very simplistic story. So the main reason that people enjoy is because the animation is so top notch? To which I always respond why does it matter? A simplistic story is not a bad thing. Dragon Ball is one of the greatest animes of all time, but let's be honest, it's a rather simplistic anime. And again, that's not a bad thing. All the way up to Dragon Ball Super, a new villain shows up, new power UPS are made, new transformations are made, and then they win. I'm not saying that there can't be depth such as Vegeta's character development, but the same thing happens in Demon Slayer as well as we get more development and more backstory behind each one of the Hashira. And even the main character Tanjiro doesn't change all that much. Slightly, but not that much. Whereas the same thing for Dragon Ball. Goku as the main character doesn't change all that much. Changes slightly, but not that much. Being simplistic is not a bad thing. I don't understand why for Demon Slayer it's demonized but not for other animes. But like usual, this just my opinion. Let me know what you guys think. Do you think that Demon Slayer is carried by animation? And if So do you think that's a bad thing",

After South Korea proposed last week, $75,000 per baby that a family has, Japan is in desperate need, okay? And they are calling all black men, specifically immigrants, um, to come and impregnate their women so that they can save their dying population. I don't understand, because, you know, black men were once and still is, on the inner side, side of the line, which means their lives. I mean, what. What are you going to guarantee us if we send our men over there to help save you? Could you imagine? Think about this. After everything they put us through, everything, y'all trying to take these men out now you need them to repopulate the earth? The United States is responsible for what's going on over there in Japan. Why should we be held responsible? And get this, they ain't even paying no money to do it. They're just saying, please, please, black men, immigrants, please come have babies without women. Here's the thing. We gonna need the Russian test, because it could be from what happened years ago as to why their population is down. You know what I'm saying? That stuff still in the soil, it's still in the air. You already know what I'm talking about. What's that white man name that thought it Was a genius idea to create the biggest bullet in the world. Oklahoma. Yeah, that's his name. So why is it that, you know, y'all called him this? Y'all called him that? You is late and you did this, and now you ain't calling? You ain't calling, but you calling. But to come save your community. And i'mma go over there and i'mma start me a negotiation firm over there in Asia and stuff. And I'm going to have black men come breed with them. But they're gonna get benefits. They're gonna get lifetime Protection from any type of child support. If they decide to leave and don't wanna stay in these here countries, they're going to be set for life. Which means anything that these kids bring, it is gonna come back directly to the black family. Which means if I send Shek over there to breathe, right? Let's just say, hypothetically, I sent him over there on a contract breeding. Anything that these kids inherit is gonna come back to us the same way they do it with these. You know, we used to be slaves on this land out here. And anything that we work, you know, I'm saying they own and went back to their family, we gonna start sending it back to Africa, back to the black families. That's the type of contract I need.

I'll be your sensei if you subscribe on the red play button app. But let's answer this Shazam Shinobi, let's get active! So the first sensei we can eliminate is Stein from Soul Eater. He's just very weak in comparison to everybody else on this list, despite being a really cool character. The next sensei that can go is Aizawa from My Hero Academia. His quirk erasure only works against other quirks, and there's no evidence that it would be able to work against the abilities of all of the other sensei. And his entire verse just doesn't really scale to everybody else's verse. The next sensei I would eliminate is Jiraiya from Naruto. Kakashi is a more powerful Naruto character and has higher feats. The next character I would eliminate is Dark King Rayleigh from one piece because I think Hokage Kakashi is more powerful than him. Next I would get rid of Gojo because Yami, Kakashi, and Kisuke can all get through Gojo's infinity and Master Roshi could literally just blow up the planet. I would go ahead and remove Captain Yami next. Then I would go ahead and get rid of Kakashi. And in the final battle between Kisuke, Orihara and Master Roshi, I would give the win to Kisuke. This is because Kisuke is more powerful than Master Roshi. Now, if I could pick any of these masters to be my sensei, I personally would either choose Master Roshi or Kakashi"

Kaido do really do much for Luffy outside of Awakened Year 5. The best way to explain it with Dio. All of these antagonists here, there were kind of longstanding effects of what they've done to the main character. Even outside of when these guys aren't present, Dio just appears in the main character's lives for a bit, then gets defeated, and then Sayonara the next. I would say Shigaraki, Pain, and Mahito. Mahito and pain definitely change Naruto and Yuji's perspective on life, since after Naruto defeated pain, he understood the cycle of hatred better. And then Yuji had the whole we the same we twinning, except he said it in a lot more of a, um, murderously intentful way. I shall say now. After Peyton Maito, I say Shigaraki and Peyto. Peyto is similar to Maito and peyto with how it was they were just around for a moment. But the things that peyto did to gon, bro. He seemed like a completely different person and even lost his net. Peyto affected gon so much that he stopped being the main character of the story. Then as for Shigaraki, I feel like Shigaraki showed Deku what is actually like to be a hero. What it means to be a hero. Since when Deku was in the one for all kind of world Deku showed how great of a hero he actually is with him wanting to save Shigaraki instead of ending him. Of course, the whole war going on now blah blah blah blah blah. This leaves us with an easy top 3. Aizen, Makimo, aztel, and honestly any order to me is fine. Aizen literally constructed most of Ichigo's life. Him making the hollow that became white that ended up biting Ichigo's mom, poisoning her, blah blah blah. Makimo just completely manipulated everything with Denji. With a lot of the ideologies Denji has now in part two of Chainsaw Man, a lot of them come from his experience with Makumo. I would say Makumo is No. 3, and I think there are arguments for both Aizen and Askeleton number one. Orphan's whole life is based on revenge and redemption, and none of that would have happened without escalate. However, each girl's life still would have been somewhat similar without Aizen. I'm assuming, since even without Aizen's intervention, he still would have been part Quincy and part Soul Reaper. So as I said, there are arguments for either one at No. 1, but I'm going to say Escalad due to everything that thorfin has dedicated his life to stepping from him. That's what I've got. Follow for more. And which antagonists hit impact to their main characters life the most? Bye.",

So the first one is Bleach Soul Residence, which is an upcoming bleach mobile game. Kind of like Bleach brave souls, except it's a 3D game with much better graphics and looks like it has better functions. We got a console game that just got confirmed, that being rebirth of souls, we have a China exclusive thousand year Blood War game, and then we just got announced that another K Lab game is coming, which is basically going to be another bleach Brave Souls mobile game. Now, even though two out of the four games on this list are mobile games, one is a Chinese exclusive, I'm most excited for that console game. Bleach easily has the most potential to have the best anime game ever, so if they do this console game right, it might just go down as the best anime video game.

A majority of people who are doing anime debates these days have zero interest in truth seeking. It's all about winning and not admitting whenever you're wrong. My my stance is not changing at all. It's guaranteed, but it doesn't have a guaranteed so it's gonna. So that's the. That's the trade off. Because it's a flurry of attacks within an area is going to hit you, but it's not like it's a guaranteed hit. Like a Jacob's Ladder or something like that. And for the record, this absolutely no hate to this content creator whatsoever. If you want to anime debate and the thing you care about is winning, that's fine. It's your hobby, do your own business. But if you openly admit that no matter how many points I bring up, you will never change your mind, then there's no point in us debating. And if I can forbatum show you a scan that says that Sukuna's open domain expansion has a sure hit effect, and you can read it and say yes, but he doesn't have a sure hit effect, then we're not debating anymore. You're just not wanting to admit you're wrong. This is why a majority of the time if I'm going to debate someone on anime, I say they have to pay me first.",

Then you shouldn't be watching these other anime either. And then proceeded to use two of the worst examples I've seen. First things first, you brought up Master Roshi from Dragon Ball as if Master Roshi is the main character and the entire story is centered around him being a P3. Deal? We are not worried about Master Roshi at all. The entire story of what? Shunku Tensei is a redemption story about Rudy and how he becomes this new and better person in this new world. When at the end of the series he doesn't even become this new and better person. He's just as weird at the beginning as he is at the end. Even in the novel I've seen they get into even weirder stuff. That's for another video. Your next example was Raroni Kenshin and you got the talking about the author as if the author wrote any of the stuff that he was doing in real life in his manga. As far as I know, we're only kitchen has no inkling of anything that was going on in Michoku Tensei. I don't know why it's so hard for people to believe that people don't wanna watch their main character being a P3 to you. He literally put a camera in his 10 year old niece's bathroom to watch her take A bath. And then on her funeral day, spanking his monkey to it. Are you serious? It's strange. You could have brought up something like, I don't know, seven deadly sins, which was well received way back in the day, but then people started hating it because of Meliodas is strange. It's not a good look for you defending this series so tough when there are way better series and way other series that you could be defending. Bro, you're cooked for this one.",

    "voice_to_text": "Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 2:59 translations are out and sukuna not holding back couldn't be any more clear. The repeated use of binding vows to alter his effects of range meant that during his battle with Gojo Satsudu, the furnace remained cooled as sukuna didn't have the freedom to unseal its flames. And despite their absurd power, the flames within the furnace lack both speed and range. So the only reason that Sukan had to constantly change the conditions of his domain expansion is because he couldn't afford to get hit with unlimited void until after Maharaga adapted. Which means Gojo is the reason that sukuna could not use his fire arrow. And because the fire arrow both lacks speed and range, it would not bypass Gojo's Infinity. Not only that, but as we saw with Choso being able to block Yuji, this is not a sure hit effect. This attack actually travels. And since Choso burned away over time, this means you could heal it with a verse curse technique. Like I said. And for those who saying the divine flames negate RCT, prove it because you can. So the whole Sukano was holding back debate is officially over. Like I had mentioned, whenever Gojo said that Sukano wasn't able to give it his all, that's him not being able to use the fire Arrow and his other abilities cause they were ineffective against Gojo in his Infinity. Anything that Sukano fans try to bring up now at this point Is 100% cope",

In the way I look at it, you're completely ignoring why Sasuke did what he did, only because it affected a certain character that you really cared about and that you like. For example, like I've said in this video, people will say Sasuke is a terribly written character because he didn't listen to Itachi's wishes. They're completely ignoring why Sasuke didn't listen to Itachi's last wishes. And because he didn't listen to those wishes. Oh, he's a terribly rude character. No, that. That's not making any sense. There's no acknowledgement as to why Sasuke did what he did, or why he felt like he didn't need to listen to Itachi's wishes.",

Some of their sword styles are 100% at like an equalized normal level human level. There's his sword style would never actually work, but neither would Zoro's. At least not the three sword style.

They're not as good of a swordsman as, again, Saber or Zoro or Kenshin, Hamura, guts, whoever you wanna go them up against. Or Musashi. That. That's fine to say that they're not a master level swordsman, or. I mean for some of them. Um. Or to say that like they're not the greatest swordsman in anime.

    "voice_to_text": "I got a genuine question for the manga community here is the quality of the art within the manga a barrier to entry for you? This comment right here is saying storytelling over art. And overall I totally agree with this opinion. Like, a good story is gonna carry it way more than anything else. But we all know on the anime side that if the anime is super poorly animated, nine times out of 10 people are not gonna like it, even if it has a really, really good story. So my real question is, does that same mentality bleed over onto the manga side now? If I'm being honest, I'm just now really getting into reading physical manga heavily. I haven't spent that much time on that side of the medium. I'm mostly anime, but I'm really starting to get into manga, and this one comes from me talking about the Boruto manga. The Boruto manga is really, really plain. I'm not saying the story is bad, the story is cooking right now. But the manga itself is super plain, and for me that's a bit of a barrier to entry. Like, it's just genuinely not that enjoyable to read the panels because they're just kind of plain. In that same realm, I just started Sakamoto Days, which is a significantly smaller IP than Boruto. Sakamoto Days art looks absolutely amazing. The backgrounds are super detailed, the fight sequences are really, really good. It's not just a bunch Of lines. Overall it looks fantastic. So the question is like, why can an IP like Boruto not have that level of drawing in it? I just don't fully understand it. For me, art style is super huge. For me. To read a manga, I've got to enjoy what I'm looking at before I can get into the story. Now with something like Boruto, I kind of already know the story, so I could maybe argue that I could get into it simply because I'm already caught up with all of Naruto and all of the anime canon. Boruto. So like, the story can be enough to grab me, but even still, I've gone to start reading it and I'll just wait for the leaks to be honest. So you guys let me know in the comments at what point would you read a manga or not read a manga based on the art?"

The physical strength that Luffy had in episode 1 is the same physical strength that he has at marineford. We never see Luffy working out or trying to train to increase his strength. Because he never needed to. Luffy was always ridiculously strong. The only thing Luffy needed to improve pre time skip was his techniques. While sure, early in the story his raw physical strength was enough to overpower most of his enemies, he did eventually need to develop techniques like second and third gear. But what's important to note is that those don't affect his baseline physical stats, they are temporary power boost. And so while sure, you can use this to say Luffy has gotten stronger, his strength hasn't increased. The strength Luffy used to fight people like Alveda Morgan Buggy is the exact same strength that he used to fight admirals.",

Also, this guy robbed his children of their childhoods, drove his wife to insanity, and regularly beat her. And people are like, I can't believe you'd say he doesn't deserve to be a hero. All he's done to atone so far after putting his family through the ringer for a decade, be a little nicer to them. But he gets punished for his sins. He keeps getting more scarred and injured as a result of how he treated Dobby. But again, even if he's the one to end up defeating Dobby and putting an end to all of this, that hardly counts as a tone Man, because he would have just done that anyway, as per his job description. Even if Dobby weren't connected to him, it would be a tone, man, if he were a civilian with no powers who took up heroing to put an end to Dabi. Because he was the one who created him. Not. Not because he's just still doing the job he was always going to do.",

And I'm here to say that the gap isn't as big as you really think it is. So what people are tending to forget is that one piece at first was a flop when the anime came out. So one piece came out in 1999, Naruto in 2002, and Bleach 2,006. But when one piece came out, it really didn't see a lot of success until 2,008, during which time Naruto was actually the second most popular anime, right behind Dragon Ball. Bleach is kind of floating around from third to fifth place. What's also interesting is that the Naruto, the original one, ended in 2,007, which essentially allowed one piece to get more popularity. So essentially what happened was Naruto stopped in 2,007, um, so they can start working on Naruto Shippuden. And then one piece got a little breakout, and then that's where it kept going. But it's not like it was still far away, because Naruto came back in 2009 with Shippuden."

Okay, but I see people saying that they will not watch Muchako Tensei because of Rudy, but they love Dragon Ball and Master Roshi is essentially Rudius except he wasn't reincarnated. I have legit seen people love Rooney Kenshin. And you know, the author. He's literally. Rudy is gray rat but like in real life, not a fictional character. And really, when you look at anime as a whole, Rudy's character type. Like you know that the pervy character type exists in almost every single anime ever. But people don't have a problem with those in those other animes. It's just with Muchacho Tensei though, right? Hmm. Interesting, interesting. Yeah, that's why Rudy is the most important anime character of all time. That dude be exposing hypocrites 24 7. Have a great day staying the night.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm convinced once you stop watching anime, bro, it's almost impossible to get back into watching it, bro. The reason is because a lot of anime, especially the older ones, are genuinely horrible. And the reason is either because they're meant to be an advertisement for the manga, or the longer ones have the worst pacing of all time. Try to milk as much money as humanly possible. Or to try to stay behind the manga. And before people start talking about oh, your attention span is cooked. If you're telling a story and you can't keep the attention of your audience, it is a bad story. I'm not watching a documentary about the history of centipedes. I'm watching a show about teenagers who beat up aliens. But I feel like a lot of us, especially growing up, were so used to mediocre fiction because we're so used to watching whatever boring show was on Cartoon Network. Because streaming wasn't really a thing. And now when you can stream the pika series whenever you want, it's hard for me to watch a show. And one interesting thing happens every 30 episodes. That's why I'm so happy that I finished Naruto as a kid, because I know for a fact if I watch Naruto as an adult I would not like it at all. The manga is probably fine with the anime. No way. A lot of people don't know this, but one piece used to be my favorite series growing Up. And then I stopped and took like a ten year break. Then I got back into it as an adult and it just wasn't good. And I'm sure that if I finished the series when I was a kid like I finished Naruto when I was a kid, I'd probably be one of those annoying one piece stands on this app right now. Anime doesn't hit the same as it used to because most animes are objectively just not good. That's why I'm always tell people read the manga, read the manga because it is rare to watch an anime that even comes close to being as good as the manga.",

Oh my god it's so boring. No, because it's not like I'm being so for real when I say this. How small of an attention span do you have to have to come up with a take like this? It's like season 3 first off just started. It's only about like five episodes in. And what the past couple of episodes have been doing showing the repercussions of what happened at the end of Season 2, showing the stakes of Season 3, and expanding on character depth and world building. Slime typically is 24 episodes of season, but god forbid they expand character depth of world building in any of those episodes. Think that somebody who likes Naruto so much would appreciate character depth and world building, but I guess not. So I know it's not just me that thinks this, but saying that Slime Season 3 is one of the worst seasons of anime ever made, especially when it's only like five episodes in has to be one of the most brainless takes I've heard on an anime in a while. Especially when stuff like shield Hero season 2 exist, which he mentioned in his video. And even that's not the worst. Season 3 of slime is an ass. That take was.",

It's because the author of the series is a terrible person. Nobody here. Watsuki was caught with so much children material that the police thought that he was a distributor. They like his collection was so large they thought, this has to be a storage bank that he's dealing from. A lot of us just don't look at the series the same way anymore. I know that a lot of people are able to separate the art from the artist, and that's fine. If you wanna watch it, I recommend not watching it on an official service. But that's really why we don't talk about this series is because we don't wanna advertise this series.

    "voice_to_text": "Many people suffer from constipation, so I invented this unobstructed toilet. We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

I don't know exactly what this comment is attempting to reference. It was just left on a video from several months ago about why chimpanzees and humans are related but that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually came from one another. So I don't know if this is talking about abiogenesis or evolution or the big bang or what. I've heard similarly factuous things about all of those and so much more because there's a lot of people out there whose whole job it is to be wrong about science professionally. And then they go out and they do debates and they make creationist videos and they try really really hard to convince as many people as possible their mischaracterization of science as one person holding up a Bible and another person holding up On the Origin of Species and \"they both have books and you just have to decide which one to have faith in\" is in any way accurate or reasonable and it just isn't. That simply is not how science works. And aren't you glad? The whole reason you're able to watch my stupid face on your cellphone right now is because science doesn't work that way. So, if you wanna learn more about what science actually says and how it actually works, I have a whole channel over on the play button platform where I make lots and lots of videos about evolution and about the age of the earth and about all sorts of other cool science stuff and I even go out and debunk those pseudoscience videos that try to teach ridiculous nonsense like creationism. And I also host several live call-in shows where people can just call me directly, live on the air, and challenge me about evolution or about religion or about politics or whatever else! So check me out on those shows as well! I'll talk about some of them over here in the comment section. I hope to see you over there because I would really love to teach you science sometime.",

I decorated it because that's what the Kindle girlies do, and I'm just copying them. Well, it wasn't enough to just get an e reader. I also needed a clicker that I could hold in my hands so I could lay in bed and not have to physically swipe on my reader to turn the pages. So I proceeded to get a miniature keyboard. And then not only did I get a miniature keyboard that I can customize the different buttons to work on my Android e reader device, you can literally change these keycaps. So I bought these custom keys. These also do light up, by the way. And now if I want to read my book in bed like the nerd I am, goes forward, back, and this one refreshes the screen, and I love it.

Like I remember a few years ago Black Clover was on the same level of popularity with my Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen, Boruto, all these new gen series. And now just no one even talks about it ever since it was removed from Shonen Jump. It's only gotten so much worse for the series because since August it's only had three chapters, and two chapters literally came out last week and not a single person is even talking about them. Black Clover genuinely had one of the worst fall offs in all of shown in history. And it doesn't help with the fact that the anime has been on hiatus for like four years and all they've done with it is released a non canon movie last year. It's genuinely sad to see that a series that once stood at the very top is now just never talked about and is practically forgotten. It's crazy that this is the series that used to be like the main rival to My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen, and now Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia both kept growing in popularity and Black Clover just fell off.",

First of all, I don't know what's going on with my TikTok, but it's not letting me stitch people back. So I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have to figure that out. But I wanted to just take a second and talk about this fight right here because I know I'm about to piss off a lot of bleach fans, but this is facts. This fight was not that good. This fight was anti climactic. This fight was a big letdown. Alright? Everyone talks about this fight. The best part of this fight was the beginning, when Ichigo mushes the crap out of Aizen. Everything else, not as good. Not even close. In fact, Aizen versus everybody was way better than this. Ichigo versus Uruguayora was better than this. Ichigo versus Grimjow was better than this. There are so many moments in fights that are better than this. I don't know why people give this the hype. Yes, it was cool to see Ichigo get the final mugetsu. And yes, it was good to see his final move, even though his final move didn't really work technically. But outside of this. They were just flexing. They were just flexing. It wasn't a good fight. There was no suspense. There was nothing really drawn out by this fight. It was not a great fight. Kaido versus Luffy was Way better. Yeah. I mean, fact. Let's go through all the fights that were way better than this fight from one piece, since that's how this was brought up. First we have Sanji versus Queen. Better, easily. Zoro versus king. Hands down better. Lawn kid versus big mom. Yes, still better. And then everything that Luffy does is better. I mean, Gear 5th. Come on, come on! Gear 5th was light years better than this. And I have to remember, this isn't even the response to the video that you made, which I have to figure out how I can stitch. I might just, like, record it and then throw my thing on top. Phrasing on that one. This is not a good fight. This was a boring fight. I was extremely let down. Now, was I as let down as the end of bleach? No, no, that was a worse let down. But this was anticlimactic. It was building up. Aizen was building up. They were getting stronger. They were getting stronger. And then essentially, when Ichigo pulled up, the fight was over. There was no more fight. It was done. He was way stronger than Aizen. And Aizen, he went from being like Uchiha Madara to Orochimaru losing to Sasuke. You know what I mean? It makes no sense. It makes no sense at all. So people who think that this fight is peak. I don't think it's peak. I think there's fights in bleach that are peak Uh. Ichigo versus Byakuya, the first one where he finally reveals his bankai. Ichigo versus Rukiora absolutely peak. There are some fights in the Thousand Year Blood War um. That are pretty good, but Ichigo Aizen ain't one of them."

Like this random dude comes out of nowhere and instantly gets insane feats. Like Sling monsters have been terrorizing the entire world for hundreds of years. Single handedly making these complex plans to destroy the witch cult and slave sin archbishops, completely outsmarting some of the most intelligent people in 3:00, becoming a hero respected by all within a year and saving cities from destruction. Conquering mythical places of history and flawlessly predicting everything. Leading a revolutions and civil wars that topple nations. Knowing the exact right thing to say at the exact right time. This is also why so many people love the if stories for RE0 even though they're like only one chapter long. Because like, imagine Subaru not having morals. Like Subaru generally must have insane aura and reputation in RE0.",

He pulled up on the damn toads. Everybody was ready to throw hands in honor of Jiraiya. That really is what it meant. The fact that he brought everyone and this face, he was piercing through pain. Because Naruto was there to handle business. And the fact that he mastered Sage mode in the time frame that he did was just like what he did. And now the match up has occurred. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki versus pain! And Naruto was there and it was just like. It is such a profound anime moment for me. Just because we were all waiting for this moment, waiting for Naruto to be able to avenge Jiraiya. We didn't know what the full stage mode would have looked like if he was gonna be able to master it. And he comes fully mastered it prepared and it was just like, let's go! It's such a proud moment, but such an incredible moment. And then as we proceed to see what the stage mode produces and what is capable of is just like, oh my god, it's so lit! But you tell me, TikTok.

I moderate panels for collecticon, and stuff like this is one of the reasons why voice actors are so hesitant to do panel sometimes. Stuff like this is why some actors don't enjoy doing panels. Now, I'm sure this young lady didn't have any malicious intent. She probably just wanted to get a laugh. But this is why people think the my Hero Academia fanbase is incredibly toxic.

Alright, so I saw my Mutual Teddy be saying uh, talk about this, but I disagree with his assessment of the situation. Um. If this would have been Gohan instead of Krillin? Cause essentially Teddy said you know, Krillin had already died once, so he doesn't you know Goku was still been Super Saiyan. But go Krillin already died and that was Goku's main anger. If I'm not mistaken. The Dragon Balls weren't in play yet. And I don't think Goku's dumb and basic. Not in a bad way. We know Goku's character. That's what I mean by that. Goku wouldn't have been thinking about the Dragon Balls and about bringing Gohan back that way. Especially with Piccolo already being hurt and the making Dragon Balls at this point gone. Goku would have snapped. He most definitely would have gone Super Saiyan, but there's a very good possibility that that Super Saiyan transformation then goes to him being berserk. Because the feelings that Goku has for krill and his best friend for majority of his life are completely different than the feelings you would have for your child. And the different than the feelings Goku would have for. Go on. You know, there's zero thought in my head that the catalyst that made him go Super Saiyan would still not. Where wouldn't be there? Like if he's still going Super Saiyan but I think he would have gone berserk and not like so much so unlike the old school Dragon Ball Z or even Dragon Ball Super Broly going berserk, but throughout the entire fight was Super Saiyan. Goku was still his normal forgiving self. There would have been zero forgiveness in this situation. There would be zero playing around. We've seen Goku and Vegeta both get angry. Neither one of them plays around when they're angry. Especially if someone fucks with her family. There would be no resurrection after. There would be no Frieza coming back as a half Cyborg. Goku would have mergalized this boy. There's zero chance for Frieza surviving. Sorry.",

    "voice_to_text": "Yo, can we please talk about the fact that Orochimaru versus the 3rd Hokage is one of the best, if not the best fight in Naruto and nobody gives it props? You know, this fight should not even be considered Orochimaru versus the third hokage cause Orochimaru was just spectating. Technically this fight was just hashirama and tobirama jumping the living fuck out of Hiruzen. This fight is the perfect example of let him get up! LET him get up! And and when they both popped out of the reanimation box, they had personalities until Orochimaru controlled them. They were like ain't this the little homie here? Isn't from back in the day? You're old as fuck now, how you doing dog? And the animation is so raw, fast paced, and intense. The choreography is top tier. I don't know how to explain it, but this looks like a Boondocks episode. Just the lighting and shading. The coloring is darker than usual. And it only kept getting better and better by the second. As soon as that boy monkey King Enma shown up, it became a 10 out of 10 episode. Ooh, smack the god of Shinobi like it was nothing. I hope everyone knows that Monkey King Enma is basically just the legendary Sun Wukong, so of course bros gonna be overpowered. This episode has such a eerie feeling to it. Arochimaru's body kept constantly getting discombobulated. This shit was creepy. This shit is sinister, bro. This has to Be Arochimaru's most inhuman moment. Bro! Turn into a fucking baby faced woman! What is this shit? It was stated multiple times by ENMA that Hiruzen was fighting very strange. He wasn't given it his all. Cause at the end of the day, he still loves that fucking psychopath Orochimaru. And of course, what's the most iconic way for a hokage to sacrifice themselves and save the village? The reaper! Dead seal! Shout out Minato! During Hiruzen's final moments, Orochimaru was so defeated, you can see it in his eyes. He kept calling Hiruzen a dootard. What the fuck does that mean? It sounds like some ice cream. We talk about Shippuden way too much and we don't give enough respect to OG Naruto. So next up, let's talk about one of the most hectic moments in this series, when Kisame and Itachi pulled up on Naruto. Make sure to follow your boy for this one. Let's get it!",

    "voice_to_text": "The absolute vile things the author writes in Mr. Cotense don't even stop it, Rudius. For example, in the redundancy side stories at the end of the novel, Rudius's half sister Aisha, who's almost thirty, seduces ours, who is twelve, and ours is heiresses and Rudius's son. And then Aisha, who's his aunt, proceeds to get pregnant from ours. After that, we have a Nord who is only a teenager, Mary Richard, who's over 500 years old. You have cliff, who is 16, who marries Alina lies, who is 200 years old and over 5,000 years old if you count old dragon's tail. And don't even get me started how many times she statutory R words cliff. Lot of Michelle. Could Tensei fans defend this by saying, oh, this is normal in this type of world. This is normal in a medieval setting, which is. Yeah, that is a fair thing to say if the author did not glorify these type of relationships. For example, the author be like, oh, and every timeline, no one falls in love with Rudger. They are faded to fall in love with each other. Okay, like, not gonna state any problems with this kind of relationship whatsoever. Furthermore, Rudius, who is from our modern world, should have some sense of a modern moral compass. But Rudy's is totally fine with this type of relationship. In fact, he participates in liking children. Even Nana Hoshi, when she finds out that Rudy's was 30 years old. Before reincarnating is totally fine with Rudy's having relationships with underage girls. That is completely fine to her. And again, to the people who say oh this is a redemption story. Please stop using that argument. Because what made rudious bad? Like being a predator, liking a children. Rudous did not get any consequences for any of those things and did not learn a single thing about those aspects. Only thing that changed from the beginning of the series to the end is rudious at the start of the series was a sad predator. At the end of the series he was a happy one. That's all that happened. He did not learn. The author with Michelle Potense is just trying to normalize this type of things because he's sick in the head. That's all that it is.",

Now, granted, she was just fighting. I think this clip is from when her and 17 were fighting trunks and Gohan. But, um, yeah, she had been, you know, roaming around in the streets a little bit. We've got this kind of asymmetrical part going on. We've got one side tucked behind the ears, the other side hanging over. I mean, it's still cute, but if I have to pick between her and 1717 just wins me over. Maybe it's the Libra in me, but I just like the symmetry here. I like the balance. This silk press is just unmoved and unbothered. Seventeen might need to share some of his products with 18. Or maybe that's just the look that 18 is going for. Nobody's wrong. We're just arguing preference. And feel free to drop your opinion in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "I am generally convinced people who defend Rudy's grarat from Ashoka Tensei have not read the novel. The reason why Rudy's got kicked out of his brother's house in the web novel was way worse. So basically what happened was Rudy's put a secret camera in his niece's, who was 10 years old, bathroom and recorded her taking a bath. And during his parents funeral, instead of attending the funeral like the rest of the family, what he was doing was beating to the recording of his niece when his brother found. What Rudius was doing after he returned from the funeral was what got him kicked out of the house in the first place. There is a reason why the author of Mushoku Tensei hides his face. Mushoku Tensei has some of the most yikes things I've ever seen, and there is no reason to defend it whatsoever. And this is not even the worst thing that Rudy's does. Like, I can make an entire series of just like, crimes that Rudy's does, which are just not acceptable whatsoever. When people say there's consequences to a lot of Rudy's actions, there is. There's not. There's like, really not any consequences. There's no learning from it, there's no redemption, none of. And it's not even just Rudius, these two. I can make an entire video on just both of them. And it's such a shame, because if the author was not sick in the head, I would recommend this novel The World Building power system, the Lord, the characters, everything is so well made and fleshed out, but it's all ruined by the author's sick fantasies.",

And then when we see like the two minute fire where he went up against Loxus, we saw him use illusion magic. But I don't think that's the only magic that he had to have had in his bag, okay? Because he was taking down all those subdivisions, but he also had the strength of magic at least to make everyone in the guild fall asleep. Guildmaster was barely staying awake, Erza was sleep.

Before pouring my mixture onto it, I made sure to spread it as thin as I could. Thinner you get this batter, the crispier your corn flakes will turn out. And I popped it in the oven for about 15 minutes before pulling it back out and breaking up my pieces. At this point, it's still very soft, so it's easy to rip everything apart and get it into the shape and the size that you want. I was done ripping all of them up. I popped it back in the oven for about 50 minutes to an hour at a very low temperature. Once they were all cooled down and crispy, I poured my toddlers some cereal into their bowls. Today was a day that they wanted milk with their cereal, so I poured some milk on top, and their breakfast was done. I've been on a real cornflake kick lately, so this is very exciting for them.",

For me, I wanna focus on Shikamaru and the entirety of, like, the naraklan itself, but specifically, let's work with Shikamaru. Shikamaru's Nara clan has the ability of shadow manipulation jutsu. They're able to create and manipulate shadows. To an extent we see this. They're able to physically create shadows to strangle, physically create shadows, to puncture, to admit wounds, but also ordinarily be able to manipulate the shadows to control another person's ability of movement. This ability is. Is really good. It's really powerful ability. And when it comes to shadows, to be able to cast a shadow to literally take over the movements of another person's body, that. That's pretty dope. But I feel like Kishimoto never really extended on this. And there. There's an endless possibilities of what the naraklan should be capable one. Like, they should be shadow Masters, right? They should be able to summon shadows, possess shadows. There should be a shadow realm or a shadow dimension. As we saw in, um, the third hokage fight with Orochimaru, someone casted some form of a shadow based jutsu that sort of blinded the third hokage. They should be able to do this. Summon some form of realm or cloak of shadow and be able to have some sort of sight in, like, they should be masters of the night. They should Have summonings of like an owl. And they should be like an owl sage master of shadows. Like their act like their potential has never been reached. And it is crazy. Can you imagine if Shikamaru was a shadow based sage from like a I'll summoning? He could see at night. He could bring you to a shadow dimension. The where where the shadow possessions is even more crazy. And you can be stuck there in darkness forever. Like, I just wish that this would have been extended a lot more than it was. And I feel like the potential, if given, could be incredible. But you tell me, TikTok, who's an anime character that you believe, if given the opportunity, could be a lot more stronger than they are?

I mean, if you think about it that way they don't have to swap souls only twice a month, and Utah gains another teleportation technique. I think the reason why he didn't do it is mostly because always curse technique. Because swapping souls is not his curse technique, it's curse technique reversal. There has to be some sort of extra requirements that we don't know about Utah's curse just yet. Because honestly, tell me right now what could have stopped Utah from just taking a little bite out of everybody here and getting all their curse techniques? And that way he just becomes like some sort of super Utah bro. And he also beat kinjaku and ghetto. So what's stopping this man from collecting all the curse technique? Like some Pokemons, man? Now my intellectuals will tell you that curse techniques are only 5 per brain, but Utah over here got a U Haul extra storage handling unit because Rica can hold everything. And yeah, most of his curse techniques were also found in the domain expansion, so maybe it's limiting to his domain expansion which techniques is able to use. But yeah, have a good day."

I think that this comment has brought up an interesting question, and it's a question that I've been thinking about since the reveal that the one piece world is sinking into the sea. What do we think that actually mean? Is the land going down or is the sea going up? Because technically, both of those scenarios could be described as the world sinking into the sea. And depending on which scenario it is, both the cause and the solution to that problem could be radically different. If the world is sinking, as in the islands themselves are going down, then that probably means there's something wrong with the inside of the one piece planet. But if the world is sinking because the sea level is rising, and that means either the water is all being displaced by something, or more water is coming from somewhere, both are extremely different problems with extremely different solutions. I am super fascinated to see what people think about this. Do you guys think the world is sinking as in the islands are going down, or do you think the world is sinking as in the sea level is going up?",

Then we have the Testament of Sister New Devil if you like high school DXD. This is basically a high school DXD clone, except it's better animated. Then we have date alive. This just released a season 5. I'm enjoying the living hell out of it. It's great. Kurumi's best girl. If you disagree with me, you are actually wrong. How does it feel to be wrong? Is that crazy to me? Like crazy, bro. And then we have Trinity 7. This main character actually is willing to do things. It's absolutely crazy. On top of it having good action scenes, good animation, and actual good character development. This anime is a hidden gem that not a lot of people talk about. But you know what's even Wilder than these anime though? Something that actually had my mouth gaping for a little bit. Bro. Junior High School DXD. They are confirming a spin off of high school DXD called Junior High School DXD and honestly I feel like whoever's reading this, they Need to check the hard drives of these people bro.

Mishoku   Tensei   considered   the   Godfather   of   Isekai I wouldn't really think so.   wouldn't   really   think   so I mean, yes,   mean   yes the original light novel came out way before a lot of the other   original   light   novel   came   out   way   before   a   lot   of   the   other well known Isekai anime that came out before the Mishoku Tensei anime.   known   Isekai   anime   that   came   out   before   the   Mishoku   Tensei   anime But I wouldn't necessarily consider it to be like the Godfather.

So we've got second coming of Broly versus Super Saiyan Vegeta. Now, if you remember, the second coming of Broly takes place at the beginning of the boo arc, while this Vegeta, I'm assuming, is at the very end of the boo saga. Actually, I think that's Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. Yeah, that looks like Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. The Lightning is what kind of gives that away. I just didn't notice that at first. So who would win? Broly or Vegeta? And it's Vegeta. The same Vegeta that went toe to toe with Kid Buu. Granted, he didn't do very much, but he withstood most of his attacks. Only on the other hand, went up against a weaker version of Goku. Gohan and Goten. Granted it took their combined power to beat him, but at the end of the day, this version of Vegeta would be stronger overall. That final explosion against Majin Buu. Arguably much stronger than a family Kamehameha. Not to mention with the power output with Vegeto and everything, he's infinitely stronger than Broly. Now, I'm not saying that Vegeta plays a part in this, but the fact that Vegeta was able to toy with Buhon goes to show that Vegeta, being one part of Vegeta, was strong enough to do so. So I mean, that itself kind of just makes sense.",

It does. It very much does. Whether you like to believe it or not, animation is a huge reason as to why people start watching a series. A big reason why anime such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen are so popular is because of their insane animation production. Now, I'm not trying to say that the only reason why they're popular is because of their animation, but you cannot deny that good animation plays a big role in boosting a series of popularity. For example, Boruto had one episode where they had phenomenal animation, and this episode was enough to spark back a wave of popularity into the Boruto series. Imagine how popular a series like Boruto or even My Hero Academia would be if they had the same level of animation as another series like Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen. So many more people would be watching these series if they had insane animation. So yeah, people really can't deny how big of a role animation plays in anime."

    "voice_to_text": "I think my biggest problem with the Dragon Ball franchise is really the fact that in Dragon Ball Z Kai final chapters, it should have become about Gohan. Like anything after that should have been about Gohan. He should have been the new main character. Mind you, I have no problem with his character and how he turned out. It's been obvious since he was first introduced as a child that he wasn't gonna be a fighting, loving saying like Goku. But we should have seen that struggle first hand as him being our new main character. I love Goku, but we've enjoyed Goku for decades. It was time to move on. What's the point building up all this hype and cell saga, talking about Gohan being able to surpass his father, and then he just never does it. As he was stronger than Goku and them at the end of Cell Saga, but anything past that, he became one of the weakest members again. Yeah, yeah, I know. That new movie, he got like that. That beast form or whatever this shit was called. But it's such a cop out, such a clear fucking cash grab. It doesn't make up for the fact that he just got hold. Cell Saga was the perfect introduction to our new lead and they said, fuck it, we're going back to Goku. And if I'm being honest, if they had switched it and made it to where, okay, Gohan was the first one. To achieve super saying, god, that would have been so beautiful. The new protector of earth. And you can't say it's impossible to move from one main character to the next, cause we've seen shows do it. JoJo successfully changes main characters every goddamn season. And you don't even see the new main character in the preview season. They just get introduced in that new season first episode. Hey, maybe that's just me.",

Because Obito can create the portal to Kamui wherever it is that he wants. So, unfortunately, that's just not true. And I think this guy is confusing Obito's calm way with the calm way that Kakashi has. Obito's calm way allows him to be intangible to certain parts of his body, or his entire body into the calm way dimension. However, for him to drag other people into the calm way dimension, he has to make contact with them. We've seen this multiple different times. And this even how you're able to counter him. As we learn from Minato, whenever he grabs Matto's hand, he's able to try to transport him to the calmly dimension, but Minato teleports away. In order to do this, he must be fully solidified. Which is why whenever Minato actually speed blitzed him, he was so fast, he couldn't react and put himself into the Kamui dimension. So unlike Kakashi, who would try to put a Kamui right over Gojo's head, Obito simply can't do this. Without the ability to actually touch Gojo, he then can't put him into the Calmway dimension. So Obito's version of Calmway cannot bypass Gojo's infinity. Neither can Kakashi's. That's a video for another time."

Krillin would unironically defeat every single vulture by including end of series Mark by himself. The vulturemites are incredibly powerful inside of the invincible universe, but we're talking about Dragon Ball, where they are just significantly faster and significantly stronger in every single regard. In order to destroy a planet, Omni Man needed the help of two other vulture mites and needed the planet's core to be attacked by a laser that was able to penetrate through the entire thing to make it unstable and weakened in the first place. And he still didn't even blow up the entire planet. He just attacked the core, leading to the planet's destruction. Whereas all the way back in original Dragon Ball Z characters that Krillin is significantly stronger than now could destroy planets with relative ease. I mean, I don't think anyone's gonna sit here and say that Krillin currently is weaker than the Dragon Ball Z Vegeta that bowed Goku and it was threatening to blow up the entire planet.

Let's talk about. For me, it absolutely hands down my opinion. For me, for what this anime has done personally, for me and my love for anime, it absolutely is Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I definitely believe these two anime are the precipice of the anime community to what it is today. When I first got on TikTok and start talking about anime or mentioning anything about anime, the majority of the videos that other creators were making was based on Naruto, and I think that helped propel this anime to a level that it hadn't seen before with social media. If you look at the Naruto hashtag, it's like billions and billions and billions and billions. I believe it's one of the highest hashtags on this app just simply because of how it's reciprocated within our community. This anime makes you cry, makes you smile, gives you hope, gives you belief that people are good out there, let you realize that you don't have to be the best in order to succeed, and absolutely shows you that you could have a terrible beginning. You can fail and fail and fail, but as long as you believe in yourself and believe in your goal and proactively work towards that and building yourself up, you can't obtain it. That's one of the Biggest feces anime. Teaches you across the board and I love that. Not to mention it's a dope ass anime and it's a great starter anime. It's a great. It's just a great anime overall, and I definitely think it transcends time as you see it collectively. Here is still here in 2024. But you tell me, TikTok, what is an anime that you believe will transcends time or possibly is one of the greatest anime of all time? You tell me. In second place for me is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Absolutely.",

    "voice_to_text": "I saw this post and it actually got me thinking. If Eisen successfully was able to beat Ichigo and went up to Soul Society to fight Squad Zero, what would have happened to him? I think this is a very accurate depiction of what would have happened if Eisen decide to go up. There's no way I can see this version of Aizen soloing the entirety of Squad Zero by himself. Now I understand. Aizen currently at this moment has the whole Goku, and the whole Goku would probably evolve throughout Aizen's fight with Squad Zero. However, I definitely think that they would be able to subdue Aizen before Aizen's Hogyoku evolves even further. Especially somebody like Ichibe. Ichibe was able to go toe to toe with yuhaw until yuhaw decide to absorb the powers of all the remaining Quincy. Aizen at this point in the story was not on that level. If we're talking about Thousand Year blood or Aizen, that is a whole different story. Because this version of Aizen would definitely probably be able to Solo Squad Zero. This. Aizen would get absolutely thrashed by the entirety of Squad Zero, and probably by Ichibe alone. It's a good thing Ichigo was able to stop Aizen in this moment, because Aizen would have gotten embarrassed if he went up.",

Dope has been beaten by Beerus. He's been being Nigerian. I doubt he could be any of the other gods of destruction. He's not stopping Zeno. Goku's not even top five and it's all verse. Who's your favorite anime character of all time? That. That's a tough one. Honestly, I got a shout out to my boy Black Star Patrol leader. Black Star is so underrated. People find him annoying. I think he just got that sauce. He's got that sauce. He's literally him. He got the different type of drip nobody got. First off, Soul Eater just got the best drip in all anime in my opinion. The music is gas. The music is gas, bro. I read the manga for Soul Eater, right? I wanna read those. Should I read it? Yes. Like the love that they get Blacksart in the manga.

Yo haters really be coping so bad because you know, Ichigo's soul is your favorite series so you have to make excuses about it. Oh cool about Naruto. He would give Naruto every single power in the building of the series. What is Ichigo? Ichigo has Shinigami Powers, Hollow Powers, and Quincy Powers. Quincy Powers that he doesn't use, by the way. Let's just forget that one. Naruto and Luffy are both worse, but again, y'all conveniently leave that out because y'all just don't wanna cope with Naruto. You have child of prophecy, the soul of an Otsutsuki with being the reincarnation of ashira. Throwing the reincarnation of a god in there. Not only being the jinchuriki of the strongest Biju, but also having the chakra of the strongest Biju literally in his DNA, having incredible chakra reserves as an uzumaki, being a perfect sage, having stage of six paths Chakra, and being the child of the literal hokage and the previous 9,000 Turkey. What are we actually talking about right now? And then you look at Luffy. The reincarnation of Joy Boy, the successor of Roger. Powers of the Sun God. The strongest devil fruit to exist from the clan of D with all forms of hockey. Like. What are we actually talking about right now?

There's a bit of controversy going around a new remake that was just announced. The one piece. Now, the one piece is going to be a remake of one piece. One piece has already done a bunch of takes on this. You know, there's the original anime version, there's the manga version, there's a movie version of East Blue, and there's even been the recent live action Netflix adaptation which does East Blue. So this will be the fifth version of that story. Some people are like, why do we need to be doing this again? Isn't there better things that we could be spending budget and time and production on? They're just trying to play into this success that they're having to get more bang for their buck. But the dangers of doing something like that is if you just get too much one piece going on at once, you can kind of overwhelm the audience. You can burn people out.

Details are out for chapter 11 14 of one piece, and we're finally gonna get to meet the original joy boy! This week's chapter is called The Wings of Icarus, and it will apparently start with Doctor Vega Punk continuing his broadcast and talking about the Void Century. He clarifies that he actually doesn't know much about this period in history, but he does tell us that 900 years ago, there was a man from the ancient kingdom known as Joy Boy. Had the power to stretch just like Luffy. But to be honest with you guys, I doubt we'll get much from Vega punk on Joy Boy outside of a few more vague remarks confirming information that we already knew about him and a few silhouettes. The least he could do is tell us what the fuck that giant straw hat locked in a freezing vault below the Holy Land is. But during this chapter, we will also apparently see the mother flame submerged underwater in a tank. And we will also get to see more reactions from people around the world to Doctor Vega Punk's message. But sadly, since we are getting Chapter 11 fourteen this week, that means we'll be on break next week. So stay tuned for more and cope harder!",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm confused. How is Code Geass a shojo? Now I understand the confusion because people use shonen, shojo, josei, and seinen to describe genres when they are just demographics. Basically, who is the target audience? Shonen just means that the target audience is adolescent boys. So basically young teenagers to young adults. Show Joe is the same thing, but for adolescent girls, and then say Nen is targeted towards adult men and Joe, Say, is targeted towards adult women. Typically, the easiest way to figure out what the target demographic is to a manga series is to just look at the magazine that it's released in. For example, anything released in Shonen Jump is clearly a shonen. However, Code Geassa Lucia the rebellion was released in Osaka Magazine, which is a Shojo magazine. The target audience for everything in this magazine is adolescent girls. But if you think of, like, the demographic and the genre as the same thing, it's gonna get really confusing, if I asked you to point out which one of these three is the seinen, I bet your first guess wouldn't be Apothecary Diaries. In case you're wondering, this series right here is called Queen's Quality, and this one is called Requiem of the Rose King. Those two are both Shojo, and they both fall into the genre of dark fantasy.",

Du coup, la mer, elle arrive au niveau du ch\u00e2teau de pang\u00e9a, au niveau du redline, tout en haut. Et le phare, il peut effectivement \u00e9clairer tout ce qui se passe autour. Donc l\u00e0, oui, le phare, il aurait 1 int\u00e9r\u00eat. Et ce phare qu'on voit, je.

I'm so serious. That's the entire show. Solo leveling is kind of just like SAO for the modern anime kids. Oh my god guys, he's so cool and emo and mysterious and he has black hair! Nobody cares! The main character is mad annoying. He's like oh guys, I'm a little Thai anime boy, I can't do so much! And then he turns into like every emo kids fantasy of what they think they look like but in reality they look like. The show is based off this little manhwa, which apparently is a K pop manga, which I did not know existed until today. The manhwa actually looks pretty good, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm not reading all that. The animation overall looks kinda stiff to me. Kinda reminds me of those animes. In conclusion, the anime is just emo. Bland story, bad animation, and if you like it, I don't like you.",

We have A coming got killed which is an action in revenge anime that has a little bit of fantasy involved in it. And the main character kami is absolutely freaking goaded bro. But don't get attached to any of the characters. Goblin Slayer. The first episode will shock you, but if you're looking for a really good fantasy adventure anime then this is definitely one of the tops. About a guy that likes to kill a lot of goblins and there's some crazy stuff that happens. Definitely a little bit darker. Plastic Memories is a goaded romance anime, but it is a little bit of a tear jerker. So go into this prepared knowing that you will cry by the end of this. If you don't believe me, just watch it. Gravel Fireflies one of Studio Ghibli movies that is absolutely insane and it has a great storyline and honestly it's just overall a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. Freerun is adventure fantasy. They came out at the end of last year beginning of this year. If you're looking for something that's calm, slice of lifey, and it's literally side quests then this is a good one to watch. And it has action scenes that don't need to be as hard as they are. Jujutsu Kaisen. I'm pretty sure you've already seen ads for this everywhere bro, and everybody talks about it. Go sick Is one of the best mystery anime that you will ever watch in your life. It is a little bit older, the pacing is a little bit slow, but honestly it all you know comes together in a nice warm story. Grand Blue Dreaming is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my damn life. And RE0 is a really good psychological thriller anime if you can get over the fact that Subaru cries it over and over again. But honestly, the pain he goes through is absolutely wild. Make sure you guys follow the YouTube!"

If you know an Inuyasha fan, they will talk your ear off about this show if you even bring up the name. this was one of the most popular anime on earth for a couple of years and the fandoms all but disappeared. Though I will admit that another pretty good answer to this question is Sword Art Online. Let's be real. Like it or not, Sword Art Online has one of the biggest online followings out there. This is the isekai. They got a lot of people into isekai. Between not necessarily aging well and the middle seasons being okay ish, I find that as popular as this anime series is, it doesn't get talked about all that often. But genuinely, I feel like the only correct answer to this question is Gintama. I mean, Gintama was considered the fourth anime in the Big Three for like a decade. I mean, it had the incredibly unfortunate fate of running simultaneously with bleach one piece in Naruto, but still. One of the most popular comedies shown in anime of all time. And yet. Crickets."

Free Run is is like that bro. I know. Or mindless. Is ranked above F maybe. I honestly am not mad at it. Do I have it personally ranked above F maybe? No. F maybe is my No. 1 anime of all time, but it's up there for me. Bro. That's top 5 material anime for me. I gave it a 9.5 out of 10 at the end of the day.",

Did you just insult me? I'll be. Boo. Whatever. Um. It feels like you were reaching my womb. Okay. It felt like hopes I didn't tamper with Justin's unborn baby, Athena. Now the baby. So I was upset because I found out that my ex wife had been sleeping around while pregnant with our daughter, which is very risky. Big. That is the most diabolical shit I have ever heard in my life. I felt you in my womb. But they say after god fear women, or after the devil fear generational crash out. Me, her, the baby were all out of there. The guy. Oh, he gotta go first. Not. Not only. Okay, not only was she cheating on her husband, whoever she was cheating with was getting married. It's an evil fucking world. And it's not funny. It's just crazy, like. Cause all I could think is like, what if his joint wasn't that big? And he gotta sit there and read that and Cora look good. Whoever the hell Corey is. Can you imagine that? That's not the only guy she Was sleeping with bro five months pregnant. If you sleeping around five months pregnant, imagine what you doing with no baby in your belly. You throwing that shit? Felt you in my womb. Jesus Christ. Hope I didn't mess with Justin's unborn baby."

    "voice_to_text": "Never explicitly stated in the show, but if you pay attention, it's clear that these field trips are a massive secret, and the kids are actively helping hide it. But, Miss Frizzle, we can't let Mr. Junket know the bus is magic. He can't know what he can't see. But why? I could see why the producers are hiding the secret, but why are the kids in on it? Maybe it's just because they love the field trip so much, and they know that if the secret got out, they wouldn't be able to go on them anymore. But I think there might be something more going on here. In the very first episode of The Magic School Bus, Arnold brings his cousin Janet to visit his school, and she mentions that Arnold told her all about the field trips they go on. Arnold told me all about your family field trips, adorthean. What did he say? Look at their reactions to hearing this. They are terrified of someone else knowing the truth. Now, I've already shown you that clip of Arnold taking off his helmet and freezing in space, but I didn't show you why he did it. Throughout the entire episode, Janet is trying to collect proof to prove that she went to space. in order to convince Janet not to bring back incriminating evidence, Arnold does this. There's no way I'm going home without my stuff. It's proof. Nobody will believe me without it. Janet, you Want proof? I'll give you proof. Here's proof. A little happy. You. You stay here with your stuff. I don't know. Arnold is more afraid of Janet exposing their secrets than taking off his helmet in space. What could these kids possibly be so afraid of happening if the truth got out? Well, in Season 1, episode 11, we actually do get to see what da thinks would happen if her old teacher found out about their field trips. Um, Mister C flat, I'd like you to meet. Take chances, make mistakes. Get messy. Oh, we never did anything like this at our old school. Holy shit! It's Miss Frizzle! They're all afraid of Miss Frizzle. Miss Frizzle may seem like this quirky, fun, eccentric teacher, but she is constantly manipulating these kids into being afraid and totally obedient. In Episode 2, Arnold asked Miss Frizzle if he could skip the field trip. Miss Frizzle, I'd really love to go on a field trip, but. But I've got this weird feeling. Well, Arnold, I do need a volunteer to stay behind. She casually says he could stay behind, but then, without telling him, they shrink down.",

Now, going all in means you need a big studio, you need animation to be on point, you need voice acting, you need plot. All of these things could work if you took a live action and you made it an anime. But you have to commit. So what is this show? The supernatural series. I love this show. This is one of my favorite shows ever. Supernatural is a show about two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester. They go around fighting monsters. They eventually end up fighting Angels, Demons, stopping the apocalypse. It sounds very anime. Now, if we gave this to a studio and made them commit to making it, well, I think we could do this and it would be a hit. I know supernatural kind of had an anime done already, but there was no love in that. There was no love in that supernatural anime. Let's make it better. All right, let's commit. We're gonna get Jensen Ackles, we're gonna get Jared Padalecki to revoice themselves. Actually, you can bring the whole cast back to voice themselves. But we need to go all in on animation. We're gonna have to read adapt the story a little bit. Well, you have Angels, Demons, monsters. Two brothers fighting them all. There's a little bit of sexual chemistry, a dash of BL. And you have a hit anime on your hands, ladies and gentlemen. We gotta do this with love. Don't just be like, oh, this is kind of anime, let's halfheartedly make an anime of it. No, we gotta go all in. This could be a hit as an anime. But you tell me what you guys think.",

Then he said that the reason that he went back. What got him killed. Was that he needed to confirm some. You needed to confirm what? Even the information that he ended up sending back to the village was of no help. Why? Because shizune figured out when she did the autopsy on the main. Oh shit. The receivers again. Chakra from somewhere else. So that means somebody's controlling the pains. Jiraiya sent the body back. But when he got that body of pain that he was gonna send back. Send back to Tsunade for the all time. He was in the told. He could have left. Agato isn't there? Yeah. Cause none of them look like Nagato. Yeah.

    "voice_to_text": "I hate things that are black. Like, let's be real, most things look better when they're white. That's why almost anything you'll see in my possession is white. And there's a good reason for that. It's a way better looking color that you can literally match with anything, and honestly, you can never really go wrong with it. Now, I'll admit I do own some things that are black, because there is the rare occasion that something will look better in black, but that is very rare. For example, something like my bed frame. This just makes more sense to be in black. And I think it contrast my white bed sheets pretty well, because if literally everything was white, it would be pretty overwhelming. But that doesn't apply in this case, because as you can see, I decided to purchase some white item frames. I mean, picture frames. This isn't Minecraft. And along with some nice photos of a concrete wall, I'm hoping these will breathe a little bit more life in my. And for where I'm putting them, it's right here on this wall. Now, I know this is where I put these in my last apartment, but honestly, I really did like the way it looked. And fortunately for me, the layout of my new bedroom is very similar to my last, so I have no problem putting these right back where they belong.",

I talked a lot of shit last chapter, but I'm not gonna take it back because I still think Yuji's gonna prevail. Gay guys just trying to show Sakuna's full potential. I don't know. What the fuck is this domain? What is going on? What is this? So we find out that Yugi ate his brothers. Theory confirmed. Which means Yuji can convert CE into blood and his CE output is crazy. And we find out Yuji does have soul swapping. Theory confirmed. Remember how Yuji said that he cheated? Essentially, when he swaps souls with someone, he can only do it twice in a month. He basically has their experience imprinted on his body, if that makes sense. So he swapped with Kusakabe and now he knows simple domain and shit. So Yuji is not cooked because he used simple domain? What the fuck is this? Anyway, sakuna cannot maintain his domain for a long amount of time. So Sakuna's domain only last for 99 seconds. But all of my faves are trapped in there because of course they are. And Choso is concerned for his little brother because he's yelling after Yuji, just stay alive, please, Yuji! Simple domain breaks and he gets attacked! His fucking foot! It's fine because he has RCT, so I guarantee you his foot will be back. And just when I thought it was over. Oh, There's a break next week, but I don't think they're cooked. Because either sukuna is aiming that error at Yuji and then chose is gonna jump in front of him trying to save his little brother. Which I hope doesn't happen because I love Choso. Or whoever that second person Yuji swapped with in that month. That's gonna come in handy because they haven't revealed who else he swapped with.

There's a, like, situation. There's this one scene of Omni Man on invincible one where Cecil is talking to him, and he keeps trying to split. Cecil? Yeah. And Cecil keeps disappearing. Krillin's grabbing Cecil. Haha, really? Got you. You. You ain't faster than an old man pushing a button. I don't know, man. I'm going with Krillin, man. I'm going with Krillin.

I've seen this one before, but on a whim I decided to rewatch it like a couple days ago and I just finished it and I can truly say this is probably my favorite anime as of now. I've always been into slice of life animes, um, but this one doesn't take anything over the top. There's no super depressing sadness or death or anything like that. It's just a wholesome, um, 12 episodes of daikichi taking care of Rin and learning how to be a father and her accepting him as a part of her life. And that's just like, really good.

For real. For real. That I'm gonna make every other jutsu that does not pertain to my innate element. Like don't get me wrong, you got the water dragons. He got them. Water smell good. Like he got some regular water stuff. But what do we really know tobirama for? What did tobirama get easy know with. It wasn't with no water style. It was with the flying Ryjan, the flying Thunder god. What was he really known for? What was he pulling up to the battlefield with? It was them and otensei the resurrected forced to serve him over and over and over again to simply detonate themselves with what? That's hand on Paper Bomb Jutsu. After what? Getting jumped by multiple shadow clones? Toby Roma really said, fine, you can give me whatever garbage on that you want. I don't even need wood style. I'mma show you my style. And he did. He did. Almost every single jutsu that makes Naruto or Minato broken is born in tobirama. And don't get me wrong, both of them improve it drastically. Flying rising for me to so. And obviously multi shadow come for Naruto. But still, he's the basis. And I got to put respect on that. For real? For real.",

Comic Book just posted an article saying Studio PRTS is Boruto seasonal return. Oracle says that it's been a hot minute since the world saw Boruto Uzumaki take on a small screen. This was back in March 2023 when they put a cap on his first half. Now all the eyes are set on the future. But now we finally got some information that the team is eager to restart the series seasonally. This was revealed in an in depth interview with the president of Studio Period. Right here it says, I think it's great making one project for a long period of time, which period is done so far, but at the same time, large budgets is scheduling costs involve big risk. Essentially, what I'm picking up from this is that they use bleach to practice the seasonal approach, and they like the result. So now they're gonna use it on Boruto when other animes under studio period. Do y'all understand what this means for Boruto, Bro? We're finally gonna get the quality we deserve for the series. And it's gonna be for the best part of the series. Barto 2 Blue Vortex has been 100,000 times better than the original Barto. And now we finally getting what we deserve production wise. We're taking over, fellas, you've been here this whole time? I know you feel good, bro. I know you feel good. We stayed here when it was hard."

Let\u2019s start off strong\u2026 I'm actually graduating at the top of my class. I finished my time at college with a 4.0 GPA. I double majored and double minored and I'm also gonna be graduating with departmental honours which is not something that anyone else in my graduating class is graduating with. And now you might be thinking, \u201cEducation and English aren't particularly impressive majors\u201d but considering my background I think they are. I am the daughter of two immigrants; I'm a first generation college student and English isn't even my first language. My first language is actually Hungarian. I attended my institution on a full tuition merit scholarship and while I was there I was a very active member of our community as well. I was on the executive board for multiple clubs, I was in various leadership positions, and I also worked multiple jobs on campus which is how I was able to afford my collection. I did block out my name and the name of my institution cause I don't need y'all knowing that but here are just some of the awards that I've won in recognition for my involvement and my leadership. I finished my requirements a semester early after my study abroad in Hungary so right now I'm working full time at my karate school where I'm a first degree black belt but I do have a job lined up at my college after graduation as an admissions counselor which is very exciting because it's in my field."

    "voice_to_text": "the internet is debating right now whether new television shows should drop all of their episodes at once or do it weekly I've read all the comments it's like 50 50 and even I don't know what the right answer is here because there's a lot of things that need to be consider I just wanna say the reason why this is happening right now is really cool it's very rare that we get two very good shows happening at the same time with fallout and X men 97 fallout dropped all these episodes at once this past week in the Amazon Prime and X Men 97 is still going on Disney I wanna talk about why both release strategies can be positive first for dropping them all at once you don't have to pay for a streaming service longer than one month I think this allows for a property that is new to a lot of people to hook them better if you have all the episodes at one time rather than releasing it week to week because I feel like they could fall out of interest with it third not releasing it all at once can really hinder the flow of a show we saw this very recently with invincible season 2 now why weekly is good you get to talk about characters that you love with your friends for months and months what could be better than that seasons of television shows don't come out as often as they used to so when you expand one it narrows this gap just the little bit lastly if every single episode of a show is good then a week to week basis feels warranted I feel like people are missing one important thing when it comes to this debate Netflix\u00a0introduced\u00a0streaming\u00a0like\u00a0online\u00a0streaming\u00a0in\u00a0January\u00a0of\u00a02007 so that means that we have had the ability to binge now for 14 years there are adults in the world right now who have never had to wait week to week for a show so I wouldn't be surprised at all if they get a little bit frustrated that they don't get their content all at once even after all this information I still don't know what my decision will be I think it depends on the show but I don't know let me know in the comments what you think",

    "voice_to_text": "One generation has to go. Who are you cutting? The legendary Big Three, the old Big Three, the middle Big Three, or the new generation Big Three? We need to talk about something real quick. People throwing big Three around like nothing. There's no old generation big three. There's no new big three. There's no middle big three. There's no old big three. There is just one big three. And there's, like, one caveat. But it's not even like an impact of big three. It's just three shows that came out together. And we'll get into that in a second. But the Big Three consists of Naruto, bleach, and one piece. Three anime that dropped around the same time that blew up worldwide and drew western audiences to the genre of anime. That's why it's called the Big Three. These three cannot be touched when it comes to big three. You wanna talk about big three? You talking about these three? Dragon Ball is not in the big three. It never has and it never will be. Dragon Ball is the godfather of the big three. Dragon Ball is what made people think a western audience could love anime. They were right. We loved it. It was worldwide then. These three came at the same time and have dominated ever since. That's why they're the big three. And there's the Dark Trio. Now, these three aren't a big three. They're just not. They're called the Dark Trio because, again, three Anime that came out around the same time that have similar themes are called the Dark Trio because they dove into darker themes. They are darker themes shown in anime. You have demons, devils, darker things that you wouldn't see in a normal shonen, which is why they're called the Dark Trio. No one saying that the impact of the big three. It's just three shows, three manga that came out around the same time that have similar themes. That's it. So if you wanna talk about what the best big three is, it's this one, because it's the only big three.",

    "voice_to_text": "Kung Fu Panda Exact says that Hollywood is at a loss about anime successes. Hollywood should not be at a loss at why anime is so successful. It is a very simple answer. Because the only thing that anime creators care about is telling a good story, giving their characters proper growth, proper arcs, cool action, funny moments, things that their audience wants. They know their audience, and they give their audience what they want. So Hollywood should not be confused about this, because yet again, it's very, very simple. It's like business 1:01. Okay, when you're starting any kind of business, what is your job as a business? Just in general? Your job as a business is to please your consumer. So your consumer gives you money, which then makes the business, what, everyone? Profit. So I don't understand how this is so mind boggling to Hollywood. It's just that Hollywood is so caught up in their own little bubble that they, like, forgot, like, hey, us, we. We right here. You have to please us. We're the ones giving you money. You don't please us, you're not getting any money. They are pleasing us, so they are getting our money. There's a reason why anime and manga is beating out American animation and beating out American comic books by, like, a lot, mind you, not like, by a little margin, by a lot. Specifically in the comic book, like, you know, area. It is insane. Manga is destroying American comic books. And this is for a very simple reason. Because, again, manga, anime, all they care about is giving us fans what we want. And that is entertaining, fun stories with good characters, good arcs, great moments, heartbreaking moments, moments that make us cheer. Like they're just. They. All I care about is the story. You know what Iger was saying about Disney a little while ago? Like, we got to focus on storytelling, not messaging. That's all manga ever does is like, this is a cool story. Is it gonna be fun? Are they gonna like it? Okay, yes. Okay, then make it like that. Simple. So simple. This is not rocket science, people. There's no reason why Hollywood should be confused about anime success, or even manga. Because, again, the answer is simple. Just make it entertaining, good stories, all we want."

And the one a lot of people don't seem to recognize, this is Rusty Rose from fairytale. Now the weakest. Look, you can put it somewhere between the bottom two. Luffy is outright stronger, you know, physically, but his imagination or overall Tune Force abilities are basically low tier versus Rusty Rose. He's not as physically strong, but he has better imagination abilities cause he's able to manifest anything that know, he's able to think of. But the tear stuff that he was, you know, manifesting through his ability wasn't as strong as Grammys. And basically the stuff that he was able to manifest and effect did have somewhat of a limit. Like of course he was able to, you know, change his no hand to a like a giant cloth thing, manifest different swords, different abilities, raise a giant tower, make golden Shields, you know, stuff like that. He was able to do that, but the tear things he was able to do doesn't compare to the stuff Grimmie was able to do. So, you know, those two will be at the bottom and in Arthur 2nd, because his imagination does have the limit of basically revolving around himself. But nobody's been able to do the imagination things Grimmy has done. Grimmy. You know what this imagining a pocket of space, you Know, making meteors drop in, turning people physically into cookies. Like grandma was able to imagine whatever you wanted. So from weakest, strongest is one of the bottom two, then the other one of the bottom two. Arthur 2nd. Grimmy first. Simple.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think I finally figured out why anime TikTok feels so much different than it did a year two years ago and by different I mean significantly worse significantly more boring significantly less fun significantly less Taco Bell \ud83d\udd14  I figured this out while I was going through my following list for reasons and I kept coming across names that was like oh I remember that person I what am I just not getting their content on my for you page so I just click on their profile I go to the most recent videos and the most recent videos are posted a year two years ago then that happened once then it happened again and again and again and I was like wow there's a lot of people whose content I thought or still think was some of the best anime content on this platform and they've stopped posting then I thought about all the people who used to make anime content but now has switched their content up to comics or video games or sports might have an anime take here or there but their content isn't really anime focused anymore I think about it I'm like wow these are like a good chunk of the people I used to watch on a daily basis a year two years ago they've all stopped and then I think back and I go okay like two years ago I used to find a new anime content creator that I absolutely loved at least once a month back in those times I think about it now like I I haven't really found a creator that I didn't know about that I really really liked in like the last six months so it's like anime Tik Toks losing really good creators in my opinion and there's no new blood there's no new influx of creators whose content I really really like I think this is caused anime content anime TikTok to feel kind of bad for me on a personal level and I know there's been a lot of other people who've expressed feelings similarly and you know what I found might be the reason those people are not enjoying anime TikTok as much I don't think what I said in this video is the only reason there there are plenty of reasons and I can get into some other time but this is a new reason that I think really contributes to my personal experience with anime"

Luffy Dog walks every single verse. If you give Luffy every awakening the string string fruit, he turns Naruto into a puppet and then kills Ichigo with Naruto. If you give Luffy all devil fruit on top of his own power, imagination, plus tune force and immortality that none of these three characters have, it's not a discussion. Luffy Legit Dog walks every single verse. On top of the fact he has emus ability and the abilities of ancient weapons that gives Luffy existence erasure on top of everything else. This is not a versus debate. These are three fandoms living in denial that they get Fucking Dog walked. Andy I love you bro, but Bro, let's be honest. What is this father doing to Luffy? What is Ichigo gonna do without his swords? Canon or not, but Goku needed to go Super Saiyan just to fight base Luffy.

I am called Funny Toss. The vampire of the Blue Moon left to me his name as well as his famed grimoire, yet I am but a human. What day? His name is just as confusing as no ways. So this guy's Bonnie Toss? Except, psych. No, he's not. He's about to team up with a man named after Noah from the Bible. Except, psych. No, he's not. Wonderful. You'll start immediately. No, I'm sorry. All I heard from you was a resounding yes! Oh, psych. No, they're not. Noah and Bonnie Toss feel like every Bungo Stray Dogs character split into two people. And I can pinpoint which character is one into which. Vani Toss is Dazai mixed with Rompo. And no way is Atsushi mixed with Kunikita. How this Vani Toss would meet his end? By my own hand, of course. That's how this episode ends. This like how 90% of all Wattpad stories and their first chapter. His baby blue eyes were so piercing, so enthralling. And soon they would be completely lifeless.

So for those of you don't know, Sierra Leone is on the west coast of Africa, and they are currently facing an epidemic where there's a drug called Kush that being used all over and manufactured partly by using human bone. This is causing people to come rob graves and steal the bones of buried people. Apparently the drug is pretty cheap to manufacture, just requires one specific ingredient that requires people to steal bones from old cemeteries, in which case the government has actually had to beef up security at cemeteries to stop this problem. And this drug creates sort of a hypnotic high, as ones would describe. They said this drugs first started being produced around six years ago in their country. And the epidemic of users and the increase in grave robberies has skyrocketed since. The doctors are also seeing an increase of around 4,000% of deaths due to organ failures, which is a direct result of this drug use."

On top of the director being Eli Roth, who, like I said, was a very outspoken Zionist and who condemned a man for saying that genocide is bad at the Oscars. The film also stars Jamie Lee Curtis, who herself is as well as shameless Zionist. And it's just not something that I'm interested in giving any life to or giving my money to or supporting in any way. Now, obviously, I'm not gonna tell you what to do. If you wanna watch the movie, go right ahead, I don't care. But I'm just trying to give you the relevant information here as it pertains to the ongoing genocide that we are currently in, as it relates to the media that we consume. And if you wanna show saw small support, like just the minuscule, the bare minimumist of support, and at the very least, not supporting the people that are actively supporting this genocide, then you have a choice to do that by not watching this film."

Especially when it's comparing goat to goat, and especially when it's a super long running series. So in the Naruto versus one piece debate, people always bring up the fact that one piece has more sales, but it has more sales because it has more volumes. You have to look at sales per volume, right? If I have one book with 1,000 sales, and you have 1,000 books with one sale, you can't say that we're both equally successful. That's the same logic here. So just taking sales in a vacuum and saying that one piece has surpassed Dragon Ball or one piece that surpassed Naruto because it has more sales and just looking that in a vacuum is completely and utterly disingenuous. And even when you look at digital sales because it's 2024. Digital sales are a thing. Boruto is absolutely carrying tuition digital sales. And even further substantiate how little manga sales means when you're looking at it in a vacuum with a zero context. Demon Slayer has more sales per volume than Dragon Ball, Naruto, and one piece. But it would be absolutely asinine to suggest that Demon Slayer is more successful than all these other series. So stop using manga cells as an argument is a dumb argument."

You can hear everybody, like, mumbling their personal dies. And you can hear some. Some people are making god for Palestine. Some people are making god get married. Some people are making god for good grades. I'm personally there to get a good performance review so I can go to Jenna. But tell me why the guy next to me is bawling his eyes out. He's crying, his heart is on the floor. And I'm wondering, what could he be asking for? Should I be. I should be making this style, like the.

Sakuna would get embarrassed and it wouldn't even be close. I don't think people understand how factual this is, all right? Like Mordecai and Rigby would win this fight. So fucking simple. Like, no. Let me show you. Let me show you how easy this would be. Back in the hey and era, my dinner used to come on plates, not on their feet. 5, 6, 7, 8. You don't fucking exist! And let's just assume that the keyboard doesn't work out. How is sakuna gonna deal with the baby ducks? No no no. Y'all think I was joking here, all right? These motherfuckers are actually universal level. You can literally microwave a clock and then throw said microwave at sakuna. Right, so sakuna is gonna get passed through the time stream, and the moment that he lets hold that microwave at all during that, he's just gonna get disintegrate, make the death corn dough sandwich and shove it in sakuna stomach mouth. In order to surpass sakuna and regular Show, all you need is shorts and a fucking movie. And god forbid Benson says beat Sakuna or you're fired, right? It's raps for him if that happens. But cameraman. How is Mordecai and Rigby gonna be Fuga bro? They can eat breath mints and freeze everything around them The fire would probably freeze. Probably. It's not a competition. There's not a thing that you can say to convince me that this was a debate in the first place. Okay, so, like, sakuna absolutely gets folded.

Like why does no one else seem to like, take an issue with these motherfuckers obsession with little girls? Like the whole concept of Lolly in general just makes my skin Itchy Man. Like is no one else find that shit weird as hell? And before you weird ass lolly loving kid touches coming to the comments talking about some well if they're actually 3,000 years old, then they're actually not children. Motherfucker, you need to be investigated. And all the dumbass technicalities that these motherfuckers use to try and skirt around a clearly obvious little girl's age by just like, magically making that bitch like 32,000 years old is genuinely wild as shit. Like these fucking EDP 4 4 5 will literally show a six year old child get given ferocious fucking back shots going 137 miles per hour. But it's magically okay because turns out that little girl is actually 127,000 years old. Yeah my ass. More like 127,000 fucking terabytes. Like what are you talking about? And then these fucking kid dealers will also try to make the case that it's okay because it's just pictures and drawings. Oh yeah motherfucker, welcome to the James Charles under 18 Club. You're a VIP member. And what's even worse is that that's just not even true anymore because these motherfuckers in Japan Are starting to make lolly in real life. Like these fucking weirdos who made this Japanese AV video where they hired an 18 year old actress to play as a 12 year old school girl when she gets fucked by her teacher. The fuck? Why? And what makes this shit even worse is that you can buy this shit in like literally almost every store in Japan. Like there are 18+ sections in like certain gas stations. No, fucking insane that is. You could be going in, just wanted to get a yogurt, and you'll look to the side and there will be about three gross motherfuckers just in that section just ferociously beating their meat while looking at little children. Also, I do these motherfuckers have zero shame at all too. Imagine the embarrassment you feel when you have to open that curtain up and walk out the 18+ section holding a lolly hand tight in your fucking hand. And you have to walk over to the cashier and hand that shit to him with cash in hand. Are you serious? Well, I don't know about you, but if I'm that cashier, I'm fucking fighting you. Like, I don't wanna start any beef, but like, you're telling me that's not a reason? Like, maybe we should send nuke number three? Fuck it. Oh, but hey, at least Japan has good technology.",

    "voice_to_text": "Sad anime facts to think about part 3 1. Toji's eyes went back to normal after hearing that Megumi has no ties to the Zenon clan. Magumi was the last thing he saw before he took his life. Two. Solo leveling artist passed away before the anime release. The anime is still ongoing with only five episodes. The fact that Jang Sung Ra couldn't see his work animated is sad. Three. Light failed to create a world without evil. Light ended up becoming the very criminal he hated, unable to achieve his dream of a world without villains. 4. Solo leveling added this scene as a tribute to Akira Toriyama's death. It wasn't shown in the manhwa, and the animators added it as a Goku reference to honor the late, great Dragon Ball creator. 5. Thorfin's mom didn't see thorfin for 16 years. Helga wasn't mad, but super proud. She knew he'd seek revenge for his dad, but deep down she just wanted him to find some peace. You don't have enemies."

    "voice_to_text": "Who is the better brother? Is it ace or is it Itachi? This one's easy for me. I think it's Itachi. That is insane. But I disagree. I don't think it's Itachi. I think it's ace. Why would you argue it's ace? I think people are blinded by the fact that Itachi is such a great character that they don't see motherfucker killed his whole clan and his parents for his brother. No, it wasn't for his brother. He kept his brother alive for his brother. He killed the clan for the Lee Village. Could I would argue Luffy is a better brother than Ace? Valley! Valley! Valley! Valley! I think Itachi has done a lot of things too. Take Sasuke. He's done a lot of things to keep Sasuke out of harm's way, but he's also done a lot of things to mentally torture Sasuke. So I think whatever ace does outweighs the good that Itachi did because he's done so much more bad. Ace hasn't done nearly as many bad to Luffy as Itachi has done to Sasuke. I don't think ace has done anything bad, whereas Itachi has mentally fucked Sasuke up to the point where he wanted to destroy the Leaf Village even after he found out the truth. He killed both his parents. He killed the rest of his clan. He made him an orphan. It shows in Boruto. Now there is no one left for him to connect with in terms of his bloodline. You know, realistically, Sasuke, his personality wouldn't be like that. So cold hearted all the time if it wasn't for Itachi. If Itachi didn't do the things that he did, I would be saying Itachi clear. No, no. But this motherfucker has been more bad than good for Sasuke. He put Sasuke in a genjutsu for I think 72 hours of him just reliving his parents dying. What the fuck? To strengthen them. To make them stronger. Ace. I don't see none of that. Ace died to strengthen Luffy. Fuck it! Yeah, you wanna talk about that? Ace died to strengthen Luffy.",

He's like, oh, I thought we were friends and blah, blah, blah. Bro, you are a brand. Risk high and speed are living one in 100 million lives. Everybody around them is set for life. Look at what Kai did for Ray. Their families and the people who work for them are set. You think that they would jeopardize that running around with you? Exactly what I'm telling you. What happened with Kai happened with Charles Barkley at the same event. There's a women's division in that slap boxing event, and Charles Barkley said that he wasn't a fan of it because he didn't want to see women slapping each other. Sneaky oh goes on to say, women belong in the kitchen. And Charles Barkley's heart drops, and he's like, oh, I don't wanna get fired if you don't know this dude. Charles Barkley has hella sponsorships. His show on TNT is going crazy. Sneaky oh put that all in jeopardy to try to just be edgy and funny. People think that Kai and speed are goofy and stupid. They already knew the situation that they would get placed in being around Him and they just moved tact. Sneaky old blackballed himself and he's mad that people don't wanna be blackballed as well. You already drew the line. Stay on that side, buddy."

    "voice_to_text": "Drake has officially responded to Kendrick Lamar's diss. That's right. Just in case you guys haven't seen it, Drake has just posted to his Instagram with this photo in the caption I'm picking up I'm in Turks little baby. This is obviously a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss and just everybody in the industry going against Drake right now and he's just telling us that he's not gonna respond. He's busy. We also need to remember that Drake is on tour currently with Lil Wayne, so I don't think we're gonna see a diss track coming from Drake anytime soon. Now what's funny about all this is that the post that Drake just made, he actually quoted NAV lyric, but NAV just unfollowed Drake on Instagram. And it makes a lot of sense because NAV and Metro Boomin go a long way back and they've made a lot of music together. So this is just another person that's turning their back on Drake and they're joining Team Metro. If you guys think that was worse. Metro Boomin also recruited Playboi Carti on his team. And now Carti's going up against Drake because Metro Woman posted this photo with him, future, and Carti and in the caption it says going against us and you gonna lose. Low key I feel really bad for Drake because the fact that Metro Boomin is not recruiting Playboi Carti, he's recruiting NAV, he's recruiting future. All these people, this huge alliance against Drake, it's just Not fair. The rap media outlets are also anti Drake right now cause as you can see, one of the biggest rap podcasts in the world, Joe Biden, said that Drake shouldn't even reply to the Kendrick Lamar dis and he said he could sit this out. This ain't even for him. Honestly, if I'm in Drake's position, I wouldn't even respond at this point because there's too many people that are against him. Because also, if you guys missed it, Rick Ross also turned his back on Drake after being exposed that he talks bad about Drake. He's been racist towards Drake, talked bad about his family. And this is another reason why he was actually on the Metro album and it just keeps going on and on and on. Because Travis Scott actually a few days ago before this album even came out, he wanted future and Metro Woman to play this diss track that Kendrick made at Rolling Loud. So Travis is also anti Drake. This rap Civil War is actually insane. So let me know whose team are you guys are and you guys on Team Future, Team Drake? Who do you guys think is gonna get recruited? Next to both teams, who do you guys think is gonna come out on top? I love Drake, I love Metro, Boomin, I love future, I love all these guys, but from the looks of it, team Metro's winning right now. I don't know what Drake's gonna do. But any other information that's gonna come out on this beef, I'm gonna let you guys know. So make sure you guys stay followed.",

And a lot of the time like 5% of those volumes have been read. Manga collecting is not a competition. You're not trying to have a better collection than the next guy.

Reason everyone watches the show is because of these four right here. Next is gotta be Peyton from one Tree Hill. Listen, I am a one Tree Hill stand. I am a 90s kid. But Peyton, I'm Team Brooke all the way. We get it, you're the emo girl. You hate everything about the world cause your mom tragically passed away. But that makes no excuse that she is easily the worst friend of all time. She's constantly me, me, me. Doesn't give a shit about any of her friends. Team Brooke all the way. And last, but certainly not least is Ted Mosby from how I met your mother. This man, throughout the entire of the show, claims that he just wants to find true love. But at every turn during the show, just constantly makes excuses and whines about every last thing. So by the time you get to the end of the show, you don't give a fuck how we found love. Let's be Real. We all watch the show for Marshall and Barney. That's it.",

Chimera ants battles and all that stuff. That whole arc was was incredible. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Ichigo versus Aizen no Okora. Ichigo versus Okora the best anime fight scene of all time. I like Ring Goku's fight, and then I like the one with the guy that's always like be flashy! What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Meliodas and fun. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? The moment when Teen Gohan goes Super Saiyan 2 and does the command mayor to kill cell. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? This isn't the correct answer, but Rock Lee dropping his weights and just busting up Gaara and still losing go so hard. What is the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Knives and Vash from Dragon. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Honestly the end of attack on Titans was insane for me. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? I'm gonna have to say gear 5 Kaido versus Luffy. What's the all time greatest anime fight scene? Ichigo and Aizen when he just grabs Aizen by the face like mid mid set.

Two on one sure is rough. Hmm. Must be a good knife if it can scratch my skin. The mid air of Ben's knife, by the looks of it. Hmm. The shape must mean it's poisoned. You all right? Not a problem. Not a problem. Point one. Milligrams of that stuff is more than enough to paralyze a whale. So you can steal other people's men. Then you're a specialist. You might even be a threat if you could use those stolen powers freely. However, that implies a higher activation cost. You couldn't have gotten the ability otherwise. If I had to make a guess, you must clear four or five conditions before stealing an ability. He's right. The old man's a tough customer. Trying to meet those conditions while fighting both of us will be difficult indeed. Meaning that you won't be able to steal our abilities as long as we keep you engaged in battle. That poisoned knife of yours is proof. Right again. Guess I have no choice. Watch my back, silver. As soon as I have him pinned down, even if you have to kill me, end him. Got it. He focused his aura into his hand. The energy potential will be huge. I don't have the defenses to block it. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! A conjured cloak, eh? This could be trouble. Even if it's a stolen ability, it would be reckless to attack without knowing what it does. Or so the average person would think. But yeah. Yeah, ha ha, yeah, I see what he's doing. He can trap the abilities of others in the conjured book, take them out, and use them anytime he pleases. But there's a catch. He can't use those abilities unless he holds the book open the entire time. The cloak is also a conjured item. It doesn't look like he's planning to attack, but it's obvious that he's attempting to close the distance between us. So it must be a defensive tool that can be utilized to draw closer to an enemy and counter attack. We can lower the risk if we keep our distance. We'll wait for our chance, then strike. This old man is really something. He managed to read my mind in an instant. Doubt I capture him alive, so the ability disappears whenever he closes the book. In any case, he's impressive. He's dodging dad's attacks by a hair, all while keeping an eye on me. His attacks have improved since last time, so we don't have any clue what he's capable of. If we want to stop him, we may just have to pay with our lives. Silver! Do it now! Haha! Woo!",

And of course we got losers tweeting stuff like this. Like I love Meg but I low key feel like she really don't be know who these people are. I'm not gonna post follow up tweets cause he went on to say yeah, I just honestly don't think if you quizzed her she wouldn't know anime like that. For real. Aside from these being well known anime characters, why do people feel the need to quiz women, black women at that, about their interest? You know? She was just a casual anime fan with these being some of her favorite characters. And again, her love for anime is well documented. Why does she have to be quizzed on power scaling systems or which fictional characters would be other fictional characters or whatever else you feel like you need to quiz her on to validate her love for something?

No easier way to say the tears running down your face at the end of the film. I think you have no soul and you might be just an alien of some sorts. Like, I can understand things like angel beats, things like your name, things like a silent voice. You can kinda argue. OK, don't have to cry a silent voice. German. But we're great with the fireflies. I think you have to cry. I think it's illegal not to. That shit is the saddest shit ever. Like, it's literally probably the saddest thing I've ever watched and will ever watch in my life. It's raw, it's authentic and it's just.

You have to have the reading comprehension of a toddler if you don't understand that scenes cannot breathe in space. It's something as well documented throughout the entire Dragon Ball franchise. And I know that people are gonna say that one manga panel saying that scenes cannot breathe in space isn't enough to prove that scenes cannot breathe in space, especially since a cure to Yama is known for forgetting literally entire characters. But saying is not being able to breathe in the vacuum of space was established in the name of arc. Frieza literally told Goku that he'll suffocate in the vacuum of space. So with this additional panel, we can establish two things. The first thing that we can establish is a consistency in the statement that saints cannot breathe in space. The second thing that we can establish is that saints need oxygen in order to survive. With that being said, we could prove that Goku is not planetary. Goku cannot destroy a planet because if he did, he would die.",

    "voice_to_text": "To a child who isn't loved properly, the answer one might expect is that they start to hate the person who doesn't give them the love they need. But far from it, the reality is that the child becomes filled with shame, a sense that it's profoundly unworthy, dirty, soiled, sinful, ugly, embarrassing. The child is unable to redirect the blame outwards. It doesn't ask what's wrong with my parents for not loving me adequately? It simply wonders in a fullon way what have I done wrong in order to have ended up on the receiving end of my parents disapproval? The child prefers to attack itself for being bad than to confront a yet more awful possibility that it's entirely dependent for its well being on inadequate and unkind parental figures. The child searches for explanations for the lack of love it has to endure and comes up with all the wrong answers. It concludes I've not been impressive enough, and therefore it undertakes enormous efforts to prove to itself and outsiders that it does nevertheless deserve to exist. At school, this kind of child might try seven times as hard as any other to show that it's clever and good. Or else a child may go down an anti social route and graffiti the nearby underpass as a desperate way of giving out would form to a feeling of badness it's tortured by inside. There is so sadly no way out from the burden of shame available either By trying to be extremely good or extremely bad, the only solution is to work against the grain of forgetting, in order to perceive for the first time an awful possibility that one could never perceive as a child, that one has done nothing wrong at all, that wrong was done to one",

I don't get it. I don't know why he is such a popular character. He's got the hair, but shorts. I just. I'm not feeling him as a character at all. Mine is the typical one from Naruto. Sakura.

Anything but. I just. The hold for, like, how many hundreds of episodes of Naruto if you can't get to me, like, being okay, I kind of like her.

Can't save 300,000 episodes of mediocre medical jutsu. Came in handy. We did. She played a part. But, you know, it's kind of like sooner day is hokage. Everybody's like, yeah, it's. She's.

This was a time when manga collecting was really difficult. Big manga like one piece, Naruto, bleach, etc. Were really, really hard to find. And I was really, really close to finishing my one piece collection. So one of the days I was there, I walked into a small comic shop in a random spot in Barcelona and found two volumes of one piece that I was missing at the time. Those volumes being 13 and 23. These, if you don't know, and if you didn't collect back then, were impossible to find. I literally could not find them anywhere in the US at all. Me and the store owner even had a conversation about it when I was buying the volumes, and I was telling him about how hard it is to find manga in the US at the time, and he was really surprised, because in Spain have so much manga. They're constantly printing manga, they're constantly releasing new manga. So for him it was like, really? You really had to find them here? But hey, I was happy to have them. And I think I finished my collection like three months later, which was amazing.",

    "voice_to_text": "Naruto community as a whole, can we like, collectively do each other a favor and stop giving Naruto credit for things it didn't do as well? Naruto is one of the best any manga series ever made. Can we please stop acting like Naruto inspired literally everything that came after it? Because it didn't. Before I even get into the fact that this guy just blatantly lied, I'm gonna point something else out. One who unironically says that Asta is a wannabe. Naruto not only knows nothing about Asta, but they know nothing about Naruto. Every single time I've seen someone try to say that Asta's a Naruto clone, they are always reaching. Oh, and back to the fact that this guy was lying. Yeah, I saw your other comments said the creator of Black Clover said Naruto heavily inspired it. Yeah, no he didn't. Two actual confirmed inspirations for Black Clover are bleach and Yuyu Hakusho. And anyone who has seen either one of those two and Black Clover can tell you that it's inspired by it. What's even funnier is that anytime somebody brings up that Black Clover copies Naruto, the reasons are always bad. The main ones that people try to bring up is that oh, well, you know, Asta has an inner demon and Naruto has Kurama. And Asta wants to be the wizard king and Naruto wanted to be the hokage. As if Naruto started either one of those tropes to be that guy. But Like, Naruto did not start wanting to be number one at something, nor did he start the inner demon trope. Y'all can't give Naruto credit for everything. We're gonna ignore the fact that Goku wants to be the strongest? Or ignore that Luffy wants to be the Pirate King now? Naruto wanting to be the hokage was the first thing to ever happen, right? So funny that people try to draw comparisons between Asta and Liebe and Naruto and Kurama. Because again, Naruto was not an inspiration for Black Clover. Bleach was. So why people are comparing Naruto and Kurama when Ichigo and zangitsu were actually the inspiration is beyond me. Don't even get me started on the people who try to say that you know and know well. Or like Sasuke and Sakura. Stop. People can sit there and call me a Naruto hater, but I'm like the people that are whining about that. I was the one who was actually watching it all. It was airing on tsunami, so I don't really care how they feel about it. Moral of the story if you think that Asta or Black Clover copied Naruto, you're wrong. Believe it.",

    "voice_to_text": "so this person responded to my video again saying that this is not the first light speed feat in one piece because Luffy was dodging Foxy's photon attacks and Zorro was dodging Kuma I don't agree for a couple of reasons when explaining Kuma's ability and how it was able to harm Frankie the manga says a normal cannon shouldn't be able to have any effect on Frankie this is called the pad cannon air is repelled at light speed creating a shock wave that penetrates through anything the attack is created by repelling air at light speed it doesn't mean that the air pad itself travels at light speed so the Assumption of the air pad itself is moving at light speed even though there is no indication that is the case is entirely a headcanon and it double makes no sense when you look at characters who actually have light based attacks like an L all of a sudden these quote unquote light speed character are not able to replicate such speed feeds secondly you can dodge the trajectory of an attack without out running the attack for example if somebody points a gun at me and fires I can dodge the bullet without moving faster than the bullet because I can dodge the trajectory or the angle of the bullet which is exactly what was happening here that is assuming that this attack actually moves at light speed in a literal sense and this is even further substantiated in the data book that is explaining Kizari's power and says explicitly that Kizaru can spam light speed attacks and then goes on to say it is impossible to grasp even a single of his movement without being a proficient user of hockey pretty sure Zoro at Thriller Bark was not a proficient user of hockey I mean Zoro still is not a proficient user of hockey this however is undeniably a light speed feat unlike the other ones you mentioned because here Sanji is out of the frame Kizara points his light speed attack that is stated to be a light speed attack closes his eyes and fires it and Sanji from outside the frame enters the frame intercepts the attack directly from the exact trajectory it was fired and deflected this is a light speed feat not this and Naruto in the land of waves is also light speed because of Haku transfers from mirror to mirror he caught Haku mid transfer and pulled him down so Naruto and anybody who scales to this version of Naruto is also light speed so for the characters to be light speed here and light speed here but not light speed here and contradict this either means you're wrong or Oda doesn't know how to scale his own series",

The show premiered on adults on February 10th. I didn't even know. I didn't see any trailers, I didn't see no promotions, I didn't see anything on social media. I literally just saw this on my HBO Max last night and I was like, I saw the cover just like this, like, let me give it a chance. No expectations or whatever. I just went into it. The first two minutes literally grabbed me and hook me. I was sold immediately. I was sold to me. The first scene is like one of them like, you know how you like listen to music in the beat, hit and you got it. You hit them and you replay the song back at. That's what I did. It was. It was amazing. I won't even spoil it for you, but I would tell you. Adult Swim gave us one of them ones. Yo, adult swimming gave us one of them ones. It's so good. It's got a 9.2 on IMDB, 473 reviews. The show only came out like 3, 4 days ago, man. I'm telling y'all, I'm telling if you looking for a show to watch, you looking for a good anime to watch, there you go. I won't even spoil it for you cause I want you to have the same level Of excitement that I had when I watch this. I want. This comes out February 17th. I will be there February 17th on Adult Swim, and I will rewatch it again the next day on HBO Max, because it comes out on the next day on HBO Max. Like I said, great story, great animation. The boxing. The boxing. The box is great. Oh, my god. I'm one of the ones where I needed a show to hit right away. First episode. I don't like long, drawn out animations, long drawn out stories. I get bored really easily. I'll watch a couple episodes and then go to something else. Only three shows has, like, hook me from the pilot. Rising of the Shield Hero and demon slayer, and now this. That says a lot. I don't know if you're like that and you like that, you know the story to develop, but I need the story to punch me in the face immediately. If you got HBO Max, you got Adult Swim, you got cable hoop. I'm telling you, you're not gonna be sorry. Thank you, tsunami. Excuse me. Thank you, Adult Swim. You didn't gave us one of the ones"

On the spectrum of getting giant. That one girl's hot. Terry especially hard today because he's the reason my wife and I are broken eyes. And she's up and I'm broken. You have a good heart. Why is there a cat under the table? Finally, a pussy that wants to be around me and our pet cat. What are you wearing? You look like Little Red Riding Hood. Let's talk about some fondues and fond. Don't rat dick. Can't bit my ankle. Cat dick. Fucking cord sucks worse than the Kardashians and NBA All Star weekend because the girl from J Date ghosted me a Red Lobster using her gift. This heart shaped box reminds me that I want Terry to Kurt Cobain himself. That guy painted. Oh, he painted one wall. Oh, fuck! I meant to remove the one that had caramel. Oh, god, we're about to make a bigger chocolate mess than when that stripper's water broke on my lap at Club Escalate. Yes, I know what today is. No, not Valentine's Day. It's Black History Month, you fucking race! Stop shouting the N word! Okay, hate you too, hasty cock. Sounds like one of my preferences on porn. Oh, these look like precious as. Oh, tastes like it, too. You'd agree if you were casting the Golden Bachelor. If I were to see old people fuck, I just start looking in the windows of the nursing home again. Last time I saw something this dark and full of liquor, Patrick Mahomes's dad was at a DUI checkpoint. No, love's not real, right? Fuck you. Oh, this looks like fondue. Dude, I'm getting two girls, one cup PTSD. That Tyler Perry movie. That's actually better. To help me enjoy the fondue today, I have this giant fruit and an apple. You get that outfit? You look like Marvin Gaye. His dad and me might have something in common. Taking the fruit now to see if it's bussing or not. Hmm. Dad, how are we gonna clean this up? The neighbor's dog. We get it. Cupid's heart bone or Valentine's dicks."

    "voice_to_text": "let's talk about this because the brand of sacrifice tattoo has to be the most common tattoo I see at the gym nowadays and I'm beginning to think that people don't really know what the brand of sacrifice tattoo is I think that people have seen so many influencers with it so they think it's like a gym bro thing maybe or maybe they saw a really cool muscular anime character with it and just thought that it was just like a Baki thing maybe um it's not it's from berserk and it's not really a good thing let's just say the brand of sacrifice is not something that guts is happy to have I'll put it like that so if you're thinking about getting the brand of sacrifice tattoo please just wait at the bare minimum please at least watch the 1997 edition of berserk it's literally only 25 episodes so you can at least know the origin of the brand of sacrifice and then after that then if you wanna get it at least you're making an informed decision and if you've already watched or read berserk and you wanna get the brand of sacrifice or you have the brand of sacrifice and it actually means something to you as an individual I'm not gonna knock it I'm not gonna bash it at least you made an informed decision but please don't get the tattoo because you see other people getting the tattoo and then later on you find out what it means but it's too late and I'm not trying to sound like a 70 year old grandma but tattoos are permanent please know what you're getting before you actually get it at least know what it means",

Lasel disapproves. Other unimportant people approve of disapprove. You get it? And after a few hours, Laiselle might be the meanest bitch alive. I'm a straight white man. I am no stranger to a villain. Run! But Shawty is just cruel. She told me that I looked goofy because I didn't actively participate in child murder. I'm pretty sure that her, like, perfect. Her dream partner is like a Terminator robot that has some extra paddles at knee height to slap candy out of the hands of children. It's fucked up.

    "voice_to_text": "If you collect vintage makeup, the Volupte Golden Gesture Compact is one of the most coveted compacts to collect. Hand shape compact launched in the 19 forties, and it's rumored to have around 12 different versions. Now, I know a lot of you out there are starting to collect vintage makeup, which I absolutely love. So if you're looking for this compact, I have about 7 of them. I'm trying to complete the collection. But let's start with this one. Is the engagement ring. All you have is the ring, no bracelet. And what you want to look for is absolutely no dings. You want the mirror intact, although it does sometimes get this sort of corrosion that happens to a lot of vintage compacts. And then inside, you want to have the puff. And most importantly, with any compact, if you can find it in its original sheath and its original box, this also came completely clean with no ring, no bracelet, and no nail polish. And this one has the nail polish, but you can actually see it's a little bit tainted. So this is not mint condition. But I just find it really difficult to find these, so sometimes I'll grab them even if they're not perfect. The card playing hand is extremely rare. But speaking of not perfect, I've never been able to find it in mint condition all of these years. So you can see it up close. It is a little bit scuffed, but I had to have it. This one's very special because it's actually on the cover of the holy grail of compact collectors. This is Roslin gerson's Ladies compact's book. Definitely need this. All collectors. In 1948, they launched the gay 90s Mitt. Now, this refers to the Victorian era, the 18 90s, when women would wear the fingerless gloves. This one's a little easier to find. It's the white mitt. There's no ring. And of course, this gorgeous bracelet. And I have one that's even more rare. Now, this one comes with the glove and the ring and the bracelet, and I do have the box for it. This back then would have sold for $7 and \u00a250. And recently, one on eBay went for over 2000 dollars. Now, this one might be the rarest of all. This is the Zodiac compact. And this one came out closer to the 19 50s. A lot of Zodiac compacts were becoming a thing. And this one is intensely rare. It's in perfect mint condition. I have the box, I have the sheath. And this one also would go for over 2000 dollars. If you find these and you don't want them, let me know. Or get them for yourself if you can get them at a good price. Because as you can see, worth it.",
