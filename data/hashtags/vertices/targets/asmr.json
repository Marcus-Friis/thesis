If you say you like your steak this way. No, you don't. You're lying. You're just looking for attention. This is absolutely vile. Fifth place, we have well done. There's no reason you should ever order a steak like this. You might as well just eat a hockey puck instead. It'll be the exact same flavor and texture. Fourth place, we have medium. this is completely unacceptable unless you're under the age of six. Just grow up and have a little bit of blood in your steak. Third place, we have rare. I could see this being acceptable if you go to like, a really fancy, really high end steak place, but for the most part, this is not gonna be the best way to get it done. Second place, we have medium. This is acceptable if you're at like a Waffle House, an IHOP, or some shitty diner, but let's be honest, you really shouldn't be ordering steaks at those places anyway. And of course, at number one, in my opinion, the only way to get your steak cooked is medium rare.",

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

The JaQ Lee controversy shows that we have a lot to learn about the potential impact adult/child relationships can have, how abuse happens, and our responsibility to create a safer world.  In my work with young people, I try to behave in ways I would be comfortable with ALL adults behaving with kids. There are actions I don\u2019t take not because they are inherently evil, but because it is my responsibility to build relationships that set emotionally and developmentally appropriate expectations for kids. Transference is natural, but this teacher\u2019s behaviors consistently invite a transfer of parental or romantic emotions from students to him.  So should a teacher allow students to take down their braids in class? No. And that goes for any gender of teacher or student.",

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

You just scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll and then you're like man or the bear? Hahaha that's so funny. Let's. Let's characterize all men as savage bears or worse than that. That is disgusting to reduce an entire gender into savage animals and it's just not right cause there's a lot of men that are have heart ones. They were heart centered. We love women, but you wanna reduce us because you're not willing to do the inner work to admit like hey, maybe I am puking my trauma when other people. What about the woman or the bear, huh? The woman or the bear? I much rather live in a cave with bears than a woman. Because bears don't fucking get on this app and complain all the time. They're not gonna get on this app and try to smear my reputation. Bears are chill. Like you even have a good history with bears, Goldilocks. What are you gonna. You're just gonna eat their porridge and traumatize them like you've done before? So go ahead and live with the bears. But I'm just saying the bears would rather Have us.

And it has Europe's highest rate of gangland killings. And one result is at the far right, parties are in the government now. They are for the first time. To which liberals say blaming immigrants for the rising crime rate is racist. Yeah, but is it true? Of course it's true. It's not a coincidence the quality of life went down after the Somali gangs started a drug turf war using hand grenades. Calling it racist doesn't solve the problem.

Despite the abundance of bacteria and potential health risks associated with excessive consumption, its distinctive flavor continues to entice adventurous eaters to prepare it. A thorough massage is essential to diminish odors, followed by meticulous hand needing to clean the breathing holes. Peeling off the black outer skin, which harbors waste deposits, is a laborious and time consuming process, resulting in a clean, white appearance. Additionally, removing the outer hair is crucial to prevent discomfort while eating. After preparation, marination with lemon helps to neutralize its taste. Before cooking, placing it in a pot with local red fruit lens a vibrant color and stewing in coconut milk for two hours enhances its flavor. Chili and garlic can be added for additional taste, simmering until the broth thickens. Once cooked, slicing open the red exterior reveals a tantalizing texture. Serve sliced thinly alongside Vietnamese vegetables and dipping sauce for a delectable dining experience. Despite initial hesitations, those who dare to try it often find it surprisingly delicious.",

There's a black owned seafood restaurant in Vegas that serves your food to you from a robot. And if you're a fan of deep fried everything, this is where you should come for lunch. The best thing on the menu is their whole fried lobster. I mean, is there even a such thing as too much butter? If you're a Vegas local who loves seafood, tag your friends and check out catchers fish out. Yo. Sometimes you have to realize that, yo, this is it. It's happening now, you know? And this moment, besides the longevity of this whole thing. Less than 24 hours later. I got it. Let's try it and rate it one to 10. I spent $83 and \u00a237. As always, we will start with the custom service. Immaculate. Like the first video say it. They are black owned and you can feel it when you walk in. Extremely welcome and warm hospitality. I loved it. I stopped rating the customer service after a while, but I'm gonna get back to it. Custom service 8.5 out of 10. I'm sure everything I got and we gonna try it and rate it one to 10. Grilled salmon burger, fried catfish burger 3 fried catfish tacos 3 piece catfish. A 3 piece fried corn with honey butter, a side of Mac and Cheese and a medium brisk raspberry iced tea. We gonna start with this corn, cause I never heard of nothing like that. This honey butter. I don't even like deep fried stuff, but this look way too good not to try. Is it heavy? Absolutely. Is it delicious and seasoned and crispy? Absolutely. I didn't think I was gonna like that that much. 8 out of 10. We start, huh? Next is the fried catfish taco. I will say I love that variety. I never heard of no fried corn or no fried catfish taco. That's a fish taco on steroids. I thought the toppings was gonna be overwhelming because it was a lot of them. All of the flavors mash perfectly. Again, we high. 9 out of 10. Absolutely. Next, fried catfish. I got some tartar sauce. It ain't catfish without hot sauce. That house also do it every time. Now, that one a little greasy, but the flavor. 8 out of 10. Next up is this salmon burger. Why this place not around a corner? Okay, we're gonna get into it in a minute. Hold on. Fries. MMM. I'mma keep my thoughts to myself until the end, but right now, that's a 9. Easily a 9 out of 10. I'm very picky with fries. That fry is an 8.5 out of 10. That season. I don't know what seasoning they use, but I love it. Next up, fried catfish sandwich. Boy, wait a minute. It. Is this a 9.8 out of 10. I was this close to giving it a 10, but it needs to be a little spicier for me. This is fantastic. Hold on, hold on, hold on. There go. There go. Last but not least, the Mac and cheese. I didn't broke into a full sweat like I'm about to be sleep right after that. That's cheesy. Hmm. I'm really perplexed. I don't know if I like this or not. It's different. Is that like Parmesan cheese on top is. It's cool at first, but whatever cheese they put on top do got an aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan. 4 out of 10. Let's get straight to it. I've never said this before, but I'm legit upset that they don't have a line out the door. That's genuinely, like, puzzling to me. The customer service is great. The Fool is immaculate. The location is good. They offer Main Street. The price. It is what it is is seafood. Seafood get expensive. I genuinely can't wrap my head around why this place is not, like, around the corner. I'm not playing. I'm stuck right now. I pray and I hope that after this, that changes. I'm officially putting this on my top 3 of best restaurants that I've had in Vegas. And I do not say that lightly. I'm dead serious, and whatever that's worth. But I know i'mma be back. That what? God bless you. Have an amazing day. You know what? I'm going Back. And I'm ordering more. And I'm not playing just for the video. I'm being dead serious. Going back."
