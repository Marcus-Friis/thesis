I mean, George, I will say, uh, I have heard from some people who really don't wanna see Trump get elected in the Republican Party, who are concerned that this is just this particular case is just going to drive additional enthusiasm for the former president. I'm interested you to respond to that. And you got your face in your hands. What do you got to say to Scott? I have to say. I mean, look. I mean, you know, Scott's lying. And that's the problem with the Republican Party. It is continually addicted to lies. What am I? Wait a minute. What am I? What am I? You're lying. You're lying. You're lying, Scott. You're lying about the law. You're lying about what the jury was charged to find. They don't have to find an underlying crime. They had to find the intent to cover up an underlying crime. And the underlying crime was pretty obvious. What was the crime? You ran for public office, Scott. You. You ran for public office, Scott. You know, you can't take money from somebody and reimburse them to. For. As a. You know, if it's a campaign, you know that damn well. And you. Okay, fine. You're close enough. You're involved in politics to know that. Okay, so that's the problem with the Republican Party, is that they are so fused with lies. I don't know why this Network is paying Scott to commit to save those lives. Whoa, whoa, okay, let's. Let's not go there. George, please. Please, let's not go there. No, no, we should go there. Scott is. Scott is our colleague, and we're gonna treat him respectfully as such. Continue. Well, you should. Here's my question. If it is an obvious crime, why did the department of justice and the Federal Election Commission take a pass on it for the federal election? They should have prosecuted it. Should have been prosecuted on January 21. On January 21, 2,021. Let's look at this, okay? That's what we all know. This is the thing about Donald Trump. He's never been. He's never been. Donald Trump has been let off. He should have been indicted for. And the fact of the matter is, Donald Trump isn't treated special. But he wasn't. Hold on, please. David. It doesn't",

And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it.

Now, obviously, they didn't televise the trial, but reporters have already said what the prosecution said in their closing argument. That they acknowledge that Michael Cohen is a convicted purger, both in court and before Congress. They acknowledge that Cohen recently lied to a judge and falsified documents to get out of his probation. They also acknowledge that Cohen got caught lying three times on the stand in this trial by itself. But then they just said, well, despite all that, he's telling the truth about his accusations against Trump, which is a fucking batshit crazy argument to make. You're saying that, yes, he has lied in the past, yes, he has been convicted of lying. Yes, he has recently lied and forged documents to a judge, and, yes, he lied on the stand three separate times in one testimony. But what he said about Trump is true. He lied to the court about not wanting a pardon from Trump, and they proved that by showing the affidavit he signed requesting a pardon. He lied about not wanting revenge against Trump, and to prove it, they played his podcast where he said he wanted revenge against Trump. Also decided not to talk about the fact that Michael Cohen admitted to embezzling money from the Trump Organization. They basically just said everything Cohen lied about was to protect Trump. And that Michael Cohen, while he would lie to protect Trump, he would never lie to protect himself. Yeah, I mean, let's see how that works out.",

So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date."

I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions. So if you wanna be mad at me, be mad at me. But if you want me to care, be somebody I respect first. Oh, and for all you haters keep jumping in my comments and giving me that algorithm boost."

    "voice_to_text": "So I just debated the older millennial, the big Republican creator on this app, and I am at a loss for words for what he said during this debate. He argued for the unaliving of people who are mentally disabled. He said all of them should go. Take a look at the clip here. People. Yeah, I think people who are gonna hold humanity back, we should eliminate them. Can you define, like, hold humanity back? Yeah, people who have met an IQ standard that they cannot support humanity or support a normal job or are mentally disabled. What? He is calling for the unaliving of millions of people around the world, people in the United States, because they don't hit his definition of productive member of society. That is an abhorrent thing to say. That is the position of some of the worst leaders in history. Mustache Man from World War 2 comes to mind. And he said this multiple times during the live, not just when Chris and I were there, but when he was debating other people. People like Parker and Dean have posted videos about this. Listen, this is not politics. I know there are people out there who disagree with me, there are people out there who agree with me, but this is not politics. This is basic human rights. And there are people watching this video who, under his belief, should have their close family members and loved ones unalived. It's disgusting. It's abhorrent. Nobody should Be saying things like that, especially a large creator like himself. So if you were watching that live, I'm sorry you had to witness that, but we are better than this as Americans. And I don't care your ideology. We are better than this.",

Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights. Somebody from California explain this to me.",

    "view_count": 210040,
    "voice_to_text": "When this trial against Trump is over, Michael Cohen is going to prison for a very long time. And it has nothing to do with all the crimes he's already been convicted of. It's because he just admitted to committing so many more fucking crimes. So he was asked on the stand about the $50,000 The Trump Organization gave him to pay Redfinch for IT services, where he admitted that only $20,000 of that actually went to Redfinch, and he kept the other 30,000. He said he believed it was a bonus he was due. Like, at its most basic, that's embezzlement. It's also theft by deception, theft under false pretenses, forgery because he made a fake invoice, wire fraud, male fraud, and even unjust enrichment. And the trial to charge him with all that would be the easiest shit ever. They could just replay his testimony from this trial, because he was asked about this directly, and he admitted to it directly. Trump's attorney asked him directly, did you steal from the Trump Organization? And he answered, yes, sir. That is an admission of guilt. The only way he escapes going to prison is they don't charge him with this crime. Which would be kind of weird to not do, considering he just admitted to committing the crime. It would be the easiest case ever. And the funniest thing was to watch the media try to defend what Cohen did. Lawrence O'Donnell actually said, oh, this wasn't so much Embezzlement, but more of a forced bonus. That's not how that shit works, Lawrence. You don't get to lie to a company, say you need money for these services, and then pocket some of it. That is embezzlement and fraud. Here's the thing. Even if Alvin Bragg doesn't actually prosecute Michael Cohen for this, the Trump Organization is gonna Sue Michael Cohen into the fucking ground. Michael Cohen, if he somehow manages to avoid prison, is going to be broke for the rest of his fucking life. Because the Trump Organization is not just gonna come for that 30 grand now. They're gonna come for far more damages than that. And it's not gonna be hard, cause he fucking admitted to it. Like, if you actually zoom out on this trial, it's kinda wild, because you have to think that this entire trial revolves around a convicted liar, perjurer, and a disbarred attorney, as well as a prostitute. Those are the only people who have anything to say in this case against Trump. And we've already found out when Stormy Daniels took the stand in this case, she lied. Like, that's been proven. And when Michael Cohen took the stand in this case, he was found to lie three times in one testimony. All of that proven as well. And now he just admitted to committing embezzlement against the Trump Organization. And Michael Cohen, hilariously, is still wondering why Trump didn't make him a part of his administration. It's cause You're a fucking criminal, Mike.",

The statute only provides me with two. One is fine of up to $1,000 for each violation. The other is jail. And I don't wanna exercise the jail option. It would be inconvenient.

He's gotten significantly worse since 2016 and even 2020, when people see how crazy he is in comparison to Joe Biden, who has done a lot of good stuff and is sane, they won't like him very much anymore.

It means a right to exist regardless of what sector you're from. My intention is to never offend anyone. I want every soul in this arena to feel the reflection of love. But there's innocent humans out in Gaza getting murdered with our dollars. And those precious human lives are an extension of us. I can't get up here in a fur coat, jump around and pretend while in my gut and the ancestors yelling you better step up for us and sisters so much. And my perspective is one that saying free Palestine is also rooted in your Protection, my loves. And there isn't a drop of anti. Again means never again for all. Have we not Learned the lessons, my love? The self centering around what is potentially threatening to us is actually at the root of what disconnects all of us. The word genocide is such a point of contention for some that it's more hurtful than seeing dead babies getting pulled out of the crumbled cement in the dust. Comparative suffering leads to believing the lie. There's a them and there's a us. It's a lie. We don't own this earth. We're just guests here, my love. And at some point in time we drew lines in the MUD based on the colour of our skin, the gods we worshipped and The divine up above. And historically, we've exploited black and brown bodies to climb up the rungs. But the latter doesn't work when it depends on the oppression of some. Hmm. Hmm. And I've been hearing the earth cry lately. Yeah, the deepest cries. My, oh, my, what have we done? We got some work to do to unlearn and rewire the plugs that are short circuiting in a selfish cycle. Than we're blind to the drug that we're all addicted to. Me, myself, I. And not us. In this moment in time, we're being called to rise and become. See ourselves in the pain of others and not separate from them. And i'mma say it till I die with my chest to the sky. Free Palestine!

Donald Trump just said that the Republicans shouldn't come to the courthouse with him. They should stay in Congress and pass policies to block the charges against him. Really? You know, that's a very strange thing for someone to say who claims that they're totally innocent, right? I mean, Donald Trump says he hasn't done anything wrong, there's no crime. So he would have no problem going to trial because he's gonna be exonerated, right? He doesn't need any policy blocking it from happening. Oh, wait. Donald Trump knows he's guilty, and he needs somebody to step in to save him. He is quite literally trying to get the government to interfere with his trials, something we don't do here in the United States of America. But in Donald Trump's ideal world, where he's a dictator, that happens all the time. This man is so dangerous for democracy, I can't even put into words how bad a second Trump term would be.

And we had a woman get arrested because of the portal for blocking people from seeing the screen. We had a flip off battle between Dublin and New York where people were flipping each other off, which started on Dublin side. A man also decided to do this in front of the portal, surprising everyone on the New York side. And now, out of disrespect, someone decided to show a picture of September 11 on Dublin side again. This all happened in under a week, and they're contemplating on doing something back to Dublin because of this. Many are also wanting the portal to be removed, specifically. Typically after this incident, now people are not happy. And all the problems we had regarding the portal surprisingly seem to be coming from Dublin. These problems, however, were anticipated, and it's the reason why the portal won't be up for much longer. Right now, it's scheduled to be removed in November. And many are glad that it's gonna be gone since it's been causing nothing but problems. And who knows, we might be getting the removal date even earlier if something crazier happens.",

We knew it was because you went to work, but I'm not sure our children realize that. They saw simply that the clothes got better, the house got bigger. This. The neighborhood got nicer. And I have a strong suspicion that what happened in the late 60s was that the kids who rebelled took it for granted that life would improve automatically."

According to the latest court filing, crooked Judge Cannon is now vacating the late may trial start date, claiming that pre trial deadlines have not been met and therefore the jury is not prepared to be presented with the facts in this case. But the only reason that pre trial deadlines have not been met is because Judge Cannon has been deliberately and intentionally delaying and delaying this case at the request of the man who appointed her to her position, the criminal defendant Donald Trump himself. So unfortunately, this postponement likely means that Donald Trump will not be going to trial for the crimes he committed or for the classified documents that he stole from the United States government in 2,024. And that is a complete and utter travesty to the rule of law, because justice delayed is justice denied.",

He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order.

Every single thing they want. So it's really interesting to me, Hocking Jeffries that has gone through round after round of speaker votes. And we've all witnessed it, haven't we, America? And I wanna tell you, I think it's good that America witnessed all of that. And the Democrats said his name over and over again. They said Hakeem Jeffries because they wanted to elect him speaker. Why? Find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson. And you wanna know something? I wanna see it happen. And I also wanna see recorded votes. I think the American people, by the way, who I represent, I think the American people need to see a recorded vote of. Do they. Does Congress. Does the members of Congress support the UNIT party? Is this what they support? I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may. And so next week, I am gonna be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and Have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again. Having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative. I think that'll play well. I'm excited about it, and I also can't wait to see my Republican conference show their cards and show who we are, because voters deserve it. Is the Republican Party has.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on Wednesday vowed to force a vote next week on Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s (R-LA) ouster, setting up a scenario in which Democrats will provide the votes needed to save a Republican speaker\u2019s job.   \u201cI think the American people need to see a recorded vote,\u201d the Georgia firebrand told reporters. \u201cI think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d   Hardline Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated with Speaker Johnson, pointing to him frequently turning to Democrats for their support in passing key legislation like Ukraine aid, government funding and FISA warrantless surveillance.   \u201cMike Johnson is giving them everything they want,\u201d Rep. Greene said. \u201cI find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson. And you want to know something? I want to see it happen.\u201d   Rep. Greene initially filed her motion to vacate last month, but held off on triggering a vote, trying to use it as leverage to wield influence over the speaker. When she makes the motion \u201cprivileged\u201d next week, it will require the House to act on it within two legislative days.   The House will likely vote on a motion to table the motion to vacate, which will require a simple majority to shelve the effort.   So far, only two other Republicans have joined Rep. Greene\u2019s effort \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ) \u2014 but given the GOP\u2019s very slim majority, that would likely be enough to strip the speaker of his gavel absent Democratic support.   House Democratic leaders on Tuesday announced they would vote to table the motion, saying it was time to \u201cturn the page\u201d on the chaos in the House that\u2019s been driven by the hardline faction of the Republican conference.   Rep. Greene acknowledged her motion is likely to fail but said it would serve to get lawmakers on record.   \u201cIf this vote fails and the whole conference, the whole Congress, supports the \u2018uniparty,\u2019 let me tell you something, that is not a failure, it\u2019s a win for the American people because that\u2019s a list of names,\u201d she said.   #marjorietaylorgreene #speakerofthehouse #mikejohnson #cspan  ",

    "voice_to_text": "Over 100 Columbia University students were arrested during protests against Israel's war on Gaza. Here's what happened on Thursday, April 18th. At the request of the university president, police cleared out a camp of pro Palestine protesters on the school's campus. The night before, protesters erected an encampment of around 50 tens on the main campus Lawton calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and what university president Doctor Manus Shafiq called a violation of quote, a long list of rules and policies. An email to students she seek wrote quote, I authorized the New York police departments and begin clearing the encampment. I took this extraordinary step because of these extraordinary circumstances. New York City Mayor Eric Adams waited on the incident at a press conference, echoing Shafique's message that the protesters had violated university policy with their 30 hour long demonstration. Amongst the protestors was Erisa Hirsey, daughter of democratic congresswoman Elon Omar. Hirsey and two others were suspended from Columbia and Barnard College, Columbia Sister School, for participating in the encampment. In total, 108 people were arrested. It was the first time mass arrest had been made on Columbia's campus since 1968 when students demonstrated against the Vietnam War. It wasn't the only time police interviewed on the Ivy League campus this week. This Wednesday, April 17th, police were on site as students protested the war in Gaza while University President Doctor Shafiq testified about anti Semitism on campus before Congress.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I bring you a fresh book publishing scandal. For the Atlantic, the writer Tyler Austin Harper wrote an expos of the New York Times bestseller White Rural Rage, and he argues that the authors of this book conveniently misinterpreted research and data in order to prove their own thesis. I'm gonna focus on two main problems with the book White Rural Rage. The thesis of the book is that white rural voters pose a unique threat to American democracy. But as Harper points out in the Atlantic, the authors of this book never bother to define what the word rural means. The word rural is defined by different academic researchers in different ways, and the authors of this book, instead of picking one definition that would work for their argument, just decide not to choose a definition of all. So rural could mean anything. Avoiding giving a definition of what you mean by the word rural, which is in the title of your own book, Harper says, is like deciding to write a book about Irish people and then drawing on studies of Irish people from Ireland, Irish Americans, people who took a 23 and me test and Learned they were Irish, and people who like to get drunk in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day. The second big problem with this book is that to prove their thesis that the threat of political violence is particularly acute in white rural America, they cite an article titled The Rise of Political Violence in the United States that directly contradicts the claim they are making. This whole scandal reminds me of 2019 when Naomi Wolf had a book coming out about how gay men were treated in the UK in the 19th century. And then while she was doing this BBC interview, the interviewer asked her about her interpretation of this two word phrase that basically her entire thesis was based on, and she had completely misinterpreted those two words, meaning the entire point of her book was null and void.",

So, the minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us, regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have, or who we voted for. But we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition, or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for, and died for. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get The attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't.

    "voice_to_text": "Joe Biden come out yesterday on national television talking about gun laws, and here's what he said. I shit you not. I'm getting real tired of the American people thinking the Second Amendment was to help protect them against a government who has abused their power. But that's not even what pissed me off. Here's what really pissed me off is when he said, if you think you need guns to take on the government, you are going to need some F Fifteens and some nuclear weapons. What? I don't know. I could be mistaken, but that sounds like a threat to me. That don't sound like a president. You wanna know what that sounds like? A dictator. This administration must have forgotten this is our country. Not Joe Biden's country, not Elon Musk's country, not Bill Gates country. This is our country, the United States of America. People have shed blood to call this their country. And if you want our guns, you come get them.",
