Well, that's a prompt that could easily have been five seconds, but I could tell by your body language you'd love to hear yourself talk. We've said it about a couple thousand times, but y'all don't wanna listen. Doesn't matter if he's Democrat or Republican. If he's guilty, he's guilty. Yeah, if you wanna charge Biden with something, charge Biden with something. And if it stands up in court, lock him up and throw away the key. What part of this don't you get? Politicians are not gods. They don't deserve our worship. They work for us. But then again, I'm talking to someone that has Team Trump in their bio, so.",

    "voice_to_text": "I hope they now go and take a look at the oranges you don't have to go back and watch the video I stitched if you don't have time or you don't care to it's a compilation of misspeak word salad if you will that Donald Trump has exhibited over the years really and the reason that I'm stitching this video is because I wanna say this to you let's take aside the fact that Donald Trump might not have a moral compass let's put aside the fact that Donald Trump is involved with and has committed crimes let's put aside the fact that he really doesn't have the experience or the expertise to run this country he has not been successful in running his own companies and has not been able to do so in an ethical way all of that aside let's just pretend that doesn't exist let's just pretend Donald Trump is an upstanding citizen who's never committed a crime in his life who loves puppies and kittens and is a great father to his kids and he's just everything um you would want in a representative for our country so let's just pretend all of that's gone Donald Trump has dementia and yes I am qualified to make that assessment and give that opinion that's what I did and of course I can't make a diagnosis nor can anyone else without evaluating him but there have been letters sent to the United States government from scores of psychologists and psychiatrists and neurologists that they've all signed saying this man is not fit to hold any office with any responsibility because he is cognitively compromised is it his fault that he has dementia well both of his parents had alzheimer's so it's probably a foregone conclusion that that's where he's going to however there are things you can do to decrease the onset of these things like um not using drugs not drinking um a healthy diet regular activity and exercise do I need to say it so when someone has dementia the the mixing up of words and word salad that is a prime symptom and it is only gotten worse with time and I know it makes you all angry or it makes you laugh you know the videos about Donald having to use both hands to hold his water or having trouble walking down the ramp um that's all part of it that's all part of dementia and I look at him sitting in the courtroom in those still pictures the man is not in good health he is not in good health at all he's almost as old as Joe Biden and he's definitely not taking care of himself the way Joe Biden has um can someone old run the country yeah if there are sound mine and good health sure can someone without a moral compass run the country well he did if you wanna call that running but that's another topic um someone dementia someone with dementia can they run the country yeah into the ground he's not going to be capable of making the hard decisions and providing the leadership we need to stay safe in this world it's simple I'm just asking for you to think about it and you know there's a lot of pressure on people to vote one way or the other and you know that when you go in the voting booth to cast your ballot you're the only one there you vote your conscience you vote what you want for the future of your families this really is the most important election in the history of our country and it is because the outcome of the choice we make is gonna determine what this country is going to be after this for the sake of having someone of sound mind that can run the country in my opinion that won't make an impulsive decision that will get us all blown up someone that knows that you can't deport all the immigrants cause they're a vital part of our workforce in our communities you may not like Joe Biden you may think Joe Biden's too old you may think Joe Biden has dementia but look at Joe Biden's record and look at the work he's done and compare it to the mess that it was when Donald Trump was president all of these things impact that all of them I know you all love this country and you want the best for it but what people don't seem to realise is that if Donald Trump is president in the state his cognitive brain is in right now it's not going to go well no matter how much you love him he can't do it as much as he might want to he simply can't do it he wouldn't be running the country all his single fans will be operating his levers and they'll be running the country trust me I'm telling you vote",

    "voice_to_text": "so Tony Gonzalez wins a very close very tight run off election to retain his congressional seat in Texas and against the guy they called he's like an AK hero assault right rifle hero to those in Texas very far right guy and the wind has me thinking about one thing that I want to pose to folks here is MAGA waning is Marco waning is Make America Great Again the Trump wing of the party waning and its influence in its power and I say that for a couple of reasons one is if you file the race and if you file anything in Congress for the last few years right when you know when Donald Trump announced that he was running for president in 2016 um a number of Republicans uh said you know no way you know never in my party you know what we have this guy this guy is a Charleton this guy is a fraud he is uh you know all the stances on policies are an enigma and against the Ronald Reagan conservative mainstream Republican philosophy for the last since you know has ruled apart since 1980 never will I get on board with him and Trump ushered in a populist uprising within the Republican Party and won the nomination now there's lots of reasons why he wanted many candidates running no one could ever get around a single establishment candidate to oppose him and by the time you know winter take all happens in the Republican Party Trump you know halfway through had had won enough delegates in and they all had to had to quit and then they all bowed down because they had to the populist militia had taken over their party much of the same way that I I would say you know for those who are saying why you so horse you know course on that and same way Obama took over the Democratic Party from the Clintons in 2,008 I was part of the Obama campaign that did that and we took the party from the party regulars we took it from the machine and and and Obama became the titular head of the Democratic Party well in terms of philosophy in terms of policy uh he was very much uh uh you know for racing the top and those kind of things educational form that Hillary Clinton wasn't uh for and the number thing that maybe even the Black Caucus wasn't supporting uh he took over the party the same way Trump took over the party in 2016 but what you saw was a number of Republicans who then either you know file in line or stayed on the outside and opposed him but they quit so they wouldn't have to run against pro Trump people in the primaries and in 2018 so you saw a lot of uh uh congressional chairpersons interestingly enough who Republicans who quit rather than run under the MAGA wing rather than run against a far right challenger who had Trump support and had to make them spend money and potentially lose in those races and they left Congress more left Congress in 2020 uh and more the ones that stayed that were Republicans fell in line uh in 2022 more uh more uh more retired and in 2024 people like Kim Buck retired or were retired right especially those who um you know want to reprimand Trump for for 2020 and the January 6th insurrection Tony Gonzalez is one of those people who want to reprimand the president he was on the president's hit list to be taken out he's a moderate Republican he's a mainstream by moderate Republican he's mainstream conservative Republican Ronald Reagan Republican and so um you're seeing this now happen and people like Tony Gonzalez has survived there were many minors who have survived the challenge some have lost but many have won there's another there's another congressman in Texas who was a had a far right person attack running against them they won handily and the Tony Gonzalez raises interesting because he has called out the far right publicly he has called some of his colleagues in the house scumbags like Matt Gates and others he has he has told the tale he is he is not voted the party line on every issue he's been sort of a Maverick and independent kind of kind of guy I think it's the constituents appreciate that uh he had the support of the mainstream Republicans in the state Governor Abbott uh and a number of packs that are aligned with sort of mainstream Republicans uh on the other side was Matt Gates and eventually enough uh I was mean good who's the head of the House Freedom Caucus amongst the Republicans but my question is that they you know it was a close race but he still won and that means it's gonna be continued division within the house caucus between the MAGA wing and the conservative traditional Ronald Reagan uh mainstream wing of of the party and I and I'm beginning to wonder ask the question is Marga waning nationally um one is his evidence I'm just gonna give three pieces of evidence one is again that people like Tony Gonzalez continue to win um and and and the mainstream Republicans are getting behind other mainstream Republicans and when that happens they win secondly we've been talking about this here and on TikTok another places please make sure you subscribe to my YouTube channel as well curious formula uh but we've been talking about that you know there's a strong anti Trump vote uh happening in the primaries even though Trump is the presumptive nominee in Indiana 20% of the vote voted for Nikki Haley she's not even running just her name was on the ballot in Maryland 20% of the Republican primary vote went for Nikki Haley again even though she's not running Nikki Haley was forced in my opinion to to endorse Trump by the RNC to make sure he stops hemorrhaging these votes because Republicans who are these Ronald Reagan mainstream considered Republicans are having buyers remorse and they jumping off the MAGA the MAGA boat as it seems and the Tony Gonzalez race is an example of that and so the second example is Trump having trouble in these primaries and Nikki Haley saying please my hope by my supporters will talk to Donald Trump and Trump will reach out to my voters the third reason why I think MAGA may be waning is because it really appears that is a cult of personality that it is Trump driven that when there is no Donald Trump uh saying vote this way vote for this candidate a MAGA are left to their own devices and they can't really muster up the strength to beat mainstream candidates when the mainstream Republican conservatives line up and support them one good example is that you know again Congressman Good is the head of the House Freedom Caucus The House Freedom Caucus is basically a MAGA caucus it is basically the caucus of the most far right members who are the most rabid and supportive of Donald Trump and guess what Donald Trump is is supporting in his district and his fight Congressman goods district the far right candidate was opposing Congressman Good so we have the vision even amongst the manga people because good is a manga guy but Trump doesn't think he's a manga enough I suppose and so he's opposing him in his own district so that proves that the Freedom Caucus people who support Donald Trump the strongest in the most it's not reciprocal Donald Trump doesn't necessarily support all of them and so that's the that's the third reason why I think MAGA might be weighing there seems to be infighting within the very caucus within the very movement of people there's not anonymity about who the candidates ought to be is not anonymity about who Trump actually supports uh from his own sort of wing of the party and that wing of the party when one more one more moderate and and and more establishment were conservative Republicans get together they can't beat them and it seems to be that those elites those college educated Republicans those um white women in the suburbs Republicans are jumping off the Donald Trump wagon but tell me what you think uh is Michael waning uh are we seeing uh a softening of of the MAGA wing are people gonna stay home or Donald Trump within his own party or will he get that or will he get the rabbit popular support that he received in 2016 let me know what you think subscribe like and comment here um but also go to my YouTube channel curious Formula subscribe like and comment there uh stay curious and uh remember think it ain't illegal yet",

And all three of us is going down to the Manhattan courthouse, and we're gonna sit in our lawn chairs and drink our unwoke beer wearing our Donald Trump diapers, and we're gonna wave our Donald Trump is Jesus flags. Then we're gonna do what we do best. We're gonna go on that damn near true social. We're gonna issue death threats. Because we're patriots.",

    "voice_to_text": "Seen all these fucking Trump supporters saying that they're gonna start a civil war if Trump loses in November. The MAGA said there would be a civil war when Donald Trump was searched at Mar a Lago in 2022. Then they said he would never get indicted and there would be a civil war if he was. Then they said he'd never get arraigned and arrested and had his mugshot printed because there would be a civil war. Then they said he would never see a single day in court because there would be a civil war. The MAGA used civil war the same way Donald Trump uses the phrase something's been rigged. It's their only defense for anything. Donald Trump loses something, loses an election, something doesn't go his way, it's because it was rigged. If the MAGA don't like something that's happening, if they don't like rainbows on shirts and they don't like their beer being woke, they'll just threaten a civil war. And the most hilarious part is that all these treason loving idiots keep calling themselves patriots and they don't even realize that if they ever tried to start that civil war that they keep dreaming about, they would be the bad guys. And like she pointed out, the US military has drones. You can come out and march in the streets in your Larping gear in your AR fifteens all you want. One push of a button and a Reaper drone turns you into meat. Paste from 15,000 feet. Good luck finding something to defend you from that at Walmart.",

You think Trump is the first president in history to be accused of lying? And the irony being, he lies more than any president we've ever had. But your delusion, you know, you're just. Your fucking.

I will not bow down to a relgious, fascist, who is intentionally funding m@ssacre after m@ssacre for the sake of power and money. If that's what's YOU feel like YOU need to do, then YOU should absolutely do that. Stop telling me I HAVE to. I do not.

    "voice_to_text": "can I have a hug oh fuck no is it just trying to spread love I see videos like this all the time on TikTok and I'm not gonna lie this should be bothering the fuck out of me when I see people going up to random people and asking for stuff with somebody with a blatant camera just in their face I'm from Chicago alright I was born and raised in Chicago on the South Side we not just walking up hugging strangers like that's just not something that we do I'm not gonna lie however I also think it's kind of insensitive to walk around and hug people with a with a person that's got a camera all up in their fucking face and they probably just don't wanna be recorded and then you plaster these people all over the internet so that way people can judge them when they might just be having a bad day or might just you know don't wanna be bothered and shit because you don't know what these people are going through you know what I'm saying so in the act of you trying to give out you know hugs because you need a hug and you wanna spread love and then you proceed to post it on the internet and then having a group of your followers judging these people is giving the literal opposite message of what you're trying to spread and it's that type of shit that bothers me because then it lets me know that it's not done you know in a genuine way you're doing this for views and for clicks because if that was the case if you really just wanted a hug you would have posted the video of of people giving you hugs and not exposing people that just don't want you in a personal space and because you posted this video is more than likely for good reason because that's some scummy shit to do somebody doesn't wanna give you a hug and and and indulge in your feelings because of a day that they're possibly having and then you wanna go online and expose these people and try to embarrass them and look like you're the one that's like trying to do good for the world when you have no idea what these people are going through I think that's really fucked up and insensitive to do and this is what I mean by everything isn't for the internet you know what I'm saying like this is what I mean like this shit is so fucking cringe and weird to me that you guys can go up to random people who don't wanna be filmed or don't wanna be put in this position and then just put a camera in their face and then just expect them to react the way that you want them to because that's something that you expect I think that's fucked up and real shit you can't do that with everybody because you don't know the trauma and the BS and all the things that other people have gone through in their lives to make them like that but then you wanna jump online instantly to make yourself look like oh yeah I'm the I'm I got the more high ground because I'm trying to spread love and these people don't wanna spread it back well ultimately you have no idea that that could have made these people so uncomfortable that they don't wanna deal with that just because somebody doesn't wanna give a random stranger a fucking hug it's been let alone some random stranger who also goes out of his way to expose them on the internet afterwards fucking crazy leave people the fuck alone",

I respect the hell out of you, but you are making a huge mistake. In November, we have 2 choices, Trump or Biden. Are pie in the sky dreams of perfect President, government, or culture worth destroying lives because your mad about an App. Like I said, I have legitimate fears regarding a Trump presidency.

    "voice_to_text": "afternoon TikTok so I have not made any content in quite a while I uh I just I don't know it's been tough with everything going on but today you know I saw a video from a content creator who I respect tremendously I would appear that 99% of the time I fully and wholeheartedly agree with her perspective um and again this is not coming out of I'm not I'm not I'm not being a like a troll or anything I just really don't understand this is an application TikTok all right this yes it it is an important application for lots of people yet it is an application on a phone if this application disappeared tomorrow do you know what I wouldn't be missing uh my house wouldn't disappear my Hispanic wife civil liberties wouldn't potentially start disappearing my wife my daughter wouldn't be continuously losing their rights um this is serious life this is not an application this is not something that we should be trivial about now I understand you want need want this application to perpetuate itself but to pretend that they don't already have a backup in line for this is insane there is 100% a backup for TikTok that this company obviously and very likely already has set to go but all this is just in effect publicity for that app but what in right now all we're seeing are distraction after horrible event that is somehow being painted to put Trump and Biden in the same category that is insane can we not just for one second think yeah TikTok it goes away and you guys decide not to vote for Biden and then we get Trump is it gonna be worth it when everything we go everything changes goes away that my daughter gets pregnant and then she has to sign up for some fucking registry she has a miscarriage then she gets to describe and get freaking investigated on whether or not it was an abortion or she did something my wife my half breed children who are Hispanic not my words we you your platform and under the table is so is huge and your message is is almost always amazing but I I just cannot disagree with this more you cannot hold the election hostage based upon TikTok you you you you could sway millions of people with your message and what this is gonna end up doing is ending up with Biden losing Trump in the presidency and just a full on nightmare for everyone in this country and if you really think TikTok is worth it then fine have fun but if Trump wins do you think TikTok is gonna be around I'll take indifference I'll take rude rude seriously rude I'll take all of that over the absolute certainty that if if if Trump wins everything will get worse for everybody not just TikTok creators and and your your source of of income or you know real fucking problems now I'm not trying to I really don't wanna belittle that this is important to people cause it truly is and it's it's it's very valuable potentially on some levels somewhat essential to get messages across between people but really this is an application we're talking about the fate of the country the fate of women the fate of girls the fate of just men who need to who are gonna start if this goes forward are gonna grow up in a culture where we we we I mean really really this is an argument that we need to be having get it together Trump that is that should be priority number one that's it that is it how can you not realize what is at stake here it's more than an app it's more than freedom of speech at this point it's it's keeping a a narcissistic megalomaniacal maniac who was willing to sell his position for billion dollars to the wealthiest oil elites in the fucking world and this is what you're you're you're gonna you're gonna Jack him up for get get get with it get with the program under the table I'm just like I said I respect you to the moon and back but I'm disappointed like broken hearted frankly cause I've seen countries where this sort of government where a man like Trump is in charge and you're worried about TikTok I just don't I just don't get it",

But for now on, let's get talk about. Hey, Mr. Bucket here, Harrison Buddker, the famous kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs, just recently did a graduation speech at a Catholic, uh, college. Uh, fun fact, Harrison Bucket himself is Catholic. So he was just pushing some of the ideas that he was taught. Some of the ideas at the school also benefits from, you know, they all have the same kind of ideas. By the way, if you're just mad at the speech because you don't like what he said, and that shows more of a character than of him actually teaching other students.",

They feel good, and then when they go to use it, they get arrested. So I'm actually, like, helping clean up the community, you know, getting them off the street. Okay, so we're just openly admitting to committing crimes now? Because the US government says intent to defraud is punishable up to 20 years in prison. I showed that video to Mrs. Murphy, and she said, well, technically, if the counterfeit currency being used in said transaction isn't of an approximate material or approximate dimensions, then technically, it's not really counterfeit. Which is why I'm highlighting the intent to defraud. Which is exactly what Johnny Mac is admitting in his video. So this is the part of the game where we download his video and send it off to the FBI. And then he reaches that find out portion of this game of fuck around.",

With that being said, I wanna set this young man straight, because apparently this kid really ain't getting it, all right? And I would want. Oh, and by the way, ladies, I want you to basically go and frequent this young man's page and let him know about said Lawrence Taylor, for instance. Probably kind of spread the truth around a little bit about him, because this is gonna be hard to hear. You see, Donald Trump has done this bullshit before, alright? He's done it in 2,016. He tried to do it in 2020 and he lost in 2020. He did it in 2,016 and was successful at it because people thought that he was a breath of fresh air. No one wanted Democrats that actually hold power and office. And we all got duped. That's right, we all got duped. I wasn't duped. I voted for Hillary. But nevertheless, elections are elections. It wasn't until 2,020 where he couldn't get the black vote. Lawrence Taylor wasn't around then. Where was he then? Now all of a sudden he talks about he met this man. Really? You know, it's not a real good idea to bring somebody up there that looks like, you know, he hasn't done anything in the last, what, 20 years? After his retirement, he played in a couple of movies. Little Giants. What was the other one? Any given Sunday hasn't really done too much, and also, believe it or not, is a registered sex offender. Yeah, he is. I'm sorry, but he is. And Donald Trump is reaching right now because a lot of people are not playing this game with him anymore. They're not. The last four years of this man's presidency under his watch basically showed the fact that racism ran wild under his watch. George Floyd, Jacob Blake, a mob. Mob Barry, Brianna Taylor, to name a few. The protest that went around the run around this country and around the world for police brutality, and what did this man do? Nothing. Nothing at all. All he did was complain about democratic cities and Republican cities. Buildings being burned down, businesses being looted. We all knew that there were certain individuals that were peppering inside these protests that were either policemen or white supremacist groups trying to cause anarchy and chaos. Nevertheless, Donald Trump didn't do a damn thing. And now, since this man is doing his campaigning in a courtroom, he's about maybe this close to being a bitch to the state of New York. Very fitting. Just want to let you know that, kid, check out this video for context and clarity. You have a wonderful day.",

    "voice_to_text": "Look, the average income in my district is $55,000 a year. The congressman. Hey, everybody, go back and watch the whole video. Very well done video. It's congressmen and women from both parties arguing why they need their pay raise and why that pay should be indexed to inflation. And they give some perfectly valid reasons as to why that pay should be increased. They talk about the fact that it's very expensive as a Congress person to not only maintain residents in DC where they work, but also maintain their residents back home where they got elected and where the constituents live. Definitely a valid reason. The other reason they give is actually much more compelling, and I think it's very important that we keep this in mind. We don't wanna be governed just by the elite, by the independently wealthy, by the people that don't need the money to do the job. We want our members of Congress and the Senate to come from our neighborhoods, come from our friends and family and neighbors. We want those people in Congress representing us. Why? Because they're more likely to understand our problems. But my favorite part about this video is how tone deaf it is these people are talking about how it's very hard to take that vote to increase their salary. Because if they do, and then they have to come back to their district and justify why they needed more money, it's gonna be really hard. To do when people are making $55,000 a year or $32,000 a year. And that's the point. If you're gonna represent your constituents in Washington, go do it. Go past policies that will get us paid more, get workers paid more. You get a substantial raise for your constituents through the policies that you pass. Then you come back and say, you know what? I need more money in order to continue to do my job, because it's very expensive to maintain two residences and all those other reasons. Fine. But until then, you're right. If you take that vote, we will run you out of office. And you know what? If you don't take that vote, we're probably gonna run you out of office, too, because you guys aren't doing your job.",

And I'm gonna give you the answer to that one as well. I hope you stick with me the whole time. Doesn't matter why Biden decided to keep his salary illegally. He gets to do that. Is that an American? I don't think so. Moving on. Question you're not asking is why did Trump give up the $1.6 million over four years? Um, the only answer I can think is it has something to do with the tens of millions of dollars the taxpayer spent at his businesses, housing, the Secret Service, him, and his travel during that time. We spent more money on his travel in four years than we did on Obama's in 8 9. In addition to those tens of millions of tax dollar money, he also directed foreign governments to his businesses to the tune of about $7.8 million. Yet he was profiteering",

Any other candidate who can't answer that very simple question, will you accept the results of the 2024 election with a simple yes, they are immediately disqualified from running for office. Rule number one. And we all know why Tim Scott couldn't say yes. He's trying to be Donald Trump's vice president. Donald Trump still has not conceded the race in 2020. He's still not acknowledged that he has lost the race in 2020, even though there is no evidence that he. That there was any sort of voter fraud or anything like that that would have given Donald Trump any sort of chance of becoming president. And he lost over 60 cases in court that verified the fact that Donald Trump lost that race. But, yeah, absolutely disqualified. If you can't accept the results of a competition and you can't lose that competition, then you can't be in that competition, full stop. And good on Kristen Walker for pushing back on this as Tim Scott tried to pivot and go on the attack. Tim Scott tried desperately to pivot to, you know, inflations higher under Biden. And nobody likes NBC, even because they're just Democrats. And Chris Walker said, I ain't having it. Good for her.",

Chris, it's almost like you're shocked and surprised that these tactics aren't working, buddy. Yes, Chris, Donald Trump has been in court damn near every single day because the Biden administration is weaponizing the government to go out to their political rival. Jack Smith, Alvin Braggs, Leticia James, Funny Willis, they've all been accolds with the Biden administration. And, Chris, you're saying the quiet part out loud. Not only is this election interference, but this is the biggest, and I mean the biggest political witch hunt ever. This went from Trump included, with Russia to steal the 2016 election to a porn star. A porn star who owes Trump $300,000. It's Trump 2024.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm gonna read a quote from Martin Luther King Jr and trigger warning I am going to say an outdated word that is  not very appropriate now but I will say it for the sake of this quote I have reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the KuKlux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than justice this creator does a very common mistake in trying to  misinform people about the similarities between communism and fascism  yes he makes a very good point that you can't put your political alignment on a single line that would be very lazy and that is very true and it all depends of course on what line that is but he says that it's not just straight there's an up and down thing now he brings up horseshoe theory but it's very interesting that I never saw the similarities until now but he was showing what is called the political compass now the political compass is not a great  way of showing your political alignment there are many factors in regards to  where you would fall but this is a general idea so at the top you have authoritarianism and authoritarian simply means how much power the state has okay but we've equated it over time to mean autocratic or totalitarian which is not entirely wrong but it's not entirely correct either and then at the bottom you have what's called libertarian which would be more towards the liberties of the people where there's less state ah influence up here is high state influence here is low state influence and then on the right you have capitalism and then on the left you have socialism and this is in regards to where your beliefs fall in  in the idea of economics do we want more private ownership of the means production or do we want more socialized communal  control of the means of production so with these two axis this is where you have your political people aligned now Stalin of course is on the authoritarian scale and he's also on the socialist side but because  there's more state control there is not necessarily as much social stuff especially  with what Stalin had which was called state capitalism so there were capitalistic tendencies but it was a socialist model this is why Stalin was on this side and this would be people like Mao and Lenin and Marx and then down here anarchists they are libertarian socialists okay and this has been the term for anarchist for a very long time all right on the capitalist side you have the an-caps the anarcho capitalists these would also be your minarchists and your Misesian kind of people or even your  libertarians quote unquote really they're right wing libertarians but up here state power capitalism here is Hitler Hitler is fascism along with Mussolini this is when the state and capitalism join up together okay and this would be called some people call it crony capitalism or corporatism but it's still fascism right here Democrats and Republicans Republicans are closer to the capitalist side they're more right wing they align more with capitalism but Democrats and Republicans both are capitalist and they are liberals because they believe in liberalism this is where liberalism would be okay MAGA is a lot closer to Hitler because they wanna have a more authoritarian government and they want to you know a lot of them are very uh capitalist they wanna believe more in a free market sometimes the ancaps will fall into this from time to time but you know actual an-caps would not want any government in general so by looking at that political compass which you know can be found on the internet on Google that's just a very  generalized slim down version but there are other placements of different  government systems and political ideologies on that he wants to talk about how the communist and the MAGA people  both complain about liberals well yes but not only do we commies I am a commie not only do we complain about liberals from the Democrat standpoint but we complain about liberals in general remember liberals are both Democrats and Republicans because they believe in liberalism okay but just like Martin Luther King said the white moderate who would happen to be a Liberal are more likely to align with fascism because fascism is about maintaining order  the thing is that we communists do complain about the conservatives but also the interestingly enough the progressive liberals complain about the conservatives so we agree on the same reasons why we both hate the conservatives because of their racism and sexism and misogyny and patriarchy and all of those things and you're gonna see a bunch of left leaning people and leftist people saying fuck Joe Biden because he is  supporting a genocide that is why we say fuck Joe Biden but the MAGA people are too scared to say fuck Joe Biden they're gonna say let's go Brandon and when he's talking about the hierarchy that both uh the MAGA and the communist want hierarchy that's not true like we saw on the political compass only the Marxist Leninists are concerned about hierarchy because it's authoritarian in nature it's the anarchist that don't want want hierarchy at all and that's the biggest problem is that they wanna lump all socialists together as being commies and that's not the case you have two different kinds you have the state socialist and then you have the libertarian socialist what's interesting is that Stalin wanted to resign multiple times but his council wouldn't let it happen and it was later revealed from a document in 1953 that the CIA knew that Stalin was not a dictator like they wanted to make everybody think he was I find it very interesting that he wanted to blame communism for the sexual morality laws in China when we see even to this day that there are states that will punish women for premarital sex or even being raped this is not a communism problem this is not even a Liberal or libertarian or liberalist problem this is a patriarchy problem which is what the conservatives are all about so China with their more conservative values in their country from the time if you understand the history of China they were even before the communist took over they were not very permissive towards women's right in 1917 Russians allowed women to vote three years before America did they even had more rights for black people in Russia than America there were a lot more civil rights in Soviet Russia at the time than America at the same time they even allowed women in their military at the time of the Red Army and some of the most feared soldiers were women there is one female sniper she was Ukrainian she had 309 kills I think it's interesting he's saying that they didn't get it from the Bible with this  thing they were doing in China with the woman who had the multiple boyfriends um if memory serves me correctly the Bible speaks multiple times about sexual immorality and the sinfulness of prostitute he wanted to say that communists are anti intellectual of course that is obviously not true Soviets both uh Cuba and Russia or the USSR had more doctors in the world and currently Cuba has more doctors per capita they even made the technology that got us to space before we got to the moon so this whole idea that communists are anti intellectual is not at all true he also wants to go on that both MAGA and communists are based on revenge and this is entirely not true communists have dedicated themselves to liberating the workers that means everyone the 99% of people in the world from wage slavery and for over 150 years various different socialists and communists have dedicated themselves to civil rights and breaking down of hierarchies and using philosophy to analyze and explain the harm that these types of ideologies that we live with our problem so this guy is entirely stupid and he's just propagating anti communist rhetoric and he's a dumb Liberal that's pretty much it",

So Donald Trump was in real estate for 36 years and engaged in legal business practices that denied contractors payment and evicted African Americans. He bankrupted hotels, casinos, food brands, and airline. Had his university shut down due to fraud. Cheated on all three of his wives. Was a mediocre game show host for 14 seasons, is no longer allowed to operate a charity camp practice business in New York State for at least three years. Blew up our national deficit to over 27 trillion. Ignored a global pandemic that LED to the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans. And that is your chosen one. You have been called out by so many different people on this app so many different times that I'm trying to figure out if you're doing this on purpose, you're this misinformed, or if you just have a humiliation kink.",

Well, because we happen to live in America, and we don't have the burden of proof, and so there's not. That's not the point that should. That's a question that is a loaded question that should not be asked of a defense attorney or a defendant. The question that we asked the jury, and they ultimately obviously got passed, is why. Why the prosecution didn't call those witnesses. Right. You, as a defenser, you don't go into a case saying, um, I'm gonna fill the holes of the prosecution. Right? And. And Keith Schiller and.

And everyone that watches my videos knows that I don't take a Republican side, I don't take a Democrat side, I don't take a conspiracy theory side. I just take the side of common sense. And common sense tells me that this is insane. I mean, we're literally living in Sri Lanka at this point. This is what dictators do of third world countries to their political opponents. This is what Putin does. And if this exact same situation was happening to a Democrat right now, any Democrat, I would be saying the same thing. Because it's wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it's also entirely hypocritical, because people that were a part of this trial were saying that the voters of Donald Trump deserve to know this information before they voted for him in 2016, in 2020. So why don't the voters get to know about Hillary Clinton's 36,000 emails then? That's so hypocritical. Why didn't the voters get to know about Hunter Biden's laptop? Why didn't the voters get to know about hunter and Joe Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and what 10% for the big guy meant? And again, I'm trying to come out of a place of common sense here as an independent voter. I wanna know what Joe and Hunter's emails were about now. I wanna know what Hillary Clinton's emails were about now. As much as I wanna know about this Donald Trump shit. So you cannot say the voters deserve to know about this without saying the voters deserve to know about all of the other stuff that the Democrats also did. It's hypocritical.",

But they're gonna put up a 34 count felon to leave this country a fucking traitor. But let, let. Let's make one thing clear. This was not a hush money trial. Donald Trump has been convicted of fixing the election. Just like the Russia stuff. This is an example of how his presidency was illegitimate. It was stolen through illegal means. We all know this. Everything he did should be wiped off the board. All of those fucking judges, including on the Supreme Court, should be unseated. This is what should happen if this country had any sanity whatsoever. If this country had any sanity whatsoever, Donald Trump would be in prison and not threatening the health of our rights. So it's a good day. I mean, it's been a long time coming. We've been waiting for Donald Trump to be convicted of some sort of criminal activity for, it seems like, forever. But to me, it's certainly bittersweet because it doesn't take him off the chessboard, and it absolutely should. It remains to be seen what the political ramifications are for this, and so let's just take in this sweet victory and Recognize that this traitor is also now a felon. Right? I mean, the shit that's going on in Florida with Eileen Cannon is an embarrassment to anybody in the legal profession anywhere. Um, our legal system is a fucking joke still. But at least they got this one right. 34 count felony. Little Donnie the felon.",

So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date.",

During his speech, I watched a couple clips from his speech, if you can call it that, from his rally in the Bronx the other day, and he was talking about what's going on, um, inside the Gaza Strip in the Israeli government, and. And he said, they've got to get the hostages. They have to go get the hostages. Hostages have to be a priority. And then he said, and none of this ever would have happened if the 2020 election wasn't rigged. Was a rigged election, a stolen election. He didn't get animated talking about the return of Israeli hostages or what was going on inside the Gaza Strip. He only got animated and energized when he was talking about the 2020 election being rigged and stolen. He doesn't care about that. He cares about the 2020 election, and he knows. He knows it wasn't rigged. He knows it was not stolen. He knows that. He has known that since the beginning. He has known that since the beginning. But, yeah, his grievances are the only thing that matter to him. That his grievances matter to him more than his own children matter to him. Certainly more than his own supporters matter to him. He's disgusted by his own supporters. He thinks they're disgusting people. He wouldn't. He doesn't touch them. He doesn't shake hands. With his supporters ever? Not unless they've got a membership tomorrow Lago or are a billionaire donor. Those are the only supporters of his who he will touch. He doesn't. He's a politician who doesn't shake hands. He refuses to shake hands with his own supporters. He goes to these rallies and he stays as far away from these people in the crowd as he possibly can because they disgust him. He finds them to be disgusting people.",

We were all there, and we were all in DC for this conference featuring pearlmania, under the desk news, Khalil Green, consciously, jolly good ginger. I told y'all about that boy, Panda Lee. I told y'all about him. See? But y'all at one day folks will listen to me. So when you wonder why certain creators get on this app and they just pander to the point where it gets disgusting, and they're catering to a certain demographic, and they would that. That man stood 10 on their brick lady shit. And you can like, you can tell the things that they say and do, they really don't believe it. You gotta start asking yourself, why? Where is this coming from? Now, some people will look at the fact that those content creators were down at Capitol Hill because of some initiative. Why would Capitol Hill. Why would Democrats, Republicans? Why would these politicians put an initiative to garner support of influencers? And I said, don't. Don't go to conspiracy. Just ask yourself common sense questions. When influencers get their. The word influence, what does that mean? And just like the lobbyist do with politicians and put money in their pocket for lobbying their. Their thoughts and initiatives, right? Why would politicians then, in that term, become the quote unquote lobbyist to push narratives, beliefs, Topics and influence people through influencers on the very apps. I'm just saying, when you start asking the questions and just paying attention, just using comments. I said don't. You ain't gotta do no deep dive. You ain't gotta be a conspiracy theorist. Just ask yourself the common sense questions. It starts clicking. Cause these are all people that can sway and swoo and influence and get people to believe certain narratives, right? And y'all don't think they can be tools? Okay. So when you ask yourself why a lot of these topics and conversations just go and they repeat the cycle on these apps, you gotta ask yourself, who are the plants?",

I am not affected by your booze because I've seen what makes you cheer me. To take your criticism to heart, I'd first have to value your opinion. And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions. So if you wanna be mad at me, be mad at me. But if you want me to care, be somebody I respect first. Oh, and for all you haters keep jumping in my comments and giving me that algorithm boost.",

He argued for the unaliving of people who are mentally disabled. He said all of them should go. Take a look at the clip here. People. Yeah, I think people who are gonna hold humanity back, we should eliminate them. Can you define, like, hold humanity back? Yeah, people who have met an IQ standard that they cannot support humanity or support a normal job or are mentally disabled. What? He is calling for the unaliving of millions of people around the world, people in the United States, because they don't hit his definition of productive member of society. That is an abhorrent thing to say. That is the position of some of the worst leaders in history. Mustache Man from World War 2 comes to mind. And he said this multiple times during the live, not just when Chris and I were there, but when he was debating other people. People like Parker and Dean have posted videos about this. Listen, this is not politics. I know there are people out there who disagree with me, there are people out there who agree with me, but this is not politics. This is basic human rights. And there are people watching this video who, under his belief, should have their close family members and loved ones unalived. It's disgusting. It's abhorrent. Nobody should Be saying things like that, especially a large creator like himself. So if you were watching that live, I'm sorry you had to witness that, but we are better than this as Americans. And I don't care your ideology. We are better than this.",

There is only the perpetuation, however flawed and feeble you might perceive it, of our fragile 249 year old experiment. Or the entropy that will engulf and destroy us if we take the other route. When, as Mercy Otis Warren would say, the checks of conscience are thrown aside and a deformed picture of the soul is revealed. The presumptive Republican nominee is the opioid of all opioids. An easy cure for what some believe is the solution to our myriad pains and problems. When in fact, with him, you end up re enslaved with an even bigger problem. A worse affliction and addiction a bigger delusion. James Baldwin would say, the author and finisher of our national existence, our national suicide. As Mr. Lincoln prophecies. Do not be seduced by easy equalization. There is nothing equal about this equation. We are at an existential crossroads in our political and civic lives. This is a choice that could not be clearer.",

See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome.",

Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights.

And nobody believes defendants who testify on their own behalf, because why would they? Big brothers. Literally no positives whatsoever. However, there are a million fucking negatives.

I think there's an overwhelming chance of a conviction, a significant but much smaller chance of a hung jury, and zero chance of an acquittal. Why? Because they built a very strong circumstantial case. They built a building out of a series of bricks that really couldn't be crossed. And that circumstantial case, least in my experience, having tried a lot of cases, is very, very powerful with the jury. But my gut tells me, and had a lot of experience, that they'll be impressed with the way in which the prosecution connected it to broader themes, to an election, to the Trump's need, according to the proof, to suppress information, to conceal it from the voters. That kind of stuff rings loud, I think, in the minds of public spirit and citizens. And when you're on a jury, public spirit just flows through you. So that's why I think it's more likely than not to be a conviction.",

You know, in the New York City trial, your defense rested its case without you taking the stand. You know, you said you would absolutely testify. Why did you decide ultimately not to take the stand? Was that a hard decision for you? Yeah, because he made rulings that makes it very difficult to testify. Anything I did, anything I did in the past, I can bring everything up. Then, you know what? I've had a great past, but anything but the other thing is, and the main reason, and I don't even mind that effect, I like talking about it, because we had rigged cases. New York is out of control, and they can solve it with a good appellant. You know, we won in the Angoran case, who he doesn't know anything about what he's doing and he's totally corrupt. That's a different case. We had that overturned. We had decisions overturned five times. I think it's a. Yeah. None of that is true. Not a single word. The judge in the criminal case against Donald Trump did not make any rulings to make it difficult for him to testify. The judge ruled that prosecutors could ask Donald Trump about a variety of things, and Donald Trump simply did not wanna answer those questions. He also claimed that He beat Judge Edgarron five times in the civil fraud suit against him in New York City, which is also not true. I don't know where he's getting this stuff. He's completely making it up. Donald Trump didn't testify because he's a coward. He's scared. He doesn't wanna answer questions under oath. He doesn't wanna answer tough questions from prosecutors. Instead, he wants to sit in court, fall asleep, then leave, go lie to the media about the case, and then go home and play golf at Mar a Lago. That's all he wants to do.",

This is absolutely not normal, completely out of the mainstream, but something that a lot of Republicans have fantasized about doing. Immediately there was enormous push back, as well there should have been. Donald Trump went to truth social to post the truth, saying that he didn't actually wanna limit contraception and that this had been a democratic lie. But we have video of him saying that he wanted to limit contraception or at the very least kick it back to the states. This is so out of the mainstream, and more importantly, it's wildly unpopular with voters. Remember, the right is pushing this idea that a fertilized egg is a person. And that will trickle down to stopping the birth control pill, making that illegal, making the morning after pill illegal.

He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today.",

We go to church and there's a priest. We go to work and there's a boss. So everywhere we're being conditioned to be told what to do. And so when times get scared, fascism always rises. If you notice, when technology spikes, when communicative technology spikes, right? The radio and the television movie specifically, like triumph of the will drove the Mustache Man and gerbils and. And propelled those guys in Germany to power, right? And. And there's a couple reasons for this. Number one, the world. You see more of the world, right? So the internet comes and we're starting to see all over the world, okay? People get scared. They see their power waning, that the. The barbarians are at the gate. They see all of these other cultures. And certain people are trained to. To be model culturalists. And the introduction of other cultures into their. Into their understanding makes them scared and wanna protect their power, protect their culture. And in order to do so, they turn to a strong man leader. But. But it's about fear and our conditioning and the fact that we're all created to be bootlickers. We're all trained to Look up at authority. What does that do? It creates authoritarianism. So everywhere, look. Think of Christianity. Christianity is a fascist religious template. There is an all powerful strong man, god, who you can't talk shit about. You can't take his name in vain. You can't have any other religions. It's a monotheistic, monocultural religious template. And it conditions people for fascism. If you don't follow the leader, you burn in hell. Let god sort it out, as they say. And so it. It. It. It is just human nature to look to somebody else to solve our problems when. When. When we're. When we're scared, I guess. Or at least western civilizations, nature is. Is. Is. Is a liquor in search of a boot. Basically, that. That. That's what we're conditioned for.

Hey, George. Good morning to you. It is normal, of course, for presidential candidates to share videos with their vision for the country. It is not normal for those videos to have references to Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler. Trump campaign tells us this morning that this was a video that was shared by a staffer while the former president was in court, saying that staffer missed the reference, but as of this morning that video has not been taken down. Former President Donald Trump sparking backlash this morning after a video posted to his social media account seemingly suggest there will be a unified Reich if he wins the 2024 election. Donald Trump wins what's next for America? Those words are largely associated with Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, another name for his Nazi regime. The 30 second video features hypothetical newspaper articles of Trump celebrating a victory in November, that phrase appearing three times, including under the headline what's next for America? It includes references to World War One signing, German industrial strength and peace through strength, another headline suggesting Trump would reject globalist, the phrase often used by the far right as an anti Semitic slur.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the Liberal left tells you to follow the science. Okay, well, did you know you can scientifically prove this statement? Liberalism is a mental disorder? Yeah, see, 75% of a human brain mass is made up of a substance called myelom. Myelom is 100% made up of cholesterol. Now it's funny cause alzheimer's didn't exist before 1979. Which is funny, cause if you look right prior to 1979, you saw this big push during the 70s to tell you that cholesterol was bad. We didn't need cholesterol, we needed to get it out of our system. It's weird too, because that's when we started to see products like margarine and other things come onto the market to replace butter because they were low cholesterol or no cholesterol alternatives, and they're literally one molecule away from being plastic. We saw this massive rise in vegetarianism and veganism and we went from first finding alzheimer's in 1979 to today, in 2024, Alzheimer's being one of the leading causes of death in the western civilization, which is a neurological disorder, degenerative, where you kill brain cells. Now, where do we see veganism and vegetarianism where they tell you you don't need to eat animals, when in fact you do, cause that cholesterol that you need to keep those brain cells is in the animals and animal fats and butters that you eat. It's not in the vegetables that you eat that are devoid of cholesterol. So we can scientifically show that back In the 70s, to be called a Liberal was a negative thing for a Democrat to now liberalism is taken over the Democrat Party. And according to studies coming out of the psychological world, people who identify as Liberal have a higher instance of mental disorder. That's scientifically proven. Again, so we can definitively prove that liberalism is a mental disorder because you're devoid of cholesterol and you're losing brain cells.",

It seems like he had a bit of an emergency there or something like this. Reminded me of the time that Mitch McConnell froze in the podium, and I disagree with Mitch McConnell, but I'm thankful that he's okay. That looks very similar to me. He looked confused. He didn't really know where he was or what he was saying. I think this is incredibly concerning. Like, Donald Trump's ability to serve is certainly in question. He's stumbling over his words. He's falling asleep every single day in court, and he's doing stuff like this at his rallies. It's just happening far too often. So I don't know.

    "voice_to_text": "here's what's going on with the TikTok lawsuits in my meeting with John Kirby at the White House getting a one on one interview with John Kirby is something that most journalists would kill for and we were able to get it because of the power of TikTok now in the beginning I think he thought he was gonna be able to convince me that there were security implications that meant that I should support a ban but I was able to turn it around pretty quickly I talked about the people on this app because that's the part I think the White House is missing and banning TikTok would result in an economic apocalypse among other things I told them you have to understand and have some compassion for the fact that there are millions of people on this app that make 200 400 dollars a month but that's rent that's diapers that's food on their table it's not just about the big creators who could go somewhere else a ban on TikTok he's a former admiral would also directly affect our military readiness and reenlistment I met with military families back in September who said that TikTok changed their lives because the number one most unemployable demographic is military spouses but thanks to TikTok they've been able to become influencers or sell on TikTok Shop start small businesses that they could advertise here and do e commerce in addition to the work it also affects people's livelihoods TikTok is this place where you see something funny and you can send it to someone it makes you feel connected when you're away and so for many of our military families TikTok is something that makes them feel connected it's also a great benefit to their children who are able to meet other people like them and make friends off base or if they know they're gonna be moving start talking to kids from that area a ban on TikTok directly affects reenlistment and military readiness I also talked about for the people who don't even make any money on here this is a place that makes you believe in yourself there are folks who make like 41 cents I remember the first dollar I made on TikTok for a video that's what gave me the confidence to make another one to feel like I don't know maybe I can do this maybe maybe I am worth something you can't take that away from people when you don't have anything to replace it with not just the heart of the nation that is beating well here on TikTok but our connectivity and also our economic opportunities I also told him that I thought that the White House was showing a grave lack of compassion when it comes to talking about TikTok in the ban having President Biden hopping on a helicopter going yeah I'll sign it I I'll sign it I support a ban on TikTok stuff like that's gonna cost him the election in addition to a million other things he's doing that people don't like but stuff like that comes off just so bad and just heartless and uncompassionate I do believe that John Kirby actually listened to the things I had to say and was surprised by many of them now whether he takes action on them or not that's step two step one was getting in the door but I've been an advocate for a long time and I've taken White House meetings with people who were far less fun than John Kirby okay this is me at Trump's White House meeting Betsy Devos begging her to not cancel the food relief program that I was doing with kids in Detroit this is what I do this is my job I've been at it for a long time and dare I say I am very good at it when I believe in something I believe all the way and I will go to the wall for it I was there day one of the trials when they started trying to ban TikTok and I will be here with you to the very end I will continue to fight as I know you will as well because you are and TikTok themselves has filed a lawsuit so I've got the two lawsuits right now that I have a lot of faith in will protect us from a ban first up the TikTok corporate suit TikTok corporate has asked the court to issue a declaratory judgment saying that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act violates the Constitution and wants the court to issue an order that would stop Attorney General Merrick Garland from enforcing it and they claim that this act violates the Constitution in a couple ways first something called fire sale takings the government is forcing TikTok to try and sell this application for less than it's worth faster than it's possible the second is on Fifth Amendment grounds TikTok is being treated different than other applications even than other adversary owned applications TikTok is also suing for First Amendment violations not just of creator speech that would be affected but the fact that TikTok itself the company has speech thanks to Citizens United companies are people and money is speech and TikTok is a person using money as a form of speech they also have channels for which they distribute information and express themselves on as a company that is protected under the First Amendment lastly there's this thing called bills of attainer and those are unconstitutional in the United States Congress cannot make a Bill that convicts somebody of a crime without a trial so they're saying Congress essentially forcing this divestment is accusing TikTok of being unsafe to national security but never allowed them the trial to prove that and so thereby is violating Article 1 Section 9 and Article 1 Section 10 of the US Constitution furthermore if Congress can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down then how could this be used in the future in an even worse way TikTok also saying that it is impossible to move the apps underlying coding to a new owner it could take years for engineers to familiarize themselves with the code to develop and maintain the platform in addition the engineers would still need to access ByteDance software to keep TikTok functioning which this new law prohibits TikTok has invested $2 billion in security protocols sometimes called Project Texas and even given the government a kill switch to poll that would immediately pull the plug on the app if TikTok violated certain promises regarding security so TikTok's gonna try to prove that they have put $2 billion into shoring up security and that they'll even give Congress an automatic kill switch if by some chance some national security had been breached and they're gonna say that should be good enough because no other platform is doing the same thing no other platform has put that much effort into security now let's talk about the creator lawsuit eight creators are being represented by Davis Wright Tremaine a firm in Seattle known for its cases involving First Amendment and media law this is the same group of lawyers that was able to overturn the TikTok ban in Montana and that also got Trump's attempt to ban TikTok overturned their suit focuses on the fact that TikTok is uniquely different from other applications and that you do not need to provide a bunch of personal data to make your profile or to view content and the content you are served does not leverage understanding your in real life friends and family for connection but rather offers you a for you page and that success on TikTok is not easily replicated on other social media platforms proving that it is uniquely successful for speech they're claiming that TikTok's defining traits stem from the editorial decisions it makes using its proprietary content recommendation technology TikTok would no longer be TikTok without that technology and these creators along with the other hundred and seventy million people who create or view or comment on content on this app would similarly have their First Amendment rights violated if there were changes made or if there was a forced divestment I'm very confident in those two lawsuits meaning that TikTok is sticking around for a long time I'm also very hopeful that in addition to these lawsuits my conversation with John Kirby will be heard and will be considered because the lack of compassion that the White House and Biden in particular has shown towards tiktokers is in my opinion unacceptable in addition things like that continue to chip away at any lead Biden might have in this presidential election and it is his job to earn votes actions like this and being rude or dismissive of tiktokers is not going to help earn votes it is not my job to soften President Biden to tiktokers or to whip votes for the Democrats it is his job to do that which is why to this point I haven't said who I'm voting for or who you should vote for simply that the Electoral College doesn't allow us to really access a third party candidate even when Ross Perrow won 19% of the vote back in the 90s he didn't make any electoral advances he didn't get one state in the Electoral College Biden and Trump have 3 4 months to make their case on why they should be the president I'm gonna be looking at who they're putting in their cabinets what their policies look like but I'm also going to be looking at things like are you in touch with the heart of this nation are you listening to people and then we'll make up our minds in November right um in personal news I'm gonna be taking a couple days off of TikTok I'm still working but um we had a little bit of a family emergency with some medical stuff with my dad this morning and I need to be present for that so I'm not gonna be making Tik Toks probably at at least for the next day or two um so if you pray or if you have good vibes please send them our way um and I will be back as soon as I can be clear headed and present with you guys here and know that he's safe and taken care of okay I love you I trust you make good decisions",

And I keep getting the question, what caused Generation X to finally wake up from their slumber? And the thing is, that's not an easy question to answer. Because each of us woke up on our own timeline, each of us decided that we wanted to start paying closer attention to what was happening in the world around us. You see, we poured our blood, our sweat, and our tears, and we've had to fight for everything that we have in life. And many of us are starting to watch that slip through our fingertips because the ruling radical elites in Washington, DC and in the media and the celebrity class have decided that what's ours is theirs. Well, we've decided that we're taking it back. So I could go through a whole host of events, of single issues that have occurred over the last several decades that have caused each individual to wake up on their own time frame. But there's one thing, one thing that's occurred over the last couple of years that I think if I had to put my finger on, this is what's caused Generation X to wake up.",

You know, this is one of the most closely watched counties here in the key battleground state of Georgia, so it seems like the perfect place to come out and talk to Republican voters and see all of the coverage, all of the things that we're talking about. This New York hush money trial, how was it impacting them down here? So I spoke with about five different Republicans, and they represent a very wide cross action, a very diverse group of Republican voters here in this county. And I asked them, how are they being impacted by this trial? Are they paying close attention? And what impact might a guilty verdict have on their decision to support the former president? Here's what they told me. Take a look. Do each of you support Donald Trump? I do. Yes. Yes, yes. For all three of you, has this trial changed your opinion, even caused you to wave or question that at all? No, it's, um, actually caused me to support him more. Um, I. I just don't believe there's a coincidence that, uh, we have a trial happening in Atlanta, uh, we have one happening in New York. So the question people are beginning to ask themselves, like, ideas like, why now? It's pretty much everybody says they're picking on him. You know, people are tired of going after him. And you sit in so many areas, it's really not a big issue in the party. Actually, they're really making everybody mad and they look at a big bully and the government is a bully. This is gonna be your first time casting a ballot. Um, what is it for you that drives your support of the former president? Um, thing. Always fighting me, taking so much just defence from news and everything. But he still hasn't given up. He just. He keeps fighting to do his right. I've talked to many people who formally identified as a Democrat. They have changed their political persuasion to independent and they are looking forward to voting for Trump because now they find something in common with a political candidate at that level. When you say they find commonality, what. What is that commonality? They. They have felt persecuted by the system of American injustice and it's not a a stretch for them to think that Trump may be a victim as well. People see that there's. There's some kind of commonality between himself and maybe all the black men that have been incarcerated in the families that have been impacted by black male incarceration.",

I think she just posted a video just to post it. Well this slow whatever momentum she has, probably the WWE has to do some damage control. But it was an accident.

We're all getting phone calls right now. Baby girl with the pink hair. I don't know what you're doing. I mean, I think it's a great thing, because I've been waiting forever for the rest of the Gen Xers, and if you are here right now, time to check in. Technically, I am a baby Gen X. I'm the youngest Gen X in 1980. And supposedly I'm, like, a cusper, because I'm, like, in this weird little gap of, like, five years and a millennial cusper or something like that. So I have, like, the older generation millennial traits and then, like, the younger generational X traits. I don't know. Look, I'm here for all of it. We're the Goonies generation. We knew how to handle grown adults, like the fertelities at the age of, like, seven. Okay? Nothing that's going on right now scares us. You little videos don't scare us. We used to watch the gremlins when we were five. The kids from Stranger Things. That's us. You see them? Scared to fight a Demogorgon? Nah. No, neither are we. We are the ones that will literally just run into a dark alley. We don't care. We will just do. That's what we do. We were taught never to start a fight, but to finish it through shows, movies, our Parents. That's what we were taught. Be for real. Right now. If it's gonna be anybody, it's gonna be us. We don't have organized lists of what we do. We just do. And that should scare a lot of people. We just do. We watch as well, which is something you got to be careful about. I saw somebody tonight talking about how Gen X is literally Beth Dutton and rip combined. That's it. That's all you need to know. That's all you need to know about. About us.

Failure doesn't bother us that much. All we ever wanted in life was to find stasis. Just a nice, calm, balanced existence. And we were able to eke that out for quite a long time. We were well enough to be left alone and leave everyone else alone. But the last few years, we've seen it right in front of everyone's faces. They fucked with everything. And they're doing it on purpose, and they're doing it out loud. And it fucked with our stasis. And now we have no choice but to come out and get shitty about it. That's the answer. And before you add me, you can shove your red team, blue team nonsense right up your ass. Look, none of that matters. They don't care about you. Everything they tell you is a lie. Every promise they give you is empty. My entire life they've been running on these vapid, empty promises. You know, free college, student debt relief, universal healthcare, codifying reverse Wade. Look, they don't actually wanna do any of these things. You know why? Because if they get it done, they can't run on it anymore. That's a fucking lie, and we're sick of it. They fucked with our money. They pretend like money is real. It's not. It's not based on Anything, it's fucking fake. And we all know that. The whole game is a fucking weirdo game of monopoly that they do just to keep us surfs. And we were actually well enough just to ignore all that as long as we had stasis. But now they've made it impossible to just survive comfortably on a reasonable amount of effort. We're not here for that. So that's why we're pissed. And for those of y'all confused, you know, asking, what is this movement? What. What are your plans? You know, words like movement and plans and all that stuff, it's not really our thing. Look, the plan is to be actively disruptive. To be such a goddamn inconvenience to everybody that's inconveniencing us. They could. We can find something close to the status quo, but I think that ship is sailed. We are ready to watch it all fall apart and build something better from the fucking ashes. I know it sounds scary. We're all gonna have to give up a lot of shit that we like, but we just don't have access to that shit anymore anyway. So let's fucking party.",

If you are not responsible enough to have a kid, then why are you having intercourse with anyone? So that means that in the spirit of equal treatment, one must be in favor of women who are not ready to have children getting hysterectomies, right? You should be practicing abstinence.

Everything from hot dogs to Hannibal Lecter to Jimmy Connor. That the tennis star. I don't know what the fuck he was talking about there, but you know, I can see that the US all jumping off the Trump train. The support is going way down for the guy because it's just too much bullshit and America is sick of the fucking lies and trying to inflate rally numbers. No, I don't care. You wanna do that and make yourselves feel better, fine. But it's a blatant fucking lie. Because I don't know if you noticed, but we do have technology now that we can take actual photos and videos and see what the fuck is going on in the world. Yeah, I'm gonna post a photo here of a, an aerial shot somebody took off a plane window showing the size. And believe me, this is not 100,000 people. So there you go. So I am grateful to all my friends and followers out there with common sense, no right from wrong, uh, truth and reality from lies and bullshit. I appreciate it. Thank you for your great comments and just have A common sense and loving your country. Not smearing shit on the halls of the US fucking capital. Like we all know how that happened. They were not tourists. But I'm not gonna go into that. And all you mega trolls. Just so you know, I am on the delete and block programmer. Thank you Johnny, for well, bring me into that. Yeah, cause it's a lot, lot better. Really cleans things up. Cause I look at their pages before I block them and awful lot of pervy pictures of uh, young girls and stuff. These guys and they're all. I think the most one I seen had like uh, 237 followers. Yeah, they're all a bunch of fools, maggots. You're all scared. You're scared of people that are different than you. And what does that do? That leads to hate. And well, there you have it. And you follow this orange fuck nugget and listen. Anything he says is our last. God bless you. So get some help.

I believe in freedom and free speech and. And following your dreams. But I can tell you right now what you're not gonna do. Send me messages, trying to bully me into being part of Donald Trump's gang. I'm not MAGA. I don't support that. The Gen X follow train is people from our generation getting together, following each other, so that we all get enough supporters, followers, views, likes that we can all make money, too, and we can use our voices to be heard. And if you have hashtags that have secret meanings about operations you're doing on behalf Of Donald Trump, that's fine. But when we find out that you're using us and recruiting a secretly, we're gonna reject it. If we don't believe in it, every politician, celebrity, and millionaire CEO is part of the problem.

He also criticized abortion and President Biden, saying to women specifically I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage, are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get?

Is all that transgender and the books they keep on the shelves and the libraries and absolutely the lack of control by the parents. Parents should have access to the curriculum. They should have open communication with teachers. They should. There should be a website, a school board website, where you could look up and see exactly what your kids are being taught. Absolutely, 100%. If you wanna be a cat, you need a litter box. And I mean, hey, you. You are two sexes. Either you one or the other. They need to get rid of the. All the programs they're putting in there, the critical race theory and all the, um, identity gender stuff. All of that garbage needs to go away. When things are not in line with what the Bible says, they're wrong. Do we need god back in school? You know what they're teaching kids? You can say what you wanna say. Uh, I'm a guy or I'm A girl. They can't teach curriculum instead of teaching idealism. Then I don't need need to be on our campuses. Okay. Yeah, no, we definitely don't want idealism. I have biracial. Hmm. Grandchildren, so. Okay. It's a bigger issue. They are grooming people to hate our country. What would you say is kind of scariest? Transitioning kids. There's something on X that everyone can follow.

Scientists are now warning that there's a giant invasive juro spider with 6 foot webs that could be poised to take over US cities. So fun. Thank you. If you don't know what a Zorro spider is, they're basically a species of orb weaving spiders, which is a group known for creating highly symmetrical circular webs. Cute. Also saying that your host spiders can build unique webs that could be more than 6 feet long and appear golden when they reflect sunlight. Okay, just to make this a little bit better for you, whenever the eggs hatch in spring, the baby spiders create parachute like webs that enable them to fly up to 100 miles away from where they were born. Doro spiders are actually supposed to be in Asia, but they were recently found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Then by the way, experts are believing that these invasive individuals were accidentally brought to the US inside a shipping container. So as of right now, these spiders have been spotted in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. And they've also been spotted in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Look at this, and you should go out and check it out. But we have a corrupt judge, and we have a judges highly conflicted, and he's keeping me from campaigning. He's an appointed New York judge. He's appointed patients. He's appointed. He's a scared. Every single legal analyst, even CNN, even MSDNC, they're saying there's no case here, thank you very much. I think this makes Donald Trump look terrible in the eyes of the jury. They go home every day and probably watch the news, and when they see that, they know that's what a guilty man sounds like. And PS, this is definitely a violation of Donald Trump's gag order, and he should be charged for it.",

No. No, we will not. And after seeing this, I have come to a conclusion. That conclusion being that society is actually devolving at a more rapid rate than I first had anticipated it that it would. Because there are actually individuals out there announcing to the entire world how delicate they truly are and have a definite lack of internal fortitude and do not even have the strength to deal with the opinions of others that they disagree with. Just imagine the type of society in which people actually have to watch their words so carefully and have to live in such fear of offending another person.

And nevertheless, we have a horrible gag order. That should be allowed. Has never been on. Nothing like this has ever happened. With your witnessing. Is the first to have some articles that came out this morning. Jonathan Gerley. The predominant question in the Manhattan Huyshmani trial of former President Donald Trump is not one of guilt, but something far more basic. Is the District Attorney Alvin Braggs case a joke? Is it a prank? Is it a farce? On Thursday, the edges became clear. It's all of the above, but it's also an abominable abuse of our justice system and a wretched assault on the rule of law. As John has been. Charlie. And it just goes on and finishes. Although it's a long story. That's, uh, brutal about this case. This case is highly unconstitutional. It's presided over by a very conflicted judge. Conflicted like I've never seen before. He refuses to take himself off the case, and it should be a miss trial. Their objective, of course, was to humiliate Smeer Trump with a gossiping tale of sex. That had nothing to do with the criminal judges. That issue had not. Wow. What happened? Oh, so this is how You're going in today after you heard the news that Michael Cohen is going to be testified. Haha! Oh, this has everything to do with what Stormy Daniel said. Damn!

    "voice_to_text": "In 2018, Donald Trump traveled to the village of Mount Pleasant in Racine, Wisconsin, where he used a literal golden shovel to break ground on what he said would be the eighth wonder of the world. The project Trump was touting was a deal with the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn. Foxconn promised they would build a massive LCD screen manufacturing plant, investing $10 billion of their own money to do so and creating what they and Trump touted would be 13,000 jobs. In exchange, the state government of Wisconsin was prepared to give Fox Con $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives, which, if paid out, would have been the largest tax incentive given to a foreign company in US history. With the promise of that many jobs, the local government of Mount Pleasant practically destroyed itself trying to make this plant a reality. To make the plant possible, Mount Pleasant has ended up borrowing money to buy up land. Mount Pleasant is on track to spend close to $900 million in land acquisition and infrastructure. That's 38 times our annual budget. To clear room for the giant factory. The local government spent so much money buying up that land that the town itself had its credit rating downgraded. 100 homes and farms were bulldozed to make room for this plant. This is Prairie View Drive, and this road here used to lead into an entire neighborhood of houses. The Foxconn's building, they've been cleared out. Those residents are now asking, was it worth it? Kim Mahoney is One of them, she built her custom home in this subdivision with a dozen neighbors. The whole process has been somewhat of a nightmare. Now Mahones is the last house standing. Her neighbors took offers from the village government to move out and raise their homes. She says she received a low ball appraisal, so she stood her ground. I think this whole project was a scam. There's a real fear that we have been taken for a ride. Our only hope is that they build something. Unfortunately, the residents of Wisconsin were taken for a ride. Foxcon did build a small factory in racing, but it only employs about 1,000 people. The massive 20 million foot factory with 13,000 jobs never materialized. But today, six years after getting sold a Bill of goods by Donald Trump and his Golden Shovel Racing, Wisconsin got a new deal. Foxcon turned out to be just that, a con. Today, President Biden was in Racine to announce a 3.3 billion dollar investment by Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence data center in Racine. Project is expected to create more than 2,000 union construction jobs and another 2,000 permanent data center jobs. Jobs for which Microsoft is partnering with local technical colleges to train the local workforce. And this new data center will be built on the same land that locals cleared for Donald Trump's Foxcon plant. President Biden is quite literally fixing Donald Trump's broken promises. The question now is, will voters notice?",

All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this. Do you want it to still be the house of the people, or do you want it to be only wealthy people? I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments. I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment. I think it should at least keep up with inflation. It.

Yes, she's holding her own, and the lawyers are trying to discredit her. But here's the important factor. Whether they discredit her or not, the fact remains the crime is this. He paid her to keep her mouth shut. He identified that as a legal fee. That is fraud. And there in lies the problem for Donald Trump and his legal team. Donald Trump wants to try to prove that it never had an affair with Stormy Daniels. Well, the fact is he did, and the evidence is there. But that's not even the basis of the crime. He should be looking at the crime and trying to prove that he didn't commit fraud. It's gonna be hard, cause he did commit fucking fraud. I'm loving this. The cross examination is going to be entertaining when we hear all the facts and information about it. But remember that the prosecution team has a chance for redirect after the cross examination. They'll be wrapping some shit up, and Stormy Daniels will have done her job. Putting Donald Trump in his place. And all the while embarrassing that motherfucker all day long. Again. I love this.",

What is it going to be about? And it turns out the signature piece of legislation for the extreme MAGA Republicans this week, this month, this year is Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. This is what we are dealing with on this magical house floor with all of the challenges that the American people are confronting. Liberty for laundry, defending the dignity of dishwashers, fighting for freedom of refrigerators. This is what we doing. The Bill is cool. It's the Hands Off our Home Appliances Act. The motion reconsider. It's passed on the table. Boom. It passed. Vote 2 12 to 1 95. This is what the Republicans have done this year. The Bill would require the department of energy to consider cost effectiveness of various new efficiency requirements on appliances. This is anti environment. They took swipes at Biden for wanting to save Mother Earth, and Jeffries was not pleased.",

It's because the United States government has created different assets for different classes of people. And when it comes to hedge funds, middle class doesn't get to participate. She. To join a hedge fund, not only do you have to outperform 4:01 K's and make more than $200,000 a year and also have $1 million, you also have to be a classless piece of shit. Thankfully, you don't have to do any of that to be part of the MCU. Oh, for that, all you gotta do is click the link in the bio, fill in a little information, and then when we launch, which is only 48 hours from now, by the way, just gotta be one of the first 40,000 people to sign up. Now, fair warning, we have more than 70,000 people already signed up for alerts, so I am not in any way going to guarantee that you can get into that initial 40,000. If you're not registered for alerts, I can pretty much guarantee you're not. Now, I know some of you have a ton of questions, and we've done a ton of lives trying to answer those questions, but we're still gonna have one more tomorrow night before we launch. If there's anything keeping you from joining, make sure you attend that. Then I'll see you in the MCU.",

Going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sentence. The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. This gag order. He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order. But again, understanding the gravity of that situation and really what it would go into and making that decision happen.",

I expect President Trump to win the next election. I'm not gonna ask you answer your hypothetical question when, in fact. Yeah. Tim Scott was asked six times if he would accept the election results in 2024, and every single time, he danced around it. Would not give a straight answer. The obvious answer to the question is yes. Yes, of course we will accept the election results. Joe Biden would say yes. Every major Democrat would say yes. Except the MAGA Republicans want to continue their attacks on our democracy and say, well, you know what? We'll have to see. So they can plunge us into more chaos. Republicans like Donald Trump and Tim Scott, who's auditioning to be Donald Trump's vice president, are already laying the foundation to challenge the results in 2024. They answered this question in the same way in 2016, in 2020, and now in 2024. It is so abundantly clear that these MAGA Republicans don't care about our democracy. They never have, they never will. We must keep them out of office.",

A couple weeks ago, we won a big lawsuit in the state of Pennsylvania. They wanted to take off dates from mail in ballots. Of course, the Democrats, in an effort to make it easier to cheat.

Okay, how many of you had Mark Hammer will lead the press briefing on your bingo card hands? Yeah, me either. And, look, I just got to meet the president. He gave me these aviator glasses. I love the merch. Love it all. But, listen, I just wanted to say I was honored to be asked to come to the White House, uh, to meet the president. The most legislative, successful president in my lifetime. And, you know, I don't have to go through the list of bipartisan infrastructure law, the PACT act, the chip sacks, all that inflation. 15 million jobs looking. It's all good. I mean, I was really thrilled to meet the entire staff, because, you know, it's not just one person. It's like a composite endeavor. And all these people, my goodness, you know? I mean, I have no idea. I had no idea just what went into what is on his plate on a daily basis. So that's pretty much it. I'm open to questions, although no Star Wars questions, please. But I want to say once again how grateful I am, and it just shows You. That one person can be so influential and so positive in our lives. And again, thank you so much. And Peter Baker, I loved your book. Yes. Wow. Thank you for being here. What did you ask? What did you talk about with the president? Well, first of all, I only expected to be there for, like, five minutes. He showed us all his photographs, and, you know, it was really amazing to me, cause, you know, I was. I was invited to the Carter White House, and I came, and then I came to the Obama White House, but I never was invited into the Oval Office. And it was a large gathering, so this one was really extra special. All right, so, yes, I'm. We have Star Wars to sir. Well, you know, I called him Mr. President. He said, you can call me Joe. And I said, can I call you Joby Wan Kenobi? He like that. But listen, I'm not really here to dominate. I have to turn it back over to our wonderful press secretary, Korean Sean Pierre.

The unipartey is make Ukraine great again. The unipartey is all about funding every single foreign war. They think this is the business model that needs to be done. There you go. Why is she doing with this, you ask? She hates Mike Johnson, quite obviously. And the Democrats have said when Marjorine calls for the motion to vacate, that's what this is all about. As if this weekend Congress, as if the hundred 18th Congress hasn't been a complete show, Marjorie is gonna call for the motion to vacate and make it privileged next week. She said people need to think about it over the weekend, what they're going to do. She said before upcoming elections, the Republican voters need to see whether these Republicans will side with Hakeem Jeffries at the Yuna party or with her. Because Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats have said if she tries to oust Johnson, they will try to table the motion to save him. I think the American people need to see a recorded vote of do they. Does Congress. Does the members of Congress support the unipartee? Is this what they support? I think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may. And so next week, I am gonna be calling this motion to vacate. Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again, having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative. I think that'll play well. I'm excited about it.",

    "voice_to_text": "My generation has never lived in a world without mass shootings or a world that's not getting hotter and hotter by the second. This is not the reality we chose for ourselves or the future that we want for the next generation. But the truth is, we're the ones who have to deal with a broken system we didn't create. We're. Our reproductive freedoms are under attack, and we struggle. We struggle and we struggle to afford housing, healthcare and Equality, education. And if we're gonna stand a chance at solving these issues, and we've got to remove the Republicans. Republicans, Republicans who are standing in the way and replace them with Democrats who will fight. Fight for our future. So this summer, we're not taking no for an answer. We're going on a tour. Going on a tour across the country, stopping in Republican health districts to flip them blue. Flipping these seats blue is key to fixing our future, and yours, too. Simply put, Republicans don't care. Don't care about our voices or our lives. And as we speak, they're coming for each and every one of our freedoms and blocking. Blocking all progress. But when we win, we can finally turn ideas into action and movements into policy. But it won't be easy. Won't be easy. It's gonna take every single one of us, no matter your generation. Yes, that includes you. You, you, you! That includes you. So please visit tour to save democracy.com to learn How you can get involved and help us build a movement.",

House Republicans put out a notice yesterday what those bills would include. Let me just give you a sampling, Mr. Speaker. The Refrigerator Freedom Act, the Hands Off our Home Appliances Act. The Clothes Dryers Reliability Act. And maybe my favourite, the Liberty in Laundry Act. Liberty in laundry act. So while I appreciate the gentlemen from Wisconsins very passionate defensive liberty, I'm not so sure the American people had that in mind. I don't think they're thinking of the Liberty and Laundry Act. I think they expect this House Republican majority to actually address the consequential challenges that face our country.",

Used to, they could get these medical procedures done and, um, and kind of hide the. The fact of what had happened to them because it really ain't none of nobody else's business. Well, now it is, huh? We did that. See, I know that we don't really know a whole hell of a lot about how government works for really to give two shits about what policies are anything like that. We're on the Trump train because it just pisses off those liberals, and we just love that. That's what it's all about, right? That's what it's all about. But look what we're doing to people. Little teenage girls being forced to carry their rapist child. Hmm? Hmm. But you'd feel different if it was your little girl, wouldn't you? Hmm? Um, also, uh, uh, these same red states are forcing women to carry eptopic pregnancies, uh, you know, once. It's gonna unalive them if they care in the term. Yeah. Uh, the law in those red states says Uh, tough shit. You're gonna carry it anyway, regardless of the consequences. Yeah, we did that. That blood is on our hands, MAGA. And also, uh, if a woman becomes pregnant with a baby that, um, has a certain disorders that, uh, whenever it's, uh, delivered, it's just gonna lay there and it's gonna unalive and excruciatingly painful. Unaliving? It's the best outcome. And by the way, the mother may never be able to bear another child again because of it. We did that, MAGA. All for owning the lives, right? We're doing that just to own the lives. Pretty sick bunch of people, ain't we? Maybe we should start caring about things that matter, MAGA. Maybe we should educate ourselves. This isn't a big giant game of owning the libs. What we're actually doing is destroying our democracy over ignorance and ruining lives all over this country. Inmate Trump, 2024.",

We know it's not for the people, by the people. It's just not. What it is in this country is an experiment. Self government. And if we could do it all over again, I would say the most important thing is to have laws in place to keep money out of politics and to make it a heinous crime for someone to influence laws and. And policy based entirely on the amount of profit it could generate for a party or for a company that is investing in a candidate. That's fucking incredibly dangerous. And it's corrupt. And that corruption has been accepted. We've just accepted that it's. This corruption exists.",

Weeks before she was sworn in, Boebert was in direct communication with senior White House officials planning to decertify President Biden\u2019s victory. And one of the first votes Boebert cast in Congress was to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election. We can't allow Republicans to hold the majority next January 6th, and we can't let Boebert stay in power. But we can end both of those threats when we flip this seat and flip the House.

    "voice_to_text": "you know that video of Kamala going around with Drew Barrymore where she's like you know we need you to be the country's mamala yeah yeah okay so the thing that's driving me crazy and then I can't stop thinking about is the fact that like now a lot of people are like talking about it but this is the thing when Drew Barrymore first started that show I immediately got the ick from the way she interviewed her guest cause have you seen it I haven't okay because the what she does is she builds the premise of her entire show as if it's a revolutionary act to interview people like barefoot and like with her legs crossed because she's basically unmasking from like you know office culture you know and thinking that that's like some new crazy vulnerable thing but the thing that gives me the ick about it is that it's so performative and it like drives me crazy because like I really liked you Barrymore but when I first saw that show come out I I I remember being immediately put off you know because I'm very sensitive to like body language and it's such a perfect example to me about how we are so easily duped by the difference between performative niceness and like the actual integration of being kind do you know what I mean that's what we get fooled by politicians all the time because we'd rather see them do these things like oh look at their displays of niceness you know their tones and all their promises instead of like when it comes down to action the reason like I get like so heat up about this is because she proved me absolutely right I thought I was going crazy when it came down to the strikes you know what happened during the strikes okay so whenever there's like all these trucks going on like writers blah blah blah I'm like I'm a member of unions you know above anyone else Drew Barrymore should have known better she basically like stabbed everyone in the back you know what I mean and she continued on with her show and did not stand in solidarity with like the fellow like artists that like worked for her you know and that's crazy because number one she drew Barrymore she's like an actor she should have known better you know what I mean but number two the entire premise of her show the entire point of her show is that but we're having these conversations and we're listening in a different way like we're having real conversations and so I'm gonna get real and so to literally be that performative about it you know what I mean to put on that display and then to go on like when the time came and it mattered with action to sell out your own people and step over the picket line and like that is that is so low key crazy like that's actually wild because that's when it matters you know what I mean like that's the actual integration of like your knowledge of intersectionality and like nuance and everything and that is what happens that's why we get duped by politicians all the time like that that's that is like so crazy to me you know and I remember thinking that I was this is why I'm so hesitant and like very like wary of people that are so performative about like being you know announcing the essence of who they are because here's the thing like if you really are the essence of something you don't have to go around like announcing it all the time kind of like how really powerful leaders don't have to yell they can just whisper because everyone knows they're powerful you don't have to go around being like oh I'm so vulnerable I'm so you know I'm so sensitive and I listen to people because the minute I see people do that it reminds me of church people that's the problem with religion you know what I mean like I don't need to know I don't need to tone police you like I'd rather just care about your actions you know what I mean I'm not going around getting offended by like your tone and it's also really crazy too because if you really think about it it's so emotionally manipulative because like you cannot demand emotional vulnerability from somebody do you understand what I'm saying like just because you're crossing your legs and just because you have a really sweet tone of your voice and everything that doesn't mean that like you're not also be some people are not ready for that you know like emotional vulnerability is not something that you can demand of somebody it's something you kind of have to earn there has to be like you know a transaction there right and so it is energetically and physically very akin to like asking these the manipulative and like emotionally leading questions almost trying to get somebody to have a breakdown like back in the days when they would interview Britney Spears and she would be asked questions like but aren't you really sad like you know what I mean it's the same thing body language wise we just haven't gotten to that point in like you know society yet to where you can see even on like some of the interviews she does people are uncomfortable because that is not everybody's like comfort level and like the quickest way to shut somebody down is to keep pushing and keep pushing especially if they're already climbing up you know what I mean and that level of unawareness on top of like these actions it's just it it it just follows my mind there's and you know what she said do you know what she said literally when people ask her why are you literally going against what seems like what your entire show is about your entire image and like not like going on with the show she's and I'm paraphrasing but she said something to the effect of either the world or like the country at this moment she was like because you know the world needs our show right now it it's needed like the grandiosity of that do you know what I mean like that's so dangerous and that and I call it every time usually the people that are that performative about like being like look at how I am look at how kind and vulnerable I am those are the ones that do those exact same kind of crazy things or when it comes down to like what really matters they like they don't stand behind what they stand for you know does that make sense to you it's like the grandiosity to literally be like our show is needed like that's that's why people do crazy things like we were just watching game of Thrones Khaleesi when you all of a sudden think that like you have like some higher mission and like oh it's different when I screw people over you know like like to think that uh it just and then to watch the amount of people all like on her show like in the audience just ooh and awe and fall for this performance like oh she's being so vulnerable and she's no actually she's invading like personal body space you know and if she really like understood the finesse of real journalism and like what it takes to be emotionally like aware and like then she wouldn't do that I don't know I'm just it just it's and my mom probably be one of these people not these members if she if she was still alive she probably be one of these people I'm not saying it's a bad thing like but it is crazy to me and it's not even about the Kamala thing and also like what did you think what did you think that Niffy was gonna do like",

On the last page it says this. Ultimately, our main task as revolutionaries in the United States remains to be the unmasking of the American Empire. We cannot let our emotional attachments to a movement distract from the real mission. What is the real mission? Freedom for Palestine means death to America. Cut to everyone in my comment section saying nobody's saying that. Hope you're ready for what that means. Death to America. Hope you're ready for the lead a visceration of women's rights and the queers for Palestine being thrown off buildings. Hope you're ready for your religion to be made illegal. Hope you're ready to be stoned to death for sleeping with multiple people and never having the right to protest again. We will be our own demise.",

In some context, we have to. There's no reason to be racist. I'll tell you. So. When we have one black person presenting an image for the rest of us, what does that mean? Okay, so let's say customer service, for example. There was a whole thing about customer service in Atlanta. Keith Lee went viral over it. Because black people have terrible customer service skills, it ruins it for the next black person. So if a white person has an experience with a black girl named Tiana, and Tiana has an attitude, oh, you want a drink? I already gave you a drink. And just giving all this to this white customer, and then she goes to another establishment with a very formal. She's still gonna have that notion of, because I had this one experience with Tiana, I'm gonna off jump judge my experience, what could be another experience with this next black establishment.",

We're not gonna allow that in this day and age. Thursday, the General Assembly passed a Bill banning marriage between lineal descendants of a grandparent. Currently, the law only outlaws marriage between just the children of a grandparent. The Bill passed unanimously in the Senate and drew support from most Republicans in the house, but not all of them. There's an additional risk, but it's not as significant some might otherwise be LED to believe.

We'll read it together. I remember recently my wife had a book, and I saw her reading it on the couch, and it was about pedo baptism. And I said, no, we're not doing that yet. We will become Pedo Baptist when I'm ready. But my wife's not gonna be a Pedo Baptist for three years before I am, and I don't have time to read it right now. I know the arguments will be great. I will agree and disagree. I'm not sure which arguments are better, but for the the time being, this is what I'm persuaded of, and you're not going to outpace me. And that's not. For the record, that's not lazy. It can be, and you have to be honest with yourself and discerning of your motives, but that's not inherently lazy. This is one of the problems that I remember experiencing early in ministry as a young man with lots of other young men filled with zeal, zeal for doctrine, zeal for theology, is that they would go around, they be reading something, learning something, listening to something, and they would go around the church and they be talking to every household and every individual in the church about this thing that they've been convicted of. For 15 minutes. And they would. They would try to be terrible. And they actually thought this was charitable. They say, well, you know, you don't have to agree with me in my position. I do think it's right. But you don't have to agree with me in the position that I've taken. But you have to have a position. Now, what that's called is tyranny. That's tyranny. Do you know why? You might say, well, they're not dictating the position. This is why it's tyranny, because what you are doing is you're dictating that person's study habits. You're dictating the very hours in their day. I do that with four people. I don't do that with you, and I'm your pastor. It would be tyranny. I do not have that authority. Pastors have a very limited scope of authority. Outline specifically in the scripture. I have four people in my life that I dictate the hours in their day. I dictate what time they go to the bathroom, when we eat, what we eat, what we wear. They are my children. Those are the people that I have almost limitless authority with. As just a rule of thumb, a general principle, if you're trying to understand authority, first start with spheres. There are three primary spheres that are all forms of government. There is civil government, ecclesiastical. That's the state, ecclesiastical government, that's the church. And familial government. And it is a government that's the home, the family, households, In these three spheres, they are not a hierarchy. It is not the state, then the church, then the household. Now they are three spheres that exist autonomously, side by side, and given God's Providence, in certain practical situations. At",

    "voice_to_text": "I think it's kind of cool that California is working on giving first time homebuyers interest free and payment free loans for their home. Aha! Psych motherfuckers! It's only for illegals. The Bill gives them documented immigrants interest free home loans worth up to 20% of the property's purchase price. These loans do not accumulate interest and are free from monthly payments. Instead, they repay it when they sell the home or refinance the property. They are giving illegal immigrants 20% of the value of a home so that they can buy one. Illegal immigrants people who came into this country illegally. People that are not supposed to be here. And they are giving it to them instead of Californians. Their solution to the housing problem is to give interest free and payment free loans to illegals. People of California, your government is blatantly telling you to go fuck yourself. They are blatantly saying we do not give a fuck about you because you can't get these. These are just for illegals. Fuck the people who are voting for them. Fuck the people who are actually contributing to the country. Fuck the people who are legally here. No, fuck all you. I'm beginning to think you're better off being an illegal. There's money, cell phones, free housing, and now interest free and payment free loans. And you understand they only pay it if they refinance or sell it. So if an illegal uses this and gets a home, they are Getting 20% off the purchase price of a home in California. So you gotta think on like a 500,000 dollar home. They would be getting 100,000 dollars of the taxpayer money. Of your fucking money. And if they never sell it and never refinance, they never have to pay that back. They are encouraging illegal immigrants to buy the homes you can afford. And you're gonna keep fucking voting for these people. That is why I don't feel bad for California anymore. I just cannot wait for you to fall into the fucking Pacific.",

Can you tell me what the tally is? More than 35 times the Republican witnesses and Republican members of the committee have used the word F. Thank you so much for that. Cause, honestly, if they would continue to say if or hunter and we were playing a drinking game, I would be drunk by now. Cause I promise you, they have not talked about the subject of this, which would be the president. But let me tell you something that was so disturbing as I walked in to this chamber today, as I prepared, I said, what is the crime? Because when you're talking about impeachment, you're talking about high crimes or misdemeanors, and I. I can't seem to find the crime. And honestly, no one has testified of what crime they believe the president of the United States has committed. But when we start talking about things that look like evidence, they wanna act like they blind. They don't know what this is. These are our national secrets. Looks like in the shitter to me. This looks like more evidence of our national secrets, say on a stage at marilago. When we're talking about somebody that's committed high crimes, it's at least indictments. Let's say 32 counts related to unauthorized retention of national security secrets. Seven counts, Related to obstructing the investigation, three false statements, one count of conspiracy to the fraud the United States. Falsifying business records, conspiracy to the fraud the United States. Two counts related to efforts to obstruct the vote certification proceedings, one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights, 23 counts related to forgery or false documents statements, eight counts related to soliciting. And I could go on, because he's got 91 counts pending right now. But I will tell you what the president has been guilty of. He has unfortunately been guilty of loving his child unconditionally. And that is the only evidence that they have brought forward. And honestly, I hope and pray that my parents love me half as much as he loves his child. Until they find some evidence, we need to get back to the people's work, which means keeping this government open so that people don't go hungry in the streets of the United States.

    "voice_to_text": "Initiate went on for a long time. Can you go back? Back one more. No white could ever rape a slave woman. The regulations of laws to the white race on the subject of sexual intercourse do not and cannot, for obvious reasons, apply to slaves. Their intercourse is promiscuous. We've now justified raping black women because they can't be raped. They. We aren't raping them. They're promiscuous by nature, so we can't do it. Uh, forward one more. The fact that white men could profit from raping their female slaves does not mean that their motive was economic. The rape of slave women by their masters was primarily a weapon of terror that reinforced whites domination over their human property. Rape was an act of physical violence designed to stifle black women's will to resist and to remind them of their surveile status. These become important instruments that you look at. Now, I give you some statistics as it relates to American history. By the mid 1800s, there was over 600,000 mixed race children born. 600,000. How many of you know what, um, miscegenation is? Miscegenation is a illegal marriage between people of different races. Actually was very profound here. That was illegal to marry someone of another race. So when you consider the fact that one of the greatest issues and one of the number one reasons why black men were lynched, beaten, and imprisoned had to do with the fear that they were gonna rape whom white Women. Now, the numbers. I mean, we're talking about pure numbers, numbers alone. It was who being raped, okay? It was. It was black women being raped. But they can be raped. This advance for it before we get into the casual Killing act. The casual killing act was written because of the number of people who were killed by while being corrected. Okay? And if any slave resists master owner, other person by his or her order correcting such slave, and shall happen to be killed in such correction, it shall not be counted felony, but the master owner and every other person. So giving correction shall be a quit of all punishment accusation for the same as if such accident had never happened. So that means that if you happen to be correcting someone and you beat them to death. You know how hard it is to beat someone to death? I mean, I thought about that. I said it happened so frequently that they created a law so that you wouldn't feel anywhat, no guilt, because you were simply correcting that wasn't your fault. So I went back to looking who was beating folks to death. I wanted to know, and it was white women. White women were beating black children to death. That's who was being beaten to death. But it wasn't her fault. She was just correcting them. You see, what we do is we rob ourselves of our own humanity when we refuse to Look at this stuff. We rob ourselves of our humanity. And that's what people didn't know happen going forward. One more, then you had the mental health folks. This is how we got in. We got in to try to fix it. In the early years of the 19th century, a physician named Samuel A. Cartwright argue that two particular forms of mental illness caused by nerve disorders were prevalent among slaves. One was Draped Mania, which was diagnosable by a single symptom. The uncontrollable urge to escape from slavery. So now what we've done is we've now pathologized your desire to be free. Must be something wrong with them. Keeps keep trying to free themselves. And again, it would be funny if it weren't in journals. You see, all of this is to remove the cognitive dissonance. Now we have. Look at all the people joining in. You got the naish, you got anthropology, you got physicians, all of them saying they deserve it. It's not us. We don't need to adjust anything. And if they just tried harder. How about you people just pull yourselves up from your bootstraps? What's the matter with you? The playing field has been leveled. We're gonna see if, in fact, it's been leveled, or is that conjecture? Move forward. Now, I want you to look at this photo very closely. I want you to see who's in it more important than the man hanging. Because you gotta understand, the lynchings that occurred In America. Happened after slavery, not during. Thousands of lynchings happened after slavery. Because this is a reaction to white fear of what we would do once freed. But we didn't create a vigilante group to take out white people. But they did create a vigilante group to take us out now that we're free. See, that happened after slavery. They were called the what? The KU Klux Klan. They don't wear hoods anymore, they wear suits. But they're alive and well all over the world, even here. So look at who's in a picture. I want you to put. Look at this little girl in particular. You can't see her closely, but she's actually grimacing, like smirking. Now remember, let's go back to the puppy concept here. She would be loathed and torn up probably if this was a puppy. Which means he's less than that. Cause she's not disturbed. This little girl is not. Is not disturbed by this. But she should be, shouldn't she? People always ask me, go, joy. What was impact on white people? There it is right there. Can't feel any empathy for him.",

I have my side, there\u2019s no telling if we will ever get the truth, but what is your side? I am also seeking answers considering recent talks about how Trump may not attend the debate next week.
