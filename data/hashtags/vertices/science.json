Go watch the rest of that video, but that's not even close to the only weird thing about these guys. So let's get into it. These are Sicilians, which are mostly blind, mostly limbless amphibians, and some of them are ovoviperous, meaning their babies start out in eggs, but the eggs hatch inside of the mom. And while they're in there, the mom makes, like, a fatty, milky liquid to feed them. But according to the 2024 study, at least one species nurses their babies after they're born, which is supposed to be our thing. And by ours, I mean mammals. Anyway, once they're, like, outside of their moms, babies of the species siphonops annulatis will eat their mother's skin for nourishment, which not too weird for Sicilians, but it is, like, weird to me. But the moms in this species also feed their babies a fatty fluid similar to the million milk. And these guys don't have nipples, so the mom, like, secretes this liquid from her cloica, which is the opening that some animals have instead of separate holes for reproduction and digestive waste. So the tiny Sicilians make, like, these high pitched clicks while hovering around that opening, which triggers mom to produce the fluid. And then they just shove their heads in the opening and they drink. And remember, they have teeth. So, yeah, there's just so, so much going on with these weird little guys.",

First off, the one piece world is only three times bigger than our world. And our world, mind you, can only reach up to a magnitude of 9.5 in an earthquake. It is stated by professional scientists that it is impossible for the earthquakes to ever reach up to a magnitude of ten. Now, I'm not about to do the estimate for y'all. Y'all could do that yourself. the one piece world would not be able to reach up to a magnitude of 50, nor can Whitebeard ever get it up that high. Cause I want y'all to remember this. Whitebeard's ability is to create earthquakes. There is literally no statements of him being able to reach supernatural magnitudes and earthquakes. Now, like I said before, even if Whitebeard was to spam earthquakes, it would not destabilize the earth. And I'll tell you the little secret of why. Because if the earth was to destabilize, that means earthquakes would not be able to happen. Because earthquakes are basically mechanisms for the earth not to go boom. So all Whitebeard is doing is basically just causing that mechanism to occur rapidly. I also wanna say one more thing. People are gonna probably say, oh, well, the feat that Whitebeard showed is basically impossible in real life, science or physics. It's really Not every day that an earthquake occurs, small islands start to move. Which means earthquakes can cause islands to move. So how much you wanna bet, if someone could create earthquakes while being on said island, that they could pick up the small island, especially if tsunamis were to occur around it? I bet a lot of money that they could. Also, the one piece world is not as large as our son. Our son is 109 times bigger than our earth. Let's please stop saying that.",

All right,   day   All   right this should be good. I'm gonna turn on this microwave.   should   be   good   I'm   gonna   turn   on   this   microwave Watch what it goes to 3 million.   what   it   goes   to   3 million Now let's see what happens when we put the AirPods next to this guy.   let's   see   what   happens   when   we   put   the   AirPods   next   to   this   guy Ready? Look at that guys.   Look   at   that   guys It went to 1.2 million. Now it's an 800,000 micros per meter squared.   went   to   1.2 million   Now   it's   an   800,000   micros   per   meter   squared Little bro really thought he did something.   bro   really   thought   he   did   something First of all,   of   all you need to understand what a micro watt per meter squared is.   need   to   understand   what   a   micro   watt   per   meter   squared   is It's the way you measure radiation,   the   way   you   measure   radiation but a micro watt is literally a millionth of a watt.   a   micro   watt   is   literally   a   millionth   of   a   watt That ain't gonna do shit. So with some simple conversion,   ain't   gonna   do   shit   So   with   some   simple   conversion the outside of the microwave was giving him a total of   outside   of   the   microwave   was   giving   him   a   total   of 3 Watts per meter squared,   Watts   per   meter   squared while the airports were going down to a whopping   the   airports   were   going   down   to   a   whopping 0.8 Watts per meter squared.   Watts   per   meter   squared Also, a safe level of EMF radiation for humans   a   safe   level   of   EMF   radiation   for   humans is considered to be between 2 to 10 Watts per meter squared.   considered   to   be   between   2   to   10   Watts   per   meter   squared So the AirPods were well below that   the   AirPods   were   well   below   that and the microwave was well within that.   the   microwave   was   well   within   that Not to mention measuring the outside of a microwave to prove a point   to   mention   measuring   the   outside   of   a   microwave   to   prove   a   point isn't proving any point cause that's the safest part of the microwave.   proving   any   point   cause   that's   the   safest   part   of   the   microwave You'd have to be raw dogging the inside of a working microwave   have   to   be   raw   dogging   the   inside   of   a   working   microwave for it to be dangerous at all.

Length within height. So far so good. What would all of these things be like but from the perspective of a four dimensional being, which is time? So this is a great question, but unfortunately time has nothing to do with it. In relativity, time is one of four space time dimensions, but it's quite different from the other three. I'll explain in a minute. Four dimensional being would be able to see the evolution of that strand of hair over time and in a single instance, in a moment. So unfortunately this is just wrong. But it's an easy mistake to make if you just heard that time is the fourth dimension. The notion of time as a dimension comes from Einstein's relativity, both special and general. But in these descriptions of reality, time isn't just another dimension. It has a distinct character in a mathematically defined way. See, the way that we talk about space time is with a 4 by 4 array of numbers called the space time metric. Each of these columns or rows corresponds to one of the dimensions. And in particular, the three space dimensions have a positive signs and the time direction has a negative sign. This arrangement of signs is called the signature of the spacetime. Three pluses and one minus And this notion of signature generalizes. We say that positive signs correspond to spatial dimensions and negative signs correspond to temporal dimensions. So for studying the spatial geometry of a piece of paper, the signature is plus, plus. If we're studying the universe of flatlanders, the signatures plus, plus, minus. Importantly, the signature of a geometric space is fixed. It doesn't matter if you're living in that space or if you're viewing it from a higher dimension. You'll always see spatial dimensions of spatial and temporal dimensions as temporal. So for a 4D viewer, our time dimension would still be a time dimension. These 40 beings would therefore have four spatial dimensions and one time dimension, and our time dimensions would be the same. And so their signature would be plus, plus, plus, plus, minus. Now, you could possibly imagine that they have three spatial dimensions and two time dimensions. So their universe's signature would be plus, plus, plus, minus, minus. But even then, our time wouldn't stop behaving like time. That said, there's good reason to think that complex structures can't farm if there's more than one time dimension. So, no, a 40 being would look at us the same way we might watch a movie. We're watching something happen in two dimensions. But time is the same for them as it is for us.",

especially she's wondering this because like academia seems so collaborative and the whole point is to like build on each other's work and um we're supposed to all be working together right and yeah 1,000,000% it does happen um so she's doing a PhD in the humanities and I am in science so I thought I would talk a little bit about how it works here in science um I don't know if it's the exact same in the humanities but I do imagine it\u2019s something that happens so there's this concept called scooping and it can happen in two ways one is a lot more innocent than the other so research can often take years to publish there's work that I did um like 10 years ago that still has not been published and because it can take so long to publish and also because we're sort of all working off of other people's work it is fairly common that two labs will have the same idea around the same time and just one will publish before the other and so that's one method of scooping someone two labs independently had the same idea and just one publish before the other and that makes it incredibly difficult for the other one to publish and I've seen that happen to many of my friends and colleagues um it's just a rough thing that we have to deal with but no one's really like at fault here and while it does like really suck whenever it happens it's also at least a little bit validating that you were on the right track and you weren't the only one who like thought of it the most famous case of this happening is actually the theory of evolution so um Charles Darwin and a man named Alfred Russell Wallace both came up with the theory of evolution that we like think of today around the same time and people like to frame this as the other method of scooping that I'll talk about um because it's more dramatic but what actually happened is they came up with the idea around the same time they talk to each other realize that they were having the same idea and they actually ended up presenting the theory of evolution together but the first time that it was published it was published by Darwin and that's why we associate Darwin with the theory of evolution instead of Alfred Russell Wallace but in this case they were great friends and colleagues and they didn't like hold it against each other there wasn't like a massive rivalry here it's just something that organically happens sometimes the other method of scooping is you see someone else's research idea and you go actually that's gonna be my idea and then you steal it the way that I've seen this happen most commonly is when you're at conferences a lot of times you're presenting unpublished work and um sometimes people who are big names in the field will come by your poster and be like oh my god this is so interesting my lab does something really similar but not exactly the same as this and then like a year later they'll publish on exactly what you were presenting a fun thing that happened to me one time which is not necessarily scooping but it was incredibly annoying is uh I was constantly suggesting this thing to the faculty member because they were doing something wrong and they were it was it was such an obvious route that they should have gone down that they were like not doing and then whenever they finally did do it they gave me no credit and pretended like this was organically just a thing that they came up with now why do things like scooping and like stealing people's ideas happen whenever like science is supposed to be so collaborative it's because this concept of being so collaborative is actually fairly recent and this is part of why studying like the history of science is really important so way way way way way back in the day science was only for the wealthy elite who could go to school and like fund their own labs and their own research um and also only for like white men at least in Europe there was also research happening in other countries but I don't know as much about it and there were all of these like academic societies that these men could like be a part of that were essentially a bunch of men sitting around smoking and drinking together and talking about their theories that were just like wild ideas and so science like was not for the public and because these were a bunch of men with really big egos it also wasn't really for each other like they wanted to be the name that was attached to this thing so while they were like all talking to each other It it it they were essentially having like these giant \ud83c\udf46 measuring contest where like yeah they were talking to each other about their science but they were just trying to prove that their science was better than everyone else's and even as science became like more open to other people other people were able to go to college and start joining labs and doing research that attitude of um having your name attached to the research and like it being known as like your research really prevailed even to the modern day there are labs to this day that will on purpose train you incorrectly so that you can't like surpass them like if I were in one of those labs as a PhD student and I was assigned an undergrad I might train that undergrad incorrectly to make sure that that undergrad doesn't get into grad school and then surpass me I would never do that this is a hypothetical but also a very real thing that happens or there are labs that just straight up won't train you because their attitude is that if you can't figure it out on your own then you don't deserve to be here which is wild because none of us like figured out PCR on our own even the people who invented that they were working together and you'll still see labs at like conferences that only present published work and it's incredibly annoying because the whole point of the conference is to share your ideas with each other and get to know like what the up and coming research is like I said stuff that's been published was done like five six 10 years ago so like the point of the conference is to know what's going on right now um so it's really annoying when they do that but also it's to protect their information so that they don't get scooped so yeah the fact that we think of science as like a collaborative environment is really recent like last 30 years recent it's actually really interesting nowadays like sometimes whenever people interview for PhD uh positions they'll like ask how collaborative the environment is like what could they possibly be trained by a different professor if a different professor like knew a technique that they wanted to use for their project um and a lot of older faculty members are really like taken aback by that but that's something that people would care about so yeah um the TLDR is that science while we tend to think of it as collaborative today um it came from very snooty um private origins and of people really wanting to attach their name to a big thing and people with big egos and so um thinking of it as collaborative now is really modern and so there's still this attitude of wanting to be better than everyone else and so yeah people will absolutely steal each other's research",

When facing a strong chemical or any chemical that has warning labels on the container, you do not ever put your face directly over the opening of the container. Simply hold the bottle a few inches away from your face or set it down on your table. Then with a free hand, proceed to waft the fumes up towards your nose. I promise you, if it is a strong enough chemical, you will be absolutely more than able to smell the fumes it produces. You do not need to be putting your whole damn nose inside that container. Raw factory face holes do not belong there, and your glands most certainly be damaged like you almost did there. So, just as a quick review, if you are faced with a strong chemical or a chemical that has any warning label on its container, best just waft the fume. Never put it so close to your face. Waft? Damn! You're stuck your whole nose in that damn container.",

So I used to work with an FDA approved gene therapy called zulgenzma. And if you're not familiar with zulgenzma, it is a treatment. And it is the only treatment on the market currently for a genetic birds effect called spinal muscular atrophy. And spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, if left untreated, is fatal, usually before the age of five. Do you want to know how much sylgenesma costs? $2.1 million per treatment. Now, because Zilgensma is so fucking expensive, most insurance companies will not cover the cost. Um, they offer payment plans. And the company that makes it, strapped to therapeutics, also offers payment plans, but it is essentially the same thing as taking out alone. So then the parents of these patients, because they'll genes is intended for infants under the age of two. The parents of these patients are then faced with having to make the decision of either being in crippling debt for the rest of their lives, meaning they're ruining their credit, essentially making them unable to buy a car, buy a house, send their child to college, or they have to watch their child on a live, slowly and painfully in front of them. I will also say that zilgenzma is not the most expensive gene therapy on the market. There are currently two FDA approved gene therapy for hemophilia B, which is also usually Fatal without treatment. And they are priced at $3.5 million each. So that is one of the many reasons that I stopped working with viral vector gene therapies is because even though I'm so passionate about them, and I love virology and I love helping people, I cannot stand to know that I was contributing to parents having to make that decision and patients having to suffer. And I think that we really need to do something about this. I think that we really need to put some kind of legislature in place, because it's only gonna get worse from here.",

    "view_count": 0,
    "voice_to_text": "hi I'm the girl with the microphone as interesting as this sounds it's not possible for several reasons first of all um the nervous system is extremely complex um now with further time and a skilled surgeon's hand um in the next few hundred years maybe but I highly doubt it not with a machine like the whole image behind her no that's not how it would be done um a lot of people don't realize this but your spinal cord is actually a part of your brain it's attached to your brain stem and it attaches to all of your nerves not possible and once you sever that spinal cord completely especially from certain parts yeah no that brain's not coming back both bodies would just die also can we talk about the ethics of a full body or a head transplant you think some of us already have body dysmorphia that would be traumatizing absolutely not also brains die of old age there is no way to keep a brain alive infinitely brain cells die brains decay just as much as the rest of our body does as you get older your cells start reproducing slower and you age yeah that's why you get wrinkles on your face because that not only does that collagen get weaker but those cells on your skin are reproducing and replenishing themselves slower now I say all of this because I kind of got curious and one point because I had seen something about they were talking about trying to test on doing not whole head transplants but brain transplants and I was just reading up on it and I went down a huge rabbit hole and the biggest issue with all of this is that it's just not physically possible but I would like to get more into the ethics of this first of all if you transplant your brain or even your head onto someone else's body um you have to be a a a exact blood type match and I don't just mean into like what are your RH factors and your blood type there are more factors into people's blood than just there are each factor in what blood group they're in there are certain blood types that are missing certain proteins there are blood types that have other kinds of proteins that are not very common and if you do this and the organ or head is not an exact match the immune system in the body that it's transplanted into will kill it that that's yeah not only that um I don't think I would wanna walk around with my brain in someone else's body or even my head on someone else's body I have a hard enough time being comfortable enough to look at my own face in a mirror without makeup on or to look at my own body before I take a shower I just got out of a 26 year long stint with anorexia and I'm just now getting used to being almost 100 pounds again because every time I got to this weight I got so disgusted with myself that I relapsed back in you really think I want my head put on someone else's body I don't think so secondly the um image of that head transplanting machine has also been generated before to do a scaraganda on a new form of execution where they just grab the head and rip it off and call that more humane that's another reason why I know that this is all bogus I'm not saying you can't duet it and spread it around but people should probably know that no no they might actually be still testing and looking into the possibility of it but not the way they're displaying this because this is not a new subject that has been brought up in medical science especially since transplants first began the idea has been tossed around for a long time there have even been studies where doctors have transplanted heads of one dog onto another um both dogs ended up dying and they didn't switch the heads they just added a head to another dog so that dog effectively had two heads I don't know if you wanna see the photos of that but you can find them all over Google it didn't end well there were a lot of dead dogs like one of them I think lived for either a few hours or a few days but it was just torture so yeah no not not even remotely possible and also it's unethical like highly unethical just just so you know if you come across this video and it freaks you out it's not gonna happen in our lifetime and I honestly don't think it's a good idea to take one person's brain or head and put it into or on another person just like I don't think the idea of conscience switching is a good idea either but they've been looking into that and what is conscience with switching oh essentially you just switch your personality and conscious and memories with someone else without having to transplant the brain now that's also not possible I don't know why it's even an idea people been watching too many SCI fi movies that's my guess yes I know the filter is off of me that is because this is the two headed dog experiment I also found a picture of the two headed dog I thought I would actually share it with you guys I know I said I wasn't going to but surprise one moment here is the two headed dog they created that didn't live very long and probably had a miserable existence honestly this reminds me of this sorry if I made fans",

    "voice_to_text": "......... I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but unfortunately TikTok is pretty good at spreading misinformation regarding food safety and this little hack of storing avocados in water is a perfect example of that. If you're new to my page, if you've never seen my videos before, welcome! I'm a microbiologist and a medical laboratory scientist and I'm here stitching this video to pass on some really important food safety information so we can all be better protected from preventable disease like Listeria and Salmonella. This little kitchen hack of storing avocados in water in this way has gained a lot of traction recently thanks to it being shared on social media and people noticing that after they store their avocados fully immersed in water in this way they do stay green for longer. However, the color of the avocado fruit doesn't tell you if it is safe to eat in regards to bacterial contamination, the colour of the fruit will stay the same whether or not it's contaminated by those dangerous bacteria. So where do the bacteria come from? They're already on the avocado. It is very common to find Listeria but also Salmonella on the outside of the avocado, specifically within the root scar (that little indentation at the top of the avocado.) This root scar acts as a reservoir for bacteria, and because of its indentations, because of its irregularities, it can't be cleaned even if you are fully immersing the avocado in for example, a bleach solution. So then when we immerse the avocado in water, that moist environment allows those bacteria to infiltrate the fruit moving from the outside of the root scar into the pulp of the fruit. Like said, we can't tell by looking at the avocado if it's been contaminated we can't tell by a smell or by a taste these pathogens often don't cause spoilage. I know what you're thinking \"how do we actually know that happens though?\" science my friend! we have scientific evidence from a laboratory where scientists did this method, they immersed avocados in water and they found that these bacteria were able to infiltrate the fruit of the avocado because of the water because of that moist environment. So yes your avocados might not rot, might not spoil as fast, however they are now at a higher risk for bacterial contamination meaning that you are at a higher risk of contracting serious, painful, bacterial disease. I know in our society in our modern day culture we've kind of been conditioned to view food poisoning as no big deal \"it's just an upset stomach I'll be fine.\" we certainly shouldn't lose respect for the harm and the devastation that these organisms can cause. Listeria can lead to meningitis, while Salmonella can cause all kinds of things including arthritis, while repeated bouts of food poisoning in general lead to a higher risk of developing autoimmune disease. If you would like a safe way to store your avocados long term here's what you can do instead. You can peel the fruit of the avocado, chop it up or dice it up, whatever you prefer and then put it in your freezer, this way it can stay fresh and safe to eat for up to three months. Always take the food hacks, the kitchen hacks that you see on TikTok with a very large grain of salt, always double check to make sure the advice you are hearing is safe and that it won't make the food you are feeding yourself or your family dangerous to eat. Thank you for watching this video, thank you for staying to the end and I really really hope you learned something new",

    "voice_to_text": "    the same way you're supposed to be deciding truth throughout every era definitely for the large scale things like what does life mean and where do we come from and where are we going the Bible Holy Scripture 66 books we could debate if apocryphal writing should be included but you know starting with a 66 is pretty good uh then even for medium medium scale things stick with God's word I'm thinking James 1 5 if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask god who gives generously to all without approach and it will be given him yeah and he's he's generous if you ask him and if you're not like actively hating god he'll he will give you wisdom and even for the small scale things I mean you building yourself off of foundation of of biblical values like I mean the really hardcore basics of confessing your sin loving your neighbour as yourself boom when you start to structure your life around those things truth gets a little easier to intuit now if it comes to very specific things like you know when was earth created you know was it a million years ago or only tens of thousands of years ago that's a debate and like it almost a trivial debate the truth itself is so valuable but it's applicability here and now with that particular item that I mentioned as an example uh you know it's like uh whatever move on with life you move on with life you pick something um one of the great tools that comes into the small scale items like the age of the planet or other such questions is the scientific method the problem with the scientific method is most people think they're practicing science and really they're just practicing whatever media told them but the true scientific method if you're gonna be a diligent citizen and search for truth as best as you can in some sort of applicable way is the scientific method that starts with asking a question that is step one there are couple different formats to describe the scientific method in an applicable way but the format I start with the format I recommend is step 1 ask a question step 2 background research you're just checking out what like what is he out there then step 3 you can form hypothesis now hypothesis not a conclusion hypothesis is your your educated guess that you are about to pursue and dismantle and establish brilliant step 3 step 4 is construct an experimental procedure where you say huh how am I even gonna figure out these things how am I gonna pursue my hypothesis how am I gonna test it possibly disprove it or even support it step 5 is collect and analyse data so you had your experimental procedure that says you know what how am I gonna even do this thing how am I even gonna explore this thing and then you actually go and do it and you collect data and analyze it you're not just saying ah I have some data now and my hypothesis is true you collect some data say you test it against your hypothesis and say hmm do these guys line up does this work out do these do you know do do my data line up with each other I tried this experiment you know a thousand times and each time it was different that's a bad sign time to fix your experiment or procedure or if your experiment was very close or identical a thousand times in a row that's a good sign record it at the very end you can draw a conclusion if you have enough data pointing in the same direction and if you don't you modify previous steps in the scientific method so quick recap for the largest scale things like the meaning of the universe freaking Bible for the medium scale things about like you know what what value should I use to build my life freaking Bible again specifically wisdom literature based in Proverbs and then for the smaller scale stuff it hinges off of your core values that should be rooted in the Bible but a great tool if you're using it humbly and and and sincerely is the scientific method I hope that helps",

    "voice_to_text": "Gravity is supposed to be the greater the mass is, the greater the attractor. This will not go well. You take a balloon, you rub it on your leg, you put it over the ground. Watch the dust particles jump off the ground off this big mask, off the earth, and jump onto that balloon. This is an example of static electricity. When you rub a balloon in your clothes, the friction moves some of the electrons from the fiber in your clothes to the balloon, giving it a negative charge. When you then place the balloon near dust, that negative charge polarizes the dust so that the positive side of the dust is slightly closer to the balloon than the negative side. This results in a small attraction that causes the dust to jump. Because why? Electricity is a hundred and thirty seven times stronger than the pool of gravity or the effects of the so called gravity. Now, if you're not already attuned to physics, this sounds like it could be plausible. But what's evident to me is that he read something he didn't understand that involved the No. 137 and then included it in his made up world. Because electromagnetism isn't 137 times stronger than gravity. It's 137 times weaker than the strong nuclear force. In fact, it's roughly a trillion, trillion, trillion times stronger than gravity. Which is why a lone balloon can pick up dust held down by the entire earth. Hmm. It's the electric Force. That's the attractive force. It's the electric force that tightens everything together. As the masculine end is. The electric force can absolutely be attractive. However, it can also be repulsive. You know, the whole like charges repel opposite to tract. That's the electric force. Also. What's up with the masculine thing? And then the dividing force is the radiated force, the magnetic field. It ablates and pushes everything out again. Magnetic forces can be both attractive and repulsive. Think of what happens when the North Pole of a magnet meets the south pole of a magnet. Or when a magnet meets a lump of iron. They get stuck together. That's magnetism, not the electric force. And then they collect together again. But where these things meet? At the proper angles of incidence. Where what things meet? Terry, the electric and magnetic fields exist everywhere. Which means that you can measure the angle between them at any location. And in general, they can have any angle. No special angle of incidence required. Those angles of incidences at 120 degrees. When it converts it back into electricity. And it will keep collecting and coming and making life. What? And like people say, well, what business do you have coming in here talking about science and all that? You're an actor. You don't stay in your lane for the rest of you. Enjoy the next few days of Terry debunks.",

    "voice_to_text": "They found an ocean underneath the Earth's crust. This will not go well. This new ocean is the largest ocean on the planet. Not sure how many times I have to debunk this, but here it goes. So this is what she's talking about. And right off the bat, this isn't news. It's from about 10 years ago. It just started making rounds again for whatever reason. But more importantly, it's not an ocean. This is the paper in question. What they found was evidence for tons of hydrous ringwoodite. Now, ringwoodite is a mineral that can contain the pieces of water. It can absorb hydrogen, and it can replace magnesium ion and two oxide ions with hydroxide ion. So, in some sense, the components of water can be found in Ringwood Light, but there's no actual chemical H2O, in the minerals, and that means no water. We also discovered that there's a super massive black hole pointed directly at the earth. It's also spitting energy at us. This isn't that unusual, and it's not dangerous at all. In fact, if they're not pointing at or nearly at us, it can be hard to see them, because, you know, they're black holes. In fact, here's two examples discovered just in 2,023. Noteworthy for science reasons, but it won't affect regular people at all. The energy coming from these supermassic black holes is a million times weaker than the sun gives off. Is also a giant hole in the sun. So She's referring to the Corona hole that made the news a few months back. And despite the name, it's not a hole. It's just a cooler area of the sun's atmosphere, which makes it appear darker in the ultraviolet and X ray parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. They're not too rare, and they correlate pretty strongly with solar cycle. Neat, but again, not a big deal. We also found a continent on earth that has been missing for 375 years. It's called Zelandia. And, yes, there are people there. This is a weird one because it wasn't missing. Europeans had a weird vibe that there should be another continent in the southern hemisphere. But just because it turned out that there was another continent doesn't mean that it was known about and then lost. Anyway, this isn't some secret landmass that the man has been hiding from you. And no shit, people live there. This new continent is literally New Zealand and some surrounding islands. What makes it a continent is that there's a distinct type of crust that surrounds these islands called continental crust. The only trouble is that it's underwater, which is why it wasn't considered a continent before. The idea is that during the breakup of a super continent known as Gondwana, the crust thinned out, lowering it into the sea. Overall, she didn't really say anything hugely wrong. She just left out a lot of useful context to make her content seem more mysterious. So be kind But stern",

So OMZ law basically states that if you have current flowing through a resistor, the voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to the current through that resistor. And the ratio between the voltage and the current is called the resistance. My opinion, this is really intuitive, because resistors resist or oppose current flow, which means that the larger the resistance, the lower the current for the same voltage. Okay, thanks for watching. Bye.",

Well, if you'd like to be a forensic scientist, you're gonna need a science degree. So it's gonna be a biology, chemistry, microbiology, something like that. And those disciplines would be like the DNA unit, toxicology, controlled substances, stuff like that. Um, for investigation positions, you're going to need a criminal justice degree or criminal investigation degree. Actually, there are a whole bunch of degrees that are utilized in the investigation side of forensics. And those positions would be like, the crime scene unit, detective, police officer, homicide detective, forensic analyst, crime analyst, forensic interviewer. There's so many positions, and it's such a vast field. So I'm wishing you good luck. You're gonna do great, and I'm very proud of you.",

But you don't know if you can be a primary advocate for a family. I have a family for you. The Abbas family, a family of 14 who was located in Rafah but had to flee to the new Sri Lanka refugee camp. But they are not safe there. They have no shelter. They don't even have a tent. And a building directly next to where they were was bombed yesterday by Israeli forces while it was filled with families, killing multiple of them. The children in this family are dealing with malnutrition and fighting off infections with no medication. The father of this family is dealing with untreated bladder cancer and has been slipping into comas. Here's his medical record. Here is a picture of him. And other members of this family have been dealing with broken bones and had operations with no access to pain medication, including having rods inserted into their legs. Families 14 is trying to evacuate into Cairo and that cost an astronomical amount of money. The goal for their gofundme is 100,000 euros, and we are currently at 58,000 euros. For a breakdown on how this process works and why it cost an astronomical amount of money, watch this video. It's a fantastic breakdown and it really puts things into perspective. I will tag the creator below, but if you are Trying to get involved and helping a family reach their goal. A goal that may seem astronomical, but is very much doable with the power of community. Abra's family would love your support, and if you do make a video about them, please include their gofundme link in your bio so it makes it as easy as possible for people to find where to donate.",

    "voice_to_text": "\"should I do a candida cleanse or parasite cleanse? here's what you need to know.\" I can answer that one! NO! ....that was fun  if you've never seen my videos before, welcome! I'm a microbiologist and a medical laboratory scientist  so I am also very invested in protecting you from parasites more specifically the ones that are interested in the contents of your wallet. oops said the quiet part out loud there didn't I? so here's what you actually need to know about these purported \"cleanses\" that the people marketing them probably aren't telling you. these supplements have never undergone randomized, controlled, clinical trials (which is what we use to test pharmaceutical medication) demonstrating that they work. I know, bare minimum. I don't know about you but me personally before I put any supplement, any medication into my body I need to know that it works first. and here's what you need to know about Candida: Candida is a fungus and it's a normal constituent of the human microbiome it lives in our mouth but it also lives in other parts of our digestive system like the colon. for this reason most people who undergo these screening tests for \"Candida overgrowth\" will have a positive result. does this mean you have an infection? NO. Candida can be pathogenic, meaning it can cause infections, one example is oral thrush but it can also cause infections on the skin. however \"Candida overgrowth\" or the idea that systemically Candida can be building up and causing these vague, over-applicable symptoms like hair loss, bloating and depression is quackery \ud83e\udd86 \ud83e\udd86 this is used to sell supplements to people that they don't actually need. if you have a systemic overgrowth of Candida, if you have a systemic infection with this fungus you are in the hospital in the ICU, fighting for your life not dealing with vague symptoms like hair loss depression and insomnia people who tout these supplements use over-applicable vague, symptoms that anyone can relate to because it makes it more likely for them to get their check \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 so what about parasites? there are a huge variety of parasites (notice how these people are never specific that's a red flag)  These parasites can be acquired through food or through unclean drinking water, while others can be acquired by walking barefoot on contaminated soil, and others can be acquired by interacting physically with animal or with human waste. depending on the parasite, depending on how you were exposed and depending on the point of its life cycle it can be in your skin it can be in your lungs or it can be in your digestive system. how do these supplements differentiate between where the parasite is? THEY DON'T!! remember: like I mentioned earlier these supplements have never been demonstrated clinically to work, bare minimum. what these supplements actually do is cause intense gastrointestinal inflammation which can create \u2728artifact\u2728 that is left behind in the toilet, this gives the illusion and the confirmation that something happened and it removed something from my body even when the thing is quite literally the lining of your gastrointestinal system. We even have peer-reviewed scientific literature noting how these supplements are designed this way to cause this clumping to give the illusion that something happened. this is where I once again ask: where's the scientific literature demonstrating that these supplements work? you won't find any! but let me finish with a simple question: there are indeed parts of the world that deal with endemic, parasitic infections (endemic means the parasite is to some level always present within the population) you've probably heard people reference how certain parts of the world undergo yearly (if not more often) parasitic \"cleanses\" because these parasites are so common. in these parts of the world that deal with these endemic infections they aren't using parasite cleanses from TikTok Shop or various other social media platforms. they are using pharmaceutical medications that have undergone randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that they work. if the areas that are constantly dealing with these gastrointestinal parasites are using pharmaceutical medications and not random supplements why aren't you? if these \u2728gut health\u2728 girlies legitimately want to help people, if they legitimately want to help you address your concerns if you are scared that you have a parasitic infection why don't they instruct you to talk to your doctor about albendazole? why don't they tell you that mebendazole and pyrantel are antiparasitic medications that are available over the counter without a prescription that have been demonstrated clinically to work? it's because they can't make money off of it, so they tell you that you need to take a supplement instead. hey what do I know? I'm just a microbiologist I'm just an MLS that has physically interacted with some of these organisms in a clinical laboratory. I'm positive that the former personal trainer and former gymnastics coach knows so much more. thank you for watching this video thank you for staying to the end and please be cautious and careful before putting random, unregulated untested supplements into your body just because a tiktoker \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 told you it's what you need.",

She has a bachelors, and so that covers \ud83d\udcd0\u26d3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udca5, \ud83e\uddea\u269b\ufe0f, \ud83e\uddeb \ud83e\uddeca little bit and \ud83e\udea8\ud83d\udc1a  Yeah so I can tell you, you know geodes are really neat I don't know how they form, but it's rockin \ud83d\ude0e  got your igneous \ud83e\udea8, which is mostly \ud83c\udf0b or made of \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf0b\ud83e\udea8 got your \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0b\ud83e\udea8, which is layers\u2014which is often you know got Limestone in it, you've got \ud83d\uddfb\u26f0\ufe0f \ud83e\udea8, which heat, pressure and shit changed- made it look \ud83d\udc1b to \ud83e\udd8b yeah sedimentary rock is often what you find \u2620\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\udc1a\ud83c\udf3f in sometimes !  you got like conglomerates and plain-\u201cplain\u201d\ud83d\ude05 you know the- there's whole spectrum of stuff \ud83e\udd13 so it just genuinely makes me chuckle a little bit when I see people get a wild hair up their ass and just make some \ud83d\udca9 up about a unique rock formation that looks \u201cout of place\u201d -kind of like this one- cause it's so smooth and round, right? You wouldn't expect that to just be in \u201cthe middle of nowhere\u201d I mean if I didn't- -if I wasn't told that it was formed due to some \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf0b  I would have guessed some massive \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f \ud83d\udca8 uh at a time in a- -in a time period \ud83e\udd13 I mean, no doubt it has some \ud83d\udca8\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f to it cause probably those crevices weren't maybe as deep as they are now?  Anyway \ud83d\ude05 \ud83d\udca9 now that I \ud83d\udcad about it, how many peopl\ud83d\udc6b\ud83c\udffc can name the three types of \ud83e\udea8  and know\ud83e\uddcf\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f what they're talking\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  let alone identify a geode, or like whether something is sandstone, Limestone stalactites and stalagmites, difference between a \ud83e\udea8 and a \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f for \u271d\ufe0f sake \ud83d\ude44  I consider myself \ud83c\udf40  that I could almost identify the difference between a \ud83e\udea8 and a \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Could I recite it to you? But I know what I'm \ud83d\udc40 at\ud83e\udd13 I know that canyons are more often than not formed with \ud83d\udca6 \ud83c\udf0a erosion  or land separating..?\ud83d\ude05 I mean the Grand Canyon in Arizona is formed by \ud83d\udca6 \ud83c\udf0a erosion. Which is really \ud83e\udd2a to \ud83d\udcad about considering how deep it is \ud83e\udd14 there's a Canyon somewhere in northern Idaho that was formed by a \ud83c\udf0a it's not very deep because it happened \u201cquickly\u201d But yeah, I totally get a kick in the pants when- -when people see a a big rock formation and they're just like \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7e  some \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc7b being I mean don't get me wrong, I'm a I'm a \u271d\ufe0f I believe in god, but the \ud83c\udf0d made those \ud83e\udea8  let's just- those \ud83e\udea8 are natural occurrences that just happened over time\ud83e\udd13 and people over the myriads of of civilizations that have existed on this \ud83c\udf0d  definitely didn't have assistance from\u2026 us (white Jesus theory)\ud83e\udd21 \ud83e\udea8 are \ud83d\ude0e  the \ud83c\udf0e is \ud83d\ude0e  \ud83e\udea8 \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0bis \ud83e\udd29  \ud83e\udda4\ud83e\udeb6\ud83e\udea8\ud83e\udd96\ud83e\udd95\ud83e\udebc\ud83d\uddff\u26cf\ufe0f is \ud83e\uddd0  ^one of the best procrastinating rabbit holes one can take^\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd21 You're still learning \ud83d\udca9! so it's technically not NOT productive \ud83e\udd13 but uh \ud83d\ude05 that's a lot of information \ud83e\udd13 I'll stick to my \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc \ud83e\uddb4  and working with people and learning to be passive aggressive while being polite and still professional \ud83d\udc79 Cause in archaeology I- I don't wanna be the one that discovers something  \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc79 can't do that with a person \ud83d\ude00  am I gonna still read those \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc80 discoveries \ud83e\udd13",

It was first coined in 1956. And this isn't just some arbitrary AI. This is actual AI. I think the sense from people not knowing what AI actually is, and they see Chachi PT as what AI is, but that's not actually true. AI is just problem solving from machines. That's it. In Dartmouth College did this in 1956, if you wanna get technical, the first NOR networks were made in 1943. And later on, she references her parents not growing up with the internet, which, again, just isn't true. Unless your parents are old. If they're older than 1983, then they might have not grown up with the internet. Internet was hitting public libraries by the late 90s. So, yeah, you're not older than AI. And your parents definitely grew up with the internet. Unless they're pretty old.",

Cela \u00e9tant, euh, c'est 1 excellente question, quel est le r\u00f4le du moustique ? Et quel est le r\u00f4le de la m\u00e9duse dans la cha\u00eene alimentaire ? Le moustique, sa larve, va avoir 1 \u00e9norme r\u00f4le puisque beaucoup de poissons vont se nourrir de leur larve et euh, aussi des larves telles que les larves de libellule ou les larves de col\u00e9opt\u00e8re, euh, qui sont aquatiques hein, vont se nourrir aussi de ces larves de moustiques. Ensuite, ils ont 1/2 r\u00f4le, \u00e7a va \u00eatre 1 r\u00f4le de vecteur de maladie. Alors pour la sant\u00e9 humaine, c'est pas dingue, mais par contre pour ces parasites, c'est parfait. Je parle l\u00e0 de shikungugunya, de malaria et cetera. Et par vecteur de ces maladies, ils sont aussi des r\u00e9gulateurs des esp\u00e8ces et notamment de l'esp\u00e8ce humaine. Bah oui, n'oubliez pas, s'il y avait pas d'intervention de la m\u00e9decine, le moustique ferait des dizaines de 1.000.000 morts par an, et la m\u00e9duse, c'est 1 petit peu la m\u00eame chose. Son r\u00f4le, \u00e7a va \u00eatre de se faire manger par les tortues, par les requins, et aussi de r\u00e9guler certaines esp\u00e8ces de poissons, certaines esp\u00e8ces de plantes. Parce que n'oublions pas que les m\u00e9duses, ce sont des pr\u00e9dateurs.",

    "voice_to_text": "The lights being visible in America wasn't bigger news, but we made such a big deal out of the solar. So I prefer to get answer to this question because I've actually contributed to the problem. And the problem is that the Aurora borealis and Aurora Australia, just so finicky and so hard to forecast that even if you're looking at the Aurora forecast that is released by government agencies, um, up to days in advance, it's usually not accurate until a few hours before the possible displays begin. So you could look up right now and see that four days from now, there is a possibility of Aurora displays taking place. But because of how these events work, like we're talking about coronal mass ejections coming out of the sun that have to interact with the Earth's upper atmosphere in a very particular angle and way in order to generate a rural displays. That is just something that is so hard to predict that usually if it does show that there's a chance of an Aurora, that chance will just drop to zero right before the event begins. Last night, we happened to see the strongest geomagnetic storm in 20 years. And so the Aurora displays were visible in many places around the world that usually do not see this. But it wasn't something that scientists were, like, super confident about until a few hours beforehand. And so there was some media coverage beforehand telling people like, hey, it's Possible. You may be able to see this, but you didn't really see the media coverage crank up until we started seeing the oral displays absolutely going bad shit crazy in Europe, North Africa, India. Just places that are not used to seeing this type of bright, colorful Aurora displays. And so some people were able to see that, but a lot of people were just like, I'm going to bed, and then found out about when they wake up. But with the solar eclipse, that's something we know about, like, hundreds of years in advance. You can look up a map of solar eclipses, exactly where they're going to take place at what time of day in the next 500 years. That's how accessible that information is. So I used to make videos talking about how the Aurora is going to take place in three days. Like, clear your calendar, whatever. But that's before I realized that, like, these types of events are not predictable. Like, you literally cannot predict this. Like, we are lucky that we had a couple hours notice of this event taking place last night.",

    "voice_to_text": "so for me see I grew up uh in an Irish Catholic family um my dad's family they were Lutheran uh which is like I believe a subsect of Protestant so um and it wasn't like we wasn't like ...they were Easter and Christmas Christians if you if you get that term um it wasn't like it pervaded our whole lives but it was always just kind of this thing that was you know always kind of there this omnipresent haha but it was only because of what people said that made it omnipresent um so in middle school um you know this is the dawn of the internet um this is like the the early to mid 90s um the dawn of the internet and and we had to do like a lot of current event reports from social studies class so I was reading the paper a lot you know and looking for news stories that I could do my like little weekly summaries and writeups on and read one news story about a child that their own parent can't remember if it was a boy or girl but this child had essentially been locked in a room beaten by their parents starved um burned tortured in various ways um this kid never had a good life never had like joy or anything it's not like this just happened at this was literally how they treated this kid its entire life um and the kid finally like you know starve to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 passed in a puddle and of its own Gore and and f-ing festering body and sores and that's when even in middle school as a middle schoolers at 12 13 year old I began to essentially independently form the epicurian question in my own head it wasn't as concise but I just kind of understood the concept of it but um if you're unfamiliar with the epicurian question it's essentially a Greek philosopher you know asked is god able to prevent evil from happening but unwilling well that makes him malevolent you know cause if you can stop something and you don't then you're an ash hole for not doing it um is he willing but enable in other words does god want to stop evil things from happening but he can't for whatever reason well then he's not all powerful and is he both willing and able can he do it and does he want to do it then how come bad stuffs happening because you guarantee or something bad was happening in front of me that I could stop and I had the ability to stop I'd fighting stop it right and then the final question is is he unwilling and unable then why call him god and that the basics kind of concept of that formed in my little middle schooler head and you know that's why I started questioning it and the only response you ever get is that god gave us free will so these things need to happen because it's what you know tests us our faith and dah dah dah dah and it's like no that's faithfully manure the reason is faithful manure is because I don't care who the faith you are if you wouldn't stop a child from being beaten to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 you know SA to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 because that's f-ing happening still from starving to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 by their own parents by being tortured to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 if you wouldn't stop that I don't... faith you like honestly faith you and that's that's why I came up with this like little throw away line I I'll use is that there is no god in any heaven as long as a child suffers yeah people are sapiens  bad things happen and may there might never ever be an end to it but to claim that it's because in all powerful all capable being needs to let it happen so we get tested and understand no that's that's a load of faithful doody and if you actually honestly believe that then you're just kind of a horrible faithful person that doesn't mind children starving to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 in my opinion you would probably watch you probably watch it faithing happen and think this needs to happen because it's the only way some of us get to go to false a promise of heaven it was about the same faithless time that I finally realized that atheists are actually more moral than people that have any type of faith structure in dogma and the reason for that is for example you have two kids you tell one of those kids hey I will buy you an entire fructose bag of candy for yourself if you do this good thing but and don't do this bad thing and you get this bag of fructose candy and then you have a second kid that does the good thing and doesn't do the bad thing without being told that there's a bag of candy in it or any type of punishment which one of those kids had better motivation the one that you're promising candy to or threatening with like you know grounding or any type of corporal punishment are they doing the good thing because it's good to do or they doing the good thing because they're hoping for the reward and avoiding the bad thing because they don't wanna get the punishment see the kid that didn't know about the reward or the punishment they're just doing the good thing because it's a good thing to do and they're avoiding the bad thing because it's a bad thing to do simple as that so when an atheist does a good thing they're just doing it because they want to better their fellow man animal what the fudgr ever have you they wanna do put good into the world and they want to avoid doing bad in the world and that's just their personal motivation they have no reason to do it other than for goodness sakes but if a religious person is a good thing are they doing it because they want to do the good thing or are they doing it because oh no I can't go to hell I need to get to heaven I need to get to heaven so let me do the good thing well that's a selfish motivation so they're not really doing it for any moral reason they're doing it out of self interest self preservation it's a survival instinct at that and that's not really morality that's just survival so yeah if an intelligent designer that's all powerful exist and children suffer then he's a fallacy doo doo head or quite simply he doesn't exist and people that don't believe in a punishment or reward after death are more moral than those that might be doing it out of fear or hope",

    "voice_to_text": "You see how earth and, like, human beings have, like, such mystical, weird lure? See, I could break this down in a hundred different ways, but i'mma first start talking about how human anatomy and quantum physics just explain some ridiculous stuff that history has shown us time and time again is real. So everybody know the basis of how we are made. We have atoms, and inside these atoms are your information or your code. This holds your protons, your electrons, your DNA, etc, etc. The fan has atoms with a certain type of code. I have atoms with a certain type of code. Now, what makes humans different is our atoms can split up and make copies of itself. Okay? This explains why we can have kids, explains why we can heal ourselves. Like, if I get a scratch on my skin, my skin will reproduce itself to heal itself. 1. The fact that the atom can split and make copies is crazy because you've been doing that for hundreds of thousands of years. Your atoms, your ancestors, your DNA has been here hundreds of thousands of years in the past and probably will still be here. Especially if you have kids and grandkids will be here hundreds of thousands of years in the future, cause all your atoms in your DNA is doing is copying and pasting itself. 2. What's also crazy is just because it copied and paste itself does not mean it does not communicate. With each other. Your atom still communicates with each other through energy. 1 this. How does that not just explain interdimensional travel or time travel or, you know, consciousness being transferred? How? That explains a lot. Ancient Egypt says all this stuff is possible. Your DNA, your atoms are in the past, communicating with you right now and communicating with the future. Your atoms copied itself is right here and put itself right here. And then also put itself right here. And the energy that's in between these atoms is communicating with each other constantly. And that's just on a small scale of us as a human. This one form of consciousness. We know consciousness lives in everything. Cats, dogs, the planet. Except so what if Planet Earth decided, you know what? I feel like it's time for me to heal. Let me copy and paste myself into a different time or a different dimension or different zone. Not only that, but I still wanna communicate with myself while I'm in this timeline and also in a different timeline or even the universe. There are multiple universes. We all know this. What if there's exact copy of our universe that decided to just copy and paste itself and is still communicating with us, and still the energy from that universe is traveling here? This is where we get the ideas of dimensional travel or time traveling. Even ancient Egypt was looking at the stars and communicating with beings that aren't From their realm. And we over here arguing about Kendrick and Drake. Drake. The history about ancient civilizations is so mystical and luring because it seems SCI fi, but when you really look at it, these. These people were just using the information that we have today. They using the technology that we have today. We're just arguing about Drake.",

So apparently I needed to also add that this app has just destroyed a lot of people's basic comprehension skills and ability to pick up on implied context. If you didn't see it yesterday, I posted a little mini rants about the number of people leaving comments on my videos lately to argue that dinosaurs aren't real because they're actually dragons. Which is just insane. And some of the comments I've gotten on that video are just mind boggle. I had this one person leave a comment going um, are you gonna actually leave real facts? Like this isn't the critical thinking slam dunk you think it is because there are real dragons. Okay? Komodo dragons are one girl. I know about Komodo dragons. It is obvious from context that I am not talking about them, that I am talking about the make believe fairy tale monsters, not the big lizard named after them. There was another guy who left to comment and going define real. Like come on, you cannot be that dense. How? My recent video where where I talked about how we know that dinosaurs didn't stand like this. Uh. That. That they stood like this. I've gotten tons of comments from people going oh, so they walked on all four? It's like, no, no, I never said that. And I had myself in front of this diagram of A Dinosaur on two legs what's front legs are clearly too short to walk on. Like, I shouldn't need to spell it out because it should have been very obviously implied. Don't get me wrong, I love TikTok. I love making content here. I'm still just thrilled that there are so many people who want to hear what I have to say about these topics I love. But oh my god, it is so exhausting sometimes to have to play 5D chess to try to anticipate every insane way that someone will misinterpret my videos and then have comments from that are just like, so out of left field. I could not have possibly predicted them. Now I promise this will be the last rant for a while. We'll get back to our regularly scheduled content. But oh my god, some of y'all need to really, like, actually exercise your brains a bit.",

    "voice_to_text": "funny enough I woke up this morning with an email from one of the three Noble Prize winners from 2022, because the work I do is not only about these particles is actually about how we can use this very real continental particles to have very real applications in the very very real world belief so give me a couple of minutes or so and I tell you what is the misunderstanding here and why some of these headlines and the way we praise the stuff is misleading and results in a video like this that the lady like this would think that the universe is not real and even worse it depends on us and when we look at it things change non local reality is a various transport but has nothing to do directly with reality so locality is an axiom like anything else physics is based on a lot of things that we cannot prove it but it sounds very logical so it becames the foundation and the basis on which we build a lot of other assumptions and hypothesis and the theories and laws eventually one action is that we live in a local universe things only affect immediate things around them for example if you spray a perfume in your room not suddenly the entire room is gonna smell like perfume it's gonna take a little bit of time because the molecules of the perfume is gonna hit the air molecules and keep spreading around until it get to you the same way with everything like sun the light takes eight minutes to get to us so if the sun right now disappears not suddenly we gonna see that it's gonna take us eight minutes before we see that the sun is gone yeah so locality made a lot of sense as an axiom because it's very very compatible with pretty much everything that we see in this world up until quantum entanglement quantum entanglement is one of the only exceptions in which the word we understand as being local doesn't really apply and doesn't work that axiom doesn't work and we cannot use it to explain quantum entanglement and quantum entanglement is like flipping a coin imagine you have two coins and you keep flipping them and while these coins are flipping you have no idea whether it's zero it's gonna be head or tail until it hits the table and very intuitively you should always assume that whether the first coin is gonna hit the table whether it's gonna be head or tail is not gonna have any effect on the other coin but that's not the reality of entanglement with entanglement it's like flipping two coins every time one of them is head the other one is gonna hit the table and it's a tail or vice versa it doesn't matter when which one happens and no matter how fast you do this how almost exactly at the same time they hit the table they end up being correlated to each other and the weird part is that if you keep separate in these coins from each other put one of them on earth the other one on Jupiter or moon Jupiter wasn't a good example is a gases planet moon still doesn't matter the moment one of them is hurt the other one becomes the opposite they are correlated to each other in a way that it defies locality the way we understand it it does not mean the reality is not real the reality is very very real and more importantly has nothing to do with you and I observation even though the word observe be usually use it for us it's not about us observation is a general word used in physics means any interaction that the table is observing for the coin when the coin hits the table that's when the observation happens if you close your eyes it's not gonna change it if you think the universe is not real and if you think you play any role in that whatsoever grab a T-shirt if you have a black T-shirt sit there and just spend the rest of your life imagine that is blue let's see if it turns blue yeah or with the corn or with anything so the universe is always real it has nothing to do with what whether you're observing it or not this entanglement is happening all around the universe whether we are there or not this observations are happening everywhere but but it's a very strange and very fun thing about the universe that we discovered the past hundred years or so and we can now definitely prove that it is true it is an exemptions to locality uh we don't need this doesn't mean locality is a bad axiom because it does work a lot of places axioms do not need to work everywhere but of course we are very still interested to understand how this is working what is this connection between this particles and hopefully one day we don't understand but the answer is not gonna be us I'm sorry to break it to you we don't play a role in this universe this universe has been going on for billions and billions of years before us and it's gonna go on for billions and billion years after us yeah we didn't play a role in any of these things to come up so it's good not to be full of ourselves",

And if this is kind of your introduction to P Foss, I can understand it might be a little too much math for you to handle. Certainly it is for me. So to pull it back a little bit, one thing I. You should keep in mind when we're talking about detecting P Foss in beverages, or really in anything, is that pifos is in everything. It's so common and ubiquitous that if you test for it, you're gonna find it at some level. And that's really part of the. The huge challenge that Pifos presents for us. It's everywhere. It's in everything. Like, let's say you create some kind of miracle drink that has no pifos in it, zero pfoss. You put it in a plastic container, the plastic is now leaching pfoss into your drink, and you're back at square one. That's the challenge we face.",

    "voice_to_text": "Alright so de-extinction's back in the news I'm gonna talk about it because I've had to do a bit of this during uni um and it's some tech bro bullshit usually. Now I'm not saying that what this guy is doing is bad or anything like that it has a lot of really cool applications and just for context what he's what him and the group he's working with  are kind of trying to do is bring back the thylacine by using their closest relatives which is a small marsupial called a Dunnart, they found in central Australia and using their genetic make up basically to patch in the gaps in the genetic material we have for thylacines in order to create viable embryos we could then potentially implant into a surrogate and then bring the thylacine back, which sounds cool right and it is, it is cool, it's it's a cool thing to do it's just it's nothing like Jurassic Park it is unbelievably more complicated like you need to have both a lot of viable genetic material for your animals case and point we will just realistically will never be able to bring back the dodo because we don't have enough *stuff* (Viable DNA) of dodo around  to create enough of a genetic blueprint to bring them back. Even mammoths are difficult as hell because DNA degrades way faster than people believe, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't sequence a genome if you have enough samples of DNA it just means that you don't have enough to create an actual animal out of it basically but the thing with the extinction is it's it sounds cool it keeps popping up in the news there's a reason 60 Minutes is doing that interview but it's also expensive and time consuming as all goddamn hell like they were talking about how the backers of this program include Leonardo DiCaprio and the CIA like they're doing it with CIA money it's not a small amount of money that's been thrown at this so a lot of conservationists look at this and they have a couple of problems with it first and foremost being why are we spending millions of dollars on the chance to maybe bring back one of the species when we could instead I don't know buy 200,000 acres of Amazon rainforest from being destroyed like there's there's better ways to spend the money than giving a bunch of funky scientists the free rein to maybe bring back I don't know half of a Mammoth. The other thing is little bit less so with the thylacine because they didn't only died out in the 30s um whereas other animals they've *sequenced* options for the extinction include the Mammoth it's like where do you put them Like congratulations we spent $100 million to bring back one thylacine that's not enough to save the species that's not enough to bring back the species they're not the species because they're not thylacines they've got like 40-30% Dunnart DNA instead and all of that money could have been put to I don't know stopping the Great Barrier Reef from disappearing. And the other thing that pisses off a lot of conservationists  about de-extinction is it creates this notion that animals can come back they can't if something's gone it's gone unless we have a Time Machine or this technology suddenly jumps 50 years in front they're gone forever we need to be stopping extinction before it happens and that's not even getting into how if we did bring back one of the animals we've still only got one and you can't create a viable population with that so now your millions of dollars out of pocket so that you can watch an animal go extinct again  this is actually happened before I\u2019ll do a video on that because we brought one species back from extinction it's also the only species to go extinct twice so it didn't work out but that's a whole other video so yeah so yeah it's a it's a cool thing to see pop up on like the news and social media sites when this sort of thing happens but it's not it's not a solution it's something that people can say hey look at this cool thing we're doing if you wanna save animals the easiest way to do it is to talk to people who work with those animals and find out what they need it's it's boring but it's more effective than trying to clone a fuckin Mammoth.",

    "voice_to_text": "since it's apparently not nearly as common knowledge as I thought let's go over the carbon cycle and why carbon emissions and pollution are causing climate change to accelerate climate changes natural the world goes through cycles but we are accelerating it faster than the organisms on planet can adapt okay so that's the reason why climate change is a problem at our level now everything that's alive has carbon in it everything that is alive that has carbon and the soil has carbon in it and oil in the ground has carbon in it what we don't want is atmospheric carbon and when you burn carbon materials and you use other chemical processes to alter those carbon materials you create things like carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane chlorofluorocarbons all of these are atmospheric or gaseous carbon compounds the issue with these compounds is that they allow the sun's energy to come in and not to go out of our atmosphere so the light comes in it heats things and then the heat is not able to escape that is what is increasing the speed of climate change again climate change naturally happens throughout the earth cycle but we are accelerating it much faster by burning carbons that were safely stored in the soil in solid compounds into the atmosphere in gaseous compounds they're called greenhouse gases because they hold in the heat just like a greenhouse except instead of having a nice little house around a few plants it's around the entire world which does cause natural disasters all over the world because weather patterns are changing faster than the various climates can adapt soil is being washed away too quickly cause too much rain is falling in certain areas causing massive massive amounts of flooding and landslides and things like blizzards are happening and heat waves and a bunch of other things that are directly related to carbon emissions caused by are use of fossil fuels and again I never claimed to be a perfect human being none of us can be perfect I don't care who you are none of us can be perfect and believe me if I could make a living without my car I would be happy to do so I did walk for a long time unfortunately I can't afford to live close enough to work to be able to walk if you made it this far in the video thank you for listening and I hope you Learned something um don't give up because there are a lot of people out there making a lot of really really ignorant comments and it's just cause they don't know any better but if we all take a little bit of time to do a little bit of research and understand what we're talking about we would all be better off",

    "voice_to_text": "TikToks doing this thing where they tell me what they want me to make videos about, and apparently right now, orangutans are the new hot thing. You guys cannot stop hearing about orangutans. But let me do you one better. Orangutans aren't even like, my number one great ape. They're like my third favorite great ape. First has to be humans, because we do a lot of stuff. Third is orangutans. But second. Second is this bad boy right here. You know what this is? You might have said a chimpanzee. Well, you would be so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. This is a bonobo, okay? Bonobos are like, top tier chimpanzees. Everything about a chimpanzee, that's bad, bonobos do better. Okay? Bonobos are nice. Chimpanzees have war with each other, okay? Bonobos, when they have a conflict, instead of having war, they just make love. Literally, that's their solutions. The conflict is to just make love with each other. Over the smallest drop of a hat, they'll do that and they all get along. They're very nice. They're very nice to people. Now, they do look a lot like chimpanzees. And a really interesting thing is the geography. There's a river in Africa. Okay, there's a lot of rivers in Africa, but there's one in particular that on one side the river there, it's a chimpanzees habitat. On the other side of the river, it's the bonobos habitat. That's where they're both from. And they're just like the Geography of that river. Cause they don't like to swim. You didn't know this? They don't like to swim, they don't go across the river, so they diverge genetically. One group became bonobos, which behave very differently then chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are basically the devil. And these guys are like the angels of the great ape kingdom. They're great. If I could have a pet benobo, I would. So let's forget about orangutans and get Benobo's trending",

The brain organoids, the tiny human brains that we can grow in jars, have been released for commercial processing access. If you're not familiar with these guys, they are human brains that have been grown from stem cells. And they have brain waves very similar to a premature babies. I'm not kidding. The limitations on their use and their growth seems to be hypoxia due to the fact that their disembodied brain and don't have a circulatory system. They can be attached to a computer chip and have better processing power than our most advanced AI. A Swiss company, Neuro Platform, is debuting their biological computer chips and giving access to private citizens to use the processing power of the brain organoids. While there are 16 brain organoids to a chip, they're maintaining thousands of them. They also have mouse and rat brain organoids, but they explicitly used human brain organoids. There have been some advancements in being able to keep them alive longer, including keeping them in a media that's oxygen rich and shaking them. They live about 100 days, so they will constantly need to be refreshed. As for the company, you personally can get access to their computation. It is going to run you about $500 a month if you're in education. I am frustrated. This is brand new technology. It is pretty spooky. Those are functional little eyes that Can perceive light. They are immature human brains. They have all the structures that a human brain should have. They're just never reached that point in development because, you know, the lack of a circulatory system. But scientists are doing their very best to make them bigger and more complex. At what point are we gonna bring ethics into the equation?",

Starting off with side effects and symptoms. I have lower abdomen pain, which varies on and off. And it feels like I have to pee non stop, but nothing comes out. And when I do pee, it burns like lava. And I also have flu like symptoms such as headaches, sore throats, and dizziness. The pain is pretty bad, but I can still function. So I would rate it about six and a half out of 10. Let's break down the physical aesthetics. I have redness, soreness, and inflamation. And I've been waking up with a lot of discharge. It's very uncomfortable, does not look pleasant at all. Let's talk about the only good thing that came from it, which is the exposure. It's been putting a lot of people on notice, making them do better. And it hit everywhere, even hit Black Twitter. And my whole entire family has seen me in this terrible state. I've been getting made fun of a lot all across the internet. But you know what they say, all exposure is good exposure. So seven out of ten all around. I would rate this experience a 5 out of 10. I hope it does happen to me again, but it was a great learning experience. Now, by all jokes aside, I didn't do anything for day 10, I'm not feeling too good. I'm not gonna lie to you guys, but I did go and get my antibiotics, which is a good thing. Tell me why I'm just now finding out that Japan is paying people $75,000 yearly just to have a kid and live there. This is my last chance. I'm crashing out. I'm calling all everybody. If you're a girl in Japan and you wanna have a kid with me so we can have a good life, let's do it. Everything is for educational purposes. TikTok.

    "voice_to_text": "let's talk about Terrence Howard this is him when he first started exposing his research anytime you start talking about things that's outside of the norm this is usually what happens that's until he went on the Joe Rogan podcast now they're saying Terrence Howard just Mic dropped all the science on Joe Rogan your move conventional scientist got a lot of explaining to do this guy said there's literally nothing more important on earth than listening to Terrence Howard right now this is just an example I need y'all to listen to this there's been a lot of debate at the moment in the world of physics and metaphysics there's been this incredible interview with Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan Show everyone's talking about is the fundamental unit of creation is it a particle or a wave call where's Terrence is suggesting that um the flower of life is the key to all the secrets of creation so Terrence Howard is looked at the negative space between four bubbles or four spheres and we get this kind of shape like a tetrahedron and he's saying that that shape there is the atomic structure of hydrogen and as you know hydrogen constitutes 99.9% of the universe so this contradicts this whole theory of protons and electrons and black holes because he's saying everything has a male par and a feel par  so his work was based on the Walter Russell's Cosmology of octaves and frequencies and light so a lot of people are saying asking me like is is he the next Tesla well I believe that his popularity and his um deep understanding of the sacred geometry and the pentagons that nest um definitely constitutes him as one of the next progressive thinkers in the world because one of Terence Howard's most fundamental discoveries is he took three pentagons and he put them together at 120 degree angle and then he put another three next to it and he essentially got a shape it like um the Doja Cathedral that has 12 vertices well this link pin he's saying is the new propulsion system that can be like a drone so if you turn that into a drone put four of these constructs together you end up with this amazing new technology that can fly like a UFO can rotate on its axis it's a technology that's never been done and it's even submersible it's gonna get rid of cranes so he's saying that the golden ratio Fi ratio the work that's been suppressed for hundreds of years is now coming to the fallout so that's why I welcome his research because he's saying that 24 spheres or bubbles the negative spaces is beautiful architecture of sacred geometry these contain energy and we can harness this energy in a new and progressive way I believe that he is definitely in a positive sense offering putting on the table a new propulsion system based on the flower of life and the sacred geometry if y'all ain't seen this video I dropped in 2022 about Terrence Howard I need y'all to check it out",

Oh, it's getting sticky. It's starting to get sticky. This is such a weird video. I'm not sure this. This product would really work for two reasons. First reason, highly toxic, inflammable. Apparently, whoever told me to try this product for the second reason just takes so long to dry that you don't have that much time in gymnastics to set the bars.

Like, kept telling him that he needed to listen to a bunch of these other scientists. And, um, Terrence Howard was like, no, but you gotta, like, like, look at this and. And really look at it and tell me what you think and I'll address. Tyson was like, oh, no, I don't think so. So now they're talking about a debate. A debate between Neil degrasse Tyson and Terrence Howard. I think that would be, like, so epic. Like, would they put it on pay per view, or would it just be like one of those things on YouTube that gets millions of views? What do you think would happen? I would love to see Terrence Howard and Neil degrasse Tyson debate each other. I have not really like Neil degrasse Tyson for a long time just because of his smugness. And I kind of think that celebrity got to his head, and he stopped really being a scientist and started being more of a celebrity years ago. And I think That's where I fell out.

    "voice_to_text": "What's a good Dinner Party Fact?  I feel like it has to be something that isn't only interesting,  but also allows other people to contribute to the conversation and share their own experiences and stories.  One of my favorites is that most haunted houses that have been investigated have been found to be in places where there is a higher than average level  of carbon monoxide gas or other nearby pois0ns that cause hallucinations.  So, those stories of hearing sounds going bump in the night,  or seeing shapes moving across the surface of mirrors or glass,  or even getting a sense of being watched...  are actually probably being caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the brain.  Now I'm skeptic, I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural,  but I love a good ghost story. I feel like sharing this fact around the dinner table gives people permission to share those slightly spooky experiences that everyone seems to have had,  but has gone a little bit unexplained. Anyway, I'm curious to hear your favorite Dinner Party Facts",

    "voice_to_text": "This is going to blow your mind. A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

First of all, you'd wanna see the rupees, which are cliffs that aren't on earth. And Mercury has more of them than anywhere else. Basically, Mercury cooled down and shrunk. And as it did that, the surface had nowhere to go, so it wrinkled. Mercury is the wrinkliest planet in the solar system. These folds can be 1,000 km long and 3 km high. They're huge. Next, you would wanna head here. Even though Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. I'm sorry, Pluto. It does have the Caloris impact basin, which is one of the largest impact basins in the entire solar system. The diameter of this is about 15 kilometers across, for comparison. That's how big it is. The object that hit Mercury to form this giant impact basin was at least 100 km in diameter. And this also formed a ring of mountains around it. And these mountains can get up to 2 km high and stretch for 1,000 km. Also, the middle had filled with lava. This was all lava. Finally, you should climb those mountains, which are the tallest peaks on Mercury, and look around. From there. You would be able to truly see the most heavily cratered planet in the solar system. Mercury doesn't have an atmosphere to protect it, so any asteroids that come towards Mercury hit the surface. So there, Are tens of thousands of impact craters, which would definitely be a sight to see.",

    "voice_to_text": "And when you say rebuild the periodic table, what do you mean specifically? Well, the way the periodic table is laid out. The periodic table they have. Now, let's see. It looks. It looks like a box. It looks like a straight box. But they don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon. What do you mean by tone? Same tone, same Kiev, same KV, 40.5 hertz. The next one would be like 81 hertz. You go to silicon, it will double up and would be 162 hertz. You'll go to cobalt, and it'll be 324 hertz. It's take the angles of incidence or the tones that they create. You know, their color. Like, you can turn color back into sound based upon. It's the same wavelength, it's just twice as long or much longer. So all you have to do is keep dividing light the. By two. You keep dividing light by two, and you ultimately get back to the audible sound of it. Because there was a relationship between light and color, sound and tone, matter and shape. Walter Russell's periodic table that he put together. Now, you compare that to mendelaos periodic table, and you'll see something completely different. It's unwinding. Whoa. And you see, there's a relationship that hydrogen. You had figured this out at a young age. I had already seen this. This was all inside of that palace. I had access to it, and I knew the relationship. She saw This. In dreams, I saw it as a circle. Everything was a full circle laid out, and each area was just expanding. Like wrapping a rag around your hand. The first wrap, you know, it's so tight. This is how I saw it, more so, but as a vortex. You'll see there's a relationship between hydrogen, carbon, silicone, cobalt, rhodium. They're all bonded. They're all sit as the middle point between two noble gases. So those things don't really exist. It's only one substance. Now, the problem is, the first thing that we're able to perceive is hydrogen. That's the first visible element, because before it is too dense for us to perceive it. You understand what I'm saying? As you reach into the next octave, the carbon octave. And they call that the. A bisexual tone, because the carbon has two tones to it. It has a negative side and a positive side. The part where lithium behaves. Lithium is contractive, beryllium is contractive, Boron is contractive. But the moment you get to carbon, you balance it out. Gets to a perfect balance of plus and minus 4. So it's a double tone. Nitrogen is minus 3, oxygen is minus 2, chlorine is minus 1. Now, the balance of this, all of those are maids. Chlorine and lithium naturally mate. If you have lithium bonded with any other element, the moment that chlorine is introduced, it will break all bonds violently. So it can bond with chlorine. Same thing. With beryllium and oxygen. That's why it's it and what they've tried to keep from us. If you have. You wanna break water into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen, all you have to do is introduce barillium. Or the sound of barillium and oxygen will violently break away from any other thing, even hydrogen. To bond with that barillium",

All that matters is that you had a healthy baby. And, um, I'm gonna give this one a solid one out of 10. And the one point is because I think that when people say this, it's genuinely coming from a good place, but it is, unfortunately, a very messed up thing to say, because tell me I don't matter without telling me I don't matter. Uh, yeah. So while the priority was definitely having a healthy baby, it is not, in fact, the only thing that matters. My physical, mental, emotional health also matters, as I am the caretaker and creator of the baby. Yeah, we're moving right along. And this one is a two for one, and it's, well, I had a C section, and I was fine. Even better is when it's a man telling me that his wife had a C section and it was totally fine. Yeah, it's almost like you and me or me and your wife are different people with different experiences. And I love, love that you had a C section and were totally fine, but personally, I'm not. So I'm gonna give this one a 0 out of 10. Y'all are in for a real treat with this next one. Don't worry. You'll forget all about your traumatic birth by the time you're ready to have a second one. I Don't think I will, because memories of my traumatic birth haunt me anytime I'm alone with my thoughts. Also, I had to sign a paper saying that my form of birth might negatively impact my fertility and ability to get pregnant in the future. So might not be able to have a second one even if I wanted to. Yeah, negative 1 out of ten. And last but certainly not least, I can't believe somebody has actually said this to me. Well, think of the alternative. If you didn't have that birth, you and your baby might have. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Like, obviously my baby's life was at risk, so I chose to have the birth that left me with the trauma. I signed up for the damn thing. Doesn't mean it still wasn't horrible. Yeah, negative 5 out of 10. Don't say that shit to somebody.",

Cryogenics programs have been around since around the 1960s, where people have immersed their bodies in liquid nitrogen in hopes of waking up at a future date when medical technology has advanced. But it still remains mostly out of reach. In fact, the bodies of people who have been cryogenically frozen have started to degrade. This is through a combination of just poor storage and the human's body is intolerance to being frozen. I would say in every single case of someone who has cryogenically frozen their body, they're not going to wake up. However, that doesn't mean we won't get there soon. There's many animals that can be entirely frozen and then wake up in the next season when they thaw. That's because they have bioprotectants naturally in their bodies. And by borrowing these animals techniques, we're working on making better cryoprotectants for humans. And we've done it with the brain organoids, you know, the tiny human brains that we can grow in jars. Growing tiny, fully functional human brains is really advancing neurological research. In this case, they flooded it with the cryoprotectant and then revived it, and it suffered no damage. At least no noticeable damage. All the future where we can really just walk into a cryogenic chamber and wake up a thousand years later is pretty far out of reach. In the next few decades, we Might actually get there.",

    "voice_to_text": "How many people do you think are looking at the moon right now? Personally, I have no idea. Let's figure it out. First, there's about 8 billion people in the world. However, the moon is really only visible to about half the population. To give in time, because if you're on the other side of the earth, then the earth is in the way. So that's 4 billion people who could be looking at the moon. Next. I would imagine that people probably aren't looking at the moon while they're sleeping or working. And that's roughly half of a person's life. So at any given time, roughly 2 billion people are awake and not working while the moon is visible. Okay, what next? Apparently, in developed economies, people spend about an hour or two outside every day. Let's just suppose that it's double that for a world average. Three hours. So about a quarter of a person's time they could be looking at the moon is when they're outside, reducing our number to 500 million. Now here's where it gets sketchy. I have no way to estimate how often a person is actually looking at the sky. So let's just assume people on average look in random directions while outside. The center of human vision is about 2 degrees across. So this circle makes about 0.03% of the sky. Because the moon is in exactly one of these circles, the probability of 0.03% of looking at the moon. So if we assume that's the Percentage of people who are looking at the moon. That leaves about 150,000 people. Now, I have no idea if that number is high, low, or just right. But as with all these orders of magnitude calculations, take it with a grain of salt.",

Whole field of sunflowers turning away from what it's supposed to be. The sun. But I think we're all starting to put the pieces together, aren't we? There's something going on in the skies. All the shit that they're spraying, the way that the sun looks, it's fucking white now. It used to be fucking orange. Alright? It's just look. Looks like a spotlight. I've seen some shit up in the sky. I've seen some shit up next to the sun. If you look at it, I'm telling you there's something going on. Okay? A lot of us just started to say this and I don't think it could. It could be any more obvious than seeing a field of sunflowers turning away from the sun. That shit just says it's impossible. It's impossible unless there's something going on. It's right there before our. Our faces. What are we gonna do? How can we deal with this? What's next for us to do other than to keep talking about it and make it not something that people could laugh about? Look at it. The sunflowers are telling us that's not. That's not the sun.

The vast majority of it contradicts what the author is even trying to communicate in the story in the first place. And most of the people using it don't even know what they're talking about. Newton's laws are laws of motion. The force applied to set something into motion is also applied equally to the thing setting into motion. What it doesn't mean is that if you can do something, you can withstand it. So you're trying to tell me that if a baseball player can throw a stone at full force, let's say 90 miles per hour, you're trying to suggest that the same baseball player can take a stone being hurled at his face at 90 miles per hour and not die?

    "voice_to_text": "Watch this video to hear one of the saddest most shocking cases of medical misdiagnosis that I've ever heard in my career this case just makes me really sad to be part of a messed up medical system but also gives me a sense of pride for being able to guide people through one of the hardest times of their life I'm Doctor K I'm a board certified neuro-ophthalmologist which means I specialize in brain tumors that affect your eyes and your vision so I'm at home eating dinner enjoying my dinner one night when a local optometrist text me about a patient saying hey I have this patient that's lost half her vision on one side I'm not sure why I think she may have had a stroke but can you get her to see you as soon as possible so of course I'm you know finishing up my dinner I text back no problem I'll get her in tomorrow so next day patient shows up she's with her daughter and I'm like hey you know I'm Doctor K tell me what's going on what happened this is where the story starts to get very odd so first of all the patient doesn't speak English she's from another country and she's with her daughter who has to translate so I go to the daughter like okay like when did your mom notice the vision loss and the daughter is like she never like said anything about vision loss and I'm like okay but I mean she's lost half her vision so surely she must have said it at some point The daughter's like honestly Doc she didn't know or realize anything until the doctor told her and then referred her to you and I'm like wow that is strange like any other symptoms besides the vision like weakness on one side numbness tingling anything like that paralysis and the daughter is like no but she has had a cough for a while and I'm like okay like we don't care about the cough and I'm talking about like signs of a stroke like no numbness weakness paralysis one side loss of speech anything like that and the daughter is like no but Doc like she's had this cough for like nine months and I'm like I don't think the cough has anything to do with their vision loss but like okay tell me what's going on with the cough and the daughter's like she's had this cough I keep taking her back to the doctor but like they haven't done anything they just keep saying it's allergies so I'm like okay let's put that on hold like look we need to concentrate on the real problem here which is the vision loss and she needs an MRI as soon as possible because getting an MRI for vision loss is standard of care that's when the daughter just kind of breaks down she's just like thank you so much doctor thank you so much for caring and I'm kind of like this is normal like anyone would order an MRI in this situation I do it all the time for vision loss like I mean I appreciate that but like why you know why are you saying thank you like that daughters like Doc you don't understand my mom has had this cough for nine months I've taken her back to the doctor again and again they keep saying it's allergies they keep giving her cough medicine but finally I just knew in my gut that something was wrong I took her back to the doctor and I pleaded with him to please order some more testing and I'm like wow that's crazy okay like what what test they finally order the daughter says they ordered a chest X ray she's gonna get it later on this week so I'm like okay I mean I still don't think it had anything to do with the vision loss but like keep me posted on the chest X ray let's get this MRI order cause that's really the most important thing because I need the MRI I think she had a stroke most probably but I just wanna make sure there's not something crazy like a brain tumor or something rare like that I doubt it but like let's just get the MRI let's so I order the MRI couple days later I get a call it's from the neuroradiologist they need to speak to me ASAP that's never a good sign when you get that call from the neuro-radiologist but what was even worse was I call a guy and he's like trembling on the phone he's like shook by the results of the MRI like almost having a hard time telling me the result and this is a guy that reads MRIs all day long he's seen everything so that's when I knew this was gonna be something pretty bad can see the right eye and the left eye and over here you see all this white area which is all edema and a very large gigantic tumor which is sitting right there in the brain that's occupying space and pushing the whole brain over to the left side you can see this massive tumor here with a lot of edema pushing the entire brain squishing everything over to the other side causing huge mass effect so I called the daughter and I'm like look um I have some bad news for you this was not a stroke there seems to be a very large growth or tumor in the brain causing the vision loss daughter is just like thank you thank you so much Doc thank you so much and I was like wow I never had someone thank me for diagnosing them with a brain tumor but then I'm like so by the way like we need to figure out what's causing this whatever happened with that chest X ray and the whole cough thing the daughter's like Doc I'm so mad I knew something was wrong I just knew it that's why I kept taking her back and she had the chest X ray this week showed that she has lung cancer in her lungs and that's what was causing the cough all this time that's what I'm like fuck because I knew in that moment what I was looking at on the MRI was actually lung cancer that had spread to her brain and it was now my job to tell her that so I give her the bad news that I think it was actually all related after all the lung cancer was caught too late spread to the brain of course the daughter is like you know Kid Doc what do we do what do we do from here and I go into full on doctor mode of course I'm like look she needs to see a neurosurgeon she needs to possibly have surgery have as much of it removed as possible she's gonna need some steroids to reduce the swelling probably radiation chemotherapy I mean we need to just get her into the er as soon as possible and do everything we can for her and instead the daughter was like Doc just tell me the truth how long does she have to live and I was kind of taking it back by that question because that was not what I was expecting but I in that moment realized the daughter actually was looking out for her mom's overall best interest she understood that the chances of all the treatments I just recommended were actually very small and prolonging or saving her mom's life and she just wanted her mom to be with her family if these were gonna be her last days so I had very mixed feelings about this I don't even know if she's safe to get on a plane but I understood where the daughter was coming from and I'm like look you're right to be honest even if we do all of that it's not looking good and as the doctor it's my job to recommend the full on treatment but if you and your mom decide that's not what you want I have to respect that that's what they did they chose to go home and be with their family and this is a super sad case because I can't believe this patient was misdiagnosed for so long but I also know that doctors are fallible things can happen and if you ever sense that something's wrong like this if you have that gut feeling that something else is going on always get a second opinion always try and find another doctor always try and find the solution",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hello, want to give some important updates for pass the hat? I first started pass the hat because I had families reaching out and I could assign those specific families with specific people that signed up. But now that so many people know about pass the hat and Operation Olive Branch, you don't need to depend on getting assigned. You can go to Operation Olive Branch, which again as at the top of my link tree, and look through the master list and find a family and support them. You no longer have to wait on us. Assignments will still be opened so we can make sure every family has a decent amount of people. And for some people that don't see this video and don't know, but please take the initiative yourself and go pick a family and still hashtag pass the hat and still tag Operation Olive Branch. Ultimately, pass the hat wasn't meant to be a long term solution. It was meant to be triage to help these families while they're in the middle of it. Raise as much money as they can to escape and meet basic needs. But OOB is going so far past that they are thinking 5, 10 steps ahead. I'm not gonna be here doing this forever. I was not meant to run a non profit. Again, I am surrounded by so much trash right now, which is to say, I have no organizational skills. But 0 0 B is gonna be there, and I Intend to help however I can. So these are your new instructions for pass the hat. 1. See a video that says, pass the hat. Oh, now you got the bug. 2 you go to Operation Olive Branch and pick your own family to support. 3 you make videos about them, you put their gofundme in your link tree, whatever it takes to reach their goal. And 4, you tag three to four friends, creators, family, whoever, and pass the hat forward so they can do it, too. This way, you don't have to wait. This way, the word gets out faster. This way, more and more families can be assigned. There are over 12,000 families waiting. The faster we can get people to their goals, the more and more people we can help. Please, please, please spread this new initiative. This means people can work faster, and it means once, eventually, we're not in the triage phase, and we're in the rebuilding phase for the people of Palestine, you guys can have a solid base, a mantle to be by. And that is Operation Olive Branch. Thank you guys so much for your help. Keep going, and, uh. Free Palestine.",

I had a really good physics teacher. Really inspired me to study electrical engineering. Went from there. And so how do you apply for an PhD? Boy. So, I mean, through the website, I guess, but do as much research as you can. As many. Much undergrad research, and then, yeah, just, like, find a specialization. So how was your experience here at MIT? Loved it. The blast. Work hard, play card. What is your favorite memory that you've had here? Winning the LaCrosse New MAC championships sophomore year. Oh, yeah, yeah. So you do LaCrosse here? Do you do anything. Do you do anything else besides LaCrosse or a member of fraternity? Um, and I did, yeah. Undergrad research here. Was MIT your top choice when you apply it? No. What was your top choice? Naval Academy. Oh, wow, really? That's interesting. Long story short, I got a Navy, chose Navy, and then tore my knee. Couldn't go to Navy, so my backup is here. Awesome. You're. This MIT is your backup? Oh, yeah. Backup school. Biggest flex ever. Yeah. Yeah. So do you have any advice for Like high school students applying MIT. Study for your sats. Study for your sats. Yeah. Be well rounded applicant. Yeah. Did you have a certain spike when you applied or. I don't think so now. Luck of the draw. Yeah. You were just being you and then you got in, right? Yeah, I guess so. Alright, awesome.

    "voice_to_text": "energy update with some major twists so if you're into this topic keep watching cause you might be able to help me out by show comments how many of you experience the Aurora borealis this past weekend and out of those of you who saw it how many of you couldn't see it unless it was on your phone meaning it didn't really show up in the sky and the only time you really saw it was when you were looking at it through your screen I asked because this has been the Schumann Resonance this entire weekend not really a peep and that's suspicious with all things considered I would have guessed that this chart would have been blasted in white but it's not why well when we are looking at the simulated matrix that we call reality we have to be aware of predators coming from all different angles from the food we eat to the water we drink to the clothes we wear to basically any item that we purchase to the air we breathe to the legal drugs that they prescribe you to our true history and past accomplishments that could fundamentally shift our existence for humanity towards the better if only it wasn't suppressed we just need to face the fact that we have been lied to about everything so it's safe to say that me personally I only take official announcements from our government entities with a grain of salt this includes NASA and even are currently accepted and pushed science now I know this is going to trigger all of the flat earth haters in the comments but listen I'm going to go ahead and say this off the top if most people think it's unacceptable to force anyone else's religion down their throat why would this be any different because science after all is its own religion everyone is honestly allowed to believe whatever they want especially when our true history is not even being taught to us in our schools so chill  we embrace every opinion here on my page as we open our minds and ask the important questions so if you're being a damn idiot in my comment section I'm on a blocking frenzy right now do not threaten me with a good time but with that being said here's what we do know harp is a weather modification pew pew used by our own rulers oops I meant for the exploration of Earth's upper atmosphere and geospace environment of course my bad but just like everything else they tell us right to our faces what they are doing they just don't take any accountability to actually make sure we get the important information necessary it even states on their official website that it was previously owned by the US Air Force and it was gifted to the university of Alaska Fairbanks in 2,015 that's suspicious but not as suspicious as this harp was doing a research campaign the same time as the solar flares well can harp actually produce artificial Aurora borealis actually yes they can or as can be artificial pause to read but we can't complete this video without also mentioning the weird elephant in the room of what we all saw during the eclipse in fact if you're anywhere on TikTok you've probably come across at least one video of people talking about an artificial sun well is that possible yes this is an article from the Smithsonian this new man made sun is 10,000 times more intense than sunlight on earth ha ha research China and what they're doing I'll help you a little further China's artificial sun just broke a record for longest sustained nuclear fusion isn't that fun I say all of this to say this when I say that we live in a simulated matrix this is what I'm talking about everything about our existence is either a lie or an illusion that's it which is precisely why we ask the questions here on my page now I gained over 7,000 new followers ever since I put out the let them eat \ud83c\udf70 video and I find it so fascinating that almost every video I've put out since that one my engagement has barely changed that's suspicious you just have to critically ask yourself why would they be suppressing important information like this because it's the illusion that they are trying to sell you and when someone like me comes from behind the curtain and says this is all an illusion they don't want you to know that because the longer they can keep you in the illusion the longer they have you under their thumb so what about all of these Ascension symptoms that everyone's been feeling at least this weekend well do yourself a solid and look up Havana syndrome and what causes that this world is no longer operating in the realm of conspiracy in fact everything that these people who you claim are dumb idiots are saying there's information out there ha ha ha you're just choosing not to look at it now of course I'm not saying that the symptoms that everyone is feeling during this awakening that we're experiencing are all due to these energies that they are artificially giving us however they do seem to correspond with certain events that take place such as the actual energy that we receive coming in from the earth versus the artificial energy that they are putting out onto the earth do I know that what I'm saying right now can completely contradict things that I've said in previous videos yes and absolutely but that's the whole point of my page is to ask the questions and to not get so married to a certain idea or a specific way of thinking about the reality that we exist in right now because we don't know the answers we don't have the truth they are not telling us the truth there needs to be some other research that we do next corresponding between the Ascension symptoms and what we are experiencing and how they could be happening simultaneously and not necessarily be connected a simple explanation for that would be they are trying to bombard us with all of these electromagnetic energies to try to stop us from awakening but the awakening is going to happen no matter what we see that that's clear so I just wanted to give you this energy update let you know that none of this weekend showed up at all on the Schumann resonance so if that gives you any sort of clarification in mind about what is actually going on here great if it gives you more questions to ask great the point of all of this is to try to find the truth try to find the reality our real reality of where we're living how things are going what this world is actually looking like around us outside of the simulated matrix that they're giving us so I would love to hear your thoughts your comments your opinions all of it is accepted but like I said if you're just here to cause hate and draw shade on people or their opinions in my comment section I will block you I have no problem with that okay that's all I love you bye",

And the whole thing is powered by the renewable energy source known as gravity. I like to call it the Slap Chop for aristocrats. The guillotine featured a really innovative form of cervical manipulation. When the blade was dropped, it applied gentle pressure to this area separating the lower neck from the upper neck, thus liberating the head, the rich. I mean, the person undergoing this procedure would only feel a tiny pinch, maybe some vibration, before the massive fluid loss LED to unconsciousness. And while this form of social equity, I mean, punishment might seem barbaric by today standards, it's important to remember that it was actually a huge leap forward compared to breaking people on the wheel. If the guillotine were to make a comeback today, I think that we could give it an update, a little bit of the rasmatazz. Because if you're gonna send out the social elites, you wanna make sure you do it in style. One more fun fact about this machine. If the blade of this device had not been sharpened recently, it could take two to three drops for that cervical manipulation to occur. If you were from a rich family, they might pay the executioner to make sure that the blade was freshly sharpened, thus reducing your pain and suffering before you received the ultimate Ring dinger",

    "voice_to_text": "The shower curtain effect is how shower curtains tend to blow inward at you whenever you take a shower and over the years there have been tons of hypotheses for why your shower curtain seemingly tries to consume you whenever you're trying to wash your body. And you just got feet for free so don't take it for granted. First up it's been thought to be just the fact that the hot water heats the air inside the shower so the hot air rises and escapes above the shower curtain and that creates low pressure which pulls the colder air in from the bottom. Weirdly it still happens in cold showers so that can't be it. But the most popular explanation has been the bernuli effect explanation which holds the air pressure decreases as a fluid speed increases Bernuli effects got a lot of applications like you can use it to calculate the lift on an airplane wing but it's not fully sufficient to explain lift altogether it's also the reason carburettas work. In the case of the shower the thinking is that the rapid speed of the water increases the speed of the air around it too that creates negative pressure which sucks the shower curtain in towards a leg hug. In 2001 David Schmidt of the university of Amherst created yet another explanation for the effect using computer simulations he drafted a model of a typical shower and separated that shower space into 50,000 little cells he ran the simulation on his home computer in the evenings and weekends basically he said whenever his wife wasn't using the computer and after two weeks of running those simulations  his Space Odyssey age computer had generated 30 seconds of simulated shower runtime. The simulation showed that it wasn't burnoulie effect nor was it the chimney effect drawning that curtain in towards your leggies. instead the simulation showed that the shower spray creates a vortex inside the shower stall just like the center of a Hurricane or cyclone. tThe shower spray centric cyclone creates an area of low pressure which draws the curtain in for you David Schmidt won the 2001 Ignobel Prize in physics for this work: The effect is pretty weak so if you don't want it to happen you gotta get a heavier shower curtain or one with magnets on the bottom we have these lightweight clear curtains and I just spray it some with water with some water to weigh it down Jesus I can't speak today ha ha",

Our children cannot read! Our children cannot read, let alone writing a paragraph, let alone comprehension. They cannot read. They do not know how to sound words out. They were not taught that. And if you're wondering, well, then why do my. Why does my kids just keep getting passed on to the next grade? Because that's what they're doing now. They're not holding the children back. They're moving them on. They're graduating them. Knowing that your child is illiterate, our next change makers, our next law makers, our next voters cannot read. I beg of you, take the tablets and the cell phones away. Practice letter recognition and sounds and reading with your child, please. And i'mma keep it a stack with you. They've been new. They've been new to babies. Couldn't read and didn't care. You know, when they started caring, after the pandemic, them test scores plummeted. First of all, like, test scores for reading were, like, pretty stagnant for the last, like, decade. But after the pandemic, they plummeted, and now they were, oh, we gotta do something about it. Columbia University, I'm looking at you. You fully backed balanced reading. Fully backed it. Teachers College was 100% pushing out balanced reading. That's why the kids don't know how to sound things out. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, please go do some research. Now they're trying to push science of reading. That's the way. And if you're like, what? Science of reading? That's what we was doing. And by we, I'm talking about millennials and older. The one. The little, ah, book, eh? You know, when we were sounding words out, that's. Yeah. Now they're trying to bring that back. And if you're like, wait, they stopped doing that? Yes, for years they stopped doing it. I'mma say this last thing and i'mma be done. If you have the opportunity and the privilege, right, because like, taking off from work is a privilege, you need to start. And by you, I'm talking to parents and guardians. Start going to these PTSA meetings and these district meetings. They are passing so many policies and they're banging on the fact that parents and families are not going to show up. You need to know what them, what those policies are and how they're affecting your children, particularly black and brown children. They know families can't or won't show up. You need to be more involved with your students schooling. Their life quite literally depends on it. Alright, I'm done.",

The fact that it can be, like, raining and storming, and then all of a sudden that somehow produces a fucking bolt of electricity coming out of the sky sounds fake to me.

Rex was a dragon. Yeah, the scientist got it wrong. It was a dragon. You can't tell me otherwise. Like what? That. That is wrong for so many reasons, but probably the most important one is that T. Rex was a real animal whose bones we find in abundance. And dragons are made up. You guys did learn the difference between real and make believe at some point, right? Cause I'm. I'm really concerned that some of you didn't. Like, don't get me wrong, I also love dragons, but I'm not gonna go looking for them because again, they are make believe, not real.

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

    "voice_to_text": "I wanna keep this short, but I just wanna say that somewhere there are some surgeons who are eating crow right now, who are eating their words right now. Because for a long time, we anesthesia professionals, they were just so many of us, I guess, that some surgeons really felt that they were, you know, above us. It was a privilege for them to, um, invite us into their operating room. And I don't know if this person is a real surgeon. I think they're a troll going around harassing health care workers on this app. But there is a severe shortage of anesthesia professionals right now to where some small hospitals that surround like the bigger cities are closing down. Cases are getting cancelled, cases are waiting months. And then impatient cases are taking more, way more days than they normally would in the past. Instead of 24 hour turn around, are you talking about 48, 72 hours or maybe even longer? Because there is such a severe shortage of anesthesia professionals. As he's in, major markets are facing major anesthesia provider shortages and declining reimbursement. Anesthesia used to be a seemingly unlimited commodity. Jeff Dot, O principal at Ventura, California based Physician Surgery Center, told Beckers, now, this person is not a physician, they just run a surgery center. They were lucky to be invited to work at your surgery center. We were so lucky to be invited. Okay, I'm tell you a story. When I used To be in one city. I heard a story I heard, and I think it's true, that some anesthesiologists were literally washing cars of surgeons in order to get them to work with them. Because we used to follow the surgeons around from multiple. From hospital to hospital. And so there were no exclusive contracts. We're not just one hospital. And because some anesthesiologists were basically fighting each other to get the surgeons to work with them, they were washing the surgeons cars. It's not that damn serious. Anywho, the tables have now turned. And if centers have anyone to cover anesthesia, it usually comes at a hefty price. Yeah, it should. Anyway, all I'm here to say is, what goes around comes around. Anyway. So I really hope this is.",

    "voice_to_text": "Um, weirder still, by the way, purple doesn't exist. Do you know that? There. There are no purple photons. Doesn't exist on the light spectrum. It's entirely a psychological creation. So what happens is that, um. Uh, if you get red and blue. Now, normally what the brain should do is say, well, it's halfway between red and blue, so it must be green. I'm getting a lot of stimulus in the red, I'm getting quite a bit in the blue. Halfway between red and blue is green. Okay? But you've also got a green sensor in the middle, and the green sensor, because it's picking up red, and blue, isn't picking up anything at all. So the brain, I mean, your brain could go fuzzy and say, system error. Cause in one sense, in a physical sense, there are no purple photons. Purple doesn't exist, okay? It's entirely created in your head. What the brain does is it essentially is invented a colour purple, which essentially represents. Not green, okay? It's a color to represent the weird, unexplained absence of green. But in physics, it doesn't exist. So this is my point here, which is that",

Dr. William Li joined me on The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy recently to explain how we can leverage food to optimize every system of the body. Here, he explains the many benefits of incorporating cacao into your diet. Find the full conversation on your favorite podcast app.",
    "voice_to_text": "So studies have been done to show that the flavonols in cocoa stimulate stem cells to come out of your bone marrow like bees in a beehive, in your bloodstream. And they go out and they find wherever needs to be repaired. If it's in your heart, they'll fix it. If it's in your liver, they'll fix it. Your skin, they'll fix it. And so we can eat food, foods like high flavonol cocoa in order to be able to actually get the stem cells to work a little bit better. Now, how do we know this, this actually functions, works in people? Well, clinical studies have been done with high flavonol cocoa to show that in, like, men who are in their 60s with heart disease, they could actually eat just have two cups of dark chocolate, hot cocoa a day for a month, and they doubled the amount of stem cells in their bloodstream, and their circulation improved measurably. And then what's even more important and impressive is that there was a study called the cosmos study that was completed recently. Yeah. Yeah. That showed that eating high flavored cocoa decreases the risk of cardiovascular death. Yeah, right. Over a period. Like a stag, like I said. Exactly. Except. Except maybe the. By. By eating the same thing that you used to make chocolate. So we're not telling people to go out to have chocolate, which is a confection. There's a lot of sugar and all kinds of Other stuff in it. Yeah, but it's the stuff underlying it. Underneath it? Yeah. The core of it.",

Today, April 28th, is my birthday, and there are two things I would like for my birthday. Number one, my audience has always skewed slightly male, and I love my male audience members, but I think it would be cool if more women followed me on TikTok. I share fun facts, I talk about science, I talk about paleontology, I talk about evolution. They're mostly biology topics. I just think it would be really cool if the ladies hung out and heard me out on the Dinosaur facts, and then we would all have a good time learning about dinosaurs. I also think it would be really cool if everyone went to American Forests org and gave them some money. American Forest is one of the oldest reforestation charities in the country, and one thing I really like about them is their mission takes into account forests as infrastructure, how good it is for quality of life to live around trees. Trees are windbreak, trees are shelter. These are nice places to hang out. And they care about equity in reforestation because a lot of large scale reforestation projects tend to ignore lower income communities and communities of color when they are thinking about which places should have nice Woodlands. So that's what I want for my birthday. Happy birthday to me! Thank You so much for listening. Love you guys. Bye.",

Hammer an apple repeatedly with a chopstick and it won't just fall off. It gets tougher just like we get braver in life. That's a nursery for you. Cut a straw, fill it with water and place it between 2 cups. Watch as the water slowly moves from one cup to another. That's the siphon effect. Can't push a disc through a hole in paper. Fold it and it slides through. That's an optical illusion. Attach a magnet to a battery's negative side and place a copper coil on the positive. The coil spins fast, just like in electric cars. Write on paper with lemon juice, heat it and watch the secret message appear. Magic! Pop a balloon under a bottle and flick it to snuff out a candle with your DIY air cannon. Break a needle and then heat it. It returns to its original shape. That's the magic of memory. Metal stick one end of a tissue into dirty water and the other into a clean cup. Soon you'll filter out clean water thanks to capillarity. Make a mini fountain by poking holes in a plastic bottle, filling it with water and twisting the cap. Demonstrate a typhoon's effect. Set up two bottles with batteries. The one representing a skyscraper stays upright, showing how buildings resist wind. Sandwich of paper between two magnets. Add a Screw and a battery and connect it up. You've just made an electric fan. Doing science experiments is way more fun than scrolling on the phone. Let's inspire kids to explore more.",

So, the way you do that is, you find the closest living relative to your animal that has gone extinct and for us that is a small marsupial species called the fat-tailed dunnart. The developmental biologist at the University of Melbourne, Pask raised $15 million for a de-extinction project that recalls \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d In partnership with American company Colossal Biosciences, which counts, wait for it, Leonardo DiCaprio, Paris Hilton and even the C.I.A. among its backers. He's adamant he'll replicate the genome of a dunnart \u2014 a mouse-like marsupial \u2014 he'll turn it into a much larger Tassie tiger. We'll let him explain. We examine all of its DNA, we compared that to the DNA of your extinct species, the Tasmanian tiger, and we look at everywhere that those two genomes or those two piles of DNA, if you like, are different. And once you've identified to those differences, it's just a matter of then going in, and making all of those edits to turn your fat-tailed dunnart genome or cell into a Thylacine cell. And you're saying that dunnart that little, little field mouse marsupial dunnart is closer than say the Tasmanian Devil? But that little dunnart is a ferocious carnivore even though it's very, very small one, and it's a very good surrogate for us to be able to do all this editing in.",

If god is perfect, right, and he is flawless, and there's no more desirable state than what is perfect, how could you say that god would want to create? Because that would be saying that god plus creation is something that is more desirable than god existing alone. Similarly, you could see it this way. The state of affairs that exist with god existing alone is perfect. The state of affairs that exist today is imperfect. God would desire it less to create this state of affairs than him existing alone. Because imperfection is desired less than perfection. Because imperfection contains flaws, which are undesirable traits. And if you were to say that the creation that we exist in right now is perfect, well, then there be no reason for god to create. As a perfect state of affairs is indifferent to another perfect state of affairs. And that contradicts the story of Genesis saying that god intends to create us and that god wants to create us.

Our door looked absolutely amazing at the end. Could you really be swingers if we didn't have pineapples hanging somewhere in our room? Also, every year, we have groups that come with us, and we give out little goodie bags. This year we gave out an actual bag. We did a T-shirt which said, let's get naughty. We also had a naughty girl banto that Bella sewed. And then a magnet you could hang on your door. And if you didn't know, name necklaces are super huge in the swinging lifestyle.

That's why these people are calling it DEI. Because they understand that SCI fi cannot have diversity, equity, or inclusion because why would space be diverse? I don't even think a black person has been to space before. That's why this guy is reminding everyone that this isn't Wakanda, it's Star Wars. Blue people, good. Green people, good. Black people? That's not SCI fi. That's why this guy says he doesn't support trans inclusion. Because we can change the laws of physics, but every planet in the galaxy has the same gender binary.

    "voice_to_text": "Just last year, Wendy Williams was diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia as her devastating condition has been going viral online. While her son says it's the result of long term alcohol abuse, others point to the time Wendy did something  very peculiar on her show in 2014. Wendy said she would \u201ceat crow\u201d if Kanye and Kim's marriage lasted longer than 72 days, which it did. While that's normally just a saying, Wendy actually had a chef prepare some crow for her to eat- In many religions such as Hinduism, crows are said to be the messengers of our ancestors, and that they can cross the divide between the physical and spiritual worlds. For this reason, eating a crow is believed to be a bad omen that results in the consumer being cursed. Many say eating the crow was the turning point of Wendy's career and the start of her ailing health problems.",

    "voice_to_text": "reiki can't possibly work so why does it this was an article in the Atlantic talking about how some hospitals are offering Reiki and the debate this brings up because Reiki delivers demonstrably good effects without a proven cause so we have a number of solid studies that show that Reiki can regulate your nervous system alter your experience of pain reduce side effects of chemo and improve surgical outcomes in 2018 the New York Times reported on a group of scientists who were studying Reiki and their conclusion was that we have a biological response to an active caring that somehow calls forth healing and the more intense and focus it is the more healing it evokes and that Reiki simulates archetypical caring gestures deep in our subconscious likely drawing from the feelings we get as children from our mothers that was from Ted Capchick a Harvard Medical School professor now could it be something more than that sure in the world of energy and consciousness and quantum entanglement and inner connection there could always be something more there's a lot that could be in there in that kind of god of the gaps and this is actually a really good way to gauge whether you're more of an empiracist or if you're more of a rationalist so empiracists are more likely to say if it works and it does we have studies to show that this improves things then I'm gonna use it so Stephen Fry is an example of an atheist who says I'm more of an empiracist than a rationalist he talks about this uh he did a podcast with Jordan Peterson about this and he doesn't believe in god but he's very open to things that help even if he doesn't know why and even if he doesn't understand it and what he talks about is you know a time when we were trying to reduce infant mortality and they had a group of students wash their hands and infant mortality dropped and they didn't know why and so they didn't keep washing their hands cause they didn't understand the connection and Stephen Fry was more of the more of the kind of person to say hey if it helped drop infant mortality let's do it let's wash hands even though we don't know about germs yet a rationalist is someone who tends to be more skeptical who would look at Reiki and say our best explanation of this is this is just a really heightened placebo effect because we have these deep evolutionary brains that allow us to tap into our own uh inner healing when we have community and rituals and touch and intention that help us to heal and improve and this is why you know Mormon priesthood blessings can work even if there's no Mormon God behind it so rationalist is more likely to say I'm more willing to use treatments that activate inner healing without the placebo effect because their core values and their heart hierarchy of values has truth or skepticism or rationalism as higher on their hierarchy values the downside is if you have to understand everything sometimes you miss on placebo effects that actually help like could help you recover from surgery so Richard Dawkins or hitch would be kind of classic rationalist types so if you're using Reiki and you feel like it helps you that's great the only place that I have to draw the line for no nonsense spirituality here is if you say that you understand how like we just understood how anesthesia works like three years ago so if you're gonna tell me that you understand exactly how Reiki works that's when I get red flags because you'd have to understand the nature of reality the nature of the universe evolution what's going on with quantum physics spookiness to fully explain what's going on here so I'm skeptical of anyone who's super confident that they know what's going on here but if we kind of are skeptical to the truth claims kind of around this and just use it as a tool it seems to actually work",

If you're really worried about melons exploding, there's not much you can do. I don't know, maybe poke them at the store and see if they explode?

And even if they were volunteer, they would go in, they'll find out what's on the other side of a black hole. But none of the rest of us will ever know because they cannot communicate back out cause nothing comes out of a black hole, alright? They can't even send an SOS with radio signals, because radio waves travel at the speed of light, and the speed of light is insufficient to escape the black hole. But the theories of the universe, general theory of relativity, that gives us the black hole in the first place. If you take those equations into the black hole, it tells us that an entire other space time opens up in front of you. As the future history of the universe is left behind, a whole other universe opens up in front of you. It's freaky. But the general theory of relativity has worked in every other way we've applied it. So this is particularly intriguing to us all, that perhaps the universe with its black holes is just this sort of Swiss cheese of universes in some higher dimension where you would might have access. So it's intriguing and I want to know the answer to fact. If I know I'm Going to die soon, send me into a black hole. That way I'll die knowing rather than just a drooling on the bed, you know, Just.

Before you make any type of assumptions, we need to make it clear that the general has never mentioned anything related to aliens. He's talking about a new era in human technology. And this is the headline they chose. Which has been cropped and shared to over 16 million people. Who now think that the Space Force acknowledged aliens.",
