And just because I don't wanna vote for Joe does not mean that I'm gonna be sitting out this election. I will absolutely be voting all the way down the ballot. And also should be known, we do have other options. We don't have to vote for the lesser of two evil. We got Joe Stein, Cornell West, people who actually align with us.

Like one is obviously they just lying to you constantly. But two is how much they come after young people, call them stupid, because they know that historically, every single generation that comes next is more progressive and more progressive and more progressive. And obviously, this one that's currently here is very progressive. Um, I'm a millennial, but I adore Gen Z. I think they're great. I think they know. They're very accepting, let me put it that way. Um, and I am very passionate about education, and for them to champion it and then call you stupid is false. It's. It's. It's a ploy. It's obviously just gaslighting people into telling these, um, thinking that these kids are getting bad educations. But you can't champion higher education, tell kids they need to go get college degrees, and then tell them they're stupid. Because they did. You wanted critical thinking, and now you got it, and now you're mad. But that's all part of how America is gonna deal with education system. Public schools are going to get worse because they want them to get worse. They're going to get worse because they want them to get worse. Because they want to create tiny little robots that know exactly what they want them to know. Why they hate TikTok, so why they don't Care about fixing school shooting problems in your schools. Because they want you to be scared to send your kids to school, so they can change the education system. And I'll never shut up about it.",

    "voice_to_text": "how it seems like people are doing this block out trend purely for their own egos and to make no yeah because I hundred percent agree um with this video if you do wanna watch that wanna come back here please do so I will be waiting here patiently for you this whole blockout thing to screams performative activist because you know damn well you watching this video who have probably blocked some celebrities because you heard about the blockout was like oh my god like this is gonna be so good for us this is finally to get these people to speak up and everything like that though that may be true it is more performative than anything because why are you putting all of your attention  all of your energy all of your money all of anything on this and I don't know how to actually putting money into blocking people but at the same time when you think about it for a couple minutes you could be using that time to donate money you could be using the sign to donate to a food bank or a clothing drive but instead you are waiting on baiting breath basically being like oh my god which three celebrities are we gonna be blocking today from one dude from one guy who has only made one single video on it after he got called out on it at the end of the day these things never work and at the very end of the day the things that actually work are the things that hurt the pockets of people that are supporting this for example if there is a leading actor in a movie that supports Zionism and is a Zionist do not see that movie if there is a certain celebrity or a group of celebrities that are collaborating and working with a brand that openly supports and funds Israel do not support that group or do not support that person or do not support that company what's not gonna help is blocking people what has words and has shown to work is hurting the pockets of the people that are supporting this for every block there's about 2,000 more followers waiting to follow that person so at the end of the day it really means nothing if they lose a follower oh but if we do it as a collective it's gonna get them to speak out is it though is it is it really though basically what I'm saying is spend your time on things that actually matter to the cause instead of showcasing your block list like it's an achievement in a video game and instead use that time use those resources and everything like that to look up fundraisers to look up things that you can do in your community to help the people in Gaza and remember to keep all eyes on Rafa and again please stay safe out there if you are planning to protest",

Hi, I'm stitching this again because I see that you've doubled down, and quite frankly, you and the people that agree with you have been very discouraging. So I blocked you. But this video is for anybody who is thinking like this. Um, I just wanna call you in for a little bit. If your thought process is, why are these people putting celebrities over Palestinians? Why are you not calling in the government or the politicians whose jobs are to actually stop this genocide instead of focusing on celebrities? I'm here to tell you, where have you been in the last, I don't know, eight months? There have been demands for change, there have been protests, there have been email sent calls. So much accountability towards politicians that have been elected to represent us within the government, and they have continuously failed. And why is that? Because despite them being public servants, they are in the pockets of the ultra wealthy. You claim that this movement is simply for our security complex, but you fail to recognize the security complex within yourself because you think that we haven't thought about these things. You think that our intelligence is so low that we are conflating celebrity power to government power. But what you are failing to see is that the government does not care about its people. That has been very clear. They care about the wealthy. And most of the wealthy people are invisible. The visible section of the wealthy class are celebrities, are influencers, are people within media who have platforms, speak on this. And yet they choose to continue to flaunt their wealth in a time of crises where the wealth gap is getting bigger. The middle class has effectively disappeared. Inflation has increased astronomically, and there are humanitarian crises all over the world. Celebrities have built their wealth off of parasocial relationships. To the common day people, large corporations know this. Politicians know this. That is why they use celebrities as armor. That is why they use celebrities to influence us, to buy things, to vote for things. So when the government fails to listen to its people, who else do? The common day people have access to celebrity. To say that the everyday people withholding their support, their money to influence celebrities to use their platform for good is ineffective and lazy. Quite frankly, lacks imagination of thought.",

At least one father and son duo did call 9 1 1. And remember, this was in 19, like 64, before there was an actual 9 1 1 number. This was back when you had to call your local police precinct and identify yourself to the police. Right? So this father and son duo did call 9 1 1, and by the time they called, she had stopped being attacked. Her attacker moved and got away, so they reported it as if the attack was over and as if she was fine. Meanwhile, she had crawled away inside a building, and so police didn't really come out to check cause it sounded like the attack was over. And again we talked about the bystander effect is if there's a group of people all looking at each other and going, I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not gonna do anything. And the Kitty Jeannouise murder was a series of isolated people at 3:00am, who may or may not have been awake, may or may not have heard what was happening, and who just may not have been aware of what was happening and might not have known to call for help given what was going on. And I really don't think that we should be using the bystander effect. As kind of a reason to explain what is or is not happening. Like regarding response in Gaza, this is more of, like a collective action problem. It's more of a misinformation and disinformation problem. Like, people know what's happening, and people are acting. So, like, even now with Gaza, it's not that we're all standing around looking at each other. This is a problem that is due to poor coordination. It is a lack of communication laterally among ourselves. And it's an inability to coordinate upwards with the people who are actually responsible for fixing the problem. Just like it was with Kitty Cheney's, right? Like, 1964, there was no 9 1 1 to call. And even if you did call, it was really difficult for you to have all the facts, all the information, and to actually report to the police. Hey, this woman's being attacked. Oh, she crawled into a building. Oh, god, the guy came back! He's attacking her again. You don't have all the information to report. And even if you do, there's no guarantee that the people who you call are going to responsive. And you're certainly not going to your neighbors and calling your neighbors and getting them on board. Right? Like, we're all just individuals acting individually. That's the problem. That's why it's hard to get things done. It's because of the lack of lateral communication. It's the fact that we're not acting as a group, not that we are acting as A group and then choosing not to do anything",

Um, and it wasn't it a fundraiser for genocide Joe? And then when she didn't like what people were saying, she was like, I'm quitting. And, like, now she's back, and she sees that Kim K. Lost 3 million followers. Now it's Operation Olive Branch. And, yes, I'm excited because she has, like, 26 million followers, and it's like, that's the reach we need. It also showcases our power, because celebrities are nothing, absolutely nothing without us. But, like, she was already getting on my damn nerves. So I feel like, thank you, Elizabeth Lizzo, um, for finally, I guess, making a video that we actually wanna see, but also, at the same time, too little, too late, bitch. Anywhere at Met Gala.

    "voice_to_text": "yesterday I found out about a thing called Operation Olive Branch regarding the Green bros Erin has already expressed her own frustration that it took her efforts and her voice to amplify a cause that Palestinians and other people of color have been amplifying for months right but it gained traction once she put effort into it and we all know that the Green brothers didn't just hear about Operation \ud83e\uded2 Branch a few days ago they didn't they took action they responded because a white woman amplified it to them now I think we have to be careful we have to step back and we have to think critically about how did this all really happen in the first place right the big picture and the big picture is who creates artificial intelligence who informs the algorithm what to do it's all of us right over time the algorithm has pearned that when people of the chalk speak their voices are seen as more reputable seen as more valuable and they get amplified so the algorithm then rewards the people of the chalk for saying the exact same things that people of color have been saying for a long long time right we've done that collectively we've trained the algorithm and these systems to be what they are so I think that this moment which is now gaining a lot of visibility here on this app should be a teaching moment for all of us to say we need to continue to amplify Palestinian voices to amplify other people of color to you know pour into the Black community and make sure their voices are getting because at the end of the day we are building this community continually we are creating it we are changing it we are making it better or worse depending on our own individual engagement and together we can collectively create visible tangible change that really amplifies the voices that should be amplified now at the end of the day we're just happy that these causes are getting out there that the voices of the Palestinians are being heard even if it's through the influence of white creators pushing their voices out we\u2019re happy that they're being heard but the thing is those people the Palestinians and other people of color they're out there speaking too and if we do our part consistently and on a large scale then we can make it so that their voices move to the forefront of these conversations and then in the future when we need to do another revolutionary thing when we need to have another global movement those voices then are gonna have more impact and ultimately everything was gonna be so much better so I just think let's not be so caught up in oh the algorithm did this ultimately we did this and ultimately we can change we can do better so let's work on that",

It talks a lot about Operation Olive Branch and Operation Past the hat, which Aaron has started, and talks all about what we're currently doing right now. I'm not gonna spend too much time talking in this video about specifically what we've done. Please go watch the former videos. But we've already raised about 100 to about 200 dollars for Ahmed, the family that I have been assigned and trying to support get out of Gaza. If you want his information, go check the link in my bio. It's all there and you can see it all anytime. Well, I'm not a huge creator. I'm just so proud of our community and how much we sort of rally together behind this. And for those who don't know, I go live every single day playing cozy chaotic games here on TikTok. And a purple app that shopper name nameless, and I talk about Ahmed, but also have a great time and we raise money for him and for Palestine. So please come check it out. Not only that, but everyone who donates will be entered in for a giveaway to win a crochet project like this that I make. So I will literally give you my eggplant. No pun intended.",

Just because the majority in a certain area doesn't really fuck with it doesn't mean that they don't exist there either. Do you seriously not think there are people stuck right now in Rafa that are LGBT? Plus like hello? Are you. Are you? What racist thoughts are in here? Like I am an Arab woman myself. I am North African and just because my country is not messing with the LGBT laws doesn't mean that none of us are. this is such a ridiculous take that pro Israeli people have like oh you wouldn't even be allowed to be gay there. Israel has still not legalized gay marriage either, so what the fuck are you speaking about? Anyways, people in Rafah need your help. Who the fuck cares what their laws used to be? These people do not give a fuck about LGBT laws. By the way, these pro Israel people screaming about this constantly oh you wouldn't be allowed to live there, forgetting that LGBT people are alive in every part of the world, no matter what the laws are. They're just using you and Your feelings towards the LGBT community. To fight to. To. To. To. To. To make your brain sick, basically, to believe. Yeah, you know what? These people, for some reason, deserve this. You know what? They don't. Their laws did not support the LGBT community, so F these people. What? Again? Open your brain.

    "voice_to_text": "so I am 29 years old and when I was in high school I went through this program all four years of high school called youth and government and I wanna talk a little bit about that and um I will just say the only reason I'm not crying right now after watching that video that I'm stitching is because I took like an hour break to get some coffee and some food but um anyway so talking about youth and government it was absolutely wild to me and I'm gonna make some parallels to what I'm seeing with the students at like these Ivy League schools and what was going on at that time so this uh program was funded and created by a um I'm not gonna name the organization but it's a big organization um I later ended up working for this organization for a little while and it was not great but anyway so you think government was really catered towards students of these better high schools in North Carolina um and honestly I don't really know if they do these programs in other states but it was kind of expensive to go and the only reason I was able to go is because um we had kind of like a fundraiser that's the word um but we also like had assistance in decreasing our price because we were doing it through this like camp that's local to us and blah blah blah but a lot of the kids almost all of the kids there you know when we would talk about politics cause obviously we would talk about politics um amongst ourselves because we were all interested in government youth and government my friend and I were like the only people who were considering ourselves Democrats not the only but we were a very small amount and when we did find other people who were more on the left leaning side which I am no longer a Democrat I do not consider myself a Democrat I was a registered Democrat when I was 16 and got my driver's license but of course I've since changed my mind and I am as far left as I feel like I can get a lot of these kids that were gearing up to go to these Ivy League schools cause these were the kids of parents who had the money and they were going places because they could afford to and that was kind of like in their breeding they were all Republican because they heard their parents talking and they were doing what their parents were doing so I just wanna say that the shift that has happened from when I was a teenager from 2,009 to 2,013 when I was in high school to now these kids in these big colleges with wealthy parents seeing what's going on and standing up about it is a big deal especially if it's happening in North Carolina because let me tell you that was not the commonality I am so proud of these kids and it breaks my heart that that girl has to stand up there and talk about her family dying to get people to listen to her to get people to listen to what's happening because this is absolutely heartbreaking it should not be happening these children should not be having to bear the brunt of what's going on but they are they're brave and they're bold and they're getting is done and I am so proud of them and I feel like we should all be trying to do our part to to do better because this is not right the the absolute pompous display of wealth is not right and the fact that the celebrities and these people of wealth and these billionaires like Taylor Swift are a part of what's the big talk right now and not what's going on when we're watching our neighbors being murdered our brothers and sisters get it together",

You posted a clip using the sound of Marianne Twinette at the exact moment that the people in Rafa were being attacked. Unalived babies, children, mothers, fathers. You chose to do that. Good to know. You paid $75,000 because there's no way that you got invited. No, you paid $75,000 to go to a rich people's party where they all get to pat each other on the back and congratulate each other for being rich. And you paid God knows how much for that rank looking dress. And then the cherry on top of that shit cake, you decided to make this video. I wonder how many families could have left a genocide with that amount of money. I wonder how many people you could have helped. I wonder how many people you could help, uh, just by making a video asking for people to help. Because your videos get over a million views. You've got 10 million followers. Just one video could raise tens of thousands of pounds or dollars to help people. But instead, you chose to do this. So when you're old and grey and your grandkids find this video, because remember, stays on the internet forever. And you're gonna have to explain why you were on the bad people's side. And oh my god, I'd pay $75,000 to see that.",

I cannot emphasize enough how much it does not matter if this creator, like she said in her comment section, only made this video using this sound because her dress was Marie Antoinette inspired. Whether it was your money or not, it cost $75,000 for you to be at that event last night. $75,000 that could have been used to help countless families trying to just survive. And not only does your presence at this event distract from the attack on Rafa, but then you go out of your way to callously make a video that perfectly exemplifies the disparity of empathy and support that exists within the class divide. And then you get upset with people and delete comments when they point that out. You are actively on the wrong side of history.",

Um, and of all the things that I have kept Palestinians in my heart, of all of the pain they're experiencing, a specific type of pain that I never considered. Because honestly, it's just, it's still kind of unfathomable to me that such a scenario even exist in real life. It's extremely dystopian. Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine.

    "voice_to_text": "quick disclaimer before I start the video this video is for education purposes only and wanted to actually stitch the creator but they had their stitches turned off so I had to get the video and will splice it into this one it is so weird to watch in real time the United States of America turning into Schmatzee Germany first of all,  that's not true it's actually the other way around. Schmatzee Germany was only possible because of what was happening in the United States of America. The man with the funny mustache and a lot of other Germans felt inspired by what Americans did to the Indigenous population as well as to Black Americans. it's wild to see like a well-oiled machine just like pumping out f6sc1sm and I laugh so I don't cry like I don't think it's funny please do not get it twisted and maybe read up on it because that's not a hidden part of history it is actually factual  all of these things bl33d into each other if I'm going to apply WS logic to this WS basically meant that you take away somebody else's \u270b\ud83c\udffb  and make them less than  so obviously what they did here they took away the \u270b\ud83c\udffb of a certain population (and others) that lead directly into the Shoah that's how they did it. and what's even worse is like feeling like there's nothing you can do about it right you just kind of have to watch in horror like a car accident or something and this is not a video I'm like what would you do what you would have done during the H0l0c6ust  or anything like that like this is an additional note out of the editing suite because I felt like I have to add more why not? why isn't this the right time to actually ask yourself the question? because if you already see it happening and you recognize it for what it is why aren't you doing anything? feeling helpless and powerless is one thing but now it's the right time to actually do something. get your \ud83c\udf51 up help the students help someone  heck, build community inside your community talk to people this is the right time instead of making that video and then just laughing about it even though it's not funny but it's just wild like to see in real time like oh, so that's how H got to be H and how 6 million people got unalived and this is not a video I'm like what would you do what you would have done during the H0l0c6ust? if not now, when is the right time? this was the right question. why are you saying this is not about that? because it is about that. it is. it's not really a surprise to me that a \u270b\ud83c\udffb American woman would basically think like that it's no surprise because apparently, Americans have not been told about how what was happening in their country  influenced another country in a different part of the world. but that's something that history classes have yet to rectify. because it is a fact.  anyone who wants to f1ght me in the comment section my \ud83d\udeab button is active",

Conversely if you went into the CPS, or if you're looking after a client who has a claim, you are taught how to twist language. You are looking for every comma, every full stop, is the word may, could, should, must? Every single word matters. It makes me very good in having arguments with people, but it also opens your mind to the English legal system, which covers England and Wales. Scotland is slightly different. I cannot speak for Scotland because I was not trained in Scottish law, but in England and Wales, you have to be a linguistic to really become successful, and that as boring as MUD that Keith sounds, he is very good at twisting language. That's what makes him dangerous. He was a barrister. He was a high level barrister. This is a highly educated man. He rose to the top of his profession. The only higher he could possibly have gotten was to have become a judge, and as a legal graduate, and as somebody who trained in the legal sphere, and as somebody who worked with solicitors and barristers, because he's now a politician, and politicians are all about spin, he CANNOT BE TRUSTED...",

One of these safe zones, zone 2, 3, 7, 1, was designated as a safe zone four days ago. They bombed it 60 times. This Arabic post is translated here. A journalist from Gaza says, I saw a child enter the burning tent after it was targeted in order to help his injured mother who could not walk. And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it. That's what John Kirby said. Biden has no issue with this, with bombing a designated safe zone that you lured children into four days ago 60 times.",

This is Nikki Haley, as in US presidential candidate Nikki Haley, writing a message on artillery shells that are in Israel, that are going to be fired into Gaza. Let's take a closer look at the message that she's written, shall we? It says, finish them, exclamation point. America heart Israel. Always Nikki Haley. I checked. This is being reported by many, many reputable sources. As you and I know very well by now, the US has continued to arm and fund this genocide that Israel is enacting upon the Palestinian people. Just last week, remember, the ICJ ordered Israel to stop its invasion of Rafa. Who continues to arm them anyway? The US. I need to remind us all that this is a legally binding order from the International Court of justice. When Israel, as well as the US as a boils, the 191 other countries that are member states of the UN, signed the UN Charter and became member states of the United Nations, they agree to be bound by the rulings of its court. So I just need to revisit all of this. Former US presidential candidate Nikki Haley writing a message and signing it on these artillery shells that Israel is using on Gaza. Finish them, exclamation point. America loves Israel. Always, Nikki Haley. This is a level of depraved. I do not know how To wrap my head around.

And I kind of take a little offense at the question. No civilian casualties is the right number of civilian casualties. And this is not something that we've turned a blind eye to, nor has it been something we've ignored or neglected to raise with our Israeli counterparts, including ED this weekend, as a result of this particular strike. Now they're investigating it, so let's let them investigate it and see what they come up with. But the president doesn't have, like, a personal limit to this. The president has been very clear and very direct about what our expectations are for Israeli operations in Rafa specifically. But in Gaza, red large. We don't support, we won't support a major ground operation in Rafa. And we've again been very consistent on that. And the president said that should that occur, then it might make him have to make different decisions in terms of support. We haven't seen that happen at this point, why not have him come out and say that himself? The president has been speaking to leaders throughout the region on a regular basis. He has been addressing you guys in various forum. You've got plenty of opportunities to talk to the president, including, I might add, in a press conference last week.",

    "voice_to_text": "so this is my random thoughts on some of the media that I've consumed over the last year I love the fact that so many books are being greenlit that's great that's wonderful the only problem is they're greenlining weird stuff and just casting anyone to be in it um some good ones that I saw was like turtle all the way down turtles all the way down um I think they acted that well and I think the story is really sweet um and there's someone struggling with anxiety I 100% related to the character maybe even a little bit too much I don't know some bad ones that I saw uh Copa Mia I know that everybody was really feeling it no hate no shade if you liked it um I just thought it was overacted like the guy just knew that he already looked the way people wanted him to look so he spent the entire movie like leaning in stuff or doing the raised eyebrow or the cheeky side thing and I was just like boy stop stop no we're not doing that just wasn't feeling that one and while I actually do like um the summer I turn pretty the one thing that I absolutely did not like was two things really one um that belly was doing the whole flip flop between brothers I think both brothers are valid in the way that they feel Jeremiah is valid to be angry at Conrad for keeping him a secret for so long Susanna shouldn't have done that to them in the fucking first place and I think um Conrad is okay to be the way he is even though it's a jerk move even though it's something that I definitely didn't like on her birthday being shitty I don't understand why he felt the need to do all that or mess it up her first date I kinda get it but at the same time no it was unnecessary you can't have your cake and eat it too if you want her to stay awake cause you don't feel well um because of everything going on with your mom fine but then you don't get to dictate who she can and can't date or mess up her dates so that that was messed up but his mother is actively dying I'm not gonna get mad at him for making stupid mistakes in his grieving process a lot of y'all either had a not great relationship with your mother or a lot of y'all are acting like his mother died seven years ago and he's just still feeling some kind of way no she's dying right now like right now like she this is during her death like he's not okay I thought that would be an understandable thing I don't know maybe that's just me um so yeah I think both brothers are valid in the way they've been acting but she did there's just no excuse other than I think that she was in denial for a long time and maybe that's what is messing her up she's jumping so much into guys instead of just accepting that Suzanne is dying and that she needs to deal with it um uh my life with the Walter brothers saw that and I feel like it's it's Netflix being cheeky because the author went to Amazon with the sunwriter and pretty instead of staying with Netflix for it so they scooped up my life with the Walter Brothers cause basically a gender bent version with a lot more boys um I thought the acting was okay and some of it was actors that I actually recognized so um from other things so that was cool um as far as the show goes um like I said she's she's grieving this is right after the death of her parents so she's not making the best of decisions I like that unlike belly she took herself out of the equation she realized that this wasn't good it wasn't good for them it wasn't good for her she wasn't in that kind of place and so she took herself away she should have never started anything at all with Alex in my personal opinion um because like I said she's not in the right place for that right now she's not looking to start a relationship she's trying to mourn the loss of one of the biggest relationships of her life so no she shouldn't have been she shouldn't been with any of them um I think Cole was sweet but I think people are hating on him because he's a player I mean he's a kid that's what they're supposed to do he's only in high school he he's not marrying any of these people but it was foul for him to mess with the best friend that was so foul but he did tell her like in his defense better than all the other ones better than than Conrad and all of them was he actually did tell his girlfriend I'm not looking for a relationship and she actively knew he was smashing other people so I mean to each their own I guess I don't know um and then one last thing to like I guess sum it up I guess I don't know something I just remember about the summer I turned pretty that irritated me was the eternal version trope where she's not just a version she's like the ultimate version like it's kind of excusable because belly supposed to be really young but I'm so sick and tired of main characters being virginal and like super virginal they've never kissed they never hug they've never had held hands they never had a date um and everyone around them is so experienced and but they just never they've never done anything like that it's like come on come on like a woman sexuality isn't tied up in whatever guy she likes she could have her own sexuality outside of the boys that she likes it's not necessary for it always be because of that certain guy that certain crush whatever it could be awakened because of him maybe but it could be a whole factor of things like there's guys who get hard due to fucking a curvy piece of driftwood oh girls have sexuality too you know come on now we don't need to constantly be putting in the eternal virgin trope every time and they always have the friends and the friends are always telling them wild stuff they did the main characters always like oh I was like come on just come on that's my random pop culture feelings right now",

So when Israel dropped the ton, the 2000 ton bomb on a refugee camp, that they said, this is a safe zone, right? They obliterated pieces. And a father was holding his child and the child had no head. Let me say that again. A father was holding his child and the child had no head. And that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg of what I saw. I saw a charred, lifeless, unable to move body. I saw a child who was still alive with half of his skull gone, taking a couple of his last breaths. And you know what these so called Israelis decided to do? Like. Like to scream, I'm not my government, I'm not my government. They took the picture of the father with his toddler, that his headless toddler, put it in a group chat and was laughing and cackling. The same so called Israelis who say, I am not my government, I am not my government, however, I'm going to block aid, I am not my government, I am not my government. However, I'm going to set fire to the West Bank and Ramallah and all the other parts of Palestine outside of Gaza. Miss me with the bullshit. You are your government. It is ingrained in your bloodline to hate Arab people, to hate brown people and to hate black people.",

    "voice_to_text": "Every Saturday night it's movie night, and there is no movie night that's complete without a good selection of snacks. So I started by making some cookies and cream ice cream. Combine some milk and sugar with some vanilla and heavy cream before putting it in my ice cream Turner to churn. It reached soft serve consistency. I added in my cookies, let that go until everything was incorporated. I don't know what it is about cookies and cream ice cream. It's so good to me right now. Pop that in the freezer to chill while I got started on making some pretzel dough. He loves pretzel bites, so I made these for him, combined all of my ingredients, and then kneaded the dough for letting it rise for about 30 minutes. In the meantime, I got started on making some gummy worms, so I blended up some strawberries and raspberries. In the meantime, I heated up some apple juice and gelatin in my pot until it was all dissolved for combining the two and then spooning it into my mold. I let these set in the fridge while I worked on my pretzel dough. After about 30 minutes, I cut it up in six pieces and rolled those out into little ropes. Once I did that with all of my six pieces, I cut them up into smaller bite size pieces. They don't all have to be perfect. And I drop them in some boiling water with some baking Soda before pulling them out, salting them, and then baking them until they were golden brown. All those were cooling off. I got my gummy worms out of the fridge. I wanted them to be slightly sour, so I sprinkled them with some citric acid and then moved on to the last thing I was gonna make with some popcorn. No movie night is complete without a big bowl of buttered popcorn. Drizzled it with melted butter and some flaky sea salt before I pulled my ice cream out and served us up a bowl of that as well. At this point I was so ready to go watch the movie and eat all of the snacks.",

    "voice_to_text": "So let me get this straight. Last week it was fuck celebrities, fuck the Met Gala, fuck anyone who dared participate in that ostentatious show of wealth, regardless of what sort of work they've been doing for Palestine. But this week, for the Cannes Film Festival red carpet, it's, oh, my god, slay queen, make a stand, treatment, free Palestine. This week, we're defending celebrities because of the obvious, like, racism and things that they experience and the way that they were mistreated within the industry. Last week it was fuck celebrities. This week it's see celebrities as human. I only got two questions. What the fuck are y'all smoking, and why aren't you sharing? Like, what's happening? Are we actually going to be divesting from celebrity culture? Are we just temporarily pissed off at celebrities and trying to leverage social power to make them do what we want? Are y'all just pissed off and you want a target to aim your anger at? That is socially acceptable? So we just decided to hate on celebrities for a week, even though y'all aren't actually serious about untangling the social position of celebrities and how they function and what we can do to make things better? Is that what it is? Y'all just pissed off? Like, I personally think reactionary politic is bad, but apparently that's just how things are going to be on social media. So can we at least acknowledge and embrace that's the way things are? And then Work more strategically around it. Cause I'm personally tired of having like, a different moral purity shit test every week. How about y'all? last week's moral purity shit test was around capitalism and wealth. If you don't hate celebrities, you're wrong. This week's Moral Purity shit test seems to be more based around racism. If you don't defend people of color, you're wrong. Yo, I. I wanna get off of Mister Bones wild ride. I'm tired of this stupid fucking game where we choose a different marginalized identity to put on the pedestal in the Oppression Olympics every week. I'm fucking tired.",

Also, if it has white dust on the rind. I feel like I've definitely bought a watermelon with white dust. I just kind of, like, figured it was from, like, the transit in the watermelon trucks. And apparently you should look for ones that have the yellow patch, which I have always been told make your watermelon sweeter if it has a yellow patch on it. You know, like, you always see people tapping the watermelons, right? Isn't that how you learn to pick a watermelon? That's how I Learned to pick a watermelon.

    "voice_to_text": "Just said that there's no mathematical formula as you evaluate Israel's, um, events of Rafa. But the administration repeatedly has said that the US will not support a large scale ground invasion. So how do you define large scale ground invasion? And then secondly, um, has the president's broken promise to visit Africa created any challenges as you try to deepen relationships with the countries there? The president would really look forward to visiting Africa. He intends to do so as president of the United States. I obviously don't have anything to announce today, but if you look at the breath of his personal engagement on this issue, including being a president, the first in 20 years to actually host an African leader for a state visit here, I think it shows, along with the specific, tangible policy actions that he has taken, including most recently, by the way, an overlooked part of the national security supplemental was funding actually to help emerging economies, including in Africa. Um, you know, his record will stand for himself. And. And we believe that what today will showcase is not questions about the US commitment, but answers that the US is actually delivering for Africa, for the African people, in this case, for the country of Kenya, but also with Kenya, for the broader continent. In terms of how we look at Rafa, as I've said before, the key concern that we have is major maneuvers into dense urban areas. And that continues to Be something that we will look at. What we have seen so far has not been that. What unfolds in the coming days is something that we will review closely day by day, and will continue to take briefings from Israel about how they are refining their approach, in part based on concerns that we have expressed to them. So this is something that will be a continuing source of engagement and conversation between the two of us. And I'll keep you posted as we assess how things are unfolding. Yeah.",

Whatever the case may be, by all means, please unfollow. I will unfollow people like that. As soon as they start disrupting my peace, I'm leaving. Cause a girly will protect her peace and I so highly recommend that you do the same. So if I'm disrupting your peace, by all means feel free to unfollow. And I'm sorry that it came to that. If there's something that you don't like in my videos or the way I'm going about things you think is wrong, by all means reach out. I love talking to you guys. I Learned so, so much from my followers. Genuinely, you guys are some of the smartest people I've ever met. But at the end of the day, if you think that leaving a comment saying well, you're not doing things my way, so you lost my support is going to change anything, it's not. Respectfully, I don't need your support. I appreciate it. Genuinely and whole heartedly, I love you guys so much, but I'm not going to change the way I do things just to accommodate you. And to think that I should is narcissism. You are more than welcome to go advocate for Whatever cause you have and whatever way that pleases you, you're more than welcome to have an open dialogue with me about the way that I do things. But you're not going to do this. On top of the fact, I'd also like to point out, if somebody says something wrong very publicly, then I'm going to very publicly correct them. And I expect people to do the same to me. Because when you publicly spread misinformation and then only correct it privately, you are letting that misinformation spread and grow. And I will not be accommodating Hamas misinformation campaign against innocent Israelis. So Miss Rachel felt comfortable saying what she had to say publicly. I feel comfortable calling her out publicly, and that's just what it's gonna be.",

A friend from the flotilla, quiver Butterley, has asked us to keep the pressure on when it comes to Minister Jack Chambers and asking him to flag the flotilla. The uplifters would have received the email here in the background. You can pause to read it there. You can follow the red buttons there to get to the email link, or you can click on our profile picture just over here, which should take you to a profile. Sometimes you're gonna have to press a little button here that will drop it down and then our linktree is just here, the link above Instagram. The top link on our linktree should be email Jack Chambers to let them sell. I can take you to the email to target page here on the uplift website where you click next. So just confirm who you are, your details there and about you are. You can put in not in Ireland if you're not in Ireland and then finally you can send the email as we've written it, or you're welcome to edit it and change it yourself. There is a lot of moving parts when it comes to getting the flotilla flag. However, we are doing our best here and we're asking everyone for their support in both sharing the petition and sending on the emails to Minister Chambers. That petition is at nearly 19,000 signatures. It would be great to see it get to 20. It's always together. We are uplift. And together we can be the people. Power change. Good luck.",

Watch the moment Al Jazeera White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett challenges the US national security advisor after he said the US does not view Israel's killings of Palestinians in Gaza as 'genocide'. #news #breakingnews ",
    "voice_to_text": "You said at the start of this that you don't believe what's happening in Gaza is genocide. What criterion are you using? We're using the internationally accepted term for genocide, which includes a focus on intent. It's not just me standing here at this podium in the context of this International Court of justice case at The Hague. The United States actually made a presentation backed up by legal analysis, which I would invite you to read, because it lays out all of those criteria. Francesca Albanese, especially you, in repertoire on human rights and Palestine, presented one in March. She presented it in Geneva. The three criterion she used. Setting international law, three acts. Israel's intent to destroy national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Serious bodily or mental harm to a group. Inflicting on a group conditions of life. Calculate to bring physical destruction in hole or in part within. Imposing measures intend to prevent birth within the group process of erasure of the native Palestinians. So those three things are happening. How can you say genocides not being committed? As I just told you? I think the best way for me to answer that question is actually to ask you to look at the lay down that we gave, which saying, this isn't happening. I'm sorry, I thought you asked me how I can say it. I'm saying I'd like you to look at. The United States is asking you saying this isn't happening. Do you mind if I finish answering Your question before you. Are you saying that she's a liar? The United States is laid down at the International Court of justice in writing in detail its position on this issue, and I'd ask you to read it. Thank you. Are you saying that it doesn't line up for them with what she's saying",

But every donation helps. Even if you just donate a dollar, a couple people are just donating dollars more than enough. If multiple people do that, it can do a lot of good. Here you go, Luna. Yeah, take it. And um, yeah, it. Every donation helps. There are tons of creators that are also posting other families. So if you wanna donate to multiple families, do that, share. Sounds that, uh, the proceeds get donated to families in need. Repost videos, use filters. There's tons of stuff that you can do that won't require you to spend money and you can still find an impact. Don't be greedy. Don't be greedy, huh? So yeah, if you can do that, please do.

Explain what's going on inside the synagogue. Is a real estate sale. Is it? Real estate sale? Selling stolen property which was stolen. The stolen land that was stolen from the Palestinian people. As Jewish people, we should not steal and we should not sell stolen property. According to Judaism, if one shares with a thief, is considered a thief. And especially when this is happening while this genocide is taking place in Gaza. This mass murder of the Palestinian people is unacceptable. And the danger that the occupation of Palestine is causing for Jews. And on top of all, why in a synagogue? Why in a holy place? This is either a political move or a financial move. All of this is embarrassing for Jewish people, and as I said, dangerous to Jewish people as well. We should be very careful. Never allowed the completion of Zionists, would you? If one criticizes Zionists. I appreciate that, and I'll tell you why. Because I appreciate the people that define the right definition to what they criticize. Rather than criticizing Jews, which I discouraged to do. I visited Gaza. Yeah, and they did meet me. We are here to teach the world. We are here to teach the Palestinian, the suffering people of Palestine. We are here to teach the Jewish religion and to teach the Masses that this is criminal and this is wrong",

And the circumstances are really unusual and crazy because it was in the alleyway of just a huge apartment complex. There's like, apartments everywhere, and people were home. And she's screaming for help and screaming for help, and no, there's no help. Later, when they interviewed all the tenants, they were like, why didn't you call 9 1 1? And they were like, oh, I thought somebody else would call 9 1 1. Thus, to get the spy standard effect, which is literally thinking, somebody else is gonna do it, so you don't do anything. Now, it's interesting cause we're having this, like, online version of this now with what's going on in Palestine. You're just thinking, oh, somebody else is gonna donate. Somebody else is gonna do something. I have 1.7 million followers. Every single one of you donated 14 cents. Literally the coin sitting at the bottom of your bag right now. The family that I've been paired with through the past, the Hat Project, would have enough money to flee to Cairo with all 14 members of their family. If you stay for this long, you'll notice this bar, and if interacted as the bar is telling you to, you've already given me 14 cents. If you can donate more, the link is in my bio. So far, we raised almost $7,000. A lot of the donations are small, but they're impactful because 400 donations made $7,000. You can make a difference. You do not have to be a bystander. Thank you so much for watching. Love You. Bye.",

Every time I rented an apartment, upwards of 100 Congress members actually sleep in their office cause it's expensive. Washington's expensive. All of us ought to be concerned about the future in terms of who can afford to do this. Do you want it to still be the house of the people, or do you want it to be only wealthy people? I think that it's important to have cost of living adjustments. I think there needs to be at least an inflationary adjustment. I think it should at least keep up with inflation. It. It should probably go up with the cost of living. Congress works better when you have a broad swath of the American people being able to run and get elected. I really believe that.",

I texted her and asked her which one she got and she said hers was lighter. So only $8 which is better than $34. You guys remember when I bought a 34 watermelon in Hawaii? Now if you're the person that keeps commenting and telling me where I could get orange watermelon in Janesville or close to Janesville or somewhere near Janesville, let me know again. I'm gonna screenshot it and save it to my favorites because I keep asking you, okay? And I keep forgetting. So the video where I thought I got an orange watermelon but it was organic got like 23 million views and people are still commenting on it telling me how stupid I am. But like, it's okay because that video made me like over $5,000 just in views. But still, I'm like, they exist. People are telling me they don't exist. They're like, do you mean cantaloupe? No, no, no, no, I don't. Hi. I mean orange watermelon. They exist. I tried a yellow one and I was not the biggest fan. They didn't get like a sweet one because I'm sure there's ripe and unripe yellow watermelons also, so maybe I'll try A yellow watermelon again this year. Alright, you guys ready?

    "voice_to_text": "So Donald Trump just got some terrible news. And it shows you that even people in the Republican Party do not like him. So the Republican presidential primary took place in Indiana tonight, and with 76% of the votes in, Donald Trump won. He got 404,000 votes, 78.1% of the vote. But the problem is Nikki Haley, someone who dropped out two months ago, is not campaigning for president, got over 20% of the vote. As things stands, 113 thousand Republicans said, no, I'm not gonna vote for Donald Trump. I'm gonna vote for a candidate who's not even in the race. The Republican Party is not united behind Donald Trump. When you're losing 22% of the vote to a candidate who hasn't been in the race for two months, that shows you that this guy right here, not that popular. There are a lot of Republicans out there who won't be voting for Donald Trump in 2024, or will even be voting for President Biden. These numbers are devastating for Trump in his campaign.",

Did you know that posting one 1 video about a family in Gaza or about Palestine, you could have raised tens of thousands of dollars? Because followers with one tenth of what you have posted and they got 20,000. But you didn't. You're at the Met Gala wearing a dress that again cost thousands. That could go to the people of Gaza that are currently actively going through a genocide. In fact, they invaded Rafa during the Met Gala. Well, thousands of people protested outside the Met Gala and I know you saw them cause they were there. And now you post this video with this sound. And my thing is, what's the point? Like, I'm going off the Assumption that you have a lot of followers cause you're a cool person that people like to follow and you're a good person internally. So. So why did you do this? And I don't mean like you can't do anything cause bad things are always happening in the world. The invasion of the only safe place that happened while you were posting this video. And an act of genocide that we can all see. And of course it's not your responsibility or job to speak up, you don't have to. But why don't you want to? And instead post this video the same day?",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm coming to you from Rafa, Gaza Strip. I am a midwife from the United States who has been in Rafa for the last week to provide healthcare support at Emirati Maternity Hospital, which is the last maternity hospital in all of Gaza Strip. This hospital was originally built to support the small community of Rafa, which was just a couple of thousand people. They had, on average about 70 births a month. And now, as there have been over a million people internally displaced to Rafa, 15 births a month, the staff here also has been displaced. There are not a lot of supplies. There is not enough of anything for anybody, but in particular for mothers and babies. The Israeli forces have started attacking East Rafa, and they have also taken over the Rafa border crossing. The Rafa border crossing is a really important place for Palestinians to receive aid, as Israel has blockaded most of the aid coming into Gaza. Rafa border crossing has been one of the only places where healthcare workers like myself have been able to get across the border to provide help and care. Most healthcare supplies going into Gaza have been from healthcare workers coming into volunteer with. The closing of this border means a large exacerbation of the siege on Gaza and is a direct and eminent threat to the healthcare of all people, but in particular to pregnant and birthing people and newborns. What we are seeing is that pregnancy during Genocide means no prenatal care, a lack of diagnosis of prenatal conditions, a lack of diagnosis of congenital issues with babies. A lack of diagnosis and an increase in intrauterine fetal demise. Women are coming in to the hospital to deliver with us, and it's the first time they have seen a healthcare provider in their pregnancies. They're very upsetting things that are happening. We're seeing babies being born with congenital anomalies and the mother had no idea. We're seeing mothers who have lost so much, they've lost their family, their lives, their homes. We're seeing mothers who are too small, too skinny, too thin to be full term in pregnancy. We're seeing babies that are too small and too little to be full term. As I sit here now, sitting outside, I am hearing what it sounds like in Rafa, which is essentially a playground. There are six hundred thousand children in Rafah, and you can hear it. It's constant. They are so cute and they are running around and they are playing and they are making the most of this. But there are so many children. If Israel continues to attack Rafah, Israel will be massacring children. Anything beyond a ceasefire will be a direct attack on children, on pregnant people, on birthing people, on newborns, on babies, on the innocent and on all innocent Palestinians, a dignified people who deserve so much more respect, who deserve health care, who deserve autonomy and who are not getting it. It is now the time for you to do everything you can to call upon your governments, to call upon whoever you can for ceasefire and also an end to the siege on Gaza, so that humanitarian aid can really get into this country, which is what is needed, what is necessary, and what is deserved. Palestinians deserve dignity, and it is our job to fight in every way possible to make that happen.",

Over the last 6 months, more than 124 people in my family have been brutally killed by the Israeli occupation forces. For the last six months, I have to wake up to messages of my cousin being shot on his bike, of my aunt going blind because she can't get medicated for her blood pressure, of my entire uncle's house falling down on them. Everyone in that home died. Jesus. I like to see photos like my family and body bags make the rounds on Twitter. I have to see my last name scroll on them in black ink. This morning I got the news that the home that's been sheltering part of my family for the last 6 months has been fully evacuated. Last night, pamphlets drops all around their neighborhood. Last night, their next door neighbor was bombed, and everyone in that home was killed. The pamphlet said, you have to leave now. You have to evacuate now or face the violence of the Israeli occupation. My ox foot's been broken for 6 months. She's never received treatment. Most of my cousins are sick, hungry, tired. There's been no food, there's no water. They've been drinking sea water since week 3, trying to survive. And they've now evacuated the structure that was keeping them Out of the fucking cold, by the way. No windows, no doors. All those are pulling off my bombs now. They're headed to Morossi, a coastal, quote, unquote safe zone in Gaza. Hoping they'll find a tent to sleep in.",

Today is our love letter to the people of US up and to the people of Palestine. We have watched them stead, fastly, and patiently and bravely stand in the face of the oppressors, in a way with Grace and in a way with faith. Inspired by them, we decided to do the same this Monday. And I can say that we are the first in the UC system so peacefully we have on this campus that shares our vision of justice, that shares our vision to be progressive, that shares our vision of protecting our students. We have decided to dissolve this encampment without a single arrest, a single one of you being put in harm's way, so we will no longer be complicit in the crimes perpetrated against my people. Yeah! We have four very clear demands going into this. First, we demand a transparency. We needed the university to disclose all of their investments and endowments, specifically as it relates to arms and weapons manufacturing. We can say that the university has agreed to make it entirely transparent which companies we are investing in and the size of those investments. And we will Continue to call for transparency moving forward. Following that, we called on this administration to end their silence. Chancellor Wilcox has recognized the death toll and Liza. And we will continue to figure out ways for this administration to support you students here. Next, we called on divestment. I am confident that we have outlined concrete, legitimate steps for us to no longer be complicit through our financial. Through our financial engagements at this university. We are going in the right direction, and I am confident we will fully divest from weapons and arms manufacturing by the end of next year. Actually, I'm not gonna make any promise. Lastly, we call for our full academic boycott. Students at UC Riverside will no longer be able to walk the lands that I am prohibited from. At this university. Will no longer be able to see my Holy Land that I embarked from. As long as there's an apartheid state in occupied Palestine, students at the university of California, Riverside will not walk the land that I am banned from. Yeah. I just wanna thank every single person who has invested in this encampment anyway, materially, emotionally. To the people who Venmo, to the people who dropped off food, to the people who slept here, to the people who sent words of support, to the medics who volunteered, to our legal observers, to our police liaisons, our media liaisons, to every single person who offered support, every single person who visited, to The children who blew bubbles. To the people who drew the talk, to the people who put up the signs, to the people who stood that fast with us. I want to thank you, because this is your win. No, this is all yours. I want to. I want to also say.",

    "voice_to_text": "New York Times opinion released a fucking humiliating article today about the student encampments. It includes the quote protesters have demands, including divestment and cutting off ties with IZZY. But ending relations with IZZY doesn't help Gauzens. And on the contrary, it's useful for universities to have exchanges with a broad range of places, including those whose policies we disagree with. Doesn't help gazens to stop sending money for bombs. Guys, like, at this point, are you just, like, lying for fun? The top comment on this article, thank god. Was a great MLK quote. To sum it up, it's over the last few years, I've been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. The great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the this thing that I'm not gonna say, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action. There's another line in the article that stood out to me and many commenters. You know, I admire your empathy for Gauzens, but what about the risks to commencements? Oh, goodness, you're right. Commencement speeches in G Slide clearly carry the same weight. Shut up, Nick. No meaningful changes ever come about by asking nicely. Nice to know you care more about property damage than human lives. Isn't this the exact same thing every old white pro war dude Has said about activists ever. The New York Times has had a lot of fumbles recently, but this guy saying that it's useful for universities to have exchanges with places whose policies we disagree with has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever read.",

HR 6 0 9:00 0 known as the Anti Semitism Awareness Act will redefine anti Semitism as set forth by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance for the enforcement of federal anti discrimination laws. What does that mean? Well, if you say that Israel is a racist state, that's anti Semitism. If you draw comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, that's also anti Semitism in practice. If this Bill also passes in the Senate, it would be illegal for Americans to voice opinions such as how Israel cannot be by definition both a Jewish state and a Liberal democracy. As this op ed in the Jerusalem Post points out, this would be anti Semitic and illegal to say. Or how it's racist for there to be segregated roads that separate Palestinian and Jewish settlers in Jerusalem. Criticism like these would also be considered anti Semitic and therefore would be legal to say. Even though this is in harats. Or if you wanna criticize the IDF, their shoot first, ask later policy, that is also anti Semitic and therefore you would not be allowed to say it. It's funny, you could bash America all day long, but if you dare voice criticism of Israel, then that would not only make you an anti Semite, but in the future that could also mean that You could be sued, persecuted or sanctioned by the federal government",

I set you a Venmo for $36 for food and supplies. So this other mom said, like, thanks for the hospitality, but this is, like, a price gouging scheme to, like, make money. And they called it like, a Bill. I had a feeling that this might happen. So while her son was over, I just kept on my notes tab a running tab of everything that her son used during the playdate. I made sure to put all the food her son ate. I counted the number of pumps that they used of soap when he washed his hands, they played video games for 45 minutes, so I calculated how much that electricity cost was and then divided it by two. So for my son and her son. And then he did spill his juice on the carpet, so I charged a cleanup fee, which just is my time for cleaning it up and the cleaning supplies that I used.

What you just saw was a video of an Israeli quad copter being recorded in Gaza. A quad copter, for those of you who don't know, is sort of shorthand for one of these small Israeli drones that are used by Israeli occupational forces. Those drones are generally tasked with multiple things, ranging from surveillance to the outright murder of Palestinians. And in fact, recently, the organization Euromed Human Rights Monitor released a report claiming that Israeli occupational forces are systematically using quadcoppers to kill Palestinians from a close distance in Gaza. They note that the IOF has been using these small drones to fire directly at Palestinians, killing and injuring many. And from the data and testimony they were able to obtain, they found that Israeli sniping operations, killings and executions primarily target unarmed civilians in shelter centers, hospital streets, and populated residential areas. These civilians posing no threat or danger to anyone as they are not participants in any hostilities. Really critical to understand that, right. Israeli occupational forces are using snipers and these quadcopter drones to execute Palestinians in places like shelter centers, hospitals, just around the street and within populated residential areas. In effect, Israeli occupational forces, in the midst of their ongoing genocide in Gaza, are waging a systematic mechanized campaign of extrajudicial killings. And these quadcopters are playing a major Role helicopter is being used for an even more nefarious purpose, as it was playing the recordings of a crying child. The intent there is to get Palestinians to come out of the areas in which they're sheltering and or hiding because they're, you know, wanting to help a child in need. So that Israeli occupational forces can murder them. I want you to really let that sink in. Israeli occupational forces are using the recordings of crying children on their drones to lure out Palestinians so that they can murder them. That is a sort of twisted, undeniable evil that many of us will likely struggle to wrap our heads around. But it is just one part of a much larger, brutal genocide being waged against Palestinians in Gaza in across occupied Palestine. As Palestinians in Gaza are hiding and trying to avoid Israeli bombardment and invasion, Israeli occupational forces are upping their strategies in order to essentially hunt Palestinians for sport. Something really, really worth thinking on. But he has always free Palestine. Salamo. They come. Until next time.",

We really do, because I'm looking at my for you page, and I haven't made a video about it yet, but, like, Iran is doing a lot of stuff, um, launching missiles to Israel and stuff like that. War 3 stirrings are happening again, even though World War 3 is basically already started. It's just that your empire hasn't announced it yet. But I'm seeing a lot of glamorizing of war, and I need you guys to understand that war is never good. It may be necessary, but it's not something to be happy hype about. I saw a creator on here saying, let's get ready to rumble at the news about Iran launching missiles. Do you understand that there's a genocide going on right now? What the fuck are you happy about? One, Israel already has the Iron Dome, so it's gonna take a lot more than what Iran is doing to penetrate and actually inflict real harm upon Israel. 2. The Palestinian people are still going to be affected in a negative way regardless of what every other country is doing to Israel in the United States. So again, I'm not saying it's not necessary to get to this point in which we're potentially going into a World War 3, even though War 3 has started. Like I said before, but it's not anything to be happy about. So please, for the content creators that are making major money off of this news dissemination, Put down the sensationalism and go back to talking about the people that are being affected. Or at the very least, if you're gonna talk about the potential of World War 3, don't be happy about it. It's just a request, bro. Just a request.",

And you'll get these right here. Put a popsicle stick in it just so it's easier to hold. Now pull out your fruit roll UPS, and now it's pretty simple. You just wrap it. The hardest part is when the watermelons wet, keep slipping off. But you'll get it and it'll look like this. I made a bunch of them. I made blue, yellow, orange, all types of colors. Now we're gonna grab our chamoy or Tajin. And I'm making a bunch of them because my little cousins told me to make these. Somehow they always know the trends before me. I dipped it in my chamoy, dropped it in my Tajin, and now these things look insane. Squirted some lime on top and took a bite. It was sour as hell cause I used so much Tajin, but it was. Now see what my little cousins think about it. They threw some lemon on it, and Jake just dipped his whole entire watermelon into Chamoy. But for the most part, that look fire.",

This means the unconditional release of the Osages in Gaza now. The Protection of civilians. Hospitals, UN facilities, shelters and schools. Now. More food, more water, more medicine and, of course, fuel. Entering Gaza safely, swiftly. And that the scale needed now. And feathered access to deliver supplies to all people in need in Gaza now. And the end of the use of civilians is human Shields. Now, none of these appeals should be conditional on the others. And for all of these, we need more funding. Now!",
