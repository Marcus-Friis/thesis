Uh, this is very impressive, but, um, we're completely undermining any basic, uh, problem solving skills for some reason here. Like, parents usually say that games are fucking stupid. They don't teach you anything. Well, using a co pilot for learning Minecraft is one of those things. Like, kids actually have really good problem solving skills, and because of gaming like this. This is weird. Also, making a sword first in Minecraft is kind of stupid. Like, um, getting a pickaxe or an axe is way more important. So it's impressive, but still needs a lot of work, so. Yeah.

Only for you do I do this. This generational war put Gen X. That's not fair to you guys. That's. That's not fair. That's like sending you to war with a BB gun and I got a tank. That's just not fair. I don't believe in that. They're gonna come for me when they see this video. But hopefully the swiftly thing got rid of them for a minute. Not that they hate Taylor Swift, they just don't give a fuck like you guys did. They probably swiped off me. Alright. Anyway, I'm looking around cause I'm telling you, they're gonna come for me. I'm gonna give you the nuclear option. You got you. You will need it. Gen X is making you cry. Take exploiting the fact that you know, you, you. You didn't. Whatever. Alright, this is what you're gonna do. You gotta go to Google step by step instructions here. You're gonna click the little tab that says images and you're gonna type in in the search bar never ending story, eight tracks, swamp scene. You're gonna See, one certain image come up a lot. The one right near the shore. Kid pulling on a bridle of the horse. You're gonna find the highest quality of that image you can get. You're gonna download it to your phone or device. Then you are gonna make sure that is now your unlock screen. This won't harm you so long as you don't. This is the nuclear option. You do not ever handle the uranium. Do not watch the never ending story. However, if that image is your unlock screen and a Gen Xer is making you start to get the water works, you wanna shut that shit down. If you wanna go nuclear, and you are going nuclear, unlock your phone and then turn it around and point it at him like he was holding up a cross to a vampire. After that, you should run. Because when they done crying, they're coming for you. But you now have a nuke in your back pocket. Use it with distraction. They're gonna kill me for telling you that. That's the. I feel the number my bounty hunter count like it just went up. But I do believe in a fair fight. Oh, so fucked. You know, before I made this movie, I cried. Or this movie before I made this video, I cried. Yeah, that shit will kick Gen X right in the fucking dick. But like I said, after that fucking run.",

With all the amazing video game movies that came out recently, I think this hopefully will do really good. Especially since they got Jack Black who is really good at video or he likes video games a lot. And Jason Momoa who is just like very funny.

And I realized that there was a better way. So I was giving them the, um, like a hint, and they were like, okay, cool. And they said, I've probably been playing Minecraft for longer than you've been alive. And one kid said, well, how long have you been alive for? And I said, for 21 years. That's double digits. And he looked at me like I was a fossil. And then I realized I was not kidding. Let's say I've been playing Minecraft for 11 to 12 years. That is older than that kid was probably even an idea.",

After they leave the post office in their driving way, she actually opens the package and then throws it at him when she realizes that there is a live rattlesnake inside. This package had actually been mailed on may the 3rd. It had a return address of Florida, but it was actually mailed from Hayward, California, which is outside of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Elijah Bowles lives south of there in San Bernardino County, which is outside of Los Angeles. He went on to say that the snake was about two feet long and that whoever meld the snake put cotton balls inside the box so that people working with the Postal Service would not hear the snake rattle. The center actually wrote the word fragile in the box and then mailed it from Hayward, California on may the third, and the box had just been sitting there at that post office for several days before Elijah Bowles picked it up. Now Animal Control got the snake and took the snake and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office is investigating.",

    "voice_to_text": "Microsoft has changed gaming forever. One of our developers, Ryan, simply shared his screen with Co Pilot while he was playing Minecraft. Now, what you're gonna see here is two voices. The first will be Ryan, the second will be Co pilot. And he's gonna be having a natural conversation like he would with a friend while he plays. Let's watch this experience. Hey, co pilot, how's it going? Hey, I'm doing great. And it looks like you're about to dive into some Minecraft. Ready to build, explore, and maybe dive a few miles? Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to make a sword. My son plays this game all the time and I have no idea what I'm doing. No worries. I'm here to help you impress your son. I see you've got a crafting table in front of you, which is a great start. To craft a sword, you'll need some materials. Can you open your inventory? Just press E on your keyboard. Yeah. Do I have what I need? Let's see, you got some sticks perfect for the sword's handle. But it looks like you're missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold or diamond. Alright, let's pause it there for a second. Did you see how co pilot not only could understand that he was in Minecraft, but he could also understand Ryan's request for help and assess the inventory on his screen? Well, it gets better as Ryan continues. He gets surprised that co pilot amazingly identified and it tailored interaction. Let's watch. Let's start by gathering some wood or stone. Shall we head out and find some resources? Yeah, that sounds great. Oh my god, what's that? Oh no. It's a zombie! Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach. If you can find a shelter or dig into the side of the hill, do it now. Just make sure it can't reach you. Alright, I think I might be safe now. Cool. That was a close one. Great job finding shelter. So that was honestly for us.",

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

There are actions I don\u2019t take not because they are inherently evil, but because it is my responsibility to build relationships that set emotionally and developmentally appropriate expectations for kids. Transference is natural, but this teacher\u2019s behaviors consistently invite a transfer of parental or romantic emotions from students to him.

This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

    "voice_to_text": "Minecraft creators on YouTube are in a bit of trouble. Minecraft has recently updated their end user license agreement and commercial guidelines. There's a lot of things in here, but specifically there are changes for streamers and content creators alike. For example, content creators on YouTube can no longer use the word Minecraft as the primary title of their video. They gave us a couple of examples here. So Minecraft the ultimate help app not okay. The shaft a Minecrafters podcast. That one's good. Additionally, creators can no longer pay while their content behind. Maybe some kind of members only content situation? Minecraft assets such as logos and fonts can't be used in ways that promote mods, servers, or worlds that are not related to Minecraft. Minecraft servers need to be for all ages, and those servers must include an entry process that has a disclaimer stating not an official Minecraft product. That's just some of the changes going on here, and this is an important lesson to gaming content creators. At the end of the day, if you make content on YouTube that revolves around a video game, you are at the mercy of these companies deciding what's okay and what's not.

That's just enough space for all of your friends. If you're up for the challenge, you can build this in your own Java Edition world with this Lightmatic schematic or the world download is available for bedrock and Java Edition.
