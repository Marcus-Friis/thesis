You wouldn't think, would you, that he has justified putting Gaza under complete, under complete siege. That is abstained on one cease via vote and sabotaged another. That he refuses to support an arms embargo on Israel. And that is being instrumental in amplifying and perpetuating a deceptive myth, uh, that of Israel's mass displacement and extermination of the Palestinian people as an act of self defence. That has been used to shroud these war crimes and crimes against humanity in assemblance of legitimacy. Which has in turn been used to manufacture the consent of the public for these and other reasons. Kirstama's pretended concern in the face of the massacre of displaced Palestinians in a refugee camp in Rafa. This functions essentially as political grooming. It is intended to condition or manipulate the public by presenting a false political persona of him in contrast to his true nature. In order to entrap the public in a continued relationship with the right wing war mongering Labour Party. A release of retaining their votes from election time in July.",

He actually reached out to me on Instagram to try to get the word out about his gofundme, um, because he is trying to evacuate his family of 13 people.

Wages are so stagnant that people can hardly afford groceries; Target recently (basically) admitted that, \"yeah, we inflated our prices for funsies\" and now they're deflating them because of all the complaints about people being unable to afford shit. And this is what you're talking about? THIS is the most important thing you think you could possibly talk about at this point in time?! There are families in Gaza that don't exist anymore! There are entire genealogical pools that have been *wiped off the face of the earth*. There are people in Rafa begging for help. We are watching the wholesale destruction, slaughter and eradication of an entire people group; but you think strangers' genitals and which bathrooms they should use is the most important thing we can be fucking discussing right now?! What rock do you live under? What do you smoke? What do you drink? Because I would love some. I would love to be so detached and delusional and completely unaware of the world around me, so that I can be just as oblivious and focus on things that don't matter, just like you. I would love that! But no, instead, I wake up every day thinking about Palestine and how I'm unable to fucking help anybody because I'm broke, how all of my money has to go to rent, otherwise I will end up homeless. My thoughts are consumed about the deteriorating life of every American in this country, and how we are just watching a genocide happen in full goddamn view of everyone and God,  and you are sitting on your butt, in your bathroom, with your 4 inch baby pink acrylics, talking about genitals!! I think what hurts me the most is that there are so many people just like you, who literally don't give a darn about how the average American is this close to homelessness with every paycheck, and how there's entire families just gone, off the face of the planet. I hate you, but in a way I envy you. I envy the fact that you can hear all of this shit going on, hear about the misery and the frustrations and the unhappiness, and still be wholly consumed by whether or not somebody has a weenie. I don't know how.. but somehow I envy that.",

Hamas is only one faction (from the culture of Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region) of Israel's closest enemies that wanna completely wipe them out Israel simply wants to remove them from power and before people start spewing the Hamas propaganda one has to consider how much the Palestinian people have suffered under the hand of Hamas Yes we want the safety of children but it won't happen until Hamas is gone",

If you're a Mafia boss and your foot soldiers get arrested and you happen to be next, you should be arrested, no question. You're the swamp. But even without that, reality is this. The USA still has The Hague Invasion Act. It doesn't actually need any new laws, because at the end of the day, they could always use all available means to go and get their people back once they've been arrested before trial, or even during it, or even after it. Because the terms of Afghanistan at Lindsey Graham was talking about with the initial set of circumstances that put The Hague Invasion Act on the table and made it law. Because some US personnel were then put under the control of commanding officers from other nations, including the UK, with the view to carrying out security operations in Afghanistan. What they were worried about was that war crimes might be ordered by the senior officers of those commanding nations, whereas Afghanistan, USA, the UK or any others. So what they didn't want to do is that war crimes would be ordered, they would then be carried out, and they didn't then want to be tried for it. That was actually the original basis from which this came about. Since then, of course, as the law was progressing through the American law making system, the results were that it kind of expanded. Its rematch included elected Officials. And that's where this becomes a threat to them. But the reality is they should still be tried on war crimes. If war crimes have been committed and they've been complicit in that, you're an accomplice. End of story. Obviously, what he's fearful of here is being held to account at all.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm just trying to get some clarity okay I'm gonna try and give the Alphonse angle here as best I can for me this is a very simple decision Joe Biden Joe Biden Joe Biden let me tell you guys why most people who have reached the conclusion that they're not gonna vote for Joe Biden primarily I'd say about 60% of people who changed their vote away from Joe Biden is because of the war between Israel and Palestine specifically Gaza  completely understand what's going on in Gaza is an atrocity it is genocide there's no other way to put it and the fact that the United States is supporting Israel in this madness is outrageous and I don't blame anyone for choosing that to be their single issue voter deal deal breaker I get it but here is where I kind of come into complication when Donald Trump was president now I want you guys to think about this when Trump was president he moved our embassy to Jerusalem to do nothing more than antagonize the people of Palestine right to prove a symbolic point that Jerusalem belongs to Israel if you listen to the rhetoric of the Republican Party present time and I believe it is a reflection of how Donald Trump thinks all you hear the Republican Party say is support Israel without question we must throw all the support give them all the military aid financial aid at our disposal so that they can defeat the enemy in Gaza there is no one that I've heard thus far in the Republican Party that has tried to be a voice of reason as it relates to Israel and Gaza that to me lets me know Donald Trump would not just support Israel in their actions but in bolding them at least the Democrat Party if we just look at it from a bare minimum standpoint at least in the Democrat Party there are voices powerful voices that are calling out US support of Israel and the need to withdraw when Joe Biden spoke at Morehouse just a few days ago he said himself that he is working on a ceasefire granted a little too late an action should have been taken far sooner but I can at the bare minimum if I'm just grasping for things here respect that at the bare minimum this administration can recognise the wrong that is being committed I'm not saying that they moved as quick as they needed to but at least they recognise I don't believe that what happened with Donald Trump Donald Trump is the definition of I'm gonna dig my heels into the sand and I'm gonna dare you to move me he loves opposition and the amount of opposition to Israel that is growing in the United States would only push Donald Trump to support them more I guarantee it something else to think about and this is more on a domestic front overnight the Supreme Court turned women into second class citizens it happened because we had Donald Trump in office for four years and he had the opportunity to put not one not two but three conservatives on a Supreme Court that fulfilled the Republican Party's wet dream of overturning Roe v Wade really think about that do you really wanna give that man an opportunity to add another and another and another you never know what could happen tomorrow to any of these Supreme Court justices do you really wanna give a man like Donald Trump that opportunity do you really wanna give the Republicans as a whole an opportunity to push policies such as Project 2025 that would literally roll back the years that people like Martin Luther King Malcolm X and so many others fought for us to have greater freedoms project 2025 would roll that back overnight do you really wanna give the Republican Party that type of control and power and opportunity really think about this young voters Joe Biden tried to cancel student loan debt a lot of you guys when it didn't fall through blamed him when you should have been blaming the Supreme Court why because it is a super majority of conservatives on the Supreme Court who ruled that Joe Biden trying to overturn our cancel student debt was unconstitutional you put Donald Trump back in office kiss it all goodbye at least Joe Biden now is making incremental cancellations of student debt Donald Trump would do none of the aboves so my point here is yes what's going on in Gaza is terrible and US support for Israel is out of line and I don't stand behind it at all however I'll take that reluctantly because I fully understand the latter would make that vary issue 10 times worse and also ding us here in the United States over the head this is a man Donald Trump who said that on his first day of office he'd be a dictator that's not something the leader of the free world should be joking about a man who just recently released a campaign ad that had the words that we have not seen since the days of World War Two in Germany let that sink in let that really sink in at the type of person we're dealing with here and sure you guys can vote for a third party candidate but let's keep it a buck let's keep it a hundred here R F k has no viable path to the White House and sitting out out of an election what are you doing like what are you actually doing protesting protesting how by not voting you're not hurting anybody but yourself these president's former presidents are gonna go off and make millions you not voting ain't hurting nobody but yourself and that's the how fun thing on that",

    "voice_to_text": "The profile, since I doesn't want you to know about this book. The book was written in 1695 by Adriana Ralonde. So that video just popped up on my feed, and the creator's not somebody who's known for, you know, their own is or accuracy, getting basic things right. But I was like, oh, maybe this is interesting. It's a book I'd never heard of. It's a book from 1695. He says, um, about the demography of Palestine. Um, and it said that the majority of the population of Palestine in 1695 was Jewish. There was only one city with a small Muslim population. Novelist sham. It's like, oh, never heard of this. It's interesting. So I did, like, you know, about half an hour of research, and he got the. He got everything wrong. Um, so the first thing is that he got the name of the author wrong. Um, the name he gave is the Latinization of the author's name. The author's name is actually Adrian Relon. He was Dutch. Might be pronouncing it wrong, but it's R E L A N D. Um, and I found a book about Audrina Milan called The Oriented Utrecht. And the main thing to know about Milan is that he never traveled beyond the borders of his home country. Um, so he. He didn't go to Palestine. He never been there. Apparently he'd never even been to France. And then I found a abstract of an article by an Israeli scholar, About him. Zur Shalev. Shalev. Note that Ralan's influential Palestinian ex monumentist Veteribus Illustrata was based solely on the evidence offered by ancient sources. And then I was like, wait a minute. Palestine in the. The turn of the 18th century was under Ottoman control, under control of a Muslim empire. And the Ottomans took it over from the mom looks, which is another Muslim empire. So how are there no Muslim. So then I looked at Bernard Lewis and Edmund Cohen's population and revenue in the towns of Palestine in the 16th century. It's amazing the things that you can find just by googling. At least until Google destroy search, which apparently is gonna happen really soon. And they note not one of the six towns of Palestine in the 16th century was exclusively Muslim. Uh, but there were minorities that lagged far behind the Muslims. Jerusalem had the most substantial minority population, followed closely by Gaza, actually. So, yeah, there you have it. Fact checking, it's always fun. He won't respond to this, by the way. He'll just be like, you're obsessed with me, that's why you're fact checking me. Then he'll just. He'll just move on to some other BS. But anyway.",

You can watch the video that I've just stitched for more information on this. But this is about RAF's family. They're trying to evacuate 15 of the family members, but 5. Only 5 of the immediate family members at the moment. A lot of rehab family members are sick, and they need support and medical support, and they need to evacuate safety from Gaza. So if you can share, donate, anything with that page, even just go follow Tamzim and start reposting her videos. Literally anything helps. Truly, no family should have to be going through what these families are going through right now. And remember, it's gone to the point that we can't look the other way just because we're privileged enough to do so. So please, just repost, share, like, comment. Anything you can do helps.",

    "voice_to_text": "this is precisely why it's important for journalists to get the story right what Mitch McConnell is talking about is he's talking about the UN supposedly lowering the numbers of dead in Gaza when we all know they didn't the UN released a report showing the number of identified dead which is about 10,000 fewer than the estimated dead and tons of journalists out there took that report as oh look the UN lowered the number of casualties in Gaza see this is why you can't trust the numbers coming out of Gaza one of the first people to report that story  was Joe Scarborough from MSNBC a former politician who's cosplaying as a journalist and despite independent journalists like me who analyzed the data corrected the record that tweet is still up its had more than 4 million views his article is still up no retraction no apology and he's not the only one USA Today The New York Times tons of media outlets reported the same thing that Mitch McConnell is citing on the Senate floor you see in the problem with that is not just misinformation it's not just misinforming the public it's politicians and lawmakers who are taking those stories and using them as fact and these guys are going to drive policy using that misinformation and that's dangerous not just for Palestinians but for all of us when it came to lynch mobs back in the day the media help bolster the justification for hanging Black people from trees everything from lynch mobs to Jim Crow laws to segregation to the fight against the Civil Rights Act all of it were bolstered by false news stories like this one here and this story claiming that the UN adjusted their numbers will only lead to more death and destruction in Gaza and what these politicians and journalists are seeming to leave out of the conversation are those that are still buried in the rubble which are estimated to be about 10,000 and Lord only knows how many are still hidden in mass graves so as everybody's out there blocking celebrities which I support maybe it's time to start blocking certain journalists like Joe Scarborough or maybe entire media outlets because this isn't the only case remember Charlie D'Agata when the war in Ukraine started was talking about how Ukrainian children were more civilized than children from some far away place in the Middle East and then the ban on TikTok is also driven by misinformation that's being bolstered by news stories and media outlets everywhere the future of news is going to be an independent media and non profit media not corporate driven media that makes their money from clicks and ad views keep that in mind every time you see a story coming out on these legacy media outlets",

This is also why your algorithm refuses to push for videos like this over videos regarding Israel being spoken of in a positive light.

He talks about Israel being booed off stage, being unfair to the artist, and she can't do anything about the bombings in Palestine. Meanwhile, I am. I'm telling you that she is still supporting it, and she is still on this European stage, happy, waving her flag, while this flag symbolizes a country that commit Genesis. Now, a lot of people say that she is 20 years old, she doesn't know what she's doing. I am 20 years old. I know exactly what happens in Gaza. I wouldn't support this country in any way, shape or form. Meanwhile, she is going on state, waving her flag with a smile. Not only that, but Israel had a petition against them signed by a bunch of former EOC members and contestants to not compete because Russia didn't compete either. And what did the EOC say? We are not a political, political competition. We do not do politics. And what is Israel's response to that? They write a political propaganda song about October 7th, calling it October Rain, with the EBU telling them several times to not only change the title, but also a bunch of lyrics. So what is. What is the argument about that? I bet that now you will argue, but she didn't write the song, she. She just performed it. She just performed it, which in it alone is Already pretty bad, but let's, let's, let's, let's ignore that she probably didn't write the song and just performed it. But let's, let's look at her harassing other contestants with her team. For example, photographing Bambi Thuk after they explicitly told Israel to not photograph them in any shape or form. Or photographing and posting the door of Greek contestant marinazari into their Instagram story with a marking tag. And let's not ignore the whole just Klein situation where after yours, Klein wasn't allowed to perform, an Israeli team member was harassing him for not performing. Mocking him or her mocking the audience for booing at her. Like the the Israeli contestant mocking the audience for booing and. And making fun of the whole situation. let's talk about her not being allowed to talk to other competitors because the Israeli government was fearing that if she talks to too many of the contestants, she might change her mind about her whole political stand, which in it alone is a. Is, is, is a hard statement. Or let's not talk about the whole thing with Israeli supporters using several credit cards to vote hundreds of times in different, in different countries in support for Israel. So I don't, I, I am not for booing any Jewish artist off stage, but if this Jewish artist is waving an Israeli flag, makes fun of other contestants, makes fun of the audience, makes fun of the people, and it's just such an asshole. To be around. I think. I think we're allowed to boo at her at any age.",

If Democrats actually cared about defeating Donald Trump, they would force him to get a ceasefire by using the full powers of the presidency (like HW, Carter and Reagan did) and then force him to step down as the candidate to have a contested convention so they can nominate a pro-ceasefire/progressive candidate to unite the base. But Liberals and Democrats continue to support and prop up Biden as he still allows a literal g*nocide continue to unalive Palestinains every single day. Its 2016 all over again, except even worse.

Its the year 2024-how do people still think this way?  And then, theres our american government just sending the people doing the bombing our money that they take from us.  #artists4ceasefire your redins are really making my job easier, love spotting it on the celebs!  #doyourpart #gaza #palestine #ceasefirenow ",
    "voice_to_text": "if we want to influence celebrities to speak out on Gaza her video makes it make so much sense so if you're anything like me you don't really know what's going on over there I really had no idea all that was going on in Gaza until the whole block party started and everybody started blocking celebrities and then the Hayley Bailey thing happens that's what really sparked my interest in what the fuck is going on and why is everybody so mad I don't watch the news I don't watch any kind of like world news I watch TikTok and that's it because I don't in my mind I can't do anything about it so I'm not gonna fuck with it okay well that's kind of like we can't do that no and I am in no way an influencer but I do have 12,000 followers which is more than like most of the surrounding towns have in population so in my mind I'm like oh shit maybe I should say something about this because in my mind I'm thinking I'm nobody um it does not matter what I have to say about it but at this point I'm seeing all these people bashing celebrities and people that have a platform for not speaking about it and I'm like okay I have a platform it may only be 12,000 people you know but I still have a fucking platform that I worked really hard for by the now being a mother what this lady said makes so much sense because I have really tried to re parent myself so that I can parent my children the correct way which is helping them learn how to be normal human and in that process I have Learned that beating kids um taking stuff away you know all the negative reinforcement that all the corporal punishment that we were raised it doesn't work I mean some of it might but not really it doesn't really teach them how to be grown UPS how to manage the stress how to not make those mistakes and what she says is you reward good behaviour which is I am all about when you are doing nothing but pointing out everything that's wrong or everything that the celebrity or person or kid or whatever is doing wrong that's not going to make them want to do right that just makes them feel less than and make someone crawl in a hole and not do what you want them to do so I did a quick Google search of celebrities who have supported Gaza or who have donated or spoke out something to that effect because I think it's better to shine a light on the people that are doing something instead of just forcing people to speak about it or block them that's kinda like a double edged sword like they'll speak on it yeah just like Haley did her little apology thing but did she mean it do they mean it do they really want to help or are they just doing it because you're forcing them to you're forcing their hands so like to me that's not if somebody was like let me give you $20 I know you you look like you need $20 I wanna help you let me give you $20 okay I would feel one way if somebody was like here's this $20 the world's forcing me to give it to you here's the $20 I get it it's still gonna be helpful and I get it but it's like you're doing it out of spite practical I understand how scary it is to get on the internet and voice your opinion when there are other people that could possibly not agree with your opinion believe me I fucking I have an entire the Kelsey show it has over 8 800 posts I have posted and most of them are about my event and at first it was very scary to start posting about them so when people were getting mad at celebrities I'm like I feel not how they feel but I understand why they're not talking about it but at the same time I'm like maybe you should grow a backbone and not worry about the bag so much and maybe spread the word because at this point I I've done the research now it's not fucking good and people do need the word does need to be spread and these celebrities have ungodly amounts of money to help the people it should not be on us the normal people of the world who have barely enough to get by to try to support these families when these celebrities are out there just living their fucking best life on their yachts and fucking private planes and giving a dollar or two or making a simple fucking post I get that that that's good I'm glad people are doing that but fucking syndrome so I made an entire list of all the celebrities that I found online that actually have started donating and have been outspoken about it and they are supporting and calling for ceasefire wearing the so since this video is already 4 minutes and 30 seconds of to me just fucking bitching and ranting I love it I'm gonna go ahead and start a whole series of celebrities who have donated to goth or spoken about because I think people just want the celebrities and the influencers to do their influencing job and spread the word and I get that so I'm gonna start a whole series of celebrities who do support Gaza and do make the the noise and do all the thing maybe that will get more track and maybe that will get the people who aren't you know saying something to do something",

    "voice_to_text": "So I posted a comment on this video about um my artist that I'm obviously supporting and now my favourite because they actually stand up for the cause and they they use their platforms to raise awareness and to create awareness and to to help to hopefully change the way governments and western powers are going about handling and managing what is happening in Palestine and one of the comments I received one of the I would I won't don't wanna call it ignorant ignorant comment but it's just it just shows people's level of thinking in saying that um if you send these celebrities or ask them to go out to these areas and fight they won't do it now I'm just thinking it's such a waste of a comment because even if they what is it what are you achieving by making that kind of comment what what do you achieve through saying that oh well they won't fight if they get asked to go out there no one would who would want to willingly put themselves in that situation to fight for a cause when the powers that be I'm not even willing to do the same thing like obviously if it was me I based on what I believe I would happily go and fight because I would much rather know that I am doing something to help better society and willing to die for the sake of bettering society but what's the cost of it what is what is the cost of my sacrifice if the people that are not involved in that conflict are not gonna change their outlook are not gonna change their opinions and this again it's coming from having grown up in a western society where as a Muslim life already is I don't wanna call it difficult but it's already so challenging because there's a stigma behind everything that you do the way you pray the way the way you dress the way you cover yourself the the what you recite the things that you do there's there's a stigma behind it albeit it it may not always be negative but people always think that it doesn't conform it's not it's not exactly right you know it's not exactly the ideals of what society deems now we as a society are now standing together and saying well the companies that are supporting this kind of agenda this kind of narrative we have as as a community and now have the opportunity as a international community have the opportunity to hold them accountable we have the opportunity now to actually make global changes because that is the power of social media that is the power of being connected through the internet uh over you know leaps and bounds across different countries and continents so when someone makes this kind of comment I'm just sitting here thinking you can clearly see you've you've never had to deal with struggle in your life and the only struggle that you know is either financial or to some to some extent it's maybe a spiritual or psychological struggle but you've never been in a position where every single one of your family members have fought or had to endure suffering for the sake of your life being better now all we asking is for you to have the same energy that you that these celebrities are having promote the same energy put make a list of the celebrities we should be supporting we should be advocating for we should be um pushing to hear their voices over others I mean I love this whole idea of the blackout or the other blackout um the trend I love it because we finally as a community acting to hold celebrities accountable and to hold people with influence accountable whether it ruins your livelihood or not is not my problem cause at the end of the day what you stand for in this life would deem what you stand for what you get repaid for in the afterlife based on what I believe so your celebrities like Justin Bieber um Hailey Bieber uh Kim Kardashian um Black Eyed Peas whatever all these all these artists that are not saying anything all these celebrities that are not saying anything why are they so quiet what is their agenda be about why why is it so difficult for them to actually say the things that need to be said and to stand why is why is it easy for Kehlani to sit there and say that the weekend um who are there so many others people I mean keep people have commented so many other names that I can't even mention cause I don't even I don't even firstly I maybe I'm ignorant I don't know their names but there are so many that are standing in the course of what is right and why are we sitting here saying oh but if they if they not sent there they won't fight or if if you ask them to go and fight they won't go what is the point I mean let's use our platforms for what it's intended for let's use the platform to spread awareness and to create them I mean the more we saturate the market with videos of support the more people have to listen to it so I don't understand why people have to make comments like that because it's counterproductive it's counterintuitive we we're here to change people's mindsets not to in not to get people to start conflict for no reason so you know peace to whoever but you know use your platform for what it meant for don't be stupid",

    "voice_to_text": "as we're going into an election cycle it's really important for us to understand how these things are sustained from one presidency into another presidency from one decade into another decade one generation into another generation and why voting in the presidential elections is simply not enough to ensure that the continued and ongoing support for Israel stops this is bigger than a single president while yes the president may be the most powerful person on the planet um they are inheriting a system that was created generations before they got there and understanding how those systems operate is critical to truly and effectively dismantling them so that we can never repeat this I'm using example here um and I really hope that it is not experienced or perceived as dismissive or flippant because I'm pulling from children's literature so think about the Harry Potter series also I feel like we should add JK Rowling to the block list um I might just do it for shits and giggles okay so the Harry Potter series right when Voldemort rises to power it was because of this already present historical sentiment and fear of the muggle world by the wizarding world right and it was a legitimate invalid fear right like I don't wanna dismiss the wizarding fear of the Muggles they were persecuted um and that LED the wizarding world to become extremely isolated and very insular which made it possible for these really extreme and damaging ideologies to faster and grow um strong enough and pervasive enough and insidious enough that somebody like Voldemort rose to power and had an entire plan of genocide against Muggles um and then Harry Potter does his whole heroes journey thing Hermione Granger is the real hero all along all the things happen right seven books later we get a glimpse into what the future is like and it hasn't actually changed there's this podcast I listen to I really recommend it um called witch please it's too um literature professors at a university in Canada and they go through the entire series like every single chapter and provide this really great analysis using all of this like super smart people stuff and literature theory and like things that like I don't necessarily like understand at that level um and one of the things that they talk about is that the underlying ideologies that created these systems like the Ministry of magic and the RS and the pedagogical approach in the Hogwarts system which is just horrifically abusive um and the prison system of Azkaban and like just like like what the fuck who where is the adult in charge of the wizarding world kind of thing you know what I mean that I think a lot of us like muggles at this moment in time can really relate to the ideologies that LED to the creation of those did not end when Harry defeated Voldemort and they continued as Harry and Hermione and Ron and Ginny and Luna and Neville became adults and then inherited those systems what they chose to do with those systems moving forward we don't really know you know like that's the world of fanfic um but the last glimpse that we got of them they were the same systems and that's the cycle that we are going to find ourselves caught in if we don't look at those underlying ideologies and the ways in which they have been institutionalized and legitimized through our legislation through our education system through our law enforcement system and our criminal justice system through our media and our literature and our religions and our neighborhoods and communities and businesses right like they are embedded in all of these things and so in order to really stand a chance at never again actually being never again one of the things we are going to have to really really grapple with is the how and why of every single decision that we make as Americans because from the moment of our inception as a country blood was on our hands this country is built on the genocide and destruction of Turtle Island it is built on the enslavement of African peoples and we continue to reap the benefits of those horrific crimes against entire civilizations until we grapple with those very foundations on which this country has been founded we will continue to fund and support and legitimize things like the Zionist project",

And you can hear it. Such a good song. Because it is such a good song. When I first heard it, I thought, wow, this could be a winner. But as we know yesterday, it got zero points in the popular vote, which was not deserved. But I do believe it's because of the raunchness of that performance. I was watching with my mum and she was like, well, they're quite athletic, but what are they wearing? And you can't get away from that visual and really listen to the song. I think the sound was also a bit weird. Um, so I do feel bad for Ollie. Um, he's very talented. I love. I love his performances generally. So, yeah. Um, is Eurovision political? I think it's become political in. In the widest scheme of things, but my top 3 actually were top 4, so the better songs do win. Ukraine slipped in there. I think that's political. It's an okay song. Israel being number five, uh, after getting nearly all of the top points in the popular vote, to me, is shocking and surprising. The song was okay, it's very Lorraine, but not my favourite. Um, so I think that's political. And I'm not gonna go more into that, but, yeah. Free Palestine.",

Kicking them out of school and housing right before graduation. Literally all these college presidents and nonprofit CEOs and education leaders\u2014All they care about is their donations. Money. And proximity to power. Because they aren\u2019t speaking up and when they do speak up, it is to call the law down viciously on teenagers and young adults exercising their free speech in the face of some of the worst ethnic cleansing of their lives. But watch how these young adults move. They refuse to be silenced when we are talking about genocide. Babies blown apart day after day by a ruthless, brutal army. Hillary Clinton and all the war mongers invested in weapons companies will try to tell us what we see with our own eyes is propaganda, but they are on the wrong side of history and we will never ever let them forget it or live it down. These students? These students are on the right side of history and I am so damn proud of them and I stand with them. #students #college #career #VCU #harvard #columbia #CUNY #protest #gaza #freepalestine #palestine #war #uwmadison #uwmilwaukee #calpolyhumboldt #UCLA #ASU #Emory #Penn #Tulane #FSU #ohiostate #USC #NYU #CCNY ",

Firstly, you cannot say that you are not educated enough on a situation which is being reports done daily. And as a content creator, you're online 24 7, therefore you would have access to this information. Secondly, you do know what's going on because you said earlier in the video that you know that people are dying because of what's going on, but you're not explicitly saying what's going on. This is why people like Hailey Bailey, Sabrina Basum, true girl, Chris Olsen, they just annoy me because they're more just billboards for these people to elevate their platforms on and don't actually have their own opinions to say. And in a situation which involves a genocide and an ethnic cleansing of our whole country, you choose to stay mute, you choose to stay mutual, because you wanna keep all your deals, which we get. But people are not going to like that in this day and age. Fair advice. Maybe you should use your 10 million followers to influence and share news on what's going on in Palestine and why it's all completely wrong.

I've always felt like the need to discuss propaganda because we see it every day, you know, in our schools and our streets, on TV. My senior thesis in college was actually on the impact of Nazi propaganda being inserted into the German education system and the effects of that. Um, pretty interesting to see that the marks had gone down since the Nazi, um, infiltration of the German Republic. And also, classroom behavior was reported to be much worse under the Nazi regime. I feel like she's a politician for god knows how long, probably since the prehistoric age, but she should know that propaganda is not education. Like there is a difference here. Propaganda is not supposed to inform, it is supposed to make people feel. It's supposed to bring out the emotion. And what is being posted on TikTok is not necessarily harmful propaganda. It is propaganda in the fact that it is displaying the conditions of what is going on in Rafa and Gaza and how the people are dealing with this over there and how would they are suffering. Do not stop reposting those videos, please. Free Palestine!",

    "voice_to_text": "Macklemore song sounds like somebody who went on social media for three days and and that's more than most people are doing that's more than most celebrities and people with platforms are doing this is such a weird take this just gets me it's like why make this video why did you feel the need to make this video so that you could feel cooler to tell everyone that you're not a Macklemore fan I'm not a Macklemore fan but I can still acknowledge that it was a good thing to do so what if it was like bare bones research and like if it just now happens that if you know 75 years ago yes people should have cared the whole time yes people shouldn't need some artist to make a song about it for them to start caring but it's working and the tides are turning and it's finally happening that people with bigger platforms and artists with bigger audiences that are more in the mainstream are starting to talk about this and better yet to send the money that they're making to a good place why make this video why why pick it apart it's just it's so weird to me it's such a weird choice to make and I'm out here trying to like Laude Macklemore as like some savior or like a hero or even like a good artist I don't care but my point is it is a good thing to do it's actually like moving things forward it's getting the word out it's getting people involved and you know what your video is doing none of those things it's like weirdly shaming people for being a fan for support like I don't know I I don't understand I don't understand why you felt the need to make this video like if that's what you need to feel better about yourself and your choices you do that you know it's none of my business I\u00a0just\u00a0think\u00a0that\u00a0when\u00a0we\u00a0start\u00a0to\u00a0pick\u00a0apart\u00a0allyship when we start to criticise the turning of the tides and how that's happening we are moving backwards and there are bigger things more important things to focus on",

    "voice_to_text": "I would give anything for us to stop misquoting what happened to Kitty, because the thing is, people actually did call 9 1 1 for her the first time she was attacked. At least one father and son duo did call 9 1 1. And remember, this was in 19, like 64, before there was an actual 9 1 1 number. This was back when you had to call your local police precinct and identify yourself to the police. Right? So this father and son duo did call 9 1 1, and by the time they called, she had stopped being attacked. Her attacker moved and got away, so they reported it as if the attack was over and as if she was fine. Meanwhile, she had crawled away inside a building, and so police didn't really come out to check cause it sounded like the attack was over. And again we talked about the bystander effect is if there's a group of people all looking at each other and going, I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not gonna do anything. And the Kitty Jeannouise murder was a series of isolated people at 3:00am, who may or may not have been awake, may or may not have heard what was happening, and who just may not have been aware of what was happening and might not have known to call for help given what was going on. And I really don't think that we should be using the bystander effect. As kind of a reason to explain what is or is not happening. Like regarding response in Gaza, this is more of, like a collective action problem. It's more of a misinformation and disinformation problem. Like, people know what's happening, and people are acting. So, like, even now with Gaza, it's not that we're all standing around looking at each other. This is a problem that is due to poor coordination. It is a lack of communication laterally among ourselves. And it's an inability to coordinate upwards with the people who are actually responsible for fixing the problem. Just like it was with Kitty Cheney's, right? Like, 1964, there was no 9 1 1 to call. And even if you did call, it was really difficult for you to have all the facts, all the information, and to actually report to the police. Hey, this woman's being attacked. Oh, she crawled into a building. Oh, god, the guy came back! He's attacking her again. You don't have all the information to report. And even if you do, there's no guarantee that the people who you call are going to responsive. And you're certainly not going to your neighbors and calling your neighbors and getting them on board. Right? Like, we're all just individuals acting individually. That's the problem. That's why it's hard to get things done. It's because of the lack of lateral communication. It's the fact that we're not acting as a group, not that we are acting as A group and then choosing not to do anything",

    "voice_to_text": "The three of us have never been together on the same pod before, so this is legally, we have not been allowed to. I wanna say a couple things before I go on a huge rant in this video, because first off, I just woke up like an hour ago, so all this is not like, done or whatever. No flaming. Um, secondly, I have to do like an all in one take because, um, tik toks having this weird bug and it will cut out all the audio in like the second half or like if you make multiple parts of a video. So I'm just gonna do all one cause I want everyone to hear this. Um, never did ever cross my mind that I had to critique someone as true. But the reason why she's getting, you know, grilled online as of right now is because she went on this podcast. Mind you, she's pro Palestinian. You know, Spread Awareness, donated, the works. Um, but she gets on this podcast with Brittany Broski. And I already made a video talking about Brittany Broski and how hypocritical she is already, but it's just interesting to see drew go on this podcast with someone who literally did not give a flying fuck about talking about Palestine. Literally went on Instagram bitching about it. But all that aside, um, drew, especially in this one person's comments. Um, she stitched Drew's podcast video talking about how are you gonna be pro Palestinian, but get on a podcast with Miss Hypocrite herself. And so drew was in the comment section, which is like number one. Like, you probably shouldn't have, but she was in her comments basically talking about, like, her own achievements about what she is done from the pro Palestinian movement. But that's like, you know, besides the point. And another thing that I seen her comment was the fact that, like, she can't hold her like, white friends to these said consequences or what not, and how she's forgiven Britney Broski and educated her. But the problem is, is like, that's not your job. Like, she didn't do anything to you specifically. She did. She fucked up major with everyone in the process, the pro Palestinian movement. So why do you feel the need that like, just because you forgiven her, everyone else has to fucking forgive her? And you get to go on this podcast and be all fucking buddy buddy with someone who literally didn't care in the first place. So people obviously on the right side of the argument was talking about. People are grilling you because of the fact that you went on this podcast and gave Brittany Broski a platform. You, as a pro Palestinian content creator, gave Brittany Broski, person who literally could have just went through her day and not even said anything about it. You gave her a platform in which you uplift her and see her as this like, oh, Yeah, she's good now, but again, like, at the end of the day, she would have literally never said anything if people didn't press her for it. And that's just. That's just bullshit. Um, it's for Drew's. As herself and her personality and how she comes up really strong and confrontational about people that she doesn't like. It's. It's weird that you don't have the same energy for someone, like, pretty risky. It's. It's disappointing, to say the least.",

And I'm just wondering, like, where y'all with Lizzo? Because for me, I'm just not gonna forget that fundraiser that she just did for genocide Joe. Drone King Obama, and I think Clinton was there. Um, and it wasn't it a fundraiser for genocide Joe? And then when she didn't like what people were saying, she was like, I'm quitting. And, like, now she's back, and she sees that Kim K. Lost 3 million followers. Now it's Operation Olive Branch. And, yes, I'm excited because she has, like, 26 million followers, and it's like, that's the reach we need. It also showcases our power, because celebrities are nothing, absolutely nothing without us. But, like, she was already getting on my damn nerves. So I feel like, thank you, Elizabeth Lizzo, um, for finally, I guess, making a video that we actually wanna see, but also, at the same time, too little, too late, bitch. Anywhere at Met Gala. So I think it's a block. Am I wrong?",

It helps that it was a good song, but be that as it may, like, that's clearly what it was. And that is a good thing. That is a good thing that we, as of people, can say, this is bad and actually we don't want it to happen.

    "voice_to_text": "A major new poll released by Axio shows that college students don't really care about the protests that are ongoing on campuses. A survey over 12 college students show that the conflict in the Middle East was only cared about by 13% of those survey. These numbers aren't really surprising at all. This movement is a mess. Part of what is causing the problem is this movement is surprisingly ineffective at using social media. Instead of using it to raise sympathy for their cause, it's mainly being used to give the movement itself a false impression of how popular this movement is, and then to bully people who question the movement itself. This kind of echo chamber. You can maintain the belief that it's everyone else that's failing, when really it's the movement itself that's failing on every level. But rather than dwell on the failures, let's talk about solutions. The goal of any movement like this is to raise awareness and sympathy for your cause and to turn that sympathy into action. Problem with taking direct actions like encampments, destroying property, disrupting civic life, and then making hostage like demands to get you to stop, is you push more people away than you pull in. Actions themselves create fear and anger, which are both antithetical to sympathy and can inadvertently create sympathy for the opposing cause. There's another approach called a dilemma action, which is an indirect, non aggressive form of protest where the goal is to provoke a dilemma. For the opposition, where they look absurd no matter how they respond. For example, in 1982, in response to Soviet propaganda, Polish citizens started taking their televisions for walks, and wheelbarrows and strollers during the Soviet news hours. This created a situation where the government would have to arrest people for walking their television, which would then be covered in the news itself, creating the dilemma. Not only would it look absurd, but they'd have to explain why people were walking their televisions, exposing their own propaganda and spreading the message of the protesters. For them, cause of that dilemma, the government didn't do anything, which conceded ground to the Polish resistance movement, enabling them to broaden support for resisting the Soviet system. George Washington University recently used this technique against the protesters, when they hung a huge American flag in the backdrop of the protests. And the contrast put the protesters in a really negative way, while maintaining the integrity of the university. As standing up for the rights of all. Which increase their support to resist the protesters. The reason this work is because of your movement is only focus on what you're going to do and how you can express your English to your audience. It becomes self absorbed. I think we're seeing a lot of that, which is why they become blind. How antisocial this movement has become. But if you're thinking in terms of a dilemma action, you're thinking of your social movement as a Social interaction between you, your opposition, and most importantly, the rest of society. Society is the audience. They are the people you're trying to convince. They are the ones holding the sympathy that you need. But here's the question. How do you do that? What does a dilemma action look like for this movement? Let's hear some suggestions in the comments.",

At least an artist that is going on here is using their platform, is using these conferences to go. This right here, this is bull. This isn't fair. They have asked me to change this.

Xana I I apologize if that's not how you pronounce your name they have an entire \ud83d\udd17 they have like an entire thing in their bio dedicated to helping people back in Gaza so please support. I'm probably going to have my account removed for this but honestly this is more important than any following the people need your help we have been saying for days now all eyes on Rafah, this is the moment that we have been warning about because power supplies has been cut off sooner; \ud83d\udca3ing has been more apparent than ever; aid has been significantly reduced already for this moment they are saying that they have people ready to protect these people that is not true do not believe anything state media is telling you especially when they're on the side of the oppressor Or the colonizers cause I find that colonizers will always support their own and the colonised will support their own so listen to the people of \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 their stories their links support them any way you can because this is the moment that we have been dreading and that moment is sadly here we had, I imagine, we all had a feeling it will come eventually just didn\u2019t know when \u2014 that moment is now so please, help any way you can. All eyes on Rafah go back and watch their video cause they are talking about their friend and their family that is evacuated I know the money on these donations seems like a lot but that is because other governments in other countries are trying to profit off of the suffering of innocent people and these people need out so they're paying it because they have no other choice it's either pay extortionate amount of money and get to safety or be stuck so they\u2019re finding help anyway they can and that comes from people like us.  Cause unfortunately our governments aren't going to do anything so we the people have to keep protesting; keep boycotting; anything that will hit is not real to support the victims of the \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 um but yeah just support the people anyway you can please",

Um, so we already know that the American taxpayers money is going um, funding the ammunition bombs in Gaza. Um, and of all the things that I have kept Palestinians in my heart, of all of the pain they're experiencing, a specific type of pain that I never considered. Because honestly, it's just, it's still kind of unfathomable to me that such a scenario even exist in real life. It's extremely dystopian. Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine. This feels like one of those, like, I, I. Oh, man.",

    "voice_to_text": "so this is where I draw a line saying Christ is king is not anti Semitic nor is \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da which means Yeshua is the king or Jesus is king nor is \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7 that means Jesus is the Messiah It is incredible that people will try to use Muslims \"saying Christ is king\" in a comment section (on that tweet without contextual proof to connotation) to make it seem anti Semitic. You know in countries that Westerners look at as Muslim there are Christians there too and  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 just means \"God is great\" or \"Praised is God\" or \"Blessed is God\"  (depending on context/ dialect/ scripture or even Aramaic phrases included in Arabic dialects) It depends on whether someone is saying that to praise God in the context of Islam or to praise God in the context of Christianity you will never know unless you know that person specifically and it is racist to assume someone who looks Arab saying \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 is automatically a Muslim that could be arguably an anti-Semitic view considering Arabs are Abrahamic descendants of Ishmael now for Christians across the United States I want you to know we in the messianic community stand with you besides rallying for jury nullification in jury trials and appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court if they try to bring people up on charges for it; while citing the First Amendment believing in the New Testament and believing Yeshua Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected from the dead is a branch of Judaism I would go all the way up to the international levels to advocate for any person who claims they are a Jewish convert even Palestinians who have trouble immigrating to Israel over any suspected Christian prejudice this branch of Judaism is speaking of is Messianic Judaism hello I'm a Messianic Jew I consider myself the same as a gospel believing Christian because I believe in the unmerited Grace that Yeshua Jesus gave us in accordance with Ephesians 2:8 in fact Christian and Messianic both have the same meaning and word root Christian means to Christen as with oil Messianic comes from the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 which means to annoint as with oil this word is one in the same our history as messianic Jews was firmly established almost 2,000 years ago in foundation during the time that the authors of the New Testament were alive fifty one days after our Messiah died on the day of the Passover sacrifice (John 19:14) people from every nation under the heaven were present in Jerusalem (Acts 2, 51 days after Yeshia died) to receive the Spirit of God that is the spirit of the Messiah who came and died for our sins on the day of Pentecost which is the Jewish festival of Shavuot by which converts and physical Jews became a part of the messianic faith and this receiving on the Spirit accordance with Acts 2:5 and Acts 2:11 I'm a messianic Jew who does not support the integration of heavy rabbinics into the doctrine of faith and encourage those who call themselves messianics or Christians to read the book of Galatians and also Matthew 23 and Jeremiah 23 to see what I'm talking about At a leadership level we are responsible to examine those doctrines and see if they are relevant to scripture but if they are not relevant with scripture and confuses the context of scripture in accordance with the Jewish Tenach (Torah, Prophets, Writings) and Jeremiah 8:8 and Jeremiah chapter 23 they are not from God and we do not count them now regardless of race or one status with conversion in an Orthodox synagogue or how they define a Jew race and ethnic status does not matter to us although we do not replace the nation of Israel I will make that clear this is not replacement theology and we do NOT embrace that we do not embrace that as someone who literally lives at the furthest reaches from Jerusalem in the world, literally the ends of the earth I believe even if someone lives so far away from Jerusalem or ethnically different than a Jew or Middle Easterner if they accept Yeshua as the Messiah they too are taking it to our faith and are given the same spiritual blessing of being delivered out from sin and from the confinements of sin of this earth the same way that Jews were taken out from the confinements in the land of Egypt we are Messianic we as messianic Jews keep the appointed times of Leviticus 23 practice physical circumcision and the dietary laws however we know that even as Moses received The 10 commandments on Mount Sinai it is also said in the same instance in Hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 -He makes unmerited Grace- Exodus chapter 20:6 \"He makes unmerited Grace to those who love him and keep his commandments\" Deuteronomy 6:4 - 8 tells us to love God with everything that we are John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God our commandment is to love and keep the word of God all 66 books as Messianic Jews Christians are grafted in and we are one in the same (Galatians 3:29) we came into the faith the same way the Christians did (Ethnic Jews who embrace the gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) - such as myself) as sojourners lost and the noble memorial of the price Yeshua (Jesus) paid for our sins delivered us out equally we are all strangers no one is better than the other because of his ethnicity. In the 37 chapter of Ezekiel, one of the infamous prophets of old Ezekiel, was taken out to a valley of dry bones by the hand of God and told to preach to an impossible situation and tell the dry bones that God's Spirit will come into them and they will live Ezekiel 37:4 - 6 so the dry bones became his flesh that is the nation of Israel coming together in 1948 but there was no breath in the bones (Ezekiel 37:8) so Ezekiel prophesied regarding the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) as he was commanded by God to say to the Spirit of god (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) come from the four winds (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) [Holy] Spirit and breathe upon the slain so that they may live (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) in the same chapter (Ezekiel 37) so let us speak the word of God and let us all come and look to the one that was pierced (Zechariah 12:10) for the transgressions of all mankind  that was set before us by the One who created us God knew man would make mistakes and that our greatest defeat is our own sin and it was necessary for Yeshua the Messiah to die we all pierced him as humanity (because our own sin is our greatest defeat) and anyone that believes in Him will not perish (John 3:16) but have everlasting life (John 3:16) John 3:16. We eulogize the price that was paid for our own sin as one eulogizes upon a firstborn upon an only child Zachariah 12:10 (and John 19:34 - 37) we remember our going out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05df \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of confinements of this earth and its wickedness on our own (by our own choice) just as the children of Israel were delivered out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of Egypt all the days of our life as it's written in Deuteronomy 16:3 in Hebrew let us rise up from this valley of dry bones as spoken by the prophets of old in the Spirit of god and in salvation as one every time someone comes to the Lord he rises up in a vastly and joins a powerful army that will not be defeated and more and more people will rise out of this valley of dry bones unto the coming of the Messiah himself.

    "voice_to_text": "And because like.. What if you're just minding your own business and then like.. the members of enhypen just walk in ? Euhhhhh I thought about this..before. I think.. Ummm..I genuinely don't know. I feel like I would be.. Knowing myself I'd probably be like.. Like.. in shock ! Cause I'm not a lucky person dude ! Things like this will never happen to me. And no, that\u2019s not just what I like, I'm just.. (I\u2019m not sure what I said here, but this is what I heard, even though it doesn\u2019t make sense \ud83d\ude2d) I- Let's just say.. I think I'm very unlucky.. to the point where I say I'm cursed. Let's just say that. Okay..so if that were to happen to me\u2026 It will be like God telling me\u2026(aish - meaning: Ah shit) it would be like.. Dude just..ahem, I don\u2019t wanna say it out loud. But..like I would..I really\u2026 Okay, I went through the comments under that..video, that I'm stitching right now. Anddd, it sounds like no one would really approach them, out of respect. Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay.",

You have to watch this. Just watch. Uh, hi there. Um, I'm trying to report, um, my kid is not able to get into the library. They are, um, bombarding him and not allowing him to get into the library, citing the need for some wristbands. Did you see a late issue wristbands to people? I don't have any information on that if they did. Okay, so what. What should he do? Because he can't enter the library, he can't enter his classes. So whoever he's speaking to right there, that saying that they need responses, he not able to ask them any information. They said. They said because he's Jewish, he cannot enter that area and that they won't issue him a visit. That wasn't. That wasn't a university thing. That's probably the protesters that are out there. Right. So are the protesters allowed to not allow a student who pays tuition access to their class in the library? Uh, no, they're not allowed, but unfortunately, they have kind of taken over that little area right there. Um, but is there any other entrance that your son can enter through? No, they are barricading every area for him to get into. And, you know, with all due respect, why is that even tolerated? Like, why should a Jewish kid Have to go to another entrance. I don't know if I'm gonna say it's tolerated, but unfortunately the police are not intervening with that right now. You can go and watch the rest of that video. I will tag the creator of the video, but I am flabbergasted that this is even happening in 2,024. It's very clear to me that this administration in these schools and these far left crazy psychopaths. Psychopaths aren't gonna do anything about this. In fact, they encourage this. What is it going to take to put an end to it? How does the majority who doesn't tolerate this putting into it",

Why ask yourself that? And if you can't figure out a reason, that means that you're either in denial or you just completely ignorant, and therefore you shouldn't be speaking on nothing.

Because if you needed to use them bitches, you would be using them bitches. And I think anybody that signed one of those missiles, whether they were 7 or 70, should be charged with international hate crime and publicly executed. Because there's no greater sign that you're not under any dress, that you have time to sign the missiles, that means you're completely on the offense. These people are fucking sick, bro. We know the majority of people being killed here are children, and you're signing missiles. Putting heart sign is just like bread. These are real demons. Not to mention. Not to mention billions, billions of US tax dollars that's going to that. Y'all just pulling up. You know, the thing is, is that I haven't really posted much about this stuff because protesting awareness is not enough. Whenever people, whenever y'all are ready to completely disengage from this system, then I'm with it. Cause protest. Like, bro, we've been. People been protesting since October, and they ain't stop shit. They stop sending our fucking tax money over there. They ain't stopped shit. We've been boycotting shit, they ain't stopped shit. They still signing missiles. The only thing that can happen. Like, bro, first of all, this life is not permanent. This life ain't permanent. What you got to lose? What? Like, what are we. We're holding on to comfort. And it's like, if you care that much about people dying, and you know that, you're actively, you're a participant, too. I'm a participant as well. I go to work every day. My fucking tax dollars paid for some of those missiles that got signed. That just is what it is. Um, but until they're not gonna. We're not gonna engage in a violent rebellion, because most people don't have a capacity for violence, which is why this is so outrageous. But also, people don't wanna give up their comfort. So, I mean, yeah, you can protest and bring awareness to it, but that ain't stop the bombs from dropping. And nobody. Y'all just ain't ready to disengage from the system completely. You don't want to see this shit collapse. Let's just be real, cause it don't. Like, does it stop with Palestinians? Does it stop in the Congo? Does it stop in Sudan in about 10 years? What's your job gonna be worth? Are you. Are you. Is your job gonna be valuable to society? Or will you be better fit to be doing prison labor? It's a question you need to ask yourself. And pay attention what's going on and tell me it's not a possibility you might lose your job, lose your fucking house. Lose your job to AI, lose your job to a robot. Lose your fucking home? Can't pay your Bills illegal to be homeless now you're a prison laborer doing the jobs they don't wanna pay for. Honestly, man, you might just keep buying the Pop Tarts.",

I don't believe human rights should be transactional. When I say I want Palestine to be free, I want the queer, closeted children there to be free. I want them to be able to express themselves, because everyone deserves that right. Also, I know they're not focusing on LGBTQ rights as they're currently trying to find food, shelter, and escape from constant bombardments. If me showing empathy makes you angry, that tells me everything about you. Go ahead and comment something. It won't change my mind. Hopefully this video will change someone else's. If you're a feminist, you should care about the women unable to give birth or have access to menstrual products in Gaza. If you care about the environment, you should care about the hundreds of olive trees that have been burned down. If you say you care about America, then you should care about the billions of dollars our government sends to Israel's military instead of helping our homeless population. Or student loan debt. Or the fact that none of us are able to afford living here. We're barely surviving. And yet we have politicians writing finish them on Israeli bombs.

    "voice_to_text": "Ah, it's a beautiful day in the apartheid where women are able to wear whatever they want. Videos like this will always annoy me because they fundamentally misunderstand what apartheid actually is. Because apartheid is not simply like in South Africa, people being banished to the Bantu stands. Although Israel does do this in the West Bank, keeping Palestinians hemmed within small spaces and not allowing them to move freely, the fact is, is that apartheid is best explained as a different system of legal rule for the national majority and the national minority. And even in this space, TEL Aviv, where this woman is able to find women wearing hijabs, the thing is, is that in the late 1980s, a TEL Aviv judge sentenced an Israeli boy who would kill the Palestinian boy six months of community service. And Israel has more and more been trying to further this legal discrimination. For example, last year, Israeli politicians like Itamar Bengavir attempted to get a law passed where Palestinians who committed sexual assault with nationalistic motivations would get double the sentences of Jewish people. And take Israel's 2,018 nation state law, which has been described as distinctly apartheid esque because it made it so that only Jewish people were allowed to exercise self determination, which doesn't make sense when there are 2 million Palestinians living within the land. It also degraded Arabic from an official language of the state to one of special significance when Hebrew has only been spoken in Palestine since The 1920s, really. And even then it had to be Learned by the Israeli settlers, because not even the Jewish people who had lived in Palestine for generations actually spoke Hebrew. And it also made settlement of Palestinian land and national value. So how could it possibly be that Palestinians are treated equally within Israeli society? And although Israelis like to act as if the West Bank is some different place to TEL Aviv, the fact is, is that Hebron is only an hour and a half away from TEL Aviv, and in her bronze, there are literally roads which only Jewish people are allowed to walk on. And also in the early 20, Israel literally trialed segregated buses for Palestinians and Jewish people. So this idea that just because you can find someone wearing a hijab in TEL Aviv is like me going to London, filming random black people who are clearly rich, and then stating that there is no racial inequality in the UK. However, if I was to scratch just below the surface, I would find that black and minority ethnicity groups are twice as likely to be living in poverty than white people. There are so many different facets which make Israel an apartheid state. There's articles talking about how there's even medical apartheid, because Palestinians from the Gaza Strip with terminal illnesses or serious illnesses that cannot be treated with Gaza's rather poor health care service because of years of Israeli degradation of it, are just Simply not allowed to leave. So as the saying goes, looks can be deceiving. And just because you can find someone who looks different to you within a society does not mean that there is a quality or that Israel is not an apartheid state.",

Some argue the image doesn't do much to inform the public of what is actually happening and that most who share it are doing so in a informative way. This Instagram Story takeover has also drawn comparisons to the black tile Instagram post that went viral during 2020, known as Blackout Tuesday. Writer Jason Akunde said the post might feel performative or frustrating, but honestly it's a war of public opinion and consensus. It has become trendy to stand against the massacre. Then that is a net good. Matt Navarra, a social media analyst, also said it's possibly circumventing some of the automated moderation on the platform because it's an AI generated image. Because meta, who own Facebook and Instagram, have been accused of removing and restricting videos with anything that mentions the war. Creators have even resorted to using terms like G at Z, A or a watermelon emoji to try and bypass the restrictions in place on these platforms.",

And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it.

You can do whatever the hell you wanna do, and you will, but I wouldn't do it. And this doesn't make me a single issue voter. Because if we being honest, life has been pretty shitty. And that is not. That's not the only thing that is moving me. I can't recall, honestly, since. Since what, COVID? When gas was actually affordable? And I've watched my groceries increase. Every time I go to the store, something that I bought was like. And something that I bought was like, what, a dollar? 50 at one point. And then I go back into the store, like, to get that same thing. Two months later, it's now two dollars. And then it goes up again, and now it's $3. People can't find jobs. Nobody is hiring. Inflation, Is still increasing everywhere, but people wanna act like it's not. I'm not a single issue voter, but if I was, again, that single issue would be enough for me. And I noticed how people who like to deem other people single issue voters, quite conveniently don't speak on that single issue. That's funny to me that they can turn a blind eye today. The biggest blind eye.",

    "voice_to_text": "I was gonna come on this morning and post a video of me doing a sit down chat about a run. Was gonna sit and I was gonna talk about running. And I was just driving to film that video before I go for a swim. And I was like, how on earth can I just sit in my car and speak about running when I've woken up and seen the images and read what I've read on the internet about what's happening in Gaza, and I have been far too silent on the matter, because I've sat and I thought, well, I don't know what to say. But actually not saying anything is so much worse than saying something. And I've always had this internal debate of like, okay, well, my page is supposed to be like a safe space on the internet for people where they can go to get away from things, but there are children that can't even sleep in safe spaces that are being murdered. And I cannot rightfully sit here and just post my content and not acknowledge that that's happening and not try to do something. Even if the impact is small, it's still an impact and it can still help. I think I've also genuinely sat behind this excuse of like, I'm not educated enough to say anything. But it's not about being educated. It's about being a human being. And I think when you wake up and you see What we are all seeing on the internet is out there of these horrific images of children that have gone to sleep and some of them haven't woken up. Some of them have woken up to being burned and scold. Some of them. Some photos, like, they're actually decapitated. Like that is about being a human being and understanding that we have to at least to try and do something. And I understand that maybe donating money isn't financially viable for everybody. I get that. If you watch this video through to the end, it generates money. Like my TikTok bank. I will donate all of that. If you can donate, I'm gonna leave a link in my bio that will aid towards children in Gaza getting food, aid and sleep and families in Gaza as well, not just the children. Because there are just so many people that are struggling in the world right now that it doesn't feel right to just be posting as normal on social media. And I think if we can all try and do something, even if, like I said, it's just watching this video through to the end, you don't. You can put your mute, just put on the side. Um, even if you could do something, it's, like, so much better than doing nothing. And I. I'm definitely one of the people that have done nothing for far too long. So hopefully through this video, we can raise either more awareness or More money to try and help these people in this, like, horrific situation.",

    "voice_to_text": "Why would white feminists who oppose patriarchy support the most significant patriarchal system ever created: Islam? Why would they cancel and silence Middle Eastern feminists? invalidating their experiences and suffering calling them Islamophobic Why would LGBT activists support the most homophobic patriarchy and march alongside anti Semites? I believe most people watching this agree that societies only evolve with constant self challenge We question our ideas and concepts and apply critical thinking to evolve our consciousness. Without this, we stagnate individually and culturally. But why would someone who considers themselves progressive and open minded claim progress for themselves and deny it to others based on race and culture? and a good example would be: It's okay to criticise the Catholic Church but criticising Islam is Islamophobic. This behaviour exemplifies white supremacy and racism. For absolutely irrational reasons many feminists or intellectual progressives refuse to let culturally stagnating societies evolve out of their archive concepts and refuse to recognise the injustice and brutality of theocratic societies even if it means ignoring misogyny and homophobia. This is a problem because culture matters and you can judge a culture's quality by how it treats women, children and animals. So why aren't these feminists and intellectuals making sense? Because people become irrational when driven by fear and lack of identity. These individuals are preoccupied with their white guilt and shame. To free themselves they recreate themselves as part of something bigger, righteous, intellectually and morally superior etc. Heinz Kundani called it moral narcissism, however, moral narcissism is limited individually. This pathology is rooted in tribalism and is part of a larger picture. It's collective narcissism, connecting all victims. Their simplistic worldview which divides humanity into oppressed oppressors is the hellmark of narcissistic pathology called splitting. It helps them cope with their difficulty tolerating their ambiguity and contradictions inherent in humans: It\u2019s an all or nothing perspective and precisely what Obi-Wan Kenobi was talking about when he said \u201conly a Sith deals in absolutes\u201c They simulate empathy but it's synthetic fundamentally inverted and attached to grandusity, entitlement, and self righteousness, fitting the DSM-5 definition of narcissism to the T. Self-victimization is a crucial part of the narcissistic shame compensation mechanism. By positioning themselves as perpetual victims of societal structures or historical injustices, they deflect responsibility for reality. This self-victimization protects their ego from confronting their privilege and allows them to adapt a moral high ground without genuine self reflection or change. And their proclaimed social justice narrative is a veneer for deeper insecurities and unresolved issues. They believe they uniquely understand and can solve the world's problems. In reality they reinforce the very power structures they claim to oppose. This toxic cycle of guilt, victimization and grandulity\u2026 of course, inhibits genuine empathy and critical thinking, keeping them and the groups they claim to support had locked in Arrested Development. So, what is the role of our institutions in all this madness? It's a toxic dance of the narcissist and the co-dependent: the abuser and the enabler. Our governments and institutions are co-dependent, and the Woke, BDS, DEI, etc. far-left, are the self-victimizing narcissists. It's a poisonous trade where everyone, except the narcissist, loses unless we set boundaries for the raging goblin that is tirelessly rolling on the supermarket floor.",

    "voice_to_text": "Doctor 7 here, checking back in with you, and I'd say that it's just about game time here. I suggest people take this stuff serious. We've talked about what could potentially happen here for a lot of years, but it looks like some critical stuff going down. If you don't know, we have an incident just took place outside of Fort Liberty, former Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. We have two illegal migrants that were spying on Special Forces colonel, snapping photos of his family and his kids. And he caught them. It was competition. He shot and killed one of them. This is a big deal, because other colonels, other people are going on, like Fox News, and they're saying that this is a huge threat. They're in here, they're spying on our top level generals at their homes here in this country, and now they've been engaged. They go on to say that here in this country, these illegal migrants are showing up and our military facilities two to three times a week. A week? That brazen, whoever was just ignoring it, right? Two or three times a week, they're showing up at our military bases, and they're getting turned away. Now, the ones that are showing up at the basis are showing up acting like they're trying to document for some kind of. Whatever excuse they give. They do have passports, the ones that show up there, and they seem to be the forward unit of this invasion of Course, we know there's millions in here at this point. They are also state that they are rolling up on our basis with drones, two to three times a week. Incursions. So our bases are getting infiltrated by drones and these dudes rolling up on them in packs. And they're rolling up on our kernels at their homes, spying on them. Hello? How much more are. Are people waiting for? What are you waiting for? Them to show up at your house taking pictures like, dude, you better get ready. You better get it already locked and loaded. Everything that you got. You better get with your neighbors. You better get plans together. They're here. Enemies here. Cause you've been sold out. They brought them here. So you better get the training. Better be taking your extra time, your extra money. You better get ready. This ain't no joke. They're here just like they rode in the Trojan horse and at night they sprung. It's like they're waiting for their moment. And once it begins, there ain't no going back. This country will never be the same. You better get ready. I'm warning you. I'm warning you, I'm warning you. I'm warning you. It's that time. So y'all better be prepping full scale. Better be training. You better be training. You better be getting with your people. You better be doing everything it takes right now, while you got the time. Before time's up, we got a big event coming. And as soon as a series of events goes into motion, it's like Domino's, one after another, and it won't stop. So a heads up here, I'm gonna leave some links below. Make sure to check out the video clip on my Twitter as well. You can hear from the colonel's mouth talking with an admiral on their Navy. Admiral talking about what's going on.",

I am not affected by your booze because I've seen what makes you cheer me. To take your criticism to heart, I'd first have to value your opinion. And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions. So if you wanna be mad at me, be mad at me. But if you want me to care, be somebody I respect first. Oh, and for all you haters keep jumping in my comments and giving me that algorithm boost.",

As UK prime minister, what would you be saying right now to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu? Stop that. Those scenes, those reports are horrifying. And you know what makes it worse is that this was a safe zone, um, with women and children in it and families, uh, that already fled a number of times. It is horrifying to see that. I've been saying for some time that the raffle offensive should not take place. And what you saw there was the consequences, the inevitable consequences of that offensive. It should not take place and we should join with our allies to ensure that it doesn't take place. The needs to be a ceasefire. It needs to be in place straight away. And that means, um, to provide the space for hostages to come out, for humanitarian aid to desperately get in and to provide a foot in the door for, um, the process, the political process. That's the only long term way through this, um, to a two state solution, which includes in the process the recognition of Palestine as a viable state, alongside a safe and secure Israel. So I'd be very clear about this. I was shocked by What I saw overnight. I think any human being would be shocked by what they saw overnight. It's got to stop. Thank you very much.",

He argued for the unaliving of people who are mentally disabled. He said all of them should go. Take a look at the clip here. People. Yeah, I think people who are gonna hold humanity back, we should eliminate them. Can you define, like, hold humanity back? Yeah, people who have met an IQ standard that they cannot support humanity or support a normal job or are mentally disabled. What? He is calling for the unaliving of millions of people around the world, people in the United States, because they don't hit his definition of productive member of society. That is an abhorrent thing to say. That is the position of some of the worst leaders in history. Mustache Man from World War 2 comes to mind. And he said this multiple times during the live, not just when Chris and I were there, but when he was debating other people. People like Parker and Dean have posted videos about this. Listen, this is not politics. I know there are people out there who disagree with me, there are people out there who agree with me, but this is not politics. This is basic human rights. And there are people watching this video who, under his belief, should have their close family members and loved ones unalived. It's disgusting. It's abhorrent. Nobody should Be saying things like that, especially a large creator like himself. So if you were watching that live, I'm sorry you had to witness that, but we are better than this as Americans.

And then they bombed them 60 times. A refugee camp when they were sleeping. 60 times, a refugee camp. A refugee camp, all made up of tents with families. And there is a video of a man who holds up a burnt Palestinian baby, and the baby's head is completely decapitated. And the videos are just of burnt people. That video was the very first video I woke up to this morning, and I had to cover my mouth to stop myself from screaming and sobbing. This is a sickness that we are watching. This is a sickness that we are all witnessing. And I became physically sick from this so much that I had to actually take time to focus on healing my body. And I think everyday the. The trauma, the torture that Palestinians in Gaza have to endure, that. That. That trauma will never leave them. It will never leave their bodies, it will never leave their mind. The torture that they are subjected to on a minute by minute basis. And there seems like there's no end in sight because it feels like America and Israel and the UK and all these European and western countries are above international law. So doesn't feel like we can even imagine the end, because right now, a. A. A country that That calls itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Bombed a refugee camp where people were sleeping, where families were sleeping. And people, Zionists will literally say, how can you say that? Israel's a monster? They gave them a warning. I feel. I feel like we're not all living in the same world. And in this time where there's multiple genocides and multiple famines happening all at the same time, and people in America are asking, well, if we're not voting for Biden, who are we gonna vote for? It is. It is. It is unreal sometimes to be alive at this point. It is. It feels like I am in the motherfucking Truman Show sometimes. Like, this shit is so unreal. Then I watch a video of children dying in the most horrible, in the most difficult ways humanly possible. Like, no one should have to leave this world feeling that much pain, let alone a child, a child whose body is so fragile. And then I realize this is very real.",

Last week it was fuck celebrities, fuck the Met Gala, fuck anyone who dared participate in that ostentatious show of wealth, regardless of what sort of work they've been doing for Palestine. But this week, for the Cannes Film Festival red carpet, it's, oh, my god, slay queen, make a stand, treatment, free Palestine. This week, we're defending celebrities because of the obvious, like, racism and things that they experience and the way that they were mistreated within the industry. Last week it was fuck celebrities. This week it's see celebrities as human. I only got two questions. What the fuck are y'all smoking, and why aren't you sharing? Like, what's happening? Are we actually going to be divesting from celebrity culture? Are we just temporarily pissed off at celebrities and trying to leverage social power to make them do what we want? Are y'all just pissed off and you want a target to aim your anger at? That is socially acceptable? So we just decided to hate on celebrities for a week, even though y'all aren't actually serious about untangling the social position of celebrities and how they function and what we can do to make things better? Is that what it is? Y'all just pissed off? Like, I personally think reactionary politic is bad, but apparently that's just how things are going to be on social media. So can we at least acknowledge and embrace that's the way things are? And then Work more strategically around it. Cause I'm personally tired of having like, a different moral purity shit test every week. How about y'all? last week's moral purity shit test was around capitalism and wealth. If you don't hate celebrities, you're wrong. This week's Moral Purity shit test seems to be more based around racism. If you don't defend people of color, you're wrong. Yo, I. I wanna get off of Mister Bones wild ride. I'm tired of this stupid fucking game where we choose a different marginalized identity to put on the pedestal in the Oppression Olympics every week.

    "voice_to_text": "So I heard a couple liberals talking about this on a podcast, and I have to say, it's fucking awesome. See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome.",

I'm so proud of you, Jewish, for so many reasons, but I want to share one with you. In February, I went back to Israel, um, to bear witness to the horrors that took place on October 7th. And one part of this trip was also learning about the history of the Jewish people. So we went to Jerusalem, the Old City, and I got a chance to walk on roads that my ancestors, the Jewish people, built with their bare hands 3,000 years ago. 2,000 years ago, the Romans ended up taking over, and they destroyed the Jewish capital and forcibly exiled most of the Jews living there. It became forbidden for the Jews to set foot on the roads that they themselves built. But what I love so much about being Jewish is that that did not stop us from wanting to return to Jerusalem. We tried for thousands and thousands of years, and we did, 3,000 years ago. And for 3,000 years, we have experienced people wanting to expel us and quite literally wipe us off the face of the earth. We look at now after October 7th. You look at Hamas, the terrorist organization that people somehow support that say they want to murder all Jews. You look at what's going on in college campuses, the anti Semitism. And still, 3,000 years ago, and now the Jewish people refuse to be knocked down. We refuse to let another people decide our fate. We refuse to stop fighting for our right to exist, for Israel's right to exist. Jews make up point two % of the population. After 3,000 years, we're still here. And it's not a miracle. It's because of us. It's not an accident. It's because of us. We're strong, we're resilient. And I'm just. I'm so proud to be Jewish.",

    "voice_to_text": "Five things you need to know about the arrest warrants being pursued for the leaders of Hamas and Israel. One. The ICC International Criminal Court is governed by the Rome Statute, which is made up of 124 member states from all around the world. Notably absent from that membership list is Israel, the United States, and quite a few other major nations. On that list is Palestine, having a ceded in 2,015, which means that any crimes committed in Gaza do fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. 2. The ICC International Criminal Court is different from the ICC, The International Court of justice. The ICC is designed to prosecute individuals accused of committing international crimes, like we see here, whereas the ICC, the International Court of justice, is designed to resolve disputes between nations. That is where South Africa has brought the genocide case against the state of Israel. 3. This next step could take weeks or even months. What happens now is that three judges inside of the ICC review the available evidence and if it's sufficient, will move forward and issue the arrest warrants for the leaders of Hamas and Israel. Which leads into point number four. The ICC does not have the capability to conduct arrests for anyone to be brought to justice under this system. The ICC requires that any of their 124 member states conduct that arrest, detain the individual, and move them to the HAG to face prosecution. And 5 we should expect Israel to Push back as to whether or not the ICC has jurisdiction here at all. Likely what they'll argue has to do with the primacy of domestic jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court is designed to be a court of last resort, not first resort. What that means is if these cases could be heard at the local, state, or national level, they should be before being brought to the ICC. That is probably an argument that Israel make in the coming days or weeks.",

If he succeeds, that war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead. And technology and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders.

    "voice_to_text": "My name is Morgan Cooper. I'm a US citizen married to a Palestinian. We're raising our two small children here in Ramallah of occupied Palestine. Now, for World Biodiversity Day Today, I had plans to show you a video of my three year old walking through our land on the mountain. But I've decided instead to show you something that I think is really important. So if you wanna see my three year old, go to the Handmade Palace sign Instagram page, and you'll see her there and the land. I'm up on our roof, okay? We have a rooftop garden, which means our roof looks a bit different than other people's because I'm gonna hang my laundry up here. What I wanna show you are these guys. These are water tanks, okay? Every Palestinian house has water tanks on their roofs. Let me show you the neighborhood. Okay. See that? That's how you can tell the difference between an Israeli settlement and Palestinian houses. Because we have water tanks. Why do we have water tanks? Well, that's because our water is stolen. The Israelis built settlements on top of our two main aquifers in the West Bank, and they've destroyed most of our artisan wells. Moreover, it is illegal for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to harvest rainwater because the state of Israel says we are in charge. We control everything. And rainwater is the property of the state of Israel. So our water comes from Baladiyat, Ramallah. The municipality Of Ramallah. And it comes once a week. So true story, this. Yesterday I was showering, and the hot water starts getting really, like, thin, I don't know, and just not a lot coming out. So I'm like, okay, really fast. Armpits, vagina, butt. Okay. And then by the time I had soap on myself, it was gone. So I was like, cold water. I'll have a cold shower. So I turn it all the way over to cold, and I'm, like, trying to rinse it off. And I get myself kind of cleaned off, but not really enough. And I'm like, let me just get my face. I get my face, and by then it's totally dry. So I get out of the shower soaking, dripping wet, and I go to the sink thinking, there's gotta be a little bit of water left in the pipe. And I'm, like, washing my face off, and there's soap in my eyes, and I barely got it and pretty much had to use a towel to get the soap off. Now, obviously, the situation Gaza is 100 times worth, because worse, because the Israelis deny them clean drinking water or any kind of water. It's just, like, incredibly inhumane. But what I wanna say to you is that beyond the seas. Fire! We still have to acknowledge that there is incredible injustice that is 76 years long here in occupied Palestine. Because we are a colonized land and a colonized people. And One of the things that is most basic as a human right is water. And our water is colonized. So happy world. Uh, I don't know. Biodiversity, Environmental Day, whatever it is, and please help. And the injustice here and around the world, because water is a basic human right for everybody, not just colonial powers where you have all the world's resources and you waste them.",

    "voice_to_text": "The outrageous decision by the ICC prosecutor, Kareem Khan, to seek arrest warrants against the democratically elected leaders of Israel is a moral outrage of historic proportions. It will cast an everlasting Mark of shame on the international court. Israel is waging a just war against Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas massacre. 12 Jews raped Jewish women, burned Jewish babies, took hundreds hostage. Now, in the face of these, ours, Mr. Khan creates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas. This is like creating a moral equivalence after September 11th between President Bush and Osama bin Laden. Or during World War 2 between FDR and Hitler. What a travesty of justice. What a disgrace! The prosecutor is absurd. Charges against me and Israel's defense minister. A million attempt to deny Israel the basic right of self defense. And I assure you one thing. This attempt will utterly fail. 80 years ago, the Jewish people were totally defenseless against our enemies. Those days are over. Now the Jewish people have a state. And we have an army to defend our state. Not withstanding the blood libals, Mister Khan is leveled. Israel will continue to wage this war in full compliance with international law. We will continue to take unprecedented measures to get innocent civilians out of harm's way and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need in Gaza. Mr. Khan also said to dangerous president that undermines every democracy's right to defend itself against terror organizations and aggressors. The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel, and Mr. Khan's actions will not stop us from waging our just war against Hamas. But Mr. Khan's abuse of this authority will turn the ICC into nothing more than a farce. He's doing something else. He is callously pouring gasoline on the fires of anti Semitism that are raging across the world. Through this incendiary decision, Mr. Khan takes his place among the great anti Semites in modern times. He now stands alongside those infamous German judges who donned their robes and upheld laws that denied the Jewish people their most basic rights and enabled the Nazis to perpetrate the worst crime in history. Two weeks ago, on Holocaust Memorial Day, I pledged this. No amount of pressure and no decision in any international form will prevent Israel from defending itself against those who seek our destruction. To all the enemies of Israel, including their collaborators in The Hague, I renew that pledge today. Israel will wage our war against Hamas until that war is won. Because never again is now.",

    "voice_to_text": "My name is Lex. I'm a nurse from the state of California. And today I wanna talk to you about Doctor Adam Hammelly. This is Doctor Hemoy. Doctor Hemoy lives in the United States and was a former US Army combat surgeon who is now in Gaza. Earlier this week, he posted a message for President Biden, and I think all of you need to hear it. As a US Army combat surgeon, veteran and international crisis first responder, I've built my life on service in the belief in the US government. I took a hippocratic oath to help people, whoever they are, wherever they are. When the call came in December 2,023, the doctors were needed through the World Health Organization. And being specialized in combat trauma and reconstructive surgery, I signed up to serve. I have never in my career witness the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza. I arrived in Rafaa as a part of a team coordinated by the WHO. We understood the dire conditions and plan to leave together in two weeks. On May 13th, in violation of international law, our team of medical professionals were denied exit. I want our president to know that we are not safe. When the call came in to evacuate, I was asked to choose to either evacuate and leave my team behind or stay with them. I could not, in good conscious, leave my team behind. That is not what I was Taught. That is not the Soldier's Creed. We don't leave Americans behind. This is against our values as Americans. As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team. And as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans. This burden falls on the international community and President Biden to use their full influence to ensure medical personnel can continue their critical work without being put in harm's way. We worry that the European hospital we are currently in will suffer a similar fate of Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, where humanitarian workers, patients and civilians were massacred. As for our patients, it is with a very heavy heart that we will ultimately leave them behind without care. And this responsibility remains in the hands of the international community. We entered with a commitment to be relieved with another medical team, and now this, too, is being denied. The people of Gaza deserve more than their burnt out, collapsed medical healthcare system. To my wife, daughters, and son, I know that it hurts that I am not coming home this weekend, and I am sorry, but I know that you are proud. And I am upholding my oath to never leave anyone behind. This man is a hero. I just ask, um, if you are still watching, that you pray for this incredible doctor, um, for both his safety and that he can complete his mission in saving lives and providing care. I would be so proud. If that was my dad, if that was my. My husband, my colleague. Whatever. Um. Doctor Hawami is a hero. And I, too, pray that European hospital is protected, because we have seen what Israel does to hospitals.",

You had Jeffrey start making videos throwing the girl products in a trash can. Y'all had her and Kylie Jenner losing followers made Selena Gomez jump by millions of followers. Y'all band together by the millions to do this because y'all aren't okay with mean girl energy, right? But y'all couldn't band together so post something, y'all come band together to repost something about genocide. You not cool with mean girls, but you're okay with genocide?

    "voice_to_text": "Finally, after seven month and a half today, that I have reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and minister of defence, you have gallant, bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes committed on the territory of the state of Palestine from at least October 8th, 2023. The crimes include starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, willfully causing great suffering, serious injury to body or health or cruel treatment, willful killing or murder and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, as well as crimes against humanity of extermination and or murder, persecution and allegations of crimes of committing other inhuman acts. My office submits that these individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. My office charges Netanyahu and Galant as co perpetrators and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes. So this was Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, who announced today that his office submitted applications to the court in order to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister of Israel, Binjamin Netanyahu, and the Defense Minister of Israel, UAV Galan. In addition to that, the same obligation was submitted against three members of the leadership of Hamas, Yahya Sinoi, Ismail Hani and Dave, who's in charge of Al Qasam Brigade. So now you need to understand that this is very important step in order to Save god the remaining of any shred of credibility for the rule of the international law. Because we cannot have war criminals commanding extermination armies with no consequences. But what is ridiculous is that the American politicians, senators, Congress members running out of their way, threatening the ICC and publicly acting like gangsters on behalf of the Israeli state, threatening the international institution. So now, according to Karim Khan, there are high credible evidence supporting the application. So what happens if the court actually issue those arrest warrants? Will Netanyaho be arrested if he travels? The answer is look at Bhutan. Bhutan actually has an arrest warrant and he actually travels without problems. But he travels to the countries that are not party to the ICC. So couple of months ago he was supposed to go to South Africa, but he didn't because he was risking to be arrested because South Africa is party to the ICC. In addition to that, after the arrest, Warren Putin was classified as a war criminal. And that's why the majority of the western counties claim not to have ties with him or with Russia. Now the question is, will the western countries, specifically the United State and the United Kingdom and Germany, cut ties with the Israeli government and sanction Israel? Let me know what do you think of this in the comments. Don't forget share this video button in your stories and duet it. This is very important please. And check the link in my Bio, if you wanna help the people in the north of Gaza. See you next video. Ciao.",

Video started circulating seconds ago on the Iranian News Telegram of rescuers stating that there are no survivors. This was also just now stated seconds ago on El Jazeera. Earlier today, a helicopter containing Iran's president along with Iran's foreign minister suffered what was considered a hard landing near the Azerbaijan border. Here's a map of the crash site. When it crashed, signals were detected by the armed forces of the helicopter and a cell phone from somebody on the flight crew. Turkey then sent 32 mountain specialists to help. On top of that, Russia went ahead and sent 47. Most analysts believe the reason it crashed was due to the bad weather. While all of this was going on, Republican Senator Rick Scott from Florida said, frosty said, the world is now a safer and better place. That evil man was a tyrant and tea. He was not loved or respected, and he will be missed by no one. He's gone. I truly hope that Iranian people have the chance to take their country back from murderous dictators. Turkey also sent a drone that has a live feed going. The drone then detected a source of heat from the crash site. The Gulf Cooperation Council has expressed their solidarity with Iran and the Iranian people. Now Iran's Vice President Muhammad Mubarak will be taking on the role of president until An election is held within a maximum of 50 days.",

Um, that doesn't mean that I think they deserve to be bombed and starved and purposefully pushed out of their rightful native land. Well, they're being bombed because they won't release the hostages, so. Well, Hamas agreed to release the hostages 10 times. Um, but all 10 agreements had a permanent ceasefire in them, and you are prime minister in that. Yahoo would not agree to that, so you can blame him for the hostages not being released yet. Oh, so Israel doesn't have the right to defend itself? Well, if you're occupying a land that doesn't belong to you violently for hundreds of years, you're not actually defending yourself from anything, you're just further occupying. And anybody that fights back against you is attempting to defend themselves. Um, so no, they took, like, technically they are not defending themselves from anything. Oh, I get it, I get it.

I mean, I'm not saying it's not, but I'm saying that is really, really bright. I've never seen a meteor that bright before. And wasn't that the same color as the Devil's Comet that was present during the eclipse? This is around, supposedly where it fell. Look at this, though. Look at the lens flare. There's something round. I'm not trying to wear a tin foil hat, right? I'm just saying there's something round and pointing like a craft of some sort. I don't know. What do y'all think? It must just be the skeptic in me, but to me, this seems like something more. What do y'all think it is? Do y'all believe in meteors? Let me know in the comments.",

The week that i made this video it was the week that i decided to stop preaching \u201cagainst\u201d muslims (you will find a few videos of me preaching to muslims). Once even after  posting \u201cexposing the quran\u201d and started   feeling something was wrong and feeling the fear of God, so i deletee it, after so many debates i decided to stop and open my heart, and the moment i opened my heart, literally i pray something and i open the quran and God answers my prayer, which god? the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. So one thing im sure today is THE QURAN IS NOT FROM THE DEVIL like i thought, it is literally the opposite! And i want to thank to every muslim who changed my life with their kindness even when my heart was so closed! ",

But again, if you're walking down the street and you see this sign, it's a pretty fair Assumption that this person is also anti Semitic or at the very least xenophobic. Everybody loves to say that anti Zionism is not anti semitism, but this doesn't seem like it's criticizing the Israeli government. It seems like it's calling for an end to the Jewish state, which is pretty antisemitic. It's becoming pretty clear that you guys are swapping out the word Jew with the word Zionist in order to justify your antisemitism.

    "voice_to_text": "Bouquet to motherfuckers. Come with me for Friday slash Shabbat and TEL Aviv, Israel. Start off the day with a classic morning debrief with the girls on Abu Una. I've been so busy the past 3 weeks. Literally have not seen my friends, but this coffee sesh was definitely needed. I went to the beach and I fell asleep for two hours and woke up so confused. One of the things I've been really, really busy with is hot girls. Douchebags did a recent collaboration with Operation Gratitude on Yom Hot Smooth. And a massive party for soldiers. Um, this motorcycle belongs to one of the soldiers. It's fine vibes, he picked me up and it was really nice. Brought me home. I start to get ready for Shabbat. What I showed you guys is my clean room. Yes! I finally cleaned my room. You can see the floor. It's not perfect, but, like, you can see the floor. Anyway, now I'm going to my friend Izzy's birthday Shabbat dinner. The cute garden party vibe, so I love an excuse to get dressed up. Wore my long dress that I haven't worn in years, and it could not have been more beautiful. This is literally what my Pinterest board looks like. My personalized menus for everyone. Like, the thought and attention to detail that was put into this, I can't even imagine. I'm sorry. How cute is this disco ball? And the flower? Like, everything. She tied it All together, we lit our candles, and the feast began. I ate so much food, I was rolling out of here. I love being a woman. Like, I love being a girl. This. Boys can't do this. Boys don't get to do this. But girls do. Girls could have birthday cakes that look like this. Girls could have birthday cakes and tomorrow. I love being a girl. I feel so bad for boys. They don't get to do this. Ugh. Poor them. Anyway, was also my friend Misha's birthday. So after our dinner party, went over to Misha's house, had a few drinks, brought him some flowers from our dinner, then made him and all the boys watch JoJo Siwa's Karma video. Their reaction, so funny. They're like, what is this? What am I watching? Ah, change it. But then we did change it to, like, music videos from the 2 bangers. Absolute bangers. Conveniently, me, she lives, like, right across the street from me, so walked home and that's all.",

And I was like, yeah, but what kind of Middle Eastern food? She was like, I'm pretty sure they're Lebanese. They do Lebanese all of this stuff. My friend is Lebanese, by the way. No hate to the friend. Love you. We got to the place, my friend ordered her food, and I was looking, and I was like, like, what is? Like, I wanna know where this place is from. So I was asking recommendations from the people that work there, and I was like, what is this place? Like, what kind of food is this? She was like, oh, it's Middle Eastern food from all over the Middle East. I was like, yeah, but specifically what country? Like, are you Lebanese? He was like, we're really from all over the place. We have Moroccan food, we have Lebanese food, we have everything. So I was like, might as well be specific. Who owns this place? And then she was like, oh, a Israeli couple. When I tell you. I was literally about to explode. I was so angry in front of this woman. I looked at my friend, and I was like, well, I'm not eating here. And then I turned to the woman, and I was like, by the way, all of this food is Arabic food, not Israeli food. You need to be so Careful where you're buying your bloody Middle Eastern food. The trick is, this is how they trick you. They will say Middle Eastern because they know that if they say Israeli, people won't come to their place. So if places Israeli, they will try to avoid acknowledging that is Israeli as much as possible. Which is why everyone needs to do as much research as they can before they enter a bloody place. Especially if they're selling Arabic food but are reluctant to tell you specifically where it's from. If it's an Arabic place, we will tell you specifically. Lebanese, Jordanian, Palestinian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Algerian, we will tell you specifically where the food is from. If it's an Israeli restaurant or an Israeli cafe, they will avoid it at all costs. This is the fake Middle Eastern like cafe place by the way, so people can avoid it. I'm so tired of Israelis and Zionists stealing our food, stealing our culture, stealing everything we have as Arabs and Palestinians. Other masquerade us, destroying our homes, killing us, genociding us, killing our children, destroying our families, destroying our homes, destroying our land while profiting off of our culture. Please, if you have any drop of humanity inside of you, don't go to or eat at Israeli anything. Israeli cafes, restaurants, anything. And by the way, Israeli food literally does not even exist. There's literally no such thing as Israeli food. They just stole our food. They stole Palestinian food and rebranded It",

So when I asked people about the worst thing about being displaced, they all answered me the same thing. This is not a normal displacement. This is the second neck bear. So what is the first? Nickname. I mean, the nickname. In 1948, more than 15,000 Palestinians were killed, more than 500 villages were destroyed, and more than 800,000 people Palestinians were displaced. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from the whole cities of Palestine were forced to leave their homes and villages to Gaza Strip, Westbang or to the de support.

You know how normally your videos just go through an algorithm and then they post? Well, not anymore. So let's talk about exactly how this is happening and why it's happening. Do you guys remember a couple of days ago? If you haven't seen it, go back in my video and watch it. It's called the Pentagon papa John's and how they fire up to counteract something and all the pizza places will be slammed because they're making them work overtime. And during Blockout 2024, the papa John's just so happened to fire back up. Okay, well it has to do with that. We all know who controls Hollywood and the celebrities, right? Cause they help push the narrative. So apparently during our little block out 2024, they fired the papa John's over by the Pentagon back up again. That means they're working them double time to where they practically have to live at the office. So starting tomorrow, there will be a physical person from none other than your friendly neighborhood US government looking through all of your videos. They are also gonna be looking at all the creators and figuring out who they wanna keep and who they don't. So as for now, we're gonna be keeping an eye on it. But as of tomorrow, expect some changes. This is gonna Be very interesting to see how long it takes to get content out. Also, they're making it to where if you post about the blockout, it doesn't go to FYP anymore. So District 12, tell me, what are we gonna do about it? How are we gonna counteract this? Like, share, follow, comment, push this video out. People need to know what's happening. Give me any suggestions you may have in the comments, please.",

They traveled the world, and no one will take them. They ended up in our backyard. We love them, my mother said. We fed them, we dressed them, we made sure they're safe. When she came back to the gates of our home, they locked us out without allowing us to go in. To take a single memory. Was nine days old. She had to carry me alone with my sister all the way to Syria. My uncle found my father and my other two sisters and my grandmother in a refugee camp out in the desert. Lot of unfortunate people kept. I stayed behind. The refugee camps all over. All over the world. They were unfortunate. We made it safe. My. My saddest moments. I can say that. My mother asked me to promise her that when. When she dies, be buried in with her parents and their cemetery in Nazareth. I did. Not do that one single thing.

    "voice_to_text": "I've realized that I'm actually in the wrong for getting mad at Miss Rachel for her pro Palestine narrative, because it's not her fault that that's the only type of language that community can understand is at her level. So I decided to be nice and try to re explain history and a way that they'll understand. Because sometimes when our friends can't understand what we're saying, it means that we have to repeat ourselves a lot of times, and that can get frustrating. Can you say frustrating? That means a really bad feeling, like you're very annoyed. So I'm going to explain it at your level, because sometimes when we rephrase things for our friends, it can help them not understand. So let's do a short history lesson in a pro Palestine friendly way, starting with the British Mandate of Palestine. Please do not laugh at our friends drawing. Not all of us are good at drawing. But this is the British Mandate of Palestine. Can you say British? Why is it called the British Mandate of Palestine? Because the British owned it. Do you know where the word Palestine comes from? No, friends. It's not an Arab word. It actually comes from the Romans. Good job. I'm so proud of you. And right here, when we hear the chant from the river to the sea, they're talking about the Mediterranean Sea all the way to the Jordan River. That's not very nice to be yelling the push. Our friends Out of an entire country. That makes me sad. After the British Mandate of Palestine, when the British decided that they wanted to share the country, we had three different proposed countries. Can you say Jordan? Jordan. Good job. And is Jordan bigger than Israel? Palestine land. It is. Good job, friends. Jordan is bigger, but we don't say that Jordan is occupying Palestinian land. That's what we like to call a double standard. A double standard is when you have one set of rules for one group of people, and a different set for another one. That's not good. We don't like double standards. The proposal included Israel and Palestine sharing the land. We like sharing. Sharing is good, so that all of our friends can get a piece. But unfortunately, it didn't go that way. See, with sharing, Israel said, yes, we will share. Palestine said, no, I don't wanna share. I want all of it. Palestine was being very, very greedy. That made Britain mad, because Britain owned the land, and they were trying to be nice and share with their friends. They didn't like that Palestine was being very, very greedy. So after that, Palestine decided to form the Arab Liberation Army with all of their friends. To try to gang up on little Israel. Israel was a lot smaller, and that hurt their feelings. They hurt them really, really badly. And we don't hurt our friends. But they didn't know that little Israel actually packs A big punch. And it didn't exactly go the way that they planned. So what did we learn here? We Learned a few things. Number one, we Learned that we should share. Number two, we learn that we can't always get what we want. And number three, don't hit our friends. Because sometimes they'll kick your ass. In six days. Hope you guys enjoyed today's lesson.",

In true Australian fashion, he loves a good ham and cheese toastie with a barbecue sauce. The real question for y'all though is if part of your cheese starts molding, do you throw it out or do you just cut off the mold and continue to eat it? Sorry to all the Australians because they made the most pathetic little cheese toastie with the last bits of bread I had. However, it was incredibly delicious and I definitely make it again. Jake says the sign of a true cheese toastie is that it's squish, and that made mine very crispy. Like listen to that crunch for lunch. One of you actually suggested chapagetti with spam for Jake's Day. I've never made this combination before, but it was delicious. Chapagetti is an S tier instant noodle in my book. Always. And I added some spinach for a healthy colon. And lastly, Jake's favorite Korean dish is kimchi, so I made that for dinner. However, I realized I was out of tofu at the very last second, so I tried substituting that protein with eggs, which was weird but good. I'm so sorry Jake for these janky meals. I obviously flopped my grocery run. Either way, this was delicious and I still thoroughly enjoyed these. And let me know which member I should eat Like next",

And despite us and a few other outlets correcting the record, the lie persists. The second lie is that UNRWA participated in the Oct. 7 attacks even after that was debunked more than a month ago. It turns out that UNRWA workers were tortured into admitting they did when they actually lied to save themselves from further torture.

The White House said the tariff hikes were necessary to protect American industries from unfair competition. Starting this year, Biden will impose a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports, a 50% tariff on Chinese solar cells and a 25% tariff on certain Chinese steel and aluminum imports.

And we're making major investments in clean American steel, aluminum. Clean American steel, aluminum. It's a big deal. Clean because of the way we manufactured here. It makes half as much carbon as steel made in China. Last month my administration announced the largest investment in clean manufacturing in all of history. Up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across in America, creating sporting thousands, thousands of union jobs. Next, a 100% terror from electric vehicles made in China. People say, wow! Because we're not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automotive auto manufacturers to compete fairly.",

You wanna boo a 20 year old girl just because she's from Israel? Yallah, go ahead. But if you threaten and harass a singer to a point where it's not safe for her own parents to watch her perform, that's not activism. You're not doing shit for Palestine with that. You are using the suffering of the Palestinian people as a platform for your trash behaviour. Don't pretend this is about your protest. It's very important to protest for the rights of Palestinians and to put pressure on all parties involved. But when you're attacking artists at Eurovision, and not just there, just sometimes because they're from Israel, or even just because they're Jewish, you're not doing that for Palestine. And this is happening. I had to cancel multiple shows because it was not safe for me or the audience. And I'm just a shitty comedian.

    "video_description": "Unfortunately, many Christians, especially in the USA, overlook the fact that the Bible was written in the very places they support bombing. They fail to recognize that the Bible is filled with people whom they exhibit racist attitudes towards today. While they readily support children of Ukraine because of their skin color, they turn a blind eye to Palestinian children simply because they are brown. I often wonder if these individuals fail to realize that the Bible predominantly features people of color. Do they genuinely believe that Jesus was a white man with blue eyes, wearing hey dudes? These attitudes contribute to the societal challenges we face today. To the Christians around the world who are standing with us to stop the genocide, I express my heartfelt gratitude and love. To those who recognize the shared humanity of Arab/Palestinian Christians, I salute your empathy and understanding. And to those Christians who reject racism and embrace people of all colors, I wholeheartedly welcome you into our extended family. #together ",

Why do they want us to know about the Palestinian Israeli conflict? And this is. I'm not talking about this from a perspective of, um, being against genocide, because, yes, free Palestine, we are all against genocide at this point. Well, the people who are smarter against genocide at this point. But that being said, Congo is going through somewhat of a genocide as well. To. Horrible sexual crimes are being committed against the Congolese people, Congolese women specifically. And then Haiti is. Is no slouch in terms of the atrocities that they are experiencing. Why are they letting us pay attention to the Israeli Palestine one? My first thought is this, because there's black people in Congo and there's black people in Haiti. But I. But I don't think the Palestinians are like the favorite media darlings either. So the question still comes to me, why are they letting us. Why is that one on the news? Why is that one, the one that they're paying attention to? Someone, someone give me your thoughts in the comments, cause I'm. I'm curious. Ever since I shaved my head bald, I have all these ethereal thoughts. Now, maybe this is a stupid thought that has a very obvious answer, and I'm willing to just accept that, but somebody, somebody alert me as to why you think that. Why. Why Would they allow us to argue about these really Palestinian conflict, but not allow us to argue about Congo and Haiti?",

I don't know what this is, but if it costs more than $20, I'll be shocked. What is this? I live with my mother. What is this? What am I gonna tell her it is? I feel like everyone could make this. I need to see an actual person's bedroom with this hanging up, and then see what the person looks like, and it'll all probably make sense. Okay, hear me out. I kind of understand this one. So my aunt lives in the Jersey Shore, and, like, she has a, like, beach themed bedroom. Like, is this what people do in Nashville? Okay, hot take. I kind of like this one.",

    "video_description": "Something far more insidious and evil could very well be behind the Biden ploy to build a new port or pier The ultimate possible key to explain what\u2019s behind Biden\u2019s ploy with the new port concept is to buy yet more time for the Gaza Strip to be completely leveled by the Israelis, and for many more Palestinians to die, but primarily for facilitating access and exploitation of the alleged $500 billion worth of Palestinian natural gas resources under the sea near Gaza. These gas resources have not yet been tapped to any degree but they have been fully explored and mapped out. Why are they important to the U.S. and Israel to steal? In sum, no doubt, the U.S. wants to offer cheaper, exploited Palestinian gas resources to its allies in Europe and elsewhere once Gaza has been totally taken over by the Israelis, not to mention boosting Israel wildly with the theft of Palestinian natural gas. In effect, Palestinian resources that could be sold to rebuild Gaza for Palestinians would be forever lost and sooner or later deployed as a replacement for lost shipments of gas to Europe given the absence of Russian gas via the now-destroyed Nord Stream pipelines. The Israeli theft of the gas offshore Gaza may well be the reason for the genocide fully enabled by the U.S. And one must not forget the plan for the so-called, proposed \u201cBen Gurion\u201d canal that would connect the Mediterranean with the Red Sea at Eilat, bypassing the Suez Canal run by Egypt.  All this may mean, in effect, that the Israeli genocide underway in Gaza is not nearly complete. The nasty dream of Israel with U.S. support is to take over Gaza totally, build new settlements and resorts there for Jews along Gaza\u2019s fine beach, and more. Not just Israel but the U.S. benefits greatly with the offshore gas sales and the canal scheme. And guess what! After and if Gaza is cleared of Palestinians either dead or forced to move to Egypt or somewhere else, the Israelis will then attempt to move forcefully to clear the West Bank of Palestinians and fully annex the West Bank, too.

    "voice_to_text": "Cause all of this resettlement plan is happening while all while this is happening, this joint port project is now unfolding, which will enable the United States and Israel to steal all of that oil and natural gas just sitting off the coast of Gaza. So here you are looking at the foundation being built of our new port that will steal all of that oil and natural gas. Of course, all along, as we point it out, guys, this is all about oil, this is all about money, this is all about natural gas. It's all about stealing resources. It's all about building beachfront condos right there. Look at this beautiful, brand new port being built. So Fiora Isabel writes, the journalist says Israel and the US United States had begun construction on the port, located 20 miles off of the 500 billion dollar Gaza marine oil and gas fields, where tens of thousands have been killed. Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, told media the cost is $320 million and includes the transportation of equipment and pier sections from the US to Gaza's coast, as well as the construction and aid delivery operations. So, yes, you American taxpayers are paying for a new port to be built right inside of Gaza. $320 million. Did you sign up for that, by the way? We now Learned inside of that massive aid package to Ukraine and Israel last week that was passed by Congress, slipped in there, we now know it's a massive plan for resettlement. In the United States. Millions of dollars to resettle Palestinians out of the Middle East into the United States. So, yes, and in true US fashion. Sorry? In true US fashion, we're paying for this port. So our taxpayers are paying for this port so we can bring aid into the people that we have displaced to build this port. Right. And so that's it. And not even really bring aid to them, right? Really steal their oil, steal their natural gas. So, yeah, we've already done the. There's not gonna be much aid needed left cause they won't be there anymore. They're gonna be gone. As you can see, we've cleared the area. There used to be homes here, there used to be a buildings here. Those are being cleared out. And of course, a new port is being built with the United States and Israel in lock step. So, yes, we're building this. And it will station 1,000 American soldiers to protect the theft of oil that we're about to embark on. Can you believe this?",

And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there. Huh? Where should they go then? Hell, who should they listen to if not the primary sources that are live video footage of children blown to bits, mothers wailing in agony, trapped under rubble? Should they listen to politicians who routinely lie to them and write laws that favor themselves and their corporate and lobbying donors who investigate themselves when accused of crimes against the American public, only to surprisingly state they've discovered that they've done nothing wrong? Should they listen to mainstream media who, not to go out in foil hat on you, is bought and paid for, used by the rich and powerful to sway the public into believing a chosen narrative? Should they listen to Hillary the hawk, whose rap sheet in the Middle East is far from favoring peace or at the very least, the interests of American citizens? The woman who said, and I quote, that Americans should get over themselves if they're not happy with the candidate options for presidency? The woman who left American citizens to die in the Middle East? Now, it would be dishonest to pretend that social media can't muddy the information that people are getting because there are So many people posting videos. People with biases, people who are ill intentioned, people who are well intentioned but confused themselves. But this isn't 2001 anymore. This isn't 2012 anymore, where we'd have to wait for a sterilized press release from our oligarchs to have any insight on what's happening around the world, our involvement in it, and take it at face value. It is all at our fingertips. And no, possibly muddy in the beginning, it all comes to light eventually. Now, if I were you and wanted to win people over in some way, and I know you're one to double down on whatever behavior contributed to your past losses instead of seeking to improve it, hence why your communication style with the American public hasn't changed since you lost to Trump, even though it should have.

It already is. And that gives me hope. You do not need to be prisoners of the past. You can resist attempts to divide you from anybody else on the basis of their nationality or ethnicity or religion or the color of their skin. You can reject discrimination and hate speech and propaganda and lies. You can share a vision for a world built on equal rights, equal laws, respect for difference. Could not exist, would not succeed. That is the best way we can honor the families we remember today and the victims of persecution everywhere with whom we can be proud to stand. I'm thinking today all of the other survivors whose husbands, brothers and sons were murdered in the genocide. I think two of the victims in particular, the children who were denied the chance to live and love and have families of their own. It is a loss beyond words. I send you my sympathy and my respect, and I grieve with you. I want to speak today to the young people in the region and beyond. You might wonder what it has to do with you. It lives on wherever people find excuses to single out others and deny them their rights as equal human beings. It started with prejudice and discrimination, with hate speech that demonized a whole. People and treated them less than human. It was spread by leaders who used lies to manufacture fear to condition people to accept violence.

Go ahead, do it. I'm gonna ask the same question when you finish your rant, though. I'm gonna ask you, would you negotiate peace with Nazi Germany? Go ahead. So the Nazis were in the middle. Were in the middle of murdering 6 million Jews and 13 million innocent people, let alone the millions that were died in the war. So if in the middle of their murder, somebody said, hey, let's give them what they want, that would have been dumb. October 7th happened months and months ago. And every day you've been killing thousands and thousands or hundreds and hundreds of Palestinians, and you say, not enough, not enough, not enough, not enough. Kill more, kill more! Kill more! You're the guilty one!",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm a little confused. People can explain if they want, but I will explain how I understand it, which is that if I donate up $60,000 to save the children, then I have 0% of that money. If I don't donate it, then twenty five percent of it will go to the US government and I will have 75% of that money. So I like the situation where save the children gets 100%, I get 0%, versus the situation where the US government gets 25% and I get 75%. If that sounds like something that is bad or that I'm doing in a self for a selfish reason, then I can, I will happily. Please help me understand that there. You could say it's for a selfish reason, cause I've said that I'm doing it out loud and so I'm getting social capital for it. That's a legitimate criticism. Um. And it is why I usually do not talk about my donations when I'm doing large donations to save the children or doctors without borders. Because it seems weird to me to like say, hey, I'm doing this, please give me social capital. I wanted to do the match to save the children. I think I'm just gonna stop making content for a little while because this is very strange to me. But I wanted to get the money, save the children. Because in Gaza there are a number of people who can do a border crossing per day. Except By the. The Egyptian government. And we can't make that number go up. The vast majority of people will not be able to leave Gaza. And the vast majority of children in Gaza won't be able to leave. Save the children is on the ground building impromptu hospitals, delivering medicine, delivering food, bringing doctors in to help care for people. We need to do both. And so I thought it would be good to do both. Like, I'm sorry I take it down a notch, Hank. It's fine. People are gonna misunderstand and misinterpret and, like, it's fine. Uh, you. Like, you can't make everybody happy, but, like. But I do. Like, I. I do think it's important to understand that we need to do both. We need to help people get out of Gaza, and we need to help people who are in Gaza. And I thought that, and I. I think, and I continue to believe, and I think most people continue to believe that it is good to do both. Like, we have not. It is good. We have to do both. Okay. Okay. I think I'll just step back for a little bit.",

I'm going to use as coded of language as I can in this video because every time I previously try to make a video on the subject matter, it's either gotten flagged for a view or taken down, or just completely suppressed by the algorithm. I do not support isn't real. I don't believe isn't real is a real place. I believe it's an American colony made up by the United States of America so they can kill brown people and steal their land under the guise of it technically being a different country, but it's actually just the United States and sheep's clothing. Because that's all the United States of America has ever done since its inception is kill brown people and steal their land. I do not support isn't real in any fathomable way, shape, or form beyond its capacity to crumble. I am very pro watermelon people, and I have been ever since I first Learned about what this conflict even was. Back when I was in high school, I used to run a Taylor Swift Stan account on Twitter and one of my mutuals named nayama ended up going to prison for several months because she refused to join the IDF. She said she did not want to murder children. I repeat, it is illegal to not want to murder children and Isn't real. So if you're defending it, that's what you're defending. In conclusion, fuck isn't real. Fuck The United States of America's government. Fuck Amy. And if you get down with genocide, fuck you, too. You're a disgusting, vile, reprehensible human being, and I hope you die and rot in hell, you piece of shit! Harm yourself.",

VCU students who spoke at a recent Board of Visitors meeting said they were upset with Youngkin\u2019s perceived interference with VCU\u2019s now rejected racial literacy requirement.  They also expressed objections to Youngkin\u2019s views on LGBTQ+ rights, healthcare, and his response to police breaking up a pro-Palestine protest.  \u201cYes, VCU has a bipartisan tradition of inviting gubernatorial speakers to commencement,\u201d explained one student in the meeting. \u201cBut progress has never been made without challenging tradition. And our students and faculty cannot truly be Rams. If we were not headstrong, and we\u2019d not headbutt that which we do not like.\u201d Earlier this week, Governor Youngkin responded to students saying they would protest the commencement saying, \u201cI firmly believe it can be a great day of celebration.

Um, the Oslo Accords were between Bill Clinton, Yasser Arafat, and I can't pronounce his first name, but Rabin, he was the prime minister at the time in Israel. The three of them got together, laid out all these terms to create a peace deal where Israel would withdraw from the West Bank and withdraw from Gaza and stop, like, using military force. And Rabin said, okay, we can do that. We want peace. We want this to stop. All three men agreed. They were all on board and ready to sign this deal. Um, you can look this up yourself, but I'm going to tell you. Rubin was assassinated very soon after that. And then guess who took his place? Benjamin Netanyahu. And Benjamin Netanyahu looked at the terms with the two original people and said, I'm not doing that. We'll pull out a Gaza, but I'm not stopping military force. And he, like, said no to a couple other things in there. And the Palestinian president at the time was like, that's. That wasn't the original agreement. We all agreed on this. We don't want your military in the West Bank. We don't want your military, like, controlling the Gaza Strip. And Benjamin Netanyahu said no to the deal, so the Palestinian president walked away. But everybody only says that part of it. They say, oh, Palestine, they walked away. They didn't want the deal. No, they did. Benjamin Netanyahu had Rabin assassinated. He took over and changed all the rules, and he's doing it again. So, like, please don't just look at the headline of something. Read the actual article, because you could learn a lot.",

And this is caused massive outlash over social media due to the fact there's a massive wage disparity in the world today with influencers making millions and millions of dollars to post on social media and everyday people simply struggling to make ends meet and pay their bills and get a job. The effect has caused many celebrities to lose massive amounts of followers, hoping that celebrities will lose a lot of their income as a result.

    "voice_to_text": "Of course. War is horrible. So why did the Palestinians initiate this war with their vicious attack on Israelis on October 7th? Well, they didn't. What do you mean, they didn't? They didn't. This war has been going on for 75 years. Israel initiated it in 1948 by ethnically cleansing 750,000 people. We must expel Arabs. We must expel Arabs and take their places. We must expel Arabs and take their places. And if we have to use force, not to dispossess the Arabs of the negative and Trans Jordan, but to guarantee our own right to settle in those places, then we have force at our disposal. David Ben Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, said that in 1937. And that's what they proceeded to do. The people in Gaza, this is what you need to understand. The people in Gaza, over 80% of them are refugees. Many of them are from a place called Majdal, Askelon, in what is now southern Israel, in a city called Ashkelon. And they were dragged from their homes and driven from their homes, placed in prison camps, barbed wire prison camps, and then dumped in trucks in 1950 into the Gaza Strip, where they would be permanently warehoused. And then Israel proceeded to move Arab Jewish refugees and Russians into Ashkelon to prevent them from ever coming back. And pass laws to prevent Arabs, Palestinians from being able to return to their homes. 750,000 were ethnically cleansed. Sit 8 for 18 years. The remaining Palestinians, 100,000 were internally displaced inside Israel. The remaining were put under military rule. They were under military occupation until 1966. Then in 1967, Israel violently, in a war it initiated, occupies Gaza, occupies the West Bank, occupies the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights in East Jerusalem, and then invades Lebanon in 1982, attacking Palestinian refugees there. Puts Gaza under siege in 2005. No. No one can get in or out without Israeli military permission. We must kill and kill all day, every day. That's according to Arnon Sofa. Sofa and Israeli government consultant to help decide this, devise the siege of Gaza. For years, Israel would not allow certain chocolates and A2 paper into Gaza. And then they began these brutal military assaults, which they call mowing the lawn. Slaughtering a few people will leave Hamas intact, but keep them a lesson, teach them a lesson. And I talked to you about those assaults that took place on Gaza. So this didn't come out of a vacuum. This. You're not gonna be able to hold people under siege, then cut them off from the world, and then expect them to just play along. That doesn't mean that I celebrate what happened on October 7th. It should have never had to happen. The reason it happened is because of the Israel lobby here, the genocide Democrats and the genocide Republicans, who deny the Palestinians any right to have the right to have rights. And it's the right to have rights, That defines you as a citizen. They're citizens of nothing. And now we see what Israel really thinks of them, really thinks of their children. Gaza has become a graveyard for children, according to UN Secretary General Antonio Gutterrez. So this didn't start on October 7th, and it's not going to end when there's a ceasefire.",

Like, truly nowhere left to go. That's a harrowing thought. UN is calling this nothing short of a humanitarian nightmare. And they are so right. While activism is not the main focus of my platform, it still means a lot to me. And I can't change how little I've spoken about a cause in the past. All I can do is change how much I'm gonna talk about it in the future. I've connected with Erin Hatter. She's doing a great job over on her front. And I have some organizations and I'm gonna plug at the end of this, as well as giraffe wallow. That's my sister. I mean, there are so many inspiring people on this app who are inspiring me and so many other creators to be better about how often we're posting about Palestine right now. I wanna call to action. All of my followers keep donating, reposting, sharing. I'm doing so and will continue to do so as best I can. It's also important to stay updated. I have some update accounts, and I'm gonna link it. It's gonna be a long description, so if you've been looking for links, now is the time. I try to post credible information and sources on Instagram Stories every day when I can. Okay, and here is my list of Organizations and charities that I would recommend donating to. First of all, I'm reading off my list. Sorry. Uh, the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, UNICEF, Doctors without borders, uh, World Central Kitchen, helping to get food to people in Gaza. Um, WHL. And lastly, head count if you are not registered to vote. If you're an American and you're not registered to vote, please do that head count. Rock the vote. So many different companies. Make it easy and make it simple. If you've never previously voted in an election, now is the election to do it in. If you, like me, do not feel represented by your government that is funding a genocide. Please, probably now is the year to vote. Stay informed. Keep talking about Palestine. Call your representatives. Thanks, guys.",

    "voice_to_text": "You guys know, I don't chime in too much. First off, I'll apologize for the bumpy ass video. Our roads aren't exactly the best around here. But I did want to address this comment. So the video was not intended or what we're doing, not intended to be political in any way. Humanitarian only. And when Chanel found this stuff and wanted to do it, I asked her a couple questions and, you know, we talked about it and it was 100% humanitarian effort based. You know, try to help a family in a bad situation. That was it. So, you know, we. She knows. Not even very political at all. Um, I am very opinionated politically. I try to keep that stuff to myself cause I think it gets pushed around too much. It's nice to get a break from that. So, um, you know, I try to avoid doing stuff like that. However, like just helping out a family, it doesn't mean like I'm gonna throw myself in the middle of a freaking, you know, centuries old conflict between two nations. Like that is. That stuff in the Middle East is so complicated that 99.9% of the people who are spouting off and spewing different opinions on it, they don't even know the half of it or the gist of it at all. They're just, you know, you get one little nugget information and you base your opinion on that, which is fine. Like, I don't have any problem. With that. But there's so much nuance, there's so much to the whole matter that say, I'm not gonna interject myself into that. She knows. Not going to. Most people don't even understand it. So all the video is, it's not about supporting one nation over another nation or anything like that. All it is is she found a family that needed a little bit of assistance to try to get out of a bad situation. I can support that. If. If that's too much, then we don't. Then don't. Don't donate, don't do anything. That's fine with us. I don't expect everyone. I mean, I know everything is tight. I was on here bitching about the cost of donuts, what, a freaking week ago? So, you know, I'm not expecting, you know, a ton of money to be raised from this, but we don't have to get, like, into political argument over it, either. So, anyways, that's my two cents.",

    "voice_to_text": "What you're seeing here is an Israeli armored bulldozer destroying Palestinian roads in the West Bank, a practice that is remarkably common amongst Israeli occupational forces. The goals of operations like this are fairly straightforward. Their attempts at terrorizing Palestinians living under Israeli occupation while simultaneously making their lives incredibly difficult. And it's a reminder that the sort of colonial violence that is employed by the Zionist project against Palestinians extend simply beyond, like, simple brutalization and murder. Israeli occupational forces and Israeli settlers have gone out of their way for decades, try to create conditions of life on the ground that are so inhospitable to Palestinians that Palestinians either die or leave. The goal of that being to create and maintain what Israeli planners view as more favorable demographic compositions in the areas in which they're colonizing. And as a result of these operations, you often times see the demolition of Palestinian roads, of Palestinian wells for water, of Palestinian homes, of entire Palestinian villages. It's a constant daily violence that is waged openly against Palestinians living under Israeli occupation and Palestinians living outside of Israeli occupation who are denied their ability to return home from the lands in which they historically been ethnically cleansed from. These bulldozers, by the way, are also a representation of ongoing US complicity in Zionist settler colonialism. As these bulldozers are actually manufactured by Caterpillar, an American company, this bulldozer is, in effect, a result of capitalism, settler colonialism, and ultimately, imperialism, something that I think is worth thinking about is we continue watching Palestinians suffer under a brutal and repressive Israeli occupation. But, yeah, is always free Palestine. Islamu alaikum, and have a great day.",

And she's screaming for help and screaming for help, and no, there's no help. Later, when they interviewed all the tenants, they were like, why didn't you call 9 1 1? And they were like, oh, I thought somebody else would call 9 1 1. Thus, to get the spy standard effect, which is literally thinking, somebody else is gonna do it, so you don't do anything. Now, it's interesting cause we're having this, like, online version of this now with what's going on in Palestine. You're just thinking, oh, somebody else is gonna donate. Somebody else is gonna do something. I have 1.7 million followers. Every single one of you donated 14 cents. Literally the coin sitting at the bottom of your bag right now.

So far, we raised almost $7,000. A lot of the donations are small, but they're impactful because 400 donations made $7,000. You can make a difference. You do not have to be a bystander.

But the reason why I want you to block her now is because she is literally having the worst week ever. First she got booed, then she got interrupted by protesters. Followed it up with like an all lives matter type statement. I understand blocking a celebrity that has been silent, but blocking a celebrity that has been a hypocrite is so satisfying. She talked about the Armenian G word up and down all on the show, on her Instagram, but took the whole other side for the G word that's happening right now. That's crazy. Kim Kardashian is very aware of what the people are saying about her at any moment in time. Her face when she got booed at the Tom Brady roast. She was so offended. Also it has been so quiet. Not getting consistent ads for skin by Kim and skims has been so great. That's why for Blackout 2024, I nominate your number one to be Kim Kardashian!",

But the stories that we see in the books or we read in the books is a reflection of what happens in the real world. Okay, let's track that back. The reason why I cannot trust these people, liberals or on the left, is because I truly don't believe under white supremacy, white empathy extends beyond their ability to humanize themselves. The fact that people didn't understand this is what's been happening to black and brown people. Star Wars was made about Imperial Wars against black and brown people. The Hunger Games, Imperial War against black and brown people. And we're sitting here not being able to humanize the black and brown people when it's happening in the real world. And then when it starts happening and we can turn the heroin into a person, then you guys start to get, oh, my goodness. Maybe imperialism, colonialism, and fascism are pretty fucking bad when they happen to you. Even better, you guys are saying, wait a second. This, what's happening in the real world, reminds me of what I read in a fictional story. Please free yourselves from white supremacy. Because in chasing the validation of white supremacy and those who adhere to those standards, you automatically have to dehumanize yourself in exchange for whatever valuable validation. They can give you, which probably just ends up being monetary gain or social acceptance. But if you don't care about the games they play, and you truly desire to understand your value outside of this, you're gonna have to get used to being lonely, get used to being invalidated and rejected, and truly start to understand what it means to self validate gifts and unique traits of yourself and how you desire to exchange or share those with the world outside of you. I got, like, I'm two hours deep in a YouTube video on this exact topic. We keep on in social justice. We need to stop ever bouncing around white supremacy, ever. And I guarantee you will actually start making real change.",

And it took me posting about it obsessively for people to start getting on board. Whether you know it or not, voices of color are being erased. Voices of color that are awesome people that are doing the most to help. And it. It just sucks that it took one white person to get it going. And I am very grateful for all your support and all your love, but you guys need to be directing that at creators of color that have been doing this work since the beginning. And I also wanna say to white folks, first of all, text your mom back. She wants to know if you wanna get that shirt at Old Navy or not. You can wield your privilege. Look, At what happened when I did it. How it took a white person speaking out to finally get traction going. Understand that you can use that, too. And this also goes to dude folks and straight folks. While it's not fair, you hold a majority of the power. Use it. Morning time. Aaron here. First and foremost. My tummy hurts. So Megan Rice and Zam actually made really, um, poignant videos about this. I'm going to tag them in the comments. And what I want people to do is also tag other careers of color that they know are talking about Palestine or other atrocities around the world so we can follow them and support their work, too. Please. I want you to do it so badly. My tummy is hurting.",

Just in the first day of the operation, we taken 100,000, um, citizens. Civilians from Rafa. Out of Rafa, at least 1.4 million. Okay. And it's a. It's a work in progress. You've already killed up to 40,000 people, and a large number are innocent civilians, women and children. Out of that Hamas number that you just gave, more than 14,000 are terrorists that we took out. So how many civilians do you believe you've killed? We. We don't have exact figures, as you know. It's the fog of war. If you know exactly how many Hamas terrorists you've killed, you must know how many civilians you've killed. Otherwise, you're prioritizing the lives of terrorists over innocent people. I said around 14,000. Whereas Hamas will come out with precise numbers. Court, you can. You can use the ballpark. As far as the Hamas figures, which I reject, is being false. Well, if that's false, why would you give me those I had? I gave you the numbers that I had. No, you told me. I know you know how many Hamas terrorists you killed, but you doesn't have any idea how many civilians you killed. I'm just permused. Why wouldn't you keep count of both? I can tell you definitively that our aim is to go after Hamas. You're an official spokesman for The Israeli government. And you have no idea how many civilians you've killed? I don't. I don't have the information. You literally have no idea how many civilians you've killed? It's not that I don't know. I'm not authorized to give the information. I don't have the information. That's complete nonsense. Why are you authorized to give me the number of terrors you've killed, but not a number of civilians? I just find it astonishing that the moment I asked you how many Hamas you killed, you could tell me immediately. And the moment I ask you about civilians, you haven't got a clue. Literally, that you're not even prepared to issue a ballpark number. And I, I think people will find that staggering, particularly given that you are insistent that you're doing everything you can to avoid killing civilians. You come on here as the official Israeli government spokesman and. And you. You don't wanna be asked how many you've killed, cause you don't know. Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds? We're in the fog of war. We're fighting for our very existence. No, you're not foggy when it comes to killing terrorists. You're only foggy, it seems to me, when it comes to killing civilian",

    "voice_to_text": "One of the reasons everyone from Joe Biden to Benjamin Netanyahu to Ben Shapiro is so butt hurt about the student protests is that they're working. Last week, Brown University was forced into an agreement to allow several student protesters to bring their demands before the governors of the university's endowment and to force a divestment vote for Israel. A similar agreement was reached by Evergreen State College, which was the Alma mater of Rachel Corey, an American student who in 2003 was martyred when she was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer for standing up for Palestine. And today, Trinity College in Dublin agreed to divest from Israel after a weeks of student protests. More universities will fall as the pressure continues to build. But why are these student protest actually so important? To answer that question, we have to look back at history, particularly the history of South Africa. Now, we've been told a nice Liberal story about how apartheid ended in South Africa, mostly as a result of non violence on behalf of the ANC and Nelson Mandela. This is not an accurate version of events. Apartheid in South Africa actually came crashing down for two reasons. The first was that Nelson Mandela actually encouraged the ANC to abandon their long held conviction of non violence and to engage in open conflict with the regime. In doing this, they forced the world's eye to remain on South Africa. Second, so many Americans in British boycotted companies that operated in South Africa and so many American universities divested from these companies that the companies just started leaving the country wholesale. This created such an embarrassing situation for Great Britain, which was one of South Africa's only remaining supporters, that it forced Margaret Thatcher to call the South African government privately and demand that Nelson Mandela be released. This mix of internal resistance and external economic pressure brought the South African apartheid regime to its knees and opened a pathway for a peaceful into apartheid. That is why these university protests are so important. That's why divestment is so important. We have the receipts. We know it works. American companies are afraid of this, and so is Israel.",

You seen footage of shredded children's bodies? That's my taxpayer dollars. I'm going to, you know what? Going to bomb this kid. So I think we should kill them all, if that makes you feel better. Alright, everybody watch. Any person convicted of unlawful activity at a college or university to do community service in Gaza for six months. The Bill, dubbed the Anti Semitism Community Service Act, was introduced by Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Representatives Jeff Dunce of South Carolina and Randy Webber of Texas. As part of the two bills which take to aim at college students. He says if you support a tea organization and you participate in unlawful activity on campuses, you should get a taste of your own medicine.

Up until very recently, I was one of those ignorant creators who was thinking, why do I need an audience to do the right thing if integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching? Why do I need brownie points from the internet to be a good person? And that way of thinking is not okay when you have 6 million followers and you have a platform and a tool that so many people wish that they had. In times like this, I would see videos pop up on my FYP of people saying, if you have a platform, you should use it to speak out. And I guess those words never sunken. I had a conversation with one of my good friends the other day, and she told me, it's. It's not about needing brownie points and validation from the internet that you're a good person. It's about utilizing the tool that so many people wish that they had. That conversation. Head home. I'm here to step up and use the one resource that I haven't yet, which is my platform. I have submitted the form for pass the hat, which is a system created by a beautiful soul on this app by the name of Aaron Hatterman. Another one of my very good friends, Angelique, or glam by Angelique here on TikTok, has also submitted the form, and we are still awaiting a response. This project partners creators with families in Gaza to help raise money so that they can escape. This is such an amazing resource, and Aaron has inspired myself and so many other creators to want to be a part of this. Aaron has stated that there are so many families and so many creators to get through, but she's trying to get through them all. Both Angelique and myself are very eager to participate, but we understand that this could take time. So with that being said, I would love to share with you guys some other creators who have already been paired with families and have gofundmes, LinkedIn, their B I os. I saw under the desk news do this, and I thought it was a great idea. While still awaiting a response, the first creator is Ali Rose, and Ali is raising money for the italadini family. I hope I'm saying that right. And the next is Adam Wright fitness. And Adam is raising money for the Oberos family, which once again, I hope I'm saying correctly. Both of these families still have yet to meet their goal and make it out of Gaza. And both of those creators are people that I have followed for a very long time and that I think are amazing people. But most importantly, I think that Aaron is the type of person that we should all be aspiring to be right now. I look up to and admire her so unbelievably much right now, and she deserves every Ounce of credit for what she's doing. And I'm so grateful to have people in my life that love and support me enough to tell me when I'm not doing the right thing. For something to bother me and eat away at my heart for so long and for me to still not say anything online was not okay at all. There has been no justifiable excuse for our silence, and we as creators need to do better.",

    "voice_to_text": "alright so about 300,000 of you guys will remember this lady here now what did she do she accused me of getting paid by Israel to make content so she's saying the reason I'm making all this Israeli content is because Israel's paying me to do so and the reason I'm making this video is because I think it's a learning opportunity for many people especially her so stick with me till the end so let's see how it started and he has all these Zionists all love and everything he puts out preach brother preach it's the truth it's the truth and supporting him the whole way but what I really wanna know is how much are they paying him how much are they paying you because I just can't even believe what comes out of your mouth anymore notice she didn't give me the respect enough to ask me if they're paying me she skipped right past that and said how much are they paying you meaning they are paying you but just a matter of how much so that in and of itself is an accusation slight interruption while I'm making this video the squirrel is literally right outside the window anyway back to business so anyway I said to her where's the proof she's accusing Israel of going at here and paying a bunch of creators to defend them and she's accusing me of taking money from Israel and as a result of that defending them so again where's the proof fair question if you're gonna accuse someone of something you should have proof to back it up otherwise it's just a baseless accusation now I can't find the video but she made a video asking for her TikTok family to help her find the proof some of you guys probably saw that video if you went to her page but like I said I can't find it I think she took it down so you make an accusation and then when you're asked to show the proof you go asking people to get the proof for you interesting to say the least so then she later responds with this video next question you asked me on mine was can I prove to you that uh people are paid by Israel uh influence um political parties and all that kind of thing well I've actually gone and had a look for all that information and you said not TikTok related I've pulled up a couple of news articles on it but I can't actually prove it to you because this information is not done out in the open and it's not done for all the world to see so let me get this straight you just told me that you can't prove it but yet you accuse me of doing something that you absolutely have no proof of and I didn't say not TikTok related it just can't be influencer he said she said or some random email it doesn't show any organisations or anything like your favourite guy did like there needs to be some legitimate proof guys you said yourself you have none so you accuse me of doing something with absolutely no proof at all but we're gonna play that game okay you work in childcare you're a editor Jeff what's your proof I don't know some people said some weird stuff about her she looks a little suspicious to me so yep she's a editor now imagine if that was actually the rumour in your life because someone made a baseless accusation about you that could seriously damage your reputation could it not so if you're gonna accuse somebody of something you should actually get some facts and gather some evidence before you formulate your opinion rather than just admit you were wrong and you made a mistake right you tried to find a way to be right the world to see so I can't prove that part but what I can prove is you're definitely getting paid by TikTok because your growth on your account even in the last few days has grown by nearly half a million people first off where's your source that my account has grown by over half or around half a million people in the past few days please show me that source I know how much my account has been growing in the past few days and it's not even close to half a million I wish it was but it's not these here are my analytics you can see in the past 28 days if you look down below I've gained 21,000 followers my growth has been slow that's in a month 20,000 followers you've just accused me of getting almost half a million in a couple days again with absolutely no proof no evidence at all now me having a lot of growth is not an indicator of whether I'm getting paid or not by TikTok someone could have a lot of growth and not even be in the creative rewards program and make any money so you saying I know you're getting paid because you're having a lot of growth is wrong you don't know you took a guess and of all your guesses this one's actually correct I do get paid based off of how well the videos do if they're over a minute long like I said again absolutely having no proof just making accusations now keep in mind how many of your pro Palestinian creators are getting paid for videos that are over a minute long also keep in mind the difference in the amount of support on TikTok for Israel compared to Palestine so look at the top Israel 3.2 million post free Palestine with no heart 4.7 million post free Palestine with a flag and a heart another 4.2 million post Palestine itself 5.6 million post there's four more support on this app for Palestine than there is for Israel so ask yourself who's really making the money on this app so what you did is you accuse me of something and then after you figured out you had no proof of the accusation you just made which is embarrassing you tried to pivot to something else well speaking of embarrassing she said this somebody commented on her video saying you really embarrassed yourself maybe take a note for future videos right she said I don't feel embarrassed as telling about her and in my opinion many people that think like her they are perfectly fine to go out in the world and make accusations about people with no proof and then when they've been shown or they've realised they have no proof they're not embarrassed about making those damaging accusations that they made against people it's not embarrassing to them to talk about things and they have absolutely no facts no evidence no nothing not embarrassing to them that's fine if it was embarrassing to them having facts and details and accurate understandings of what's going on would be important to them but she's showing us that it's not important to her and I want you to think about that I think that's a big part in why she supports what she supports because again like I said she's not really getting the details before she formulates her opinion she's fine having opinions that are ill informed I mean speaking on those ill informed opinions and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of other people like her in the same vote",

Supposedly the blue and white country said it was only a three to five day operation and then it'll be open. The fuck knows cause you know those guys. There are a lot of families still staying by the border in the hopes that it will open. And we should continue fundraising so the second it opens, they have the money and they can leave. From what I heard in Al Jazeer, they are still sending blue and white country delegates to Egypt for peace talks, whatever that means to them. Heba has confirmed the violence is escalating. More tanks coming in. Wanna take this moment to also talk about Heather's gofundme. She needs to get to at least 50 K to even get to the point of being able to escape with some people. She is messaging me constantly. She is helping us stay updated. Please, please, please consider donating to have a. We have donated the last of our fund to her as well.

We're gonna need onion and cilantro, and you're gonna do a couple pieces of heartburn and an entire jalapeno, and you're gonna pulse this up. But you could easily hand chop it, transfer that into a bowl and hit it with some hot pepper paste, and it with the mix of Middle Eastern herbs and spices. And once this is properly incorporated, add in your ground beef and just give this one more massage. Make a pocket out of some pita and put in your meat. And then before you fully form it, you're gonna sprinkle in some cheese. And this is the thickness that I'm gonna be going for. You're gonna brush these down with some good olive oil. Awesome. On a super hot pan so they get nice and charred. And then once they're charred all over, toss them in the oven at 3:50. All eyes on Raffa. There are currently 1.5 million people stranded there. There are currently being bombed with nowhere to go, and a ground invasion will only add to this catastrophe. Cease fire now!",

How shameful of you that you even work in this administration and you put your hands on a person. Shame on you! Shame on you! You are the violent one, not the people that are protesting peacefully. You are the violent one! So we are in Congress, just like we are every day. And today we've been asking the members of Congress what do they think about Israel not signing the peace agreement that Hamas just signed? And we were in the halls, and there was this congressman, what's his name? Ezel. He's from Mississippi, and I know he's a former police officer. And can you say somewhere what happened? He turned around, told me to shut my mouth, and then took his hand and slapped my hand and knocked my phone to the ground. So have you filed a complaint? I did file a complaint, um, with Capital Police, which they called, um, in some criminal investigators to take my statement, and we'll see what happens next. It's like we were trying to fight one battle, uh, of, you know, stop arming Israel to Kill these Palestinians over there. And then we have to fight another battle for people like Congress and Ezel to suppress us from speaking the truth. And they don't wanna hear our voices, so they choose violence in and they tell us as Palestinians or pro Palestinians to. That we are violent people when we're not. And he is the violent one, obviously. So let's keep pursuing your complaint against him and pursuing our efforts to stop these racist, inhumane people from sending our tax dollars to support Israel.",

The city\u2019s Kuwaiti hospital said on Tuesday that 11 people had been killed and dozens of others injured in the strikes. Israel had earlier called for Palestinians in several neighbourhoods in eastern Rafah to evacuate before a ground excursion, triggering an exodus of thousands of people. The Israeli operation is taking place before a fresh round of indirect negotiations on a ceasefire in Cairo, and after Hamas announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal. Israeli officials said the terms did not meet its \u201ccore demands\u201d, but that they would send a delegation for further talks.

Families of fleeing Rafa after Israel's military airdrop, leaflets telling people to evacuate immediately. Many have already fled Israel's offensive several times. We fled death and destruction to seek safety in Rafa, only to find the same thing here. A ticket to the Met Gala cost $75,000. One ticket $75,000. There's people in this country that are literally struggling to pay for necessities. That will give 5, 10 dollars to support the people in Palestine. $75,000 for a shitty costume party?

I guess Macklemore doesn't care if American women lose their rights, or if LGBTQ people lose their right to marry, or if American elderly people lose their Social Security benefits, or if America loses its democracy, or if Muslims lose the right to travel to and from America. All of which will be lost if Joe Biden loses this November because people like Macklemore decide to protest Joe Biden, the president who has been trying to negotiate a ceasefire from abroad throughout 2,024. Again, what a selfish song for Macklemore to put out. I hope he reconsiders this position and puts out a statement denouncing what he said in his song, cause it's selfish.",

It's gonna be safe down south. Watch. The crazy part is I showed you guys this 135 days into this genocide. We are 80 more days into this genocide, and we are literally witnessing the same thing. Close to 40,000 innocent people have been murdered. Tens of thousands are still under the rubble. And now everyone's here, down in the south, in Rafa. And they're bombing Rafa. There are over 1.5 million innocent Palestinians that have been displaced in the south of Gaza. In Rafa, right here, over 600,000 of them are children. The aid, the food, the waters, all in that area. And now Israel's indiscriminately bombing this area. Now, mind you, all of these people are living under tents. They're indiscriminately bombing this area, dropping leaflets from the sky, telling them it is no longer safe to be there. They have to leave. Where are they supposed to go? Literally, where they supposed to go? There is nowhere else for them to go. How can you look at this visual demonstration and not call this a genocide, not call this an ethnic cleansing, not call for a ceasefire?

Before we continued on with our regularly scheduled programming, I needed to give you all this message. I\u2019m a gay, American, tolerant man, so this really shouldn\u2019t be that surprising to any of you. And since I know some of you will bring it up, I don\u2019t find that the pinkwashing argument has much merit here. I love the way @Daniel-Ryan Spaulding put it: pinkwashing is not relevant to this issue because the gay people that get thrown off roofs are also Arab and Muslim. Shout out to Israel for hosting the only Pride event in that part of the world. While I have more sympathy for the side that shares my values, my prayers go out to innocent lives lost on both sides and I hope the conflict is resolved as soon as possible.

Now, I know what some of you are gonna say. Some of you are gonna say, wow, a therapist who doesn't care about dying children. What a psychopath. Here's what I have to say to all of you. You're being emotionally manipulated. Imagine that you and I are married, and every time you draw boundary with me, I smother our kid with a pillow and say something like, look at what you're making me do. I would be emotionally manipulating you. That is exactly what's happening in Gaza right now, and most people agree with that because it's obvious. And if it's not obvious to you, then you either have another agenda you're pushing or you've been emotionally manipulated. You're being emotionally manipulated. You should talk to somebody about that. Ideally, that person is not some woke terrorist apologist therapist. And if you wanna see more content from a mental health professional who has the emotional skills to look at today's events with a little bit of clarity, you should toss me a follow. And if there's a little part of you that feels like they don't have the skills to cope with today's events, then I want you to comment the word sub stack below.

Some wonder why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down potentially TikTok or other entities of that nature.

On April the first, the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, passed a law that allowed the prime minister to ban Al Jazeera. He's now enacted that law. Let me just take you through some of the definitions within the law. They banned our website, including anything that has the option of entering or accessing the website, even passwords that are needed, um, whether they're paid or not, and whether it's stored on Israeli servers or outside of Israel. The website is now inaccessible. Uh, they're also banning any device used for providing content. That includes my mobile phone. If I use that, uh, to do any kind of news gathering, then the Israelis can simply confiscate it. Our internet access provider, the guy that simply hosts, uh, Al jazeera.net, uh, is also in danger of being find if they host the website. The Al Jazeera TV channel completely banned. Transmission by any kind of content provider is also banned and holding offices or operating them in the territory of Israel by the channel. Also, once again, any devices used to provide content for the channel can be taken away by the Israelis. It's a wide ranging ban. We don't know how long it will be in place for, but it does cover this territory of the state of Israel. Imran Khan, Al Jazeera, occupied Easter Islam.",

It includes the quote protesters have demands, including divestment and cutting off ties with IZZY. But ending relations with IZZY doesn't help Gauzens. And on the contrary, it's useful for universities to have exchanges with a broad range of places, including those whose policies we disagree with. Doesn't help gazens to stop sending money for bombs. Guys, like, at this point, are you just, like, lying for fun? The top comment on this article, thank god. Was a great MLK quote. To sum it up, it's over the last few years, I've been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. The great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the white citizens counselor or the this thing that I'm not gonna say, but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice, who constantly says, I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action. There's another line in the article that stood out to me and many commenters. You know, I admire your empathy for Gauzens, but what about the risks to commencements? Oh, goodness, you're right. Commencement speeches in G Slide clearly carry the same weight. Shut up, Nick. No meaningful changes ever come about by asking nicely. Nice to know you care more about property damage than human lives. Isn't this the exact same thing every old white pro war dude Has said about activists ever. The New York Times has had a lot of fumbles recently, but this guy saying that it's useful for universities to have exchanges with places whose policies we disagree with has got to be the stupidest thing I have ever read.",

This happened yesterday. His stock price opened at 12:24 and dropped to 11:26 by end of day. He simply tweeted moral courage over college degree. If you're currently protesting against the genocide of the Palestinian people and for your university's divestment from Israel, keep going. It's working. There are plenty of companies and CEOs eager to hire you regardless of your university discipline. Apply here. The pro Israel venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale responded by saying, real moral courage doesn't involve joining a mindless mob chanting anti US and other woke. Pablo following instructions not to debate or discuss your positions at all, yet being indignantly righteous while large numbers in the mob chant for violence and block Jewish students. Very pro Israel. Mainstream media picked this up and is basically going after his company now. This is very important. If his company suffers because of this, it's sending a message to other large CEOs and public figures that they can't speak up about Palestine. You want more public figures to speak up about Palestine? Please support his company by buying him socks. It's very important.

Every time I bring up a factual argument about how come ON steals aid or need for checkpoints because of terrorism or anything that's actually limiting peace to start a discussion, it's immediately shut down with genocide, apartheid, and all these buzzword. Every time I try to bring up legitimate facts that could spark dialogue, the immediate response is, there's no excuse for the amount of people dying. Genocide like this is a genocide. There's no excuse. Listen, I'm with you. This many people should not be dying. But every time I try to kind of explain the nuance behind the situation and why this is happening, it's immediately shut down. I'm called the genocide apologist, white supremacist. That's not productive. It's also marketed as a pro peace, anti war movement, but the slogans that are being shattered are free Palestine held backwards, antifather revolution, resistance is justified, globalized antifada. These are all calling for death to Jews. Whether you mean it or not, everything is labeled as oppressor and oppressed. And if there's any room for dialogue, maybe we would get somewhere.",

According to their logic, what's the difference between their beliefs and the beliefs of the Christians? Let me explain. Let's look at how the Christians belief and the belief of the so called salefiyah are similar. So the Christians believe that Jesus is god. And we know that I Sally, his salam is in the second heaven. So Jesus is in a place, he takes up space, he has a volume. The heavens is a place. And the wahabiya, the so called salafiya, they also believe that Allah is in the heavens. And they also say that Allah is sitting on the throne. Or they say he ascended above the throne. Referring to directions and places. Hello, Sunnah. We say Allah created the throne, he doesn't need it. And he's above everything in status, not in location. So you see, when I said Allah exists, not like we exist, he exists without being in a place, without being in a direction, that person called me a liar. So my belief, the belief of all the prophets is very clear. And their belief is very similar to the Christians. So wake up!",

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

I've met a lot of Muslim people at this point in my life, and almost all of them were extremely kind.

Some of my favorite mixed martial arts fighters, like Khabib Nurmagomedov, are devout Muslims. Nowadays we have white boys in the rural Midwest ruing for Muslims every UFC fight night. You're not gonna be able to convince us that these people are evil and that our tax dollars need to be spent on bombing them. And you know who hasn't always been kind and friendly to me? Israelis. Zionists. I talked to some members of the IDF on zoom. It took them about five minutes to start saying all Muslim people are terrorists. And to be clear, I'm not talking about Jewish people. I'm talking about supporters of the state of Israel, who, with their violent, unhinged, and rude behavior, are turning more and more people away from their cause, away from Zionism. Meanwhile, Muslim people with kindness and friendship are bringing more people towards the cause of Palestine. There were a bunch of students at the student protest recently who converted to Islam, and the mainstream media was like, look at this. See, America is being taken over by Muslims. Now I'm like, I don't blame those kids for converting to Islam. At all the Muslim students were probably super nice and super awesome and super welcoming, and they're like, hey, I'm gonna side with these guys against the mostly secular, genocidal monsters that were protesting against. Shout out to all the Muslims!",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi. Here are three things you need to know about everything that's happening on college campuses right now. Number one, it's not peaceful. Number two, it's not grassroots. And number three, it's not true. Let me explain. So first, obviously, these are not peaceful protesters. They threaten, they scream. They're pushing and shoving. They're smashing windows with hammers. They're attacking Jewish students. They're taking over buildings and hijacking campuses and preventing higher education in America. Not peaceful. Number two, this is not a grassroots movement. These are well organized, well coordinated, well funded campus infiltrations by outside groups. Some of these people showing up on campuses have been convicted with connections to terrorism financing. A lot of them are not students. These are grown adults with no connection to the campuses they are on. They are outside educators. And number three, they're wrong. They are just wrong. Some of these actual student demonstrators don't understand that they have been brainwashed by TikTok to believe that Israel's actually committing a genocide. They have been brainwashed to believe that Israel doesn't provide humanitarian aid. When hundreds of trucks of aid get into Gaza a day, which country provides humanitarian aid to the side that attacked her? And they have been brainwashed to believe that Zionism, in and of itself is a movement that necessitates the genocide of Palestinians. They truly believe all these lies. And because they do, they are hell bent on taking down the single consistent democracy in the entire Middle East. And why do we say this movement is anti Semitic? Because these privileged kids who are culturally appropriating a kafia and a rocket with a crop top, which they can't wear anywhere else in the Middle East other than in Israel, are not outraged by any actual atrocity happening in the world right now. None. But who do they target? The world. Single Jewish state. The only country. The chairs are values. They say we're not against Jews, we are against Zionists. They're so brainwashed they don't understand what Zionism is. That it literally just means Israel has the right to exist. And instead they chant jihadi slogans like globalize the intifada. And like good jihadi's do, they promise to take down Israel with blood and soul. Here's the thing. If for your revolution you draw your fashion inspiration from a terrorist from the 80s, you are thrilled by the concept of violence against Jews, and you're praised by the Ayatollah of Iran, you might wanna take a look in the mirror and rethink that movement of yours.",

If we can't criticize Israel, then who are we not gonna be allowed to criticize next? Punk ass bitches. That's how the punk ass bitches win. Do you want a country that's ran by punk ass bitches? Okay, we do have that right now. But do you want a country that's ran by punk ass bitches that we can't talk shit about? Oh, and by the way, this is this book.

Because, you know, we're in the final stages of capitalism, and it's getting pretty dicey. So, yeah, that's kind of the only word we can use to describe it. But I saw the most 1984 esque bullshit ever in real time a few days ago. The book 1984. The main character works in the record department of the Ministry of truth, where his job is pretty much to rewrite history as a way of always favoring the political party and power. So when I say I saw the most Orwellian shit of my life yesterday, just know I am being so fucking for real. At 11:23, I read this article saying UCLA cancels classes after counter protesters violently attack Pro Palestinian camp. Just keep that in mind. My friend then reaches out to me four hours later saying that the article has been changed to, after violent night at UCLA, UC president launches investigation into response. I find it insane that even the writers of this article made a very intentional choice to acknowledge the fact that the Zionists were attacking students on campus. That the Zionists were coming from off campus. Random adult men were coming from off campus to attack students who were paying money to be on that campus. And now all of a sudden, it's a two sides kind of issue. And then, boom, UCLA declares unlawful assembly. Poised to Clear out pro Palestinian camp. Isn't it insane that the news cycle literally admitted that Zionists were attacking peaceful protesters who were literally paying to be on that campus because they are students there? And now all of a sudden it is the pro Palestinian protesters fault? They're changing history in front of our eyes, my guy, I know the simple swapping of a headline might not seem like the biggest deal, but they are actively trying to manufacture consent to assault these children. Why do you think the LAPD just stood idly by as Zionist attack their encampment, and then the next night followed up by attacking the encampment themselves? The police, the military, the Zionist entity, the media we consume, they are all tied together as a way to protect the status quo of this country that was built on genocide. I need y'all to wake up, please. Please. It's happening. Fascism is here. It's happening.",

They think I'm a millionaire.   me   being   a   show   off   They   think   I'm   a   millionaire And it's actually amazing   it's   actually   amazing that someone can actually think that an African is a millionaire.   someone   can   actually   think   that   an   African   is   a   millionaire That's good. At least there's one.   good   At   least   there's   one He believes that there's one millionaire,   believes   that   there's   one   millionaire which is me in Africa, which is fantastic.   is   me   in   Africa   which   is   fantastic But the thing is   the   thing   is that there's just so much negativity about Africa out there   there's   just   so   much   negativity   about   Africa   out   there that you rarely ever see the positive sides.   you   rarely   ever   see   the   positive   sides And I didn't show you those pictures of Europe   I   didn't   show   you   those   pictures   of   Europe or somewhere in North America to shame them.   somewhere   in   North America   to   shame   them I was just showing you those pictures because unfortunately   was   just   showing   you   those   pictures   because   unfortunately people like that exist. There are poor people in those continents.   like   that   exist   There   are   poor   people   in   those   continents These are not the people that are being shown on our TV screens.   are   not   the   people   that   are   being   shown   on   our   TV   screens Basically what I'm trying to tell you is that   what   I'm   trying   to   tell   you   is   that in as much as there is poverty in other countries   as   much   as   there   is   poverty   in   other   countries in the west and beyond, they also put their best foot forward.   the   west   and   beyond   they   also   put   their   best   foot   forward So why can't an African in Africa   why   can't   an   African   in   Africa who has been in Africa all her entire life   has   been   in   Africa   all   her   entire   life show the good side of Africa?   the   good   side   of   Africa And I'm being shamed by people   I'm   being   shamed   by   people who have never visited any country in the continent of Africa,   have   never   visited   any   country   in   the   continent   of   Africa telling me that I am faking and I'm showing off   me   that   I   am   faking   and   I'm   showing   off cause I showed nice buildings.   I   showed   nice   buildings Cause in Africa we do have nice buildings as well.   in   Africa   we   do   have   nice   buildings   as   well We do have wealthy people.   do   have   wealthy   people We do have kids   do   have   kids who have never been through hunger in their entire life.   have   never   been   through   hunger   in   their   entire   life Why is it that whenever it comes to poverty in Africa,   is   it   that   whenever   it   comes   to   poverty   in   Africa it is overly exaggerated, overly hyped and made to see myself,   is   overly   exaggerated   overly   hyped   and   made   to   see   myself there is not even one single person who lives okay over here.   is   not   even   one   single   person   who   lives   okay   over   here It's quite unfortunate   quite   unfortunate the kind of image that has been portrayed about Africa out there.   kind   of   image   that   has   been   portrayed   about   Africa   out   there And I made it a decision that I am not going to add to that pile.   I   made   it   a   decision   that   I   am   not   going   to   add   to   that   pile It's so crazy   so   crazy how you don't get to see the negative sides of other countries.   you   don't   get   to   see   the   negative   sides   of   other   countries I am not negating the fact that there is poverty in Africa.   am   not   negating   the   fact   that   there   is   poverty   in   Africa I mean, there is poverty everywhere else in the world.   mean   there   is   poverty   everywhere   else   in   the   world There is also rich people everywhere else in the world.   is   also   rich   people   everywhere   else   in   the   world When the Africa become the face of poverty,   the   Africa   become   the   face   of   poverty when an African tells their story from their point of view   an   African   tells   their   story   from   their   point   of   view as an African, we are Being shot down   an   African   we   are   Being   shot   down because we don't know any better about a continent we grew up in.   we   don't   know   any   better   about   a   continent   we   grew   up   in Unfortunately, that's a very sad reality.   that's   a   very   sad   reality This narrative has to just change.   narrative   has   to   just   change But I'm not going to stop talking about how beautiful Africa is.   I'm   not   going   to   stop   talking   about   how   beautiful   Africa   is I'm not going to stop talking about how wealthy we are.   not   going   to   stop   talking   about   how   wealthy   we   are Africa is amazing.

    "voice_to_text": "You say that our leaders are addicted to war. Addicted to war? Why do you say that? Well, the sign of an addiction, I suppose, is when somebody keeps coming back to something that's bad for you and can't seem to get out of it. And. And somebody who sees, for instance, a drug as a solution to their problems, you know, not looking for other solutions, cause the drug. Drugs seem, are a quick solution to a problem that you have, you know, you. You're unhappy, you're depressed, you. You know, you. Or you're in pain. And, yes, the drug will be a quick fix, so it's. But more is a quick fix. More is a quick fix. You attacked, uh, you know, as a. As a 9 11. Oh, what do we do instead of stopping and thinking intelligently about what caused this act, what was behind it, what can we do to eliminate the causes of it? You go to that drug which you have always used, and. And war. War is a way to solve how it was. If people had an inherent desire to go to war, nations would not have to compel them. Nations would not have to draft armies. They would not have to seduce people with propaganda and persuade them that this is a just cause. No, no. People's natural tendency, I think, is not to engage in wars. But, you know, when they say, well, we must engage in war because Other nations engage in war. Well, of course, that creates the vicious cycle. And they're not asking the question, how can we get at the roots of war? It's like a present is really, you know, Palestinian situation, you know. You know, they, uh, the Palestinians are, you know, sending suicide bombers, you know, so we have to then attack Palestinian territory and destroy homes, and. And then the Palestinians say, well, you see what they're doing to us? More. And it's a cycle. It's a cycle. And the United States has contributed to that cycle.",

About 100 lawyers, including from the State Department, are saying that the US weapons are violating US law and international humanitarian law. Please come to the network. Can you turn around for a minute and address me? I'm trying to help stop the genocide. Congressman Nadler, will you do something about this? He is the head. He is the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. And now there are all these lawyers, including in the administration, that are saying the US is violating its all laws.

That's where I come in. Police officers in Canton, Ohio were dispatched and referenced to a vehicle that crashed into a telephone pole, and police officers arrived on scene. They made contact with witnesses who inform them that the offender, later identified as Frank Tyson, fled the scene on foot and ran into a bar. He's in the BMW. He ran in there. He ran in where, right now? Yeah. And there's cars right there. All right? Yeah. He's in the BMW right now. When police officers arrived at the bar, they made contact with Mr. Tyson, who is causing a disturbance, and employees were begging police officers to remove him. Police officers then tried to escort Mr. Tyson from the bar and he resisted. Mr. Tyson thrashed and kicked, violently fought with police officers. Eventually, police officers were able to get Mr. Tyson into handcuffs without using any weapon systems. Mr. Tyson died a few minutes after being placed in handcuffs. The police did nothing wrong.",

    "voice_to_text": "Fuck Palestine. Okay. Fuck Palestine. Story time on why I was faced with six charges and may not graduate from Rock Ridge University. So first two charges actually happened in the same night. I was detained in Manhattan and booked in Brooklyn with disorderly conduct and refusal of an ostrich's command during a mass arrest. Like 200 of us got arrested for peacefully protesting for the ceasefire in Gaza. Then third charge, if you'll believe it, was me trying to make it to my court date in in Brooklyn again. And I was running late. I jumped the trail. Guard in New York City. Cop caught me and wrote, gave me another charge in another court date. I don't even know what for, but he was just pissed off about me wearing the cafe. And then the next one was in Rutgers University itself. We were talking about Palestine in class and I spoke about my experience getting arrested by Jewish organization, bailed out by a Jewish support group, arrested by a Jewish cop. That was for Palestine. And this beep, beep, beep, beep sometime, I don't even know what. Disorderly conduct on me for harassment, intimidation and bullying. I don't go through a whole ass investigation series to say that I wasn't a threat for being anti Semitic. And she got somebody else involved, the professor for defending me for having free speech cause I said fuck Israel. And I'll say it again, I'll say it again during that entire Series. I was on academic probation, on the verge of being expelled, and when they finally found that case dismissed, like, she didn't do anything wrong, then she filed a restraining order against me. A girl, Wallah, Wallah! I've never even spoken to. I have no idea what Shawty Bay looks like, but if I ever walk into the same room as her, I. I can get expelled. Had been at a protest in DC. A journalist was being mad, and I said something to her, and she ran. Ran to the cops. Where are you? Officer, I. I'm an American, and I deserve to feel safe in my own country. So you agree? So you agree? Shorty started lying, spewing all of this John, Bro, talking about. Oh, she hit me! She hit me! I was like, babe, you're the journalist. You were documenting everything. Pull it up. Pull it up, Shorty. Babe, pull it up. Cops asked to see it. She refused to give it to them. Cops let me go without taking my information, so that when I was let off the hook. So overall, I got a couple of my charges dismissed, A few I had to pay off, and the rest never even made it through the first, like, investigation process. Currently, what is happening at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, where our president, Jonathan Holloway, is free, free, free Palestine! This bigot! Bigot! The absolute tea at Ruckus, New Brunswick, between the raging Zionists, And those with morals have been so high lately. Like, the Islamic Center got vandalized. Shawty Bae, I got. I almost got slapped last week for protesting. We've had people coming and cussing, calling us slurs, it. And this has been our form of protesting. We were calling on Rutgers University to divest from funding.",

But then it's kind of awkward to if you start recording them secretly because then they're gonna end up finding out and they're gonna be like, why the is fucking recording me? But then also I kind of wanna record because I wanna show my friends and I wanna have evidence backing up my claims saying that I saw in hyphen shopping at the same store I was. I don't know, it's kind of confusing cause I also wanna go up to them and be like, hey, can I get like a picture or something? But then they're also enjoying their personal time.

Alliance's\u00a0working\u00a0definition\u00a0of\u00a0antisemitism which\u00a0states\u00a0that\u00a0denying\u00a0Israel's\u00a0right\u00a0to\u00a0exist and\u00a0the\u00a0example\u00a0they\u00a0give\u00a0was\u00a0claiming\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018Israel\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0racist\u00a0endeavor\u2019 is\u00a0antisemitism now\u00a0the\u00a0problems\u00a0with\u00a0this\u00a0is\u00a0something\u00a0I've\u00a0been\u00a0researching\u00a0for\u00a0quite\u00a0a\u00a0while way back in October when\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0a\u00a0Bill\u00a0stating\u00a0that\u00a0\u2018anti-Zionism\u00a0is\u00a0antisemitism\u2019 and\u00a0referenced\u00a0this\u00a0definition I\u2019ve\u00a0come\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0obvious\u00a0conclusion that this definition is used to shut down free speech criticizing\u00a0Israel\u00a0and\u00a0policies\u00a0in\u00a0governments\u00a0around\u00a0the\u00a0world this\u00a0definition\u00a0is\u00a0heavily\u00a0pushed\u00a0by\u00a0pro-Israel\u00a0lobbies\u00a0here\u00a0in\u00a0America because it literally gives these lobbies protections not\u00a0only\u00a0are\u00a0they\u00a0already\u00a0acting\u00a0in\u00a0Israel's\u00a0interests and on behalf of Israel this shuts down a lot of criticism of the pro Israel lobby in America because a lot of it is based off the actions of the state of Israel if you can't criticize Israel legally anymore you can't criticize these pro Israel lobbies the\u00a0author\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act\u00a0is\u00a0Mike\u00a0Lawler and\u00a0you\u00a0already\u00a0know\u00a0he's\u00a0funded\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC\u00a0$180,000\u00a0this\u00a0year\u00a0alone the\u00a0reason\u00a0this\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0being\u00a0pushed\u00a0right\u00a0now is so they can use it to shut down college protests and\u00a0say\u00a0that\u00a0they're\u00a0in\u00a0violation\u00a0of\u00a0Title\u00a0VI and\u00a0let\u00a0them\u00a0pull\u00a0federal\u00a0funding\u00a0from\u00a0schools who allow these protests to continue on their campuses when I was doing my research I came across something that was really interesting this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0Declaration\u00a0on\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0 which\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0IHRA\u2019s\u00a0definition their goal was to fix the issues with the other definition which\u00a0conflated\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0with\u00a0antisemitism the two are not the same and\u00a0fix\u00a0the\u00a0clear\u00a0bias\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0Israel that the other definition is being used for so a group of 200 scholars got together and wrote this definition that makes a clear distinction about what is and\u00a0what\u00a0isn't\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0and\u00a0antisemitism my\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0politicians\u00a0are\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0not\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0definition??\u2019 clearly protects free speech in a way that the other one does not the\u00a0answer\u00a0is\u00a0-they\u00a0don't\u00a0wanna\u00a0use\u00a0it they want to shut down criticism of the state of Israel that's why they use this one we have to all speak out against this act it's an evil act it's an act meant to shut down free speech it's an act meant to protect Israel this is not an American Bill it's an Israeli Bill pushed\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC using\u00a0a\u00a0problematic\u00a0and\u00a0biased\u00a0definition they\u00a0had\u00a0the\u00a0audacity\u00a0to\u00a0name\u00a0it\u00a0the\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act what\u00a0it\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0called\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Don\u2019t\u00a0Speak\u00a0Against\u00a0Israel\u00a0Act please help this video get out there repost and copy the link a bunch of

At the very least, you gotta admit that the police response is absolutely over the top, unnecessary. And the fact that our elected officials are not saying anything in defense of the college students is very, very disheartening to me, because the overwhelmingly, vast majority of college students, you know, 20, 21, 22 year olds, 19 year olds that are speaking out about the atrocities committed in Gaza, they just want you to stop taking out Palestinians. That's all they want. That's all they want. And to label all of them as anti Semites, absolutely unfair to, to, to, to blanket all of them as anti, like, absolutely un. I have no words.

    "voice_to_text": "so originally I wasn't gonna talk about this but I'm going to because oh man like how do you not how do you not discuss this let's dive in right now we're just gonna cut to the meat and potatoes of this I had made a post discussing the TikTok ban now my primary point of contention with the TikTok ban is that the American government pull together quicker than they ever have in the history of law making to make a law banning a social media app while completely ignoring all of the issues that are actually affecting the American quality of life there's not even a discussion about giving us livable wages about giving us affordable housing about forcing the hedge funds to release single family homes back into the market they'll give TikTok nine months to sell but American hedge fund or foreign hedge fund 10 years to release our single family homes back into the market we're not talking about health care we're not talking about free health care we're not talking about the poisonous food we're currently being fed that's illegal everywhere else in the world we're not discussing any of this and simultaneously while they're completely ignoring all of our needs we are being over taxed when it's all set and done Americans are paying about 50% of their income to taxes they have completely eliminated the middle class so the average lower class citizen in America is paying about 50% you don't believe me your income tax your Medicare your Social Security all automatically debited and given to the government then you have to pay for your own private health care your own private retirement and if that's not bad enough you still have to pay sales tax and property tax so yeah roughly about 50% of your income goes to taxes in America I post this on all social media apps Instagram Facebook TikTok YouTube within an hour or two of me posting it to Instagram I wake up and I'm banned I'm completely banned they've disabled my account I had 133 *THOUSAND *followers my analytics would show on a monthly basis I would touch anywhere from 1 to 10 million individual accounts with my content I've had it for over 10 years this particular account and I met a verified but because I posted my opinion on American politics I'm banned from Instagram for life now this just makes the point that this is a gross infringement upon my constitutional right to freedom of speech and the ban on TikTok was never actually because they're worried about a foreign entity controlling an algorithm that reaches Americans it's because they want to control the narrative and they want to censor Americans because an American owned social media app oddly enough has all these community guidelines where you're not allowed to discuss race gender sexual orientation disabilities immigration political affiliation socio economic class etcetera like these are literally the community standards on the Instagram website and before you guys sit here and tell me that Mark Zuckerberg is sitting around dreaming up censorship for Americans get out of here who do you think makes the community standards who do you think runs and controls the metaverse at present Mark Zuckerberg only cares about selling our data for money and advertisement to guess what make more money the American government has been all through social media for some time TikTok is designed off of algorithms the algorithms are going to promote whatever gains the most interactions it's not the fault of a foreign entity that Americans like being rage baited or intentionally inflammatory content actually it's the fault of American media constantly polarizing us and pinning us against each other to believe that our neighbor is the enemy so we never pull together to actually address the injustices our government is committing and let me be abundantly clear here I have never been able to monetize Instagram because they always give me some type of infraction for violating community standard I'm not rude I'm not aggressive I'm not spreading misinformation I'm not posting intentionally inflammatory content I'm not inciting an insurrection or even like advocating for any type of violent behavior I am merely just disgusting my opinion on what my government is doing and that alone got me banned for Fucking Life and does nobody else see this as a gross infringement upon our constitutional right to freedom of speech how can any corporation or private entity tell me that I am not allowed to discuss my opinion even if I do give out any type of statistics I make sure that it comes from a verifiable credible source which more often than not is the American government it's a dot gov it's a um CDC or the National Crime Database like I don't give out incorrect information from unverified sources I don't speak factually I merely say I find it odd I'm displeased with etcetera etcetera all of these are feelings and opinions that I am now not allowed to voice in my country on a social media platform under the guise of community standards how how and I don't don't give me that well they can do it be I don't care about the why do none of you find this fucking off and seriously guys in the comments spare me the logistics and the legal well they can do it because judge had an example of shit and blah blah blah blah blah just just tell me you're a sheep without telling me you're a fucking sheep like I'm so for real the fact that more people are not up in arms about this is absolutely insane to me it's like the American government is like we know we're doing you guys wrong because this opinion is resonating with Americans everywhere they all feel the same it's gaining traction and rather than actually addressing it let's put a muzzle on her let's ban her let's take away her platform and the platform of other people who are like her because we're never gonna address these issues instead we're gonna use the media we do control to polarize and propagate you guys and then ban any other form of social media where you might not be polarized or propagated or where you have the ability to speak freely on your opinion like is this is this is this really where we're this is really where we're at guys wow",

Anything that, um, is people against the oppressors is my jam, okay? 100%. And I'm sure many of you seen the video now of the one kid, um, I say kid, a full grown adult, bonking the police officer on the head with the giant water jug. And have us become the symbol of these, um, student, our revolutions here. And a lot of people are saying, oh, because you know, um, water is giving to the people, blah, blah, blah, this and that. But no one's ever mentioned the fact that I've seen that using a water jug against police are just bonking them on the head with it is without a doubt, unequivocally the most non aggressive, non lethal way to fight back against the police. Because, you know, if they fought back with any other way, whether their fists, whether be like anything else, the police would justifiably use severe force against them because their, their life is in danger, you know what I mean? They can't justify that with a fucking water jug. It's become the symbol of these revolutions because it is the only way you guys can fight back without being killed, without being aggressively named, without being rubber bulleted or like tear gassed. Um, and like, they can't argue against that. You can't bump them in the head with a water bottle. And they'll be like, you wanna kill me? That's not how it works. That's. That's. That's not gonna happen. So using that as sort of a symbol of being like, hey, you guys are fighting us, but what the fuck you gonna do? I think that's solid. Use more water bottles. Bonk more police officers. What are they gonna do? What are they. You're not hurting them. You're not attacking them. You gonna Bonk",

Someone use punctuation and attacks anxiety. And yet you have no problem generalizing that an entire generation can be awful. So they're the worst. Number two, do we know you?

    "voice_to_text": "Why does it seem like so much of the fight for a free Palestine in the diaspora removes the idea of collective liberation? It's about the destruction of Israel, not changing policies, people seeing a solution as sending all the Jews back to Poland, not finding a way to live on the land peacefully together. It's only listening to extremists, not the Palestinians and Israelis who are working together, who are sitting outside Bebe's house because they can and are on the ground in the US. We can't sit outside Bebe's house. We can't fight for policy change in Israel. We are not there. But they are. And we should be taking point from the people who are fighting for it. These protests on college campuses could be inclusive, could be about collective liberation, could welcome in those who are working with organizations like Standing Together and peace now, but they're not. A person or an organization can be progressive, Zionist, and they're automatically thought of as evil, and their opinion doesn't matter. There's a distinction between a good Jew and a bad Jew. There's calls for the complete destruction of Israel and telling Jews to go back to Poland. There are people on the ground who are fighting for those things, and many of them went into Israel on October 7th. But there are also a huge group of people of Israelis and Palestinians fighting for collective freedom, collective liberation, who have been doing so for decades and generations. Why Aren't they the ones you're taking point from? We are in the diaspora. We should be taking point from those who want better for their own people. Not trying to be the loudest activist in the room, saying the most polarizing things, announcing bad actors matters. Listening to people who might not use the same language as you matters. Who on the ground are you fighting for? Just think about it. Taking point from the Palestinians and Israelis who are fighting together would be so powerful. Helping them do their work and spreading their message would be so powerful. To fight for a collective liberation, you have to take point from the people on the ground who are doing the same, not the people who are fighting for destruction before they mad do. All of us in need of healing. And may the memories of those who have been lost and those who will be lost be a blessing and a revolution for peace, freedom and safety for all.",

Yup. Yesterday, Palestinian officials uncovered two mass graves outside the bond hospitals in Gaza. These graves also constitute as a war crime, don't they? Deputy Prime Minister well, of course, we would expect the, the democratic government of Israel to investigate any allegations of misconduct, and that's exactly what they do, and it's exactly what the foreign secretary and the prime minister urge them to do. But I find it quite extraordinary that she seeks to draw parallels between the legitimate war of self defense of Israel and the conduct of Russia. Party Black 300 bodies, including the elderly and the injured, some of which had been stripped naked, mutilated, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UK's own arms policy states that if there is even a risk that war crimes may be taking place, then that is reason enough to halt the sale of arms. Stop the sale, given all we know. Why then, is the Prime Minister yet to do so? Stop the sale. Deputy Prime Minister well, we continue to urge the Israeli government to investigate any allegations of misconduct. The difference, though, is that we can trust the Israeli government, a democratically elected government, to properly investigate those things. And of course, we keep the advice under review. The foreign secretary Has recently made it clear that he is conducted, uh, a determination and has not changed his advice regarding, uh, export licenses. And I think that is the correct decision.",

Wait, we see how that is. Singapore, the millions of dollars and eight is the one building tunnels.

Instead of rebuilding, civilization has just build on Palestinians to have a nation state that they deserve by international law since the inception of the Israeli nation state. What you are saying is insane to me. The fact that you brought up the last 15 years as Palestinians crying is disgusting. Oh, I have one more question. You are a disgusting little monster.

The US military is not dropping 2,000 pound bombs on civilian apartment buildings. The US military is not doing that, but we are supplying those bombs. United States of America is not blocking the borders and preventing food, water and medical supplies from getting to desperate people. We are not doing that. But we have supplied billions of dollars to the Netanyahu government, which is doing just that. So this is not just an Israeli war, this is an American war as well. And yet, despite the massive financial and military support the United States has provided to Israel for many years, Natanya House! Natanya House! Extremist government has ignored urgent calls from the president and others to alter their military approach and to end this humanitarian disaster. In my view, the United States is unconditional financial and military support for Israel must end. And that is why I offered an amendment to this Bill to do, in fact, what a majority of the American people want us to do, and that is no longer to provide military aid to the destructive Netanyahu government. I would have welcomed the chance to vote for the humanitarian aid provision in this Bill. Terribly important that we stop feeding people not only in Gaza, but in Sudan and all over the world. It's an important provision. I wanna support. It. I believe very strongly that we should support Ukraine and help them in defeat the imperialist ventures of Putin and the Russian army. But I'm not gonna be able to do that because I'm gonna stand with the American people today who oppose more money for Netanyahu. What we are doing today is very bad policy. We are eating and abetting the destruction of the Palestinian people. What we are doing today is not what the American people want. And I say to my democratic friends, it is absolutely not what Democrats. A lot of Republicans don't want us to continue that as well. But a strong majority of Democrats are saying, enough with Netanyahu's war. You just can't give him another $10 billion for unfetted military aid. But I suppose in a little while, as things happen here in the Congress, we will ignore the needs of the American people. We will not pay attention to what they want.

It allows for illegal Israeli settlers to quickly and easily go between their illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, while Palestinians require a permit and need to go through checkpoints. This is a chadat road in the Palestinian city of elkharil. Also nicknamed Apartheid Road because Palestinians are quite literally not allowed to use it, while Israeli cars, illegal settlers and tourists can. Also, the Israeli military randomly imposes curfews and restricts Palestinians movement around their own homes and neighborhoods. Here are a plethora of checkpoints that Palestinians are subjected to for their most mundane daily tasks and routines, like for work, medical care, education, or religious purposes. And of course, Israelis don't have to go through these. This is a swimming pool in an illegal settlement in the West Bank, with water supply roughly four times greater than that provided to Palestinian communities, 180 of which don't have access to running water. And what does this lead to? Drying up of the wells, the collapse of farming villages, disappearing crops and their basic daily needs are not being met. So while illegal settlers are sometimes just a few hundred meters away enjoying swimming pools, Palestinians become forced to work for these settlers who control all of the agriculture, or Palestinians are forced to move. So just another form of ethnic cleansing, so on. Top of living under a brutal occupation and harsh military rule, Palestinians are in a vicious cycle of poverty and unemployment. Not to mention they live under constant threat of house demolitions because they don't have the proper permits. And when they do apply for the proper permits, Israel denies 98% of those applications. Just another thing illegal Israeli settlers don't have to endure. So, yeah, there's a little bit of apartheid for you.",

    "voice_to_text": "And yet another Bill in this education plan this week. this one is focused on teaching the history of communism in schools. The Bill requires the department of education to come up with an age appropriate curriculum for all grades to teach the atrocities of communism. Expected being assigned. Jason Delgado is live in Tallahassee with this, with more on what this means for your child's education. And Jason, the governor chose an opportunity to sign this Bill. Yeah, Holly, the timing's no mistake. Today is the 63rd anniversary of that Bay of pigs and invasion. The governor traveling down south to sign that anti communist law into law. We go out starting in 2026, all K through 12 students in Florida must get what Governor Desantis called anti communism education. My view on this is, uh, we might as well tell them the truth when they're in our schools. Cause a lot of these universities, they go, they're gonna be told how great communism is. So we're setting the proper foundation, I guess. The new law includes plans for a communism history museum and a new South Florida Institute designed to promote democracy abroad. This Bill today gives us the opportunity to ensure that we learn history so that our students in Florida are not apt to repeat that history and really understand the evils of communism. Back in March, two dozen Democrats voted against this Bill. Senate Bill 1264. Some called it hypocritical, but I do find This ingenuous that Republican colleagues, who are constantly screaming about indoctrination, that they pose indoctrination, then pass and sponsor a legislation that emphasizes specific political viewpoint. Be taught to our students. And what about other forms of government? Critics argue those are important to learn, too, especially when it comes to our own history. I, I don't think it's appropriate to just focus on one specific victim of a political entity while ignoring victims that have unfortunately been crated at the arms of the United States, whether it's our foreign policy decisions and so forth. Now, this new law goes into effect July 1st. Meanwhile, when it comes to that museum, the state still has yet to designate where that museum is going to be. That's the latest. In Tallahassee, Jason Delgado. Spectrumness.",

In the area known as Palestine, the country is mainly empty, sparsely populated, abandoned. Many populations are in Jerusalem, Ako Spot, Jafa, Tavalia and Aza. Most of the population are Jews, almost everyone else is Christians and very few Muslims, most of them bedwinds. The only exception is Srem or novelist. Approximately 120 people of the Muslim family notcha live there and approximately 70 Shomal names, which are the Samaritans and Nazareth. The capital of Galilee is approximately 700 people, all Christians. In Jerusalem about 5,000 people, almost all Jews, the rest a little bit of Christians. In 1695 everyone knew that the origin of the place was Jewish. There is not a single settlement in Palestine with Arabic roots in its name. Most sediments of Jewish original or in some cases Greek or Roman Latin. About 550 people lived in Azza, half of them Jews, half of them Christians. Jews are very successful in agriculture, mostly vineyards, olives, wheat. And Christians were engaged mostly in trade and transportation. This book completely refused the theories of Palestinian traditions Palestinian people and leaves almost no link between the land and the Arab people who stole the land's Latin name, Palestine, and took it for themselves. This book was written in Latin again in 1695. Adriana was a geographer, a traveler, photographer, a Philologist. He knew several European languages. Ancient Greek, Arabic, Hebrew. He ended up visiting over 25 settlements in the area. 25! And he made the population census based off of this. Now, free Palestine people. Why are you trying to free Palestine from its indigenous people, the Jews, and give it to the colonizers, the Arabs?",

It's more. It's more sweet. What's good, people? It's your homeboy, T pain. And I'm here with genius and our partner, Starbucks. One sip of this spicy lemonade refreshers. Has me ready to dive into my own spicy milk. How spicy would I consider my song writing and lyrics? To me, I think I'm teetering right in the middle. When I get into writing songs and recording songs, I never think about anything outside. You know what I mean? I always just kind of go with whatever is happening in the moment. Now, when it comes to my songs, I think. A list of my spiciest songs, the first one would be the one with me and Meghan Trainor, been like this. When Megan send it to me, I was like, you ain't gonna sing that song. I even say spicy in the song. I might have to get a little bit spicy. You get it? When I initially got been like this from Megan, I thought this was the song that was gonna defeat T pain. The speed of the song, the melodies that she was doing, it was just. She almost had me, but I was right there with my spiciness. I couldn't let the song beat me. My next spicy song is buy you A drink. You know what's crazy? At this time that I was writing this song, I had not yet bought anybody a drink because I don't have any money. So I got a little leeway to be a little extra spicy. Another one of my spicy songs is on this hill. I know it's not released yet, but it's a song about refusing to be gas lit anymore. It's. Haha, it's. It's coming to a realization of, I gotta stand up for myself. And I think we stand up for yourself. You gotta get a little bit spicy. When I'm feeling sweet, I'm sprung, a song I wrote about my then girlfriend just now, my wife of 20 years. When she heard the song, I think it was. I think it was a shock because she had known, you know, a lot of my music from before then. None of it was particularly sweet. So just the fact that I was talking like that at all was a shock. My last spicy song is Baby Got Brat featuring hurt. It's an automotive song. Everything about it, automotive world is spicy. It was supposed to be a comical song. It did not turn out that way. It is very spicy. Look those lyrics off on genius, because we talking at top. It's so spicy.",

I don't think he cares if Palestinians are murdered like roaches and ants. Um, but to the rest of Americans who have normal human values, uh, they do care. And, uh, you know, one of the other things that Mark and I wrote in that piece is that the blood on the trauma bay floor and the operating room floor was dripping from our hands. And that's. I think that's accurate. We again, we provide the crucial military, economic, and diplomatic support. Um, your viewers are no surprise to that. And that makes us responsible. If our support stops, the attack stop. If our support stops, the occupation stops. It's. It's instant. It's been proven a hundred times. It's not hard. Not hard to see. Um, and so that's what I would say to people is if you want to stop participating unwittingly, uh, in these. In some of the worst crimes that I've ever seen in my life, then you need to organize and you need to raise the cost to people like Joe Biden, because that is the only thing they care about there. The US is attempting to manage the Middle East with the system that I put in place since the Arab Spring, and the Palestinians are just kind of an annoyance to that system. So I would say To people that you know. You know what's going on. So stop thinking about it all that much and just start acting. Go to, uh, go to your houses of worship, go to your community centres, go wherever it is that you go and talk to people and say, look, let's go talk to our congressman in person. Let's demand a meeting. If you're a veteran, put your uniform on and go. I've had several veterans reach out to me. Put your uniform on, go talk to your congressperson. Film it, put it online. Do anything you can to embarrass these people and to make it obvious to the world that they are not acting with normal human decency in mind. They're acting with purely cold, almost Mafia like political calculations. And, um, the only way that we are going to stop this is by raising the cost to them of doing so.",

I think you've lost the thread. It. It just to end on this. If you had a message for Christian leaders in the United States, whether in government or in churches, or just citizens who care about the religion, their fellow Christians, what would it be? It would be to remind them that when the state of Israel was created, it was not created on an empty land. It was created on a land that had, uh, millions of indigenous Palestinians there, including Palestinian Christians. And that that state they support, uh, that state they celebrated as a fulfillment of prophecy and the sign of God state to the Jewish people. For it to become a state, uh, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians, uh, were forced to leave and have never returned. Uh, churches were closed. A friend of mine did the research and counted more than 30 churches that were closed when Israel was created. Because Palestinians, uh, were expelled from, uh, the land. Our numbers continue to be in decline. Uh, so we're pleading that, uh, uh, come and listen. Come and talk to us. And my message to Christian leaders right now is there is a very, very brutal war taking place in Gaza. A war that I've described using the word genocide because it's a war that Has used even starvation as a mean. And fellow Christians are suffering because of that war. Uh, it's time that, uh, Christian leaders, ah, recognise that wars is not the way, whether in Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya. I mean, when will we learn that war does not help? When will we take Jesus's words seriously, uh, about being peacemakers, about being merciful, merciful. There must be, uh, other ways. Um, and so it would be an invitation to listen, to learn more, uh, and to avoid very shallow and simplistic perspectives that are not based on Scripture itself, but more based on, uh, political, uh, equations. Um, and I would plea right now, and I will continue to plea, that we need to stop this war in cancer. Uh, it's killing many, many children, women, innocent lives. It has to stop. There must be, uh, other ways. And as a follower of Christ, uh, we have to pursue the path of peace, uh, and justice. And we have to avoid simplistic, uh, polarizations. Good and evil. Come and listen. Come and understand what's happening. And I plead, as a Christian pastor from Bethlehem, I plead that you come and listen. Father, thank you for your thoroughly decent and sensible analysis, and I hope it's heard by Christians throughout the west. I appreciate it.",

The first one, then an interval during which aid workers got out of their vehicles, removed the wounded, tried to move to another vehicle, which was struck. And then a third strike. What? As they tried to move and escape in a third vehicle, at which point all of them were dead. How would the second and third strikes of these marked vehicles be a mistake? And why would the US not more forcefully set conditions on the use of US made weaponry when it is being used to target aid workers? If the first one was a mistake, the second two, we're targeted with the intent of killing everyone in that convoy. So how do you respond to that? First of all, there's an investigation going on, so why don't we let it get done and why don't we see what they find in terms of the decision making process that LED to this terrible outcome? Prime Minister and the IDF have noted that it was their error. If you don't like the word mistake. Their error. They're investigating it. Let them do that work and let them see what they come up with, and then we'll go from there. Two years ago, the IDF killed an Al Jazeera journalist. They said that that was a mistake, uh, that she was wearing a Mark Press vest. She was shot anyway. Investigated it, and they, uh, released the findings. Their investigation, which found that they were at fault. Go on. But my. My question, sir, is in that case, uh, these. The Israelis did not initiate any criminal, uh, proceeding in this case. If it's found that the marked convoy was deliberately targeted, if not with the first shot, but the second two shots with the US support, criminal penalties. As I said, we would expect that should there be a need for accountability, that accountability be properly put in place for whoever may be responsible for this. But again, that's gonna allow. That's gonna depend on the investigation.",

Recently on some podcast or interview, and he was asked what he thinks should happen to Gaza, and this man had the audacity to say the quiet part out loud. Take a look. Listen to what he says. Once Gaza's leave Gaza, and then I was never gonna let them back in. Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. And Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable. It's a little bit of unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out, and then there's not much left of Gaza anyway. Move the gazons out and then clean it up. This is why it is so important to continue to talk and for everyone to use their platform to spread news like this. Because their plans are far from over. They said it initially, they wanted to turn Gaza into a parking lot. And now they're already wanting to develop said parking lot with absolutely no remorse for literal human life.",

In an exclusive interview with MEE, Chehade said that she\u2019s going to pursue legal action against the firm. \u201cToday I'm speaking out and pursuing legal action to set a precedent that we cannot be picked out one by one, that we deserve our rights as well.\u201d She also added \u201cAs lawyers, we are taught that our principal goal is justice and to be advocates for oppressed people everywhere. So, therefore, I refuse to be silenced or allow Foley to bully me into silence.\u201d",
