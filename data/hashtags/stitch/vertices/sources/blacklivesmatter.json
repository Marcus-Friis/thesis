Because right now your mother is providing for you and your children. So that means you cannot provide for yourself. So if a woman talks to you, she's gonna have to replace your mother as your new provider. And no one wants that debt in their life. You're not an asset, you're a liability. So my suggestion to you is stop focusing on women. Focus on giving a place to live of your own, raising your children, becoming your own asset. And after all that, then you can try to find a woman to also be asset to your life. Cause right now you live with your mom, you catch the bus and you have kids. You're a walking liability to a woman's life. And women can do bad all by they self. They don't need help from nobody.",

I'm just scrolling on TikTok, doing my little daily little scrolls, and I come across this bullshit. And to be honest with you, I don't even know what them little white kids do with the little face mask. I don't really get into that that on, you know, but it's just like, huh? And then it's like the. They knew what they was doing when they bought it, put it on, posted it. They already knew the type of reaction they was gonna fucking get. And then is it the black people or is it the American liberals? Make it make sense which one it is. But in all nationality, it's given that you're very much racist, and that's just what it is, so. But then don't let us black people start getting, you know, then we wrong. But.",

Why are you, in your video, gonna say, I don't think it's black Americans, but then go on talking about black Americans? No one in black America even knew about them teens putting on black face or green face or whatever the hell they was talking about. None of us even cared. We got other shit to do. We really don't care about you. It's people in your own community, not the Asian community, you know, the alphabet community, who reported you. Why don't you leave us alone, man? We're not even bothering you. You are bothering us. And then you said MLK and Rosa Porks was real change. That was the worst thing that ever happened to black Americans. But people like you think that that was the greatest thing to happen to us. That was, like, the greatest transference of wealth. Why don't you really learn about black history before you come for black Americans? Because things can get a little tricky for you. You know what I'm saying, my man? Why don't you just. Shh!",

    "voice_to_text": "Y'all never, ever, ever get the bohemian. Not crisis averted, y'all. I got my hair taken out. I went to the African hair salon that's near my house and I just asked them, how much does it cost to take my braids out? They charge $80 to take it out and then $40 to wash, blow dry and bring it back down. That was 120 dollars. And I gave her 20 dollar tip cause I was just so thankful and grateful that she helped me out. But yeah, girl, I was literally having like a full blown meltdown. I hate taking my braids out. Like, I hate taking it out. I hate doing my hair. I'm sorry. It literally gives me anxiety whenever I think about. Yeah, get the brace. They're worth every penny. But set aside $100 so that you can, you know, pay for somebody to take the shit out. Cause if you're like me, doing your hair yourself gives you anxiety. And that way you don't have to have a fucking panic attack every time you gotta do your hair, huh? Yeah, girl, I'm just so happy that I got this figured out. It was worth every penny. Yes. God, yeah, girl. I'm about to go try on my new wig. I got a little. A new little glueless wig that I gotta go try on. So I'll be back for some more. Y'all back to update y'all. But yeah, I'm. I'm good now. Thank you.",

And it's the micro aggression that Margie Taylor Green display. So when she made a comment about her lashes, AOC said something. She said nothing to AOC about what she was saying. But when she got that clap back, all of a sudden is calm down. And she became the victim and the black woman became the aggressor. No one said anything to AOC about what she said or even the tone she used. And no one told her to calm down. Cause AOC was standing 10 toes down. But when that clap back came, all of a sudden it was calm down is very victim mode. I just wanna know you guys thoughts on this."

So his question is why don't black people or people of color get abducted by aliens like white people? And let me tell you what I think it is. Cause y'all be doing stupid stuff alone. I feel like y'all be asking for aliens to abduct y'all. Cause y'all just be doing random shit like going to like haunted houses, cave diving, trying to dig up graves of random old people. Did you not see the video? Other little white girl that went walking in the forest and picked up the papa lake way all about fuck with. Put it back, that's why. Cause y'all should be doing random things to get abducted. Like white people are abducted by aliens. Cause they put themselves in a position to be kidnapped by aliens. Where's black folk? We ain't going nowhere, we ain't touching nothing, we ain't doing nothing, we not investigating nothing. If we see something, we not say nothing, we go another direction. If the house is howling it, the ghost can have the house and we moving. So I would like everyone else's opinion about why. Why people get adopted by aliens. But that's my theory. Cause y'all be doing too much and aliens know they gonna find out by yourself in some cornfield. Digging up a grave like eat popcorn? I don't know. By yourself",

The devil is a liar and so are they. Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do! Protect us from tyranny and those that mean us ill intent!!! Maybe I\u2019ll give them the compassion they lack because at one point I was them. P.S. Law enforcement and all others involved, If you\u2019re willing to break the law to catch a \u201ccriminal\u201d you Sir/Ma\u2019am are the criminal.

Cause a lot of them don't care about your hair health or your edges. I mean I have actually had some traction alopecia, but it's getting better. And I remember one of the hair stylist actually told me that you know, if you braid your edges tight, actually promote hair grow. So lot of them are really not educated and they don't understand when it comes to hair health or you know, why you're losing your hair. So be very very careful. Be very careful. And I recommend that lady to go see a dermatologist.",

Talking about the West Coast is back. Let me give y'all old heads a little. Some, some, some what's going on in the black neighborhood. We get low wages. We barely can afford rent, insurance, food, clothes. We one fucking paycheck away from being homeless. But we care about Kendrick Lamar and Drake so much that we wanna get on the internet and tell people. What? We're not listening to Damn South shit. You listening to the blues, damn South. Because that's all we getting. Instead of getting on here talking about some shit that's gonna help lift the black community, like how we need to vote in our best interest, you want to talk about some damn Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Leave that shit to the young people.",

In no way, shape or form is it anybody else's responsibility to make sure you have food that meets your very strict dietary needs. If you are vegan, if you are vegetarian, if you are gluten free or whatever, you need to make sure that you have the food that you can eat. All right? Now, I honestly think your friend was wrong for even agreeing to do that bullshit. Because there's no way in the world it's gonna be my wedding day and I'm gonna be wearing my coordinators and everything with your dietary restrictions. I'm not fucking doing that shit. She was wrong for even saying yes. And you were wrong for not making sure that you, as a grown adult and your child, that's in your responsibility, could fucking eat. I stopped that shit long ago when my kids was having birthday parties. Your kid can't have sweets? Bring something. Your kids gluten free? Bring it. Your kid is lactose intolerant, bring it. Because I ain't got the time, the resources. And honestly, I really don't fucking care. I don't.",

You're really out here promoting how you termed Frank the nerd into Frank the businessman? Yep. You just saving white Pookies and Ray rays. The only difference is white Pookie and Ray rays allow you to change them. Because the only thing you control with white Pookie and Ray rays is in the bedroom. Yeah, I know a girl who dated a white Pookie and Ray Ray, and she said the only thing he allowed her to control was the bedroom. Everything else, he controlled. And guess what y'all looking for? Y'all just want to control in the bedroom. Y'all want everyone else to control everything else. Y'all back to that slave mentality where the master took care of everything, and then when the master needed a little bit of love and he snuck into the cabin. That's basically what the black and white effect is.",

Why put yourself in that situation when you don't have to? So three places that you'll never see a boy. Cause I don't mess around. Anything out west. Anything. 79th and anything. 79th Street and anything. And Little Village. Those three places you never gonna see me. I do not mess around. I'm cool. I'm Gucci like, I love everybody know I have a bunch of Mexican homies. I be hanging around them so much at the job, they call me black chicken. But I'm telling you this, they are couple always talking about, hey, let's go Little Village, get some tacos. Cause they know I love authentic Mexican tacos. The street tacos are the best. And they say Little Village has the best street tacos in the world. Not just the city, Craig. Well, the world, Craig. But guess we will never find out if it's true or not. This guy here. I don't want a little village. You see what they gotta had to get on on Cinco de Mayo. I'm good now. Don't. Once again, I'm not scared. But why put yourself in a situation where you don't have to? Where you can easily avoid it by not going there. So, yeah, I'm cool with that. But like I said, three places you never see me. Anything I wish. Sunny Nights and anything and Little Village. Take it from me, if you plan on visiting Chicago, if you're not from here and you plan on visiting here, those three places you don't wanna go. I'm just. Just here to let you know.",

I feel sorry for the men of this generation that's coming up, because you're not gonna have no one to marry. You have have a generation for 3 o fours. 3:04 is admiring a woman who gets on fucking Instagram and shakes her ass for 24 minutes, and I didn't see it. 24 minutes. And you. And you wondering why nobody wants to protect black women. Why am I gonna protect someone who does that? This is a woman unworthy of Protection. But she can pay for Protection. The question is, can you? The average black woman who does what she does, can you pay for Protection? Yeah. She is being paid by the industry to lower the standards of black woman. So when stuff happens to you, they can use the same old thing they always use. Oh, they wanted it",

Because if you watch this dude's videos, like, this is a black man, this is a black man going to UCLA, and anytime he goes anywhere near these encampment, it's not brown students, it's not black students, it's not Palestinians or gossins or Asians or any of that shit. No, it is a bunch of white people telling a black man where he can go on campus. It is a bunch of white students saying, you don't belong here and trying to force a black man to leave their area. I mean, let's be real, at its core, that's what's going on. This is white people exercising their privilege. This is white people exercising their privilege to tell a black man that he doesn't belong there. This is white people telling a black man where he can be and especially where he can't be. How the fuck have white liberals gone so far that now they think they're right, committing racism? Cause let's be real, if these white kids were conservative, and this black dude was Liberal, and all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he can and can't go, all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he is and isn't welcome, that would be called racism. Every one of those white kids would be called a racist piece of Shit. But somehow, because they're Liberal, we just ignore the racism. I'm certainly not going to"

In 2023, there was a study done on the racial demographics of children in foster care, and an astounding 43% of those children were white, not black. Only 22% black, actually. So the real reason why white people are adopting black children not because of the plethora of black children for them to choose from, but because white people get approved for foster care and adopting children at a faster rate than black people do. In fact, black people are held to a higher standard than white people are. White women, white men are when it comes to adopting children. And that is because of white supremacy and systemic racism. So I know you're congratulating yourself because you had all these people in the comments saying you ate that lady up, but actually you didn't do shit except expose your own racism. And I'm glad that you see color, but I know that you didn't say it because you actually see color in a way that means you respect and understand other people's struggles different from your own. You said it in a. In a way because you think that people who say I don't see color are being woke, and you don't wanna be aligned with the woke people. So your comment ain't shit, your video ain't shit. You ain't done shit but showed us how racist you are. And I know that you are probably gonna reply and say something about the I'm woke, but just so you know, I'm actually not woke, because I know where the woke definition came from, and it has nothing to do with white people or what's happening in society right now. It's just another word that white people colonized. Have a good day.",

Now I will say I'm not an adoption specialist, but I do work in child welfare and I realize that there are more Caucasian children and foster care than black children. As a matter of fact, the foster care system for black children has dropped over 20% in the past 20 years. So you might ask why are these Caucasian parents adopting black children more than Caucasian children? This. Caucasian children are the majority in the foster care system and it's good old fashioned racism cause black children are cheaper to adopt the Caucasian children. And fun fact, you don't need to have a family to adopt. You could be single and adopt a child out of foster care.",
