Today, one person passed away and several were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight hit a really bad air pocket on a trip from London to Singapore. Such incidents are rare, but clear air turbulence, which is when out of nowhere in the clear blue sky your plane suddenly starts acting like a mechanical bull, is on the rise. One recent study found that it had increased 50% over the North Atlantic in the past 40 years. Could climate change be to blame? Possibly. It could be making the jet stream more unstable. But the important thing to know is that this is a risk and that there is a simple solution for dealing with it. Just keep your seatbelt fastened even when the fastened seatbelt light isn't lit."

    "voice_to_text": "Article that said that Egypt is deploying their military to the border because tensions are rising. So, yes, this is a sad state of affairs, but it's probably a little bit more complicated than we're giving them credit for. I'm gonna explain why by talking about Jordan first. Now, you might have seen this wimpy picture where king of Jordan was looking a little bit sheepish sitting behind Biden as he was giving a speech. But there is a reason for that. Because Jordan has dependency in Israel. This strip of water here is basically the most important piece of water for Jordan, because The Jordanian River, via the Jordanian Dam, is actually controlled by Israel. And not only is it a river that, how about bears the name of Jordan, more importantly, it's the river that is then desalinated by Israel and then sold back to Jordan as fresh water for drinking. That's right. Israel is capturing the water from the Jordanian river and then sell it back to Jordan. This is broadly a colonial problem, because at the end of the day, the resources actually belong to Jordan. Technically speaking, at least half of them do. But instead of splitting 50 50, they took all of it from desalinator and then sell it back to Jordan as part of a water for energy agreement. Because the Jordanian desert is an ideal place to place solar panels, and that creates electricity which is then exported back to Israel. Now, Egypt's problem is actually very similar, because they also depend on Israel to keep the peace around what is basically the Suez Canal. Now, the problem, of course, is a part of this colonialist war. I sent this invasion seems to be that Israel wants to create a second canal that it has full control over that basically more or less goes straight through the, uh, god of Peninsula. As both countries are aware of what's happening with climate change, especially since they've been suffering from some of it, they are very aware they can't lose something as crucial to human life as water, because as those areas heat up and less and less freshwater is about, dehydration is a very real problem that can happen in much shorter order than before with many more people. So you can sort of understand the predicament he is in. And unfortunately, what's happening now is basically a political point is to say, well, yes, we are ready to stand up our troops basically when the job is done, just to try and save face. But you tell by his there's no saving it.",

To these boats. They were like, climate change will take it into our own hands or fence. They also go on to say that they believe that the older generations are now taking the younger generations out to this area every year and teaching them to attack the boats, which I fully believe, because that's honestly something that orcas and many whales do as they teach their young how to hunt. This is my favorite animal. Amazing."

    "voice_to_text": "so I am stitching this specific clip from The Ocean Cleanup because I think it really hinges into a lot of my world view but also I just love the work that they do and I think it's really helpful account to follow um if you're someone who is like following all the different climate crises happening at the same time I like hear that saying all the time \u201clook for the helpers\u201d and I think this account is a really good example of helpers like the people who are out there and actively doing things to undo some of the horrible things that humans have done to this planet but on a more broad sense like I also was having a conversation with a friend this past week about like nihilism and about the sort of arc of freedom in this country and the reactionary way that kind of both sides of our political divide react to all of those things um and how it sort of hinges into my own world view and I think we all know that quote that like the arc of humanity bends towards freedom (okay barely got that right*) but at the same time I also think it's sort of important to understand especially in a political sense um while we're on the precipice of this next election and there are plenty of people who are very rightfully not interested in either side of the divide to kind of have a broader conversation I think about the way in which that affects both our day to day lives and how things happen at a more macro level I just feel as though it really is a great breeding ground for apathy to fall into that sort of space of our slowly backsliding into fascism and we're no longer going to have democracy in this country and I know that I sit in a really privileged position as a white cis-male so I just want to like caveat that and obviously I can't speak to having not experienced a lot of the atrocities that like black and brown folks feel in this country um at most I can speak to the sort of LGBT struggle having live through part of that but at the worst of it being like fighting for marriage Equality which is nothing like fighting for our lives during the AIDS crisis which predates me and then I think a lot of the horrible things that like our trans Brethren are going through today and being systematically and legally eliminated in as many ways as possible but again sort of saying in a macro level the way I was talking about it with my friend was that the way this country tends to work is that at the pendulum swing we generally have two terms of a democratic president and then two terms of a Republican president and usually all of the progressive stuff that happens during that democratic presidency has a sort of backswing that happens in the following eight years that said I don't think that the pendulum just goes back and forth I do believe that while that pendulum sort of goes back and forth it also moves forward so every time we do have that pendulum swing I feel as though we make maybe small bits of ground up in that time and taking it to an even more broad like worldview sense I don't think that I'm someone who's like a super optimist I'm definitely a realist but at the same time there's a part of me that still has this deep belief in the sort of indominable side of the human spirit so I remember during covid there would be all these news reports that would come out and say oh this is gonna be going on for another 7 years this is gonna go on for 20 years this is gonna affect 30 generations of humans and while that is certainly potentially true and I am not talking about long covid and the reverting effects it's had on us never mind the mental effects it's had on us and children's development and all of that but it kind of brings me back to this original clip from The Ocean Cleanup because there is just something in me that believes in the resiliency of the human mind and human creativity that we have generally found ways to overcome most challenges that have come our way so I'm just not someone who's going to sit here and believe that there's not going to be some amazing advancement in science at some point in my lifetime where we learn how to refreeze the polar ice caps or we learn how to build machines that help us to clean up the ocean from all that's been polluted into it and you can absolutely call that like a polyana worldview but I think that there's a way to acknowledge thr backsliding into fascism or the loss of democracy and everything without it becoming this histrionic sort of reaction that I think again breeds nihilism and then also apathy for most people and I think apathy is the opposite of what we need when we need ingenuity and creativity to fight some of these battles",

Andy's idea of \"native adjacent\" plants is an interesting one because it gets at this idea that what makes a native plant might not be so black and white. Over the last four months, I've been writing this paper about the usefulness of native plants as they face the problems posed by climate change. And in the paper I talk a lot about what the definition of a native plant is. The main factor we often talk about when defining what makes a plant native is geographical proximity. So is it native to your city, your county, your state, your country, your continent? How do you define what region is close enough to make that plant native? And while geographic proximity is useful, it has its limitations. Take for example, if I say that all plants within 10 km are native, well, I go 10 km to the top of the nearest mountain, are those plants really native to where I am here? Geographically maybe, but climatically, not really. While nativity maps are useful to an extent, they're not gonna show you the biomes or the habitats that these plants are native to. And if we add climate change into the mix, those biomes and habitats are currently changing and are going to continue changing into the future. So what does that mean for our definition of a native plant? A point that I make my paper is that, in this era of climate change, the definition of a native plant shouldn't just take into account geographic proximity or climactic conditions, but also the benefits that these plants have for native fauna. Because if we're planting native plants solely based on their historical region of nativity, what good is it if they can't survive the climactic conditions of the future? They can't benefit the local fauna if they can't survive. This is an idea that I found in this research paper from the university of Lausanne that talks about tree planting as it relates to climate change. The paper is in French, but I will break it down for you because it's super interesting. The researchers used climate modeling to predict the climate in Lausanne in 2070 and then rated a list of 110 trees. These 110 trees from around the world were rated according to how well they would be adapted to this predicted future climate. Trees best adapted to the predicted climate received a score of one, and then the trees that were less and less adapted to that predicted climate received scores of 2, 3, or 4 being the worst. But the researchers didn't just stop at looking at the adaptability of these trees to the future climate; they also took into consideration the potential for supporting local biodiversity. Biodiversity potential was calculated mainly from two factors: geographic deviation and phylogenetic deviation. I'll explain what that means. We've already kind of discussed the geographic deviation \u2014 basically, the plants that are found in this area in this close region here in Switzerland are considered to have a low geographic deviation because they're from the area. Trees found on the European continent, but not necessarily in this local area, are considered to have a medium geographic deviation. And then trees found on another continent are considered to have a high geographic deviation. The idea is that the area that a tree is native to, the closer that is to here in Switzerland, the more likely that that tree would be able to support the local wildlife. So a tree from Italy is probably more likely to support wildlife here in Switzerland than a tree from Japan. The second factor that the researchers taken to account for this biodiversity potential is the phylogenetic deviation. Phylogenetic is talking about genes, DNA, how closely things are related. So we're talking about family. The closer two plants are related, the less phylogenetic deviation there is. So if we take maple trees as an example, maybe we already have a species of maple tree here in Switzerland, and we're considering planting a species of maple tree that comes from Japan. Geographically speaking, that's a long ways off. But genetically speaking, that maple tree is a cousin. So the wildlife here might still be able to take advantage of that Japanese maple tree because they're genetically related. They're family, they're cousins. The closer these two plants are related, the less phylogenetic deviation there is, the more biodiversity potential there is. And these are all important things to consider because, as the researchers point out, some of the trees that are the best adapted for this future 2070 climate, they don't have very much biodiversity potential. However, some of the trees down here in the second place category, even though they may not be the best adapted to the future climate, they do have a pretty good biodiversity potential. This is why, in these conversations around planting native plants, I think it's really important to consider some of these native adjacents, as Andy calls them, because what might be native adjacent today could be the perfect native plant tomorrow.",

    "voice_to_text": "since it's apparently not nearly as common knowledge as I thought let's go over the carbon cycle and why carbon emissions and pollution are causing climate change to accelerate climate changes natural the world goes through cycles but we are accelerating it faster than the organisms on planet can adapt okay so that's the reason why climate change is a problem at our level now everything that's alive has carbon in it everything that is alive that has carbon and the soil has carbon in it and oil in the ground has carbon in it what we don't want is atmospheric carbon and when you burn carbon materials and you use other chemical processes to alter those carbon materials you create things like carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methane chlorofluorocarbons all of these are atmospheric or gaseous carbon compounds the issue with these compounds is that they allow the sun's energy to come in and not to go out of our atmosphere so the light comes in it heats things and then the heat is not able to escape that is what is increasing the speed of climate change again climate change naturally happens throughout the earth cycle but we are accelerating it much faster by burning carbons that were safely stored in the soil in solid compounds into the atmosphere in gaseous compounds they're called greenhouse gases because they hold in the heat just like a greenhouse except instead of having a nice little house around a few plants it's around the entire world which does cause natural disasters all over the world because weather patterns are changing faster than the various climates can adapt soil is being washed away too quickly cause too much rain is falling in certain areas causing massive massive amounts of flooding and landslides and things like blizzards are happening and heat waves and a bunch of other things that are directly related to carbon emissions caused by are use of fossil fuels and again I never claimed to be a perfect human being none of us can be perfect I don't care who you are none of us can be perfect and believe me if I could make a living without my car I would be happy to do so I did walk for a long time unfortunately I can't afford to live close enough to work to be able to walk if you made it this far in the video thank you for listening and I hope you Learned something um don't give up because there are a lot of people out there making a lot of really really ignorant comments and it's just cause they don't know any better but if we all take a little bit of time to do a little bit of research and understand what we're talking about we would all be better off",
