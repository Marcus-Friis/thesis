Go watch the rest of that video, but that's not even close to the only weird thing about these guys. So let's get into it. These are Sicilians, which are mostly blind, mostly limbless amphibians, and some of them are ovoviperous, meaning their babies start out in eggs, but the eggs hatch inside of the mom. And while they're in there, the mom makes, like, a fatty, milky liquid to feed them. But according to the 2024 study, at least one species nurses their babies after they're born, which is supposed to be our thing. And by ours, I mean mammals. Anyway, once they're, like, outside of their moms, babies of the species siphonops annulatis will eat their mother's skin for nourishment, which not too weird for Sicilians, but it is, like, weird to me. But the moms in this species also feed their babies a fatty fluid similar to the million milk. And these guys don't have nipples, so the mom, like, secretes this liquid from her cloica, which is the opening that some animals have instead of separate holes for reproduction and digestive waste. So the tiny Sicilians make, like, these high pitched clicks while hovering around that opening, which triggers mom to produce the fluid. And then they just shove their heads in the opening and they drink. And remember, they have teeth. So, yeah, there's just so, so much going on with these weird little guys.",

    "voice_to_text": "I want everybody to watch that video and take a moment to consider that it is 2024 and nearly a year eight months into multiple long term G sides that apparently the western culture has decided to acknowledge what indigenous people have been saying forever that animals and plants have consciousness and all of us who work with energy and have been talking about this for decades while people laughed and jeered and insulted our intelligence collectively raise an eyebrow and go no what's changed? what always changes probably some white dude finally figured out that maybe there's some valid validity to all this stuff because why would we pay attention to the indigenous lore gathered by multiple cultures over 3-4,000 years that is what colonialism does that is white supremacy in its most real insidious deeply rooted expression the the idea that things did not exist until some white person put them on the map and I'm not angry at the people who signed this I wanna be very clear I'm not angry at the philosophers and the the scientists that finally came together to say this I am exhausted at the colonialist attitudes that permeate western society and bleed into other societies and their cultures those mentalities that tell you that you can ignore other stuff because it's not scientifically proven completely ignoring the history of science and the reality that science and religion began as the same thing and that's because colonisers do not understand the concept of having multiple paradigms for the same thing because under colonialist mentality under white supremacist values you only have one of each that's why we get the scarcity mindsets you're either a woman or a man you're either a boy or a girl you're either good or you're not you're either tall or you're short you're either and nature doesn't work like that humanity doesn't work like that the people who never chose to actually pay attention to the rest of the world around them because they thought they knew everything god damn colonialist ego and uh those people went on to create what we now call science and I have to stress not to invalidate science because we have found some very interesting and important things about ourselves as humans about animals about plants and that is wonderful and great and also science is yet another paradigm of experiencing the world around you and it is not mutually incompatible with anything because humanity is always united so you can look at it through the lens of culture you can look at it through the lens of language you can look at it through the lens of science or politics or fashion or history or mythology or religion neuroscience quantum mechanics you name it chemistry biochemistry physics they are different lenses for the same experiences but the only people who never believed that because they could not fathom that they were somehow connected to the peasants the indigenous people hell even the women let's not forget how western science began on the bodies of Black women specifically and that's because they did not believe that women were people in their own culture I am glad honestly that we're finally getting to understand that there are multiple dimensions in a very literal sense to our human existence yeah about damn time and also the amount of of of of pain that's coming up in me right now for all the times that I was invalidated and bullied and harassed and had my my my intelligence questioned by people around me because I already know all this stuff I always have you can't not know this stuff if you're me because I feel it I see it I hear it and now people are like  \"oh my god it's autism it's ADHD - you can actually take in 40% more information than the average brain\" uh huh so what you're saying is I can see things that people normally can't I can hear things people normally can't I can feel things people normally can't and I can taste things people normally can't but my experience doesn't count because western science hasn't validated it yet \ud83d\ude44 at least at least we're getting there at least we're getting there at least we are getting there cause dear Lord",

First off, the one piece world is only three times bigger than our world. And our world, mind you, can only reach up to a magnitude of 9.5 in an earthquake. It is stated by professional scientists that it is impossible for the earthquakes to ever reach up to a magnitude of ten. Now, I'm not about to do the estimate for y'all. Y'all could do that yourself. the one piece world would not be able to reach up to a magnitude of 50, nor can Whitebeard ever get it up that high. Cause I want y'all to remember this. Whitebeard's ability is to create earthquakes. There is literally no statements of him being able to reach supernatural magnitudes and earthquakes. Now, like I said before, even if Whitebeard was to spam earthquakes, it would not destabilize the earth. And I'll tell you the little secret of why. Because if the earth was to destabilize, that means earthquakes would not be able to happen. Because earthquakes are basically mechanisms for the earth not to go boom. So all Whitebeard is doing is basically just causing that mechanism to occur rapidly. I also wanna say one more thing. People are gonna probably say, oh, well, the feat that Whitebeard showed is basically impossible in real life, science or physics. It's really Not every day that an earthquake occurs, small islands start to move. Which means earthquakes can cause islands to move. So how much you wanna bet, if someone could create earthquakes while being on said island, that they could pick up the small island, especially if tsunamis were to occur around it? I bet a lot of money that they could. Also, the one piece world is not as large as our son. Our son is 109 times bigger than our earth. Let's please stop saying that.",

So with some simple conversion,   ain't   gonna   do   shit   So   with   some   simple   conversion the outside of the microwave was giving him a total of   outside   of   the   microwave   was   giving   him   a   total   of 3 Watts per meter squared,   Watts   per   meter   squared while the airports were going down to a whopping   the   airports   were   going   down   to   a   whopping 0.8 Watts per meter squared.

    "voice_to_text": "What would it be like to be a four dimensional being? This will not go well. Being a three dimensional being means that everything around us is comprised of three dimensions. Length within height. So far so good. What would all of these things be like but from the perspective of a four dimensional being, which is time? So this is a great question, but unfortunately time has nothing to do with it. In relativity, time is one of four space time dimensions, but it's quite different from the other three. I'll explain in a minute. Four dimensional being would be able to see the evolution of that strand of hair over time and in a single instance, in a moment. So unfortunately this is just wrong. But it's an easy mistake to make if you just heard that time is the fourth dimension. The notion of time as a dimension comes from Einstein's relativity, both special and general. But in these descriptions of reality, time isn't just another dimension. It has a distinct character in a mathematically defined way. See, the way that we talk about space time is with a 4 by 4 array of numbers called the space time metric. Each of these columns or rows corresponds to one of the dimensions. And in particular, the three space dimensions have a positive signs and the time direction has a negative sign. This arrangement of signs is called the signature of the spacetime. Three pluses and one minus And this notion of signature generalizes. We say that positive signs correspond to spatial dimensions and negative signs correspond to temporal dimensions. So for studying the spatial geometry of a piece of paper, the signature is plus, plus. If we're studying the universe of flatlanders, the signatures plus, plus, minus. Importantly, the signature of a geometric space is fixed. It doesn't matter if you're living in that space or if you're viewing it from a higher dimension. You'll always see spatial dimensions of spatial and temporal dimensions as temporal. So for a 4D viewer, our time dimension would still be a time dimension. These 40 beings would therefore have four spatial dimensions and one time dimension, and our time dimensions would be the same. And so their signature would be plus, plus, plus, plus, minus. Now, you could possibly imagine that they have three spatial dimensions and two time dimensions. So their universe's signature would be plus, plus, plus, minus, minus. But even then, our time wouldn't stop behaving like time. That said, there's good reason to think that complex structures can't farm if there's more than one time dimension. So, no, a 40 being would look at us the same way we might watch a movie. We're watching something happen in two dimensions. But time is the same for them as it is for us.",

To be precise, the statement is that for any pseudo-Riemannian manifold, it's signature is preserved under diffeomorphisms.

    "view_count": 0,
    "voice_to_text": "so I just saw this video by Georgia in grad school where she's asking if academics like actually steal each other's ideas like is that something that actually happens and especially she's wondering this because like academia seems so collaborative and the whole point is to like build on each other's work and um we're supposed to all be working together right and yeah 1,000,000% it does happen um so she's doing a PhD in the humanities and I am in science so I thought I would talk a little bit about how it works here in science um I don't know if it's the exact same in the humanities but I do imagine it\u2019s something that happens so there's this concept called scooping and it can happen in two ways one is a lot more innocent than the other so research can often take years to publish there's work that I did um like 10 years ago that still has not been published and because it can take so long to publish and also because we're sort of all working off of other people's work it is fairly common that two labs will have the same idea around the same time and just one will publish before the other and so that's one method of scooping someone two labs independently had the same idea and just one publish before the other and that makes it incredibly difficult for the other one to publish and I've seen that happen to many of my friends and colleagues um it's just a rough thing that we have to deal with but no one's really like at fault here and while it does like really suck whenever it happens it's also at least a little bit validating that you were on the right track and you weren't the only one who like thought of it the most famous case of this happening is actually the theory of evolution so um Charles Darwin and a man named Alfred Russell Wallace both came up with the theory of evolution that we like think of today around the same time and people like to frame this as the other method of scooping that I'll talk about um because it's more dramatic but what actually happened is they came up with the idea around the same time they talk to each other realize that they were having the same idea and they actually ended up presenting the theory of evolution together but the first time that it was published it was published by Darwin and that's why we associate Darwin with the theory of evolution instead of Alfred Russell Wallace but in this case they were great friends and colleagues and they didn't like hold it against each other there wasn't like a massive rivalry here it's just something that organically happens sometimes the other method of scooping is you see someone else's research idea and you go actually that's gonna be my idea and then you steal it the way that I've seen this happen most commonly is when you're at conferences a lot of times you're presenting unpublished work and um sometimes people who are big names in the field will come by your poster and be like oh my god this is so interesting my lab does something really similar but not exactly the same as this and then like a year later they'll publish on exactly what you were presenting a fun thing that happened to me one time which is not necessarily scooping but it was incredibly annoying is uh I was constantly suggesting this thing to the faculty member because they were doing something wrong and they were it was it was such an obvious route that they should have gone down that they were like not doing and then whenever they finally did do it they gave me no credit and pretended like this was organically just a thing that they came up with now why do things like scooping and like stealing people's ideas happen whenever like science is supposed to be so collaborative it's because this concept of being so collaborative is actually fairly recent and this is part of why studying like the history of science is really important so way way way way way back in the day science was only for the wealthy elite who could go to school and like fund their own labs and their own research um and also only for like white men at least in Europe there was also research happening in other countries but I don't know as much about it and there were all of these like academic societies that these men could like be a part of that were essentially a bunch of men sitting around smoking and drinking together and talking about their theories that were just like wild ideas and so science like was not for the public and because these were a bunch of men with really big egos it also wasn't really for each other like they wanted to be the name that was attached to this thing so while they were like all talking to each other It it it they were essentially having like these giant \ud83c\udf46 measuring contest where like yeah they were talking to each other about their science but they were just trying to prove that their science was better than everyone else's and even as science became like more open to other people other people were able to go to college and start joining labs and doing research that attitude of um having your name attached to the research and like it being known as like your research really prevailed even to the modern day there are labs to this day that will on purpose train you incorrectly so that you can't like surpass them like if I were in one of those labs as a PhD student and I was assigned an undergrad I might train that undergrad incorrectly to make sure that that undergrad doesn't get into grad school and then surpass me I would never do that this is a hypothetical but also a very real thing that happens or there are labs that just straight up won't train you because their attitude is that if you can't figure it out on your own then you don't deserve to be here which is wild because none of us like figured out PCR on our own even the people who invented that they were working together and you'll still see labs at like conferences that only present published work and it's incredibly annoying because the whole point of the conference is to share your ideas with each other and get to know like what the up and coming research is like I said stuff that's been published was done like five six 10 years ago so like the point of the conference is to know what's going on right now um so it's really annoying when they do that but also it's to protect their information so that they don't get scooped so yeah the fact that we think of science as like a collaborative environment is really recent like last 30 years recent it's actually really interesting nowadays like sometimes whenever people interview for PhD uh positions they'll like ask how collaborative the environment is like what could they possibly be trained by a different professor if a different professor like knew a technique that they wanted to use for their project um and a lot of older faculty members are really like taken aback by that but that's something that people would care about so yeah um the TLDR is that science while we tend to think of it as collaborative today um it came from very snooty um private origins and of people really wanting to attach their name to a big thing and people with big egos and so um thinking of it as collaborative now is really modern and so there's still this attitude of wanting to be better than everyone else and so yeah people will absolutely steal each other's research",

When facing a strong chemical or any chemical that has warning labels on the container, you do not ever put your face directly over the opening of the container. Simply hold the bottle a few inches away from your face or set it down on your table. Then with a free hand, proceed to waft the fumes up towards your nose. I promise you, if it is a strong enough chemical, you will be absolutely more than able to smell the fumes it produces. You do not need to be putting your whole damn nose inside that container. Raw factory face holes do not belong there, and your glands most certainly be damaged like you almost did there. So, just as a quick review, if you are faced with a strong chemical or a chemical that has any warning label on its container, best just waft the fume. Never put it so close to your face. Waft? Damn! You're stuck your whole nose in that damn container.",

So I used to work with an FDA approved gene therapy called zulgenzma. And if you're not familiar with zulgenzma, it is a treatment. And it is the only treatment on the market currently for a genetic birds effect called spinal muscular atrophy. And spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, if left untreated, is fatal, usually before the age of five. Do you want to know how much sylgenesma costs? $2.1 million per treatment. Now, because Zilgensma is so fucking expensive, most insurance companies will not cover the cost. Um, they offer payment plans. And the company that makes it, strapped to therapeutics, also offers payment plans, but it is essentially the same thing as taking out alone. So then the parents of these patients, because they'll genes is intended for infants under the age of two. The parents of these patients are then faced with having to make the decision of either being in crippling debt for the rest of their lives, meaning they're ruining their credit, essentially making them unable to buy a car, buy a house, send their child to college, or they have to watch their child on a live, slowly and painfully in front of them. I will also say that zilgenzma is not the most expensive gene therapy on the market. There are currently two FDA approved gene therapy for hemophilia B, which is also usually Fatal without treatment. And they are priced at $3.5 million each. So that is one of the many reasons that I stopped working with viral vector gene therapies is because even though I'm so passionate about them, and I love virology and I love helping people, I cannot stand to know that I was contributing to parents having to make that decision and patients having to suffer. And I think that we really need to do something about this. I think that we really need to put some kind of legislature in place, because it's only gonna get worse from here.",

    "view_count": 0,
    "voice_to_text": "hi I'm the girl with the microphone as interesting as this sounds it's not possible for several reasons first of all um the nervous system is extremely complex um now with further time and a skilled surgeon's hand um in the next few hundred years maybe but I highly doubt it not with a machine like the whole image behind her no that's not how it would be done um a lot of people don't realize this but your spinal cord is actually a part of your brain it's attached to your brain stem and it attaches to all of your nerves not possible and once you sever that spinal cord completely especially from certain parts yeah no that brain's not coming back both bodies would just die also can we talk about the ethics of a full body or a head transplant you think some of us already have body dysmorphia that would be traumatizing absolutely not also brains die of old age there is no way to keep a brain alive infinitely brain cells die brains decay just as much as the rest of our body does as you get older your cells start reproducing slower and you age yeah that's why you get wrinkles on your face because that not only does that collagen get weaker but those cells on your skin are reproducing and replenishing themselves slower now I say all of this because I kind of got curious and one point because I had seen something about they were talking about trying to test on doing not whole head transplants but brain transplants and I was just reading up on it and I went down a huge rabbit hole and the biggest issue with all of this is that it's just not physically possible but I would like to get more into the ethics of this first of all if you transplant your brain or even your head onto someone else's body um you have to be a a a exact blood type match and I don't just mean into like what are your RH factors and your blood type there are more factors into people's blood than just there are each factor in what blood group they're in there are certain blood types that are missing certain proteins there are blood types that have other kinds of proteins that are not very common and if you do this and the organ or head is not an exact match the immune system in the body that it's transplanted into will kill it that that's yeah not only that um I don't think I would wanna walk around with my brain in someone else's body or even my head on someone else's body I have a hard enough time being comfortable enough to look at my own face in a mirror without makeup on or to look at my own body before I take a shower I just got out of a 26 year long stint with anorexia and I'm just now getting used to being almost 100 pounds again because every time I got to this weight I got so disgusted with myself that I relapsed back in you really think I want my head put on someone else's body I don't think so secondly the um image of that head transplanting machine has also been generated before to do a scaraganda on a new form of execution where they just grab the head and rip it off and call that more humane that's another reason why I know that this is all bogus I'm not saying you can't duet it and spread it around but people should probably know that no no they might actually be still testing and looking into the possibility of it but not the way they're displaying this because this is not a new subject that has been brought up in medical science especially since transplants first began the idea has been tossed around for a long time there have even been studies where doctors have transplanted heads of one dog onto another um both dogs ended up dying and they didn't switch the heads they just added a head to another dog so that dog effectively had two heads I don't know if you wanna see the photos of that but you can find them all over Google it didn't end well there were a lot of dead dogs like one of them I think lived for either a few hours or a few days but it was just torture so yeah no not not even remotely possible and also it's unethical like highly unethical just just so you know if you come across this video and it freaks you out it's not gonna happen in our lifetime and I honestly don't think it's a good idea to take one person's brain or head and put it into or on another person just like I don't think the idea of conscience switching is a good idea either but they've been looking into that and what is conscience with switching oh essentially you just switch your personality and conscious and memories with someone else without having to transplant the brain now that's also not possible I don't know why it's even an idea people been watching too many SCI fi movies that's my guess yes I know the filter is off of me that is because this is the two headed dog experiment I also found a picture of the two headed dog I thought I would actually share it with you guys I know I said I wasn't going to but surprise one moment here is the two headed dog they created that didn't live very long and probably had a miserable existence honestly this reminds me of this sorry if I made fans"

    "voice_to_text": "......... I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but unfortunately TikTok is pretty good at spreading misinformation regarding food safety and this little hack of storing avocados in water is a perfect example of that. If you're new to my page, if you've never seen my videos before, welcome! I'm a microbiologist and a medical laboratory scientist and I'm here stitching this video to pass on some really important food safety information so we can all be better protected from preventable disease like Listeria and Salmonella. This little kitchen hack of storing avocados in water in this way has gained a lot of traction recently thanks to it being shared on social media and people noticing that after they store their avocados fully immersed in water in this way they do stay green for longer. However, the color of the avocado fruit doesn't tell you if it is safe to eat in regards to bacterial contamination, the colour of the fruit will stay the same whether or not it's contaminated by those dangerous bacteria. So where do the bacteria come from? They're already on the avocado. It is very common to find Listeria but also Salmonella on the outside of the avocado, specifically within the root scar (that little indentation at the top of the avocado.) This root scar acts as a reservoir for bacteria, and because of its indentations, because of its irregularities, it can't be cleaned even if you are fully immersing the avocado in for example, a bleach solution. So then when we immerse the avocado in water, that moist environment allows those bacteria to infiltrate the fruit moving from the outside of the root scar into the pulp of the fruit. Like said, we can't tell by looking at the avocado if it's been contaminated we can't tell by a smell or by a taste these pathogens often don't cause spoilage. I know what you're thinking \"how do we actually know that happens though?\" science my friend! we have scientific evidence from a laboratory where scientists did this method, they immersed avocados in water and they found that these bacteria were able to infiltrate the fruit of the avocado because of the water because of that moist environment. So yes your avocados might not rot, might not spoil as fast, however they are now at a higher risk for bacterial contamination meaning that you are at a higher risk of contracting serious, painful, bacterial disease. I know in our society in our modern day culture we've kind of been conditioned to view food poisoning as no big deal \"it's just an upset stomach I'll be fine.\" we certainly shouldn't lose respect for the harm and the devastation that these organisms can cause. Listeria can lead to meningitis, while Salmonella can cause all kinds of things including arthritis, while repeated bouts of food poisoning in general lead to a higher risk of developing autoimmune disease. If you would like a safe way to store your avocados long term here's what you can do instead. You can peel the fruit of the avocado, chop it up or dice it up, whatever you prefer and then put it in your freezer, this way it can stay fresh and safe to eat for up to three months. Always take the food hacks, the kitchen hacks that you see on TikTok with a very large grain of salt, always double check to make sure the advice you are hearing is safe and that it won't make the food you are feeding yourself or your family dangerous to eat. Thank you for watching this video, thank you for staying to the end and I really really hope you learned something new"

    "voice_to_text": "    the same way you're supposed to be deciding truth throughout every era definitely for the large scale things like what does life mean and where do we come from and where are we going the Bible Holy Scripture 66 books we could debate if apocryphal writing should be included but you know starting with a 66 is pretty good uh then even for medium medium scale things stick with God's word I'm thinking James 1 5 if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask god who gives generously to all without approach and it will be given him yeah and he's he's generous if you ask him and if you're not like actively hating god he'll he will give you wisdom and even for the small scale things I mean you building yourself off of foundation of of biblical values like I mean the really hardcore basics of confessing your sin loving your neighbour as yourself boom when you start to structure your life around those things truth gets a little easier to intuit now if it comes to very specific things like you know when was earth created you know was it a million years ago or only tens of thousands of years ago that's a debate and like it almost a trivial debate the truth itself is so valuable but it's applicability here and now with that particular item that I mentioned as an example uh you know it's like uh whatever move on with life you move on with life you pick something um one of the great tools that comes into the small scale items like the age of the planet or other such questions is the scientific method the problem with the scientific method is most people think they're practicing science and really they're just practicing whatever media told them but the true scientific method if you're gonna be a diligent citizen and search for truth as best as you can in some sort of applicable way is the scientific method that starts with asking a question that is step one there are couple different formats to describe the scientific method in an applicable way but the format I start with the format I recommend is step 1 ask a question step 2 background research you're just checking out what like what is he out there then step 3 you can form hypothesis now hypothesis not a conclusion hypothesis is your your educated guess that you are about to pursue and dismantle and establish brilliant step 3 step 4 is construct an experimental procedure where you say huh how am I even gonna figure out these things how am I gonna pursue my hypothesis how am I gonna test it possibly disprove it or even support it step 5 is collect and analyse data so you had your experimental procedure that says you know what how am I gonna even do this thing how am I even gonna explore this thing and then you actually go and do it and you collect data and analyze it you're not just saying ah I have some data now and my hypothesis is true you collect some data say you test it against your hypothesis and say hmm do these guys line up does this work out do these do you know do do my data line up with each other I tried this experiment you know a thousand times and each time it was different that's a bad sign time to fix your experiment or procedure or if your experiment was very close or identical a thousand times in a row that's a good sign record it at the very end you can draw a conclusion if you have enough data pointing in the same direction and if you don't you modify previous steps in the scientific method so quick recap for the largest scale things like the meaning of the universe freaking Bible for the medium scale things about like you know what what value should I use to build my life freaking Bible again specifically wisdom literature based in Proverbs and then for the smaller scale stuff it hinges off of your core values that should be rooted in the Bible but a great tool if you're using it humbly and and and sincerely is the scientific method I hope that helps",

    "voice_to_text": "Gravity is supposed to be the greater the mass is, the greater the attractor. This will not go well. You take a balloon, you rub it on your leg, you put it over the ground. Watch the dust particles jump off the ground off this big mask, off the earth, and jump onto that balloon. This is an example of static electricity. When you rub a balloon in your clothes, the friction moves some of the electrons from the fiber in your clothes to the balloon, giving it a negative charge. When you then place the balloon near dust, that negative charge polarizes the dust so that the positive side of the dust is slightly closer to the balloon than the negative side. This results in a small attraction that causes the dust to jump. Because why? Electricity is a hundred and thirty seven times stronger than the pool of gravity or the effects of the so called gravity. Now, if you're not already attuned to physics, this sounds like it could be plausible. But what's evident to me is that he read something he didn't understand that involved the No. 137 and then included it in his made up world. Because electromagnetism isn't 137 times stronger than gravity. It's 137 times weaker than the strong nuclear force. In fact, it's roughly a trillion, trillion, trillion times stronger than gravity. Which is why a lone balloon can pick up dust held down by the entire earth. Hmm. It's the electric Force. That's the attractive force. It's the electric force that tightens everything together. As the masculine end is. The electric force can absolutely be attractive. However, it can also be repulsive. You know, the whole like charges repel opposite to tract. That's the electric force. Also. What's up with the masculine thing? And then the dividing force is the radiated force, the magnetic field. It ablates and pushes everything out again. Magnetic forces can be both attractive and repulsive. Think of what happens when the North Pole of a magnet meets the south pole of a magnet. Or when a magnet meets a lump of iron. They get stuck together. That's magnetism, not the electric force. And then they collect together again. But where these things meet? At the proper angles of incidence. Where what things meet? Terry, the electric and magnetic fields exist everywhere. Which means that you can measure the angle between them at any location. And in general, they can have any angle. No special angle of incidence required. Those angles of incidences at 120 degrees. When it converts it back into electricity. And it will keep collecting and coming and making life. What? And like people say, well, what business do you have coming in here talking about science and all that? You're an actor. You don't stay in your lane for the rest of you. Enjoy the next few days of Terry debunks.",

    "voice_to_text": "They found an ocean underneath the Earth's crust. This will not go well. This new ocean is the largest ocean on the planet. Not sure how many times I have to debunk this, but here it goes. So this is what she's talking about. And right off the bat, this isn't news. It's from about 10 years ago. It just started making rounds again for whatever reason. But more importantly, it's not an ocean. This is the paper in question. What they found was evidence for tons of hydrous ringwoodite. Now, ringwoodite is a mineral that can contain the pieces of water. It can absorb hydrogen, and it can replace magnesium ion and two oxide ions with hydroxide ion. So, in some sense, the components of water can be found in Ringwood Light, but there's no actual chemical H2O, in the minerals, and that means no water. We also discovered that there's a super massive black hole pointed directly at the earth. It's also spitting energy at us. This isn't that unusual, and it's not dangerous at all. In fact, if they're not pointing at or nearly at us, it can be hard to see them, because, you know, they're black holes. In fact, here's two examples discovered just in 2,023. Noteworthy for science reasons, but it won't affect regular people at all. The energy coming from these supermassic black holes is a million times weaker than the sun gives off. Is also a giant hole in the sun. So She's referring to the Corona hole that made the news a few months back. And despite the name, it's not a hole. It's just a cooler area of the sun's atmosphere, which makes it appear darker in the ultraviolet and X ray parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. They're not too rare, and they correlate pretty strongly with solar cycle. Neat, but again, not a big deal. We also found a continent on earth that has been missing for 375 years. It's called Zelandia. And, yes, there are people there. This is a weird one because it wasn't missing. Europeans had a weird vibe that there should be another continent in the southern hemisphere. But just because it turned out that there was another continent doesn't mean that it was known about and then lost. Anyway, this isn't some secret landmass that the man has been hiding from you. And no shit, people live there. This new continent is literally New Zealand and some surrounding islands. What makes it a continent is that there's a distinct type of crust that surrounds these islands called continental crust. The only trouble is that it's underwater, which is why it wasn't considered a continent before. The idea is that during the breakup of a super continent known as Gondwana, the crust thinned out, lowering it into the sea. Overall, she didn't really say anything hugely wrong. She just left out a lot of useful context to make her content seem more mysterious. So be kind But stern",

So OMZ law basically states that if you have current flowing through a resistor, the voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to the current through that resistor. And the ratio between the voltage and the current is called the resistance. My opinion, this is really intuitive, because resistors resist or oppose current flow, which means that the larger the resistance, the lower the current for the same voltage.

Well, if you'd like to be a forensic scientist, you're gonna need a science degree. So it's gonna be a biology, chemistry, microbiology, something like that. And those disciplines would be like the DNA unit, toxicology, controlled substances, stuff like that. Um, for investigation positions, you're going to need a criminal justice degree or criminal investigation degree. Actually, there are a whole bunch of degrees that are utilized in the investigation side of forensics. And those positions would be like, the crime scene unit, detective, police officer, homicide detective, forensic analyst, crime analyst, forensic interviewer. There's so many positions, and it's such a vast field. So I'm wishing you good luck. You're gonna do great, and I'm very proud of you.",

But you don't know if you can be a primary advocate for a family. I have a family for you. The Abbas family, a family of 14 who was located in Rafah but had to flee to the new Sri Lanka refugee camp. But they are not safe there. They have no shelter. They don't even have a tent. And a building directly next to where they were was bombed yesterday by Israeli forces while it was filled with families, killing multiple of them. The children in this family are dealing with malnutrition and fighting off infections with no medication. The father of this family is dealing with untreated bladder cancer and has been slipping into comas. Here's his medical record. Here is a picture of him. And other members of this family have been dealing with broken bones and had operations with no access to pain medication, including having rods inserted into their legs. Families 14 is trying to evacuate into Cairo and that cost an astronomical amount of money. The goal for their gofundme is 100,000 euros, and we are currently at 58,000 euros. For a breakdown on how this process works and why it cost an astronomical amount of money, watch this video. It's a fantastic breakdown and it really puts things into perspective. I will tag the creator below, but if you are Trying to get involved and helping a family reach their goal. A goal that may seem astronomical, but is very much doable with the power of community. Abra's family would love your support, and if you do make a video about them, please include their gofundme link in your bio so it makes it as easy as possible for people to find where to donate.",

    "voice_to_text": "\"should I do a candida cleanse or parasite cleanse? here's what you need to know.\" I can answer that one! NO! ....that was fun  if you've never seen my videos before, welcome! I'm a microbiologist and a medical laboratory scientist  so I am also very invested in protecting you from parasites more specifically the ones that are interested in the contents of your wallet. oops said the quiet part out loud there didn't I? so here's what you actually need to know about these purported \"cleanses\" that the people marketing them probably aren't telling you. these supplements have never undergone randomized, controlled, clinical trials (which is what we use to test pharmaceutical medication) demonstrating that they work. I know, bare minimum. I don't know about you but me personally before I put any supplement, any medication into my body I need to know that it works first. and here's what you need to know about Candida: Candida is a fungus and it's a normal constituent of the human microbiome it lives in our mouth but it also lives in other parts of our digestive system like the colon. for this reason most people who undergo these screening tests for \"Candida overgrowth\" will have a positive result. does this mean you have an infection? NO. Candida can be pathogenic, meaning it can cause infections, one example is oral thrush but it can also cause infections on the skin. however \"Candida overgrowth\" or the idea that systemically Candida can be building up and causing these vague, over-applicable symptoms like hair loss, bloating and depression is quackery \ud83e\udd86 \ud83e\udd86 this is used to sell supplements to people that they don't actually need. if you have a systemic overgrowth of Candida, if you have a systemic infection with this fungus you are in the hospital in the ICU, fighting for your life not dealing with vague symptoms like hair loss depression and insomnia people who tout these supplements use over-applicable vague, symptoms that anyone can relate to because it makes it more likely for them to get their check \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 so what about parasites? there are a huge variety of parasites (notice how these people are never specific that's a red flag)  These parasites can be acquired through food or through unclean drinking water, while others can be acquired by walking barefoot on contaminated soil, and others can be acquired by interacting physically with animal or with human waste. depending on the parasite, depending on how you were exposed and depending on the point of its life cycle it can be in your skin it can be in your lungs or it can be in your digestive system. how do these supplements differentiate between where the parasite is? THEY DON'T!! remember: like I mentioned earlier these supplements have never been demonstrated clinically to work, bare minimum. what these supplements actually do is cause intense gastrointestinal inflammation which can create \u2728artifact\u2728 that is left behind in the toilet, this gives the illusion and the confirmation that something happened and it removed something from my body even when the thing is quite literally the lining of your gastrointestinal system. We even have peer-reviewed scientific literature noting how these supplements are designed this way to cause this clumping to give the illusion that something happened. this is where I once again ask: where's the scientific literature demonstrating that these supplements work? you won't find any! but let me finish with a simple question: there are indeed parts of the world that deal with endemic, parasitic infections (endemic means the parasite is to some level always present within the population) you've probably heard people reference how certain parts of the world undergo yearly (if not more often) parasitic \"cleanses\" because these parasites are so common. in these parts of the world that deal with these endemic infections they aren't using parasite cleanses from TikTok Shop or various other social media platforms. they are using pharmaceutical medications that have undergone randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating that they work. if the areas that are constantly dealing with these gastrointestinal parasites are using pharmaceutical medications and not random supplements why aren't you? if these \u2728gut health\u2728 girlies legitimately want to help people, if they legitimately want to help you address your concerns if you are scared that you have a parasitic infection why don't they instruct you to talk to your doctor about albendazole? why don't they tell you that mebendazole and pyrantel are antiparasitic medications that are available over the counter without a prescription that have been demonstrated clinically to work? it's because they can't make money off of it, so they tell you that you need to take a supplement instead. hey what do I know? I'm just a microbiologist I'm just an MLS that has physically interacted with some of these organisms in a clinical laboratory. I'm positive that the former personal trainer and former gymnastics coach knows so much more. thank you for watching this video thank you for staying to the end and please be cautious and careful before putting random, unregulated untested supplements into your body just because a tiktoker \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11 told you it's what you need."

    "voice_to_text": "Children are going to look at me, and I'm gonna have to say, yeah, Mommy's actually older than AI. No, you're not. You see, AI is actually kind of old. It was first coined in 1956. And this isn't just some arbitrary AI. This is actual AI. I think the sense from people not knowing what AI actually is, and they see Chachi PT as what AI is, but that's not actually true. AI is just problem solving from machines. That's it. In Dartmouth College did this in 1956, if you wanna get technical, the first NOR networks were made in 1943. And later on, she references her parents not growing up with the internet, which, again, just isn't true. Unless your parents are old. If they're older than 1983, then they might have not grown up with the internet. Internet was hitting public libraries by the late 90s. So, yeah, you're not older than AI. And your parents definitely grew up with the internet. Unless they're pretty old."

Cela \u00e9tant, euh, c'est 1 excellente question, quel est le r\u00f4le du moustique ? Et quel est le r\u00f4le de la m\u00e9duse dans la cha\u00eene alimentaire ? Le moustique, sa larve, va avoir 1 \u00e9norme r\u00f4le puisque beaucoup de poissons vont se nourrir de leur larve et euh, aussi des larves telles que les larves de libellule ou les larves de col\u00e9opt\u00e8re, euh, qui sont aquatiques hein, vont se nourrir aussi de ces larves de moustiques. Ensuite, ils ont 1/2 r\u00f4le, \u00e7a va \u00eatre 1 r\u00f4le de vecteur de maladie. Alors pour la sant\u00e9 humaine, c'est pas dingue, mais par contre pour ces parasites, c'est parfait. Je parle l\u00e0 de shikungugunya, de malaria et cetera. Et par vecteur de ces maladies, ils sont aussi des r\u00e9gulateurs des esp\u00e8ces et notamment de l'esp\u00e8ce humaine. Bah oui, n'oubliez pas, s'il y avait pas d'intervention de la m\u00e9decine, le moustique ferait des dizaines de 1.000.000 morts par an, et la m\u00e9duse, c'est 1 petit peu la m\u00eame chose. Son r\u00f4le, \u00e7a va \u00eatre de se faire manger par les tortues, par les requins, et aussi de r\u00e9guler certaines esp\u00e8ces de poissons, certaines esp\u00e8ces de plantes. Parce que n'oublions pas que les m\u00e9duses, ce sont des pr\u00e9dateurs.",

    "voice_to_text": "The lights being visible in America wasn't bigger news, but we made such a big deal out of the solar. So I prefer to get answer to this question because I've actually contributed to the problem. And the problem is that the Aurora borealis and Aurora Australia, just so finicky and so hard to forecast that even if you're looking at the Aurora forecast that is released by government agencies, um, up to days in advance, it's usually not accurate until a few hours before the possible displays begin. So you could look up right now and see that four days from now, there is a possibility of Aurora displays taking place. But because of how these events work, like we're talking about coronal mass ejections coming out of the sun that have to interact with the Earth's upper atmosphere in a very particular angle and way in order to generate a rural displays. That is just something that is so hard to predict that usually if it does show that there's a chance of an Aurora, that chance will just drop to zero right before the event begins. Last night, we happened to see the strongest geomagnetic storm in 20 years. And so the Aurora displays were visible in many places around the world that usually do not see this. But it wasn't something that scientists were, like, super confident about until a few hours beforehand. And so there was some media coverage beforehand telling people like, hey, it's Possible. You may be able to see this, but you didn't really see the media coverage crank up until we started seeing the oral displays absolutely going bad shit crazy in Europe, North Africa, India. Just places that are not used to seeing this type of bright, colorful Aurora displays. And so some people were able to see that, but a lot of people were just like, I'm going to bed, and then found out about when they wake up. But with the solar eclipse, that's something we know about, like, hundreds of years in advance. You can look up a map of solar eclipses, exactly where they're going to take place at what time of day in the next 500 years. That's how accessible that information is. So I used to make videos talking about how the Aurora is going to take place in three days. Like, clear your calendar, whatever. But that's before I realized that, like, these types of events are not predictable. Like, you literally cannot predict this. Like, we are lucky that we had a couple hours notice of this event taking place last night."

    "voice_to_text": "so for me see I grew up uh in an Irish Catholic family um my dad's family they were Lutheran uh which is like I believe a subsect of Protestant so um and it wasn't like we wasn't like ...they were Easter and Christmas Christians if you if you get that term um it wasn't like it pervaded our whole lives but it was always just kind of this thing that was you know always kind of there this omnipresent haha but it was only because of what people said that made it omnipresent um so in middle school um you know this is the dawn of the internet um this is like the the early to mid 90s um the dawn of the internet and and we had to do like a lot of current event reports from social studies class so I was reading the paper a lot you know and looking for news stories that I could do my like little weekly summaries and writeups on and read one news story about a child that their own parent can't remember if it was a boy or girl but this child had essentially been locked in a room beaten by their parents starved um burned tortured in various ways um this kid never had a good life never had like joy or anything it's not like this just happened at this was literally how they treated this kid its entire life um and the kid finally like you know starve to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 passed in a puddle and of its own Gore and and f-ing festering body and sores and that's when even in middle school as a middle schoolers at 12 13 year old I began to essentially independently form the epicurian question in my own head it wasn't as concise but I just kind of understood the concept of it but um if you're unfamiliar with the epicurian question it's essentially a Greek philosopher you know asked is god able to prevent evil from happening but unwilling well that makes him malevolent you know cause if you can stop something and you don't then you're an ash hole for not doing it um is he willing but enable in other words does god want to stop evil things from happening but he can't for whatever reason well then he's not all powerful and is he both willing and able can he do it and does he want to do it then how come bad stuffs happening because you guarantee or something bad was happening in front of me that I could stop and I had the ability to stop I'd fighting stop it right and then the final question is is he unwilling and unable then why call him god and that the basics kind of concept of that formed in my little middle schooler head and you know that's why I started questioning it and the only response you ever get is that god gave us free will so these things need to happen because it's what you know tests us our faith and dah dah dah dah and it's like no that's faithfully manure the reason is faithful manure is because I don't care who the faith you are if you wouldn't stop a child from being beaten to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 you know SA to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 because that's f-ing happening still from starving to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 by their own parents by being tortured to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 if you wouldn't stop that I don't... faith you like honestly faith you and that's that's why I came up with this like little throw away line I I'll use is that there is no god in any heaven as long as a child suffers yeah people are sapiens  bad things happen and may there might never ever be an end to it but to claim that it's because in all powerful all capable being needs to let it happen so we get tested and understand no that's that's a load of faithful doody and if you actually honestly believe that then you're just kind of a horrible faithful person that doesn't mind children starving to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 in my opinion you would probably watch you probably watch it faithing happen and think this needs to happen because it's the only way some of us get to go to false a promise of heaven it was about the same faithless time that I finally realized that atheists are actually more moral than people that have any type of faith structure in dogma and the reason for that is for example you have two kids you tell one of those kids hey I will buy you an entire fructose bag of candy for yourself if you do this good thing but and don't do this bad thing and you get this bag of fructose candy and then you have a second kid that does the good thing and doesn't do the bad thing without being told that there's a bag of candy in it or any type of punishment which one of those kids had better motivation the one that you're promising candy to or threatening with like you know grounding or any type of corporal punishment are they doing the good thing because it's good to do or they doing the good thing because they're hoping for the reward and avoiding the bad thing because they don't wanna get the punishment see the kid that didn't know about the reward or the punishment they're just doing the good thing because it's a good thing to do and they're avoiding the bad thing because it's a bad thing to do simple as that so when an atheist does a good thing they're just doing it because they want to better their fellow man animal what the fudgr ever have you they wanna do put good into the world and they want to avoid doing bad in the world and that's just their personal motivation they have no reason to do it other than for goodness sakes but if a religious person is a good thing are they doing it because they want to do the good thing or are they doing it because oh no I can't go to hell I need to get to heaven I need to get to heaven so let me do the good thing well that's a selfish motivation so they're not really doing it for any moral reason they're doing it out of self interest self preservation it's a survival instinct at that and that's not really morality that's just survival so yeah if an intelligent designer that's all powerful exist and children suffer then he's a fallacy doo doo head or quite simply he doesn't exist and people that don't believe in a punishment or reward after death are more moral than those that might be doing it out of fear or hope",

I feel I have a large database of my own research because I've had to research and wanted to... and my own experiences seeing how I've developed and have gone through more character development than any of the biggest hero to vilian arcs ever and also being self aware enough to know that it ain't stopping anytime soon.

    "voice_to_text": "You see how earth and, like, human beings have, like, such mystical, weird lure? See, I could break this down in a hundred different ways, but i'mma first start talking about how human anatomy and quantum physics just explain some ridiculous stuff that history has shown us time and time again is real. So everybody know the basis of how we are made. We have atoms, and inside these atoms are your information or your code. This holds your protons, your electrons, your DNA, etc, etc. The fan has atoms with a certain type of code. I have atoms with a certain type of code. Now, what makes humans different is our atoms can split up and make copies of itself. Okay? This explains why we can have kids, explains why we can heal ourselves. Like, if I get a scratch on my skin, my skin will reproduce itself to heal itself. 1. The fact that the atom can split and make copies is crazy because you've been doing that for hundreds of thousands of years. Your atoms, your ancestors, your DNA has been here hundreds of thousands of years in the past and probably will still be here. Especially if you have kids and grandkids will be here hundreds of thousands of years in the future, cause all your atoms in your DNA is doing is copying and pasting itself. 2. What's also crazy is just because it copied and paste itself does not mean it does not communicate. With each other. Your atom still communicates with each other through energy. 1 this. How does that not just explain interdimensional travel or time travel or, you know, consciousness being transferred? How? That explains a lot. Ancient Egypt says all this stuff is possible. Your DNA, your atoms are in the past, communicating with you right now and communicating with the future. Your atoms copied itself is right here and put itself right here. And then also put itself right here. And the energy that's in between these atoms is communicating with each other constantly. And that's just on a small scale of us as a human. This one form of consciousness. We know consciousness lives in everything. Cats, dogs, the planet. Except so what if Planet Earth decided, you know what? I feel like it's time for me to heal. Let me copy and paste myself into a different time or a different dimension or different zone. Not only that, but I still wanna communicate with myself while I'm in this timeline and also in a different timeline or even the universe. There are multiple universes. We all know this. What if there's exact copy of our universe that decided to just copy and paste itself and is still communicating with us, and still the energy from that universe is traveling here? This is where we get the ideas of dimensional travel or time traveling. Even ancient Egypt was looking at the stars and communicating with beings that aren't From their realm. And we over here arguing about Kendrick and Drake. Drake. The history about ancient civilizations is so mystical and luring because it seems SCI fi, but when you really look at it, these. These people were just using the information that we have today. They using the technology that we have today. We're just arguing about Drake.",

So apparently I needed to also add that this app has just destroyed a lot of people's basic comprehension skills and ability to pick up on implied context. If you didn't see it yesterday, I posted a little mini rants about the number of people leaving comments on my videos lately to argue that dinosaurs aren't real because they're actually dragons. Which is just insane. And some of the comments I've gotten on that video are just mind boggle. I had this one person leave a comment going um, are you gonna actually leave real facts? Like this isn't the critical thinking slam dunk you think it is because there are real dragons. Okay? Komodo dragons are one girl. I know about Komodo dragons. It is obvious from context that I am not talking about them, that I am talking about the make believe fairy tale monsters, not the big lizard named after them. There was another guy who left to comment and going define real. Like come on, you cannot be that dense. How? My recent video where where I talked about how we know that dinosaurs didn't stand like this. Uh. That. That they stood like this. I've gotten tons of comments from people going oh, so they walked on all four? It's like, no, no, I never said that. And I had myself in front of this diagram of A Dinosaur on two legs what's front legs are clearly too short to walk on. Like, I shouldn't need to spell it out because it should have been very obviously implied. Don't get me wrong, I love TikTok. I love making content here. I'm still just thrilled that there are so many people who want to hear what I have to say about these topics I love. But oh my god, it is so exhausting sometimes to have to play 5D chess to try to anticipate every insane way that someone will misinterpret my videos and then have comments from that are just like, so out of left field. I could not have possibly predicted them. Now I promise this will be the last rant for a while. We'll get back to our regularly scheduled content. But oh my god, some of y'all need to really, like, actually exercise your brains a bit.",

    "voice_to_text": "funny enough I woke up this morning with an email from one of the three Noble Prize winners from 2022, because the work I do is not only about these particles is actually about how we can use this very real continental particles to have very real applications in the very very real world belief so give me a couple of minutes or so and I tell you what is the misunderstanding here and why some of these headlines and the way we praise the stuff is misleading and results in a video like this that the lady like this would think that the universe is not real and even worse it depends on us and when we look at it things change non local reality is a various transport but has nothing to do directly with reality so locality is an axiom like anything else physics is based on a lot of things that we cannot prove it but it sounds very logical so it becames the foundation and the basis on which we build a lot of other assumptions and hypothesis and the theories and laws eventually one action is that we live in a local universe things only affect immediate things around them for example if you spray a perfume in your room not suddenly the entire room is gonna smell like perfume it's gonna take a little bit of time because the molecules of the perfume is gonna hit the air molecules and keep spreading around until it get to you the same way with everything like sun the light takes eight minutes to get to us so if the sun right now disappears not suddenly we gonna see that it's gonna take us eight minutes before we see that the sun is gone yeah so locality made a lot of sense as an axiom because it's very very compatible with pretty much everything that we see in this world up until quantum entanglement quantum entanglement is one of the only exceptions in which the word we understand as being local doesn't really apply and doesn't work that axiom doesn't work and we cannot use it to explain quantum entanglement and quantum entanglement is like flipping a coin imagine you have two coins and you keep flipping them and while these coins are flipping you have no idea whether it's zero it's gonna be head or tail until it hits the table and very intuitively you should always assume that whether the first coin is gonna hit the table whether it's gonna be head or tail is not gonna have any effect on the other coin but that's not the reality of entanglement with entanglement it's like flipping two coins every time one of them is head the other one is gonna hit the table and it's a tail or vice versa it doesn't matter when which one happens and no matter how fast you do this how almost exactly at the same time they hit the table they end up being correlated to each other and the weird part is that if you keep separate in these coins from each other put one of them on earth the other one on Jupiter or moon Jupiter wasn't a good example is a gases planet moon still doesn't matter the moment one of them is hurt the other one becomes the opposite they are correlated to each other in a way that it defies locality the way we understand it it does not mean the reality is not real the reality is very very real and more importantly has nothing to do with you and I observation even though the word observe be usually use it for us it's not about us observation is a general word used in physics means any interaction that the table is observing for the coin when the coin hits the table that's when the observation happens if you close your eyes it's not gonna change it if you think the universe is not real and if you think you play any role in that whatsoever grab a T-shirt if you have a black T-shirt sit there and just spend the rest of your life imagine that is blue let's see if it turns blue yeah or with the corn or with anything so the universe is always real it has nothing to do with what whether you're observing it or not this entanglement is happening all around the universe whether we are there or not this observations are happening everywhere but but it's a very strange and very fun thing about the universe that we discovered the past hundred years or so and we can now definitely prove that it is true it is an exemptions to locality uh we don't need this doesn't mean locality is a bad axiom because it does work a lot of places axioms do not need to work everywhere but of course we are very still interested to understand how this is working what is this connection between this particles and hopefully one day we don't understand but the answer is not gonna be us I'm sorry to break it to you we don't play a role in this universe this universe has been going on for billions and billions of years before us and it's gonna go on for billions and billion years after us yeah we didn't play a role in any of these things to come up so it's good not to be full of ourselves",

This is yet another great explanation of food science, Babe. Breaking down the math here around calculating those numbers. And if this is kind of your introduction to P Foss, I can understand it might be a little too much math for you to handle. Certainly it is for me. So to pull it back a little bit, one thing I. You should keep in mind when we're talking about detecting P Foss in beverages, or really in anything, is that pifos is in everything. It's so common and ubiquitous that if you test for it, you're gonna find it at some level. And that's really part of the. The huge challenge that Pifos presents for us. It's everywhere. It's in everything. Like, let's say you create some kind of miracle drink that has no pifos in it, zero pfoss. You put it in a plastic container, the plastic is now leaching pfoss into your drink, and you're back at square one. That's the challenge we face."

    "voice_to_text": "Alright so de-extinction's back in the news I'm gonna talk about it because I've had to do a bit of this during uni um and it's some tech bro bullshit usually. Now I'm not saying that what this guy is doing is bad or anything like that it has a lot of really cool applications and just for context what he's what him and the group he's working with  are kind of trying to do is bring back the thylacine by using their closest relatives which is a small marsupial called a Dunnart, they found in central Australia and using their genetic make up basically to patch in the gaps in the genetic material we have for thylacines in order to create viable embryos we could then potentially implant into a surrogate and then bring the thylacine back, which sounds cool right and it is, it is cool, it's it's a cool thing to do it's just it's nothing like Jurassic Park it is unbelievably more complicated like you need to have both a lot of viable genetic material for your animals case and point we will just realistically will never be able to bring back the dodo because we don't have enough *stuff* (Viable DNA) of dodo around  to create enough of a genetic blueprint to bring them back. Even mammoths are difficult as hell because DNA degrades way faster than people believe, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't sequence a genome if you have enough samples of DNA it just means that you don't have enough to create an actual animal out of it basically but the thing with the extinction is it's it sounds cool it keeps popping up in the news there's a reason 60 Minutes is doing that interview but it's also expensive and time consuming as all goddamn hell like they were talking about how the backers of this program include Leonardo DiCaprio and the CIA like they're doing it with CIA money it's not a small amount of money that's been thrown at this so a lot of conservationists look at this and they have a couple of problems with it first and foremost being why are we spending millions of dollars on the chance to maybe bring back one of the species when we could instead I don't know buy 200,000 acres of Amazon rainforest from being destroyed like there's there's better ways to spend the money than giving a bunch of funky scientists the free rein to maybe bring back I don't know half of a Mammoth. The other thing is little bit less so with the thylacine because they didn't only died out in the 30s um whereas other animals they've *sequenced* options for the extinction include the Mammoth it's like where do you put them Like congratulations we spent $100 million to bring back one thylacine that's not enough to save the species that's not enough to bring back the species they're not the species because they're not thylacines they've got like 40-30% Dunnart DNA instead and all of that money could have been put to I don't know stopping the Great Barrier Reef from disappearing. And the other thing that pisses off a lot of conservationists  about de-extinction is it creates this notion that animals can come back they can't if something's gone it's gone unless we have a Time Machine or this technology suddenly jumps 50 years in front they're gone forever we need to be stopping extinction before it happens and that's not even getting into how if we did bring back one of the animals we've still only got one and you can't create a viable population with that so now your millions of dollars out of pocket so that you can watch an animal go extinct again  this is actually happened before I\u2019ll do a video on that because we brought one species back from extinction it's also the only species to go extinct twice so it didn't work out but that's a whole other video so yeah so yeah it's a it's a cool thing to see pop up on like the news and social media sites when this sort of thing happens but it's not it's not a solution it's something that people can say hey look at this cool thing we're doing if you wanna save animals the easiest way to do it is to talk to people who work with those animals and find out what they need it's it's boring but it's more effective than trying to clone a fuckin Mammoth.",
