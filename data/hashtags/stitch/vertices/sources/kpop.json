So instead of sitting here and bitching and moaning about it, maybe go drop out. Maybe go find something else to do with your life.

    "voice_to_text": "I am actually convinced that Kpop companies are doing this on purpose. Let me explain. So the main reason why they get trainee so young, it's not because, like, younger people are better at the arts. God knows that's not true, but instead, like, they're easier to manipulate to, to make malleable, to make into whatever product that the company wants these kids to be. And a lot of the kids that were trainees in for first and second gen were legitimately really talented kids who grew up to be really talented adults that could expand themselves beyond just being known as like, a K pop idol and an idol group. They started producing and writing. And with talent comes power. It is much easier to manipulate someone when they know that they're mediocre, when you're constantly reminding them that they can't sing well, they can't dance well, and the company has the burden of hiding from the public that they can't actually sing well, they can't actually dance well, and that they can be replaced with another girl that's a blank slate. That can get the surgeries, that can get the skin whitening, that can put on the Gucci in the Chanel and do the same exact thing that you're doing at that time. You are far more easily replaceable when you do not have a unique or extraordinary or even just basic talent. That is not shade. I think that some of the kids that are currently in Kpop had a lot of potential. And I also think that a lot of the training, even back in the day, but especially now, is more about breaking you so that you're convinced that you have to do whatever the grown folk around you are telling you to do. I don't think that K pop is actually training kids anymore to be able to sing and dance on stage. I think it's purely about breaking the kids. It was about breaking the kids this entire time, but now it's not even like, oh, we have to at least have two or three members that can sing really well, or two or three members that can dance really well and advertise how talented they are at this particular skill. And they all have their roles. They saw how SM kept saying that Taemin couldn't sing. Now Taemin is one of the best selling artist solo artist for SM Entertainment to the point that he was able to leave. He didn't need SM anymore. And I really think that is what these Kpop companies are fearful of. These idols having the power through their talents to just leave and not have to listen to everything that they say. But that is my conspiracy theory.",

Why am I seeing these clips torn apart on Twitter and on TikTok by people who usually do not care about that group? And the people in the comments of Disney's video pissed me off so bad, too, because, like, this whole argument of, like, but they're singers. It's their job. Like, this is the bare minimum. And it's just like, you could be the best fucking singer on this planet earth if you just wanna have fun, if you just wanna be goofy, like, be fucking goofy. It should not matter. It should not matter. And then people wanna talk about, like, idols, mental health. They wanna talk about all the pressure on these, like, young idols, and everybody is debuting so young these days. We will have that discussion, and then, like, you will grow, and the next thing will be, like, a group that is newly debuted just being torn apart because of their own core, because of them having fun and Like, you can already tell the impact it has on these idols, with them legitimately being scared, like, it's gonna happen, that people no longer want to win because they will be afraid of the encore and what's gonna happen. And it's just like, but they shouldn't be afraid. This is their job, their singers. And it's just like, yeah, but you're not fucking making this fun.

It probably isn't, because, again, I wasn't around when this was happening, so I haven't seen the discourse on it. Yes, it's completely commendable what the staff was willing to do, um, risking themselves like that, but that shouldn't have been necessary. I don't care how big this award show was. To be honest, I don't know which one it was. If it was, eh, one of the smaller ones. So if it was Mama or what it was. I don't care how big it is. If staff see that the stage is literally about to collapse to the point where they're calling staff over to hold the stage up, you're gonna, like, call someone in and get that performance stopped. Get them off the stage. I don't care who it is. Um, this is not something I'm saying just because it's BTS. I don't care which artist was on stage. If the stage is collapsing, and especially when you know a performance of that scale is gonna be taking place, you call that shit off. I don't care how big the award show is. I don't care how much money you've spent on it. It's not worth risking the lives of the artist, the dancers, and the staff, if not the other artists. In the wings watching this, because you can see that the stands are shaking as well. This should have never happened. Yes. It's like, I completely commend the staff for being willing to put themselves at risk like that, but that shouldn't have been necessary. Like, in what world was that necessary? That it is money and getting. Getting the views for. For the show really more important than these people's lives. Like, legit, this. This shouldn't never have happened. I know this is not. Probably not an original take, but to be honest, I. The only takes I've seen from this has been people praising the staff, and I am also praising the staff who are willing to hold the stage up, but I am very much criticizing that none in that staff called off the performance as soon as they figured out what was happening. That is deeply unprofessional and inhumane, to be honest. You are willing to risk people's lives and physical health for the show to keep going?"

He is my golden boy of stray kids, and probably one of the best purchases I ever made was this photo colored right here that I bought outside of an 80s concert for six bucks. And for not being my bias, I do tend to get him a lot and pre order benefits. It's kind of fascinating, really. And like, sometimes I just keep him because he has pink hair or because he has silver hair or because he's holding Jenny Rick. It's really, truly an interesting experience. And again, he's holding Jenny Red, so, like, how could I say no? And then you got the classic peace sign kind of action going on here in the fit is on point. So again, how am I supposed to say no? Especially when he's coming in something I'm already buying anyway. But this. This is Lino, and we call him a bias wrecker. But probably one of my favorite photo cards of Lino is this one right here. He's holding a little Dinosaur. Isn't that neat? I think it's neat. And you know the best part about this one? It's double sided. So from the back he's giving you a peace sign, which can either mean a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your country of origin. And this. This is Han, and he's just the cutest little bean that ever beaned. He's a quoko, but also just A silly, goofy little guy who also has a penchant for acting sexy when he should be behaving. He also likes hats. And, you know, I really can't blame him for that. And then this one. Well, that one. That one, that one. Yeah, yeah, if, you know, you know. And as you can see here, he likes peace signs and hats. Sometimes the peace signs come with hats. Other times, we forgo the peace sign for either a cheek, heart, or whatever this is. It's by his cheek, and it's really cute. I don't know why he does it, but he's doing it. And then. And then, as if that wasn't enough, we have iron. And really, with this PC alone, you get the entirety of his personality. And the jokes truly do right at themselves. That is a baguette he's holding, just in case you're wondering. And then, finally, finally, we have my little bean, young man. And with this PC alone, you get the entirety of his personality. Yes, he likes to poke stuffed animals in their peepers. Why he does that, I don't know, but it sure is endearing. And in this one, he's got a little flower crown. But don't worry, he can also be safely pictured with real dogs and not poke them in their peepers. I don't think it's a waste of money, Mel. Can I call you Mel? And then, of course, there's a fan art that I could get into, but I don't think we have time for that, Mel. I don't think you have the patience for it either. But I could go into heavy detail about it.",

K-Pop choreography takes from a bunch of different choreography and then puts it into one. So to take one person's vision and then to hate on specific parts of it just feels wrong. Whenever someone creates something, whether it's dance or anything, it has a strong connection to them personally because it's what they want to express with whatever fits the vibe or the music or whatever they're going for. So just because it doesn't matter what you want or what your vision is or what you think is right doesn't mean that it's bad or objectively anything. As someone who sometimes creates content related to K-Pop, (because\u00a0I\u00a0also\u00a0make\u00a0K-Pop\u00a0dance\u00a0videos) I think that we need to have more respect for the creative process in general. There\u2019s a lot that goes into it and it\u2019s not just someone who creates the final product. These are real people that are creating things and putting themselves in a position where they're likely to be judged by people who maybe don't understand what they're going for. So to make videos like this that aren't productively contributing to conversation or adding anything, and instead just judging what people already created, it stops people from creating what they authentically want to create or what they believe they want to express which is where real art comes from. So (again) I don't wanna be ruining the fun or be a Karen or anything, but I'm just saying, we need to have more respect for the people that are creating the artistry that we're consuming and enjoying, that's all.",

    "voice_to_text": "Who then, shortly after outing this high ranking police officer, allegedly took her own life. I've seen a lot of this over the past few days and I really think it needs to be addressed. So this is referencing the Burning Sun documentary that the BBC dropped over the weekend. And particularly this is about the involvement of Harugu, who was a member of the girl group Kara, and how she helped investigators, um, with the case that they were building. And I just wanted to say and put it on the record that there was nothing alleged about her passing. Um, I've seen a lot of that. I've seen that, you know, her death was definitely suspect and things like that. And if you know anything about her, followed her story, you know that's bullshit. Hara suffered with her mental illness openly for years. She attempted to end her life many times before she finally succeeded. There was nothing alleged about her ending her life. There was nothing. There was no mystery behind it. Um, she had a troubled past and a. A. A troubled soul and that was extremely unfortunate, but let's not sensationalize it and make it into something that it wasn't. Hara should be remembered as being a hero for doing what she did to help these victims. She was a victim herself, as it says in the documentary. Um, that's how we should remember her. And not trying to make clickbait and get engagement in You know, bullshit accusations that because of her involvement in this scandal, that somehow that's what ended her life. It's bullshit. And the involvement. Nobody knew she was even involved when she was alive. All that came out after her passing. The reporter came out long after she was gone and said Hara helped. So as someone who was a fan of hers and a fan of Kara's, it's kind of irritating that I'm seeing a lot of this stuff. Um, it just needs to stop. The watch the documentary. The documentary is terrible enough, and the things that happened were terrible enough. We don't need to sensationalize extra parts of it just for, you know, clickbait, bullshit reasons."

It's fine. It's fine. Anyways, I just bought it. I think I bought us. Oh, wait, is that the. Hold on. Wow, it is. Hold on, let me check. Tell me why. I just looked up the global side and if you bought it on the global one, like the set, you also get a unreleased photo and the Polaroid type photo feature. You get an extra Polaroid. You get a Polaroid? Fuck y'all bitches. Cause I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. But like, the few times that I've like, almost bought something off of weverse and I did global, it wouldn't let me. Because I think it might have had something to do with specifically where I am in the US. Miss Lindsay. Girl, you're on the east, you're on the west coast, you're in California, and where you get all the. You. Where y'all get all the. Nice did. I'm on the east coast in the south, so like, I don't get shit. That's ghetto as hell. And the set was cheaper. That's also ghetto as fuck. I paid $122 including shipping. Also, fuck shipping. That shit is unnecessarily expensive. 20 extra dollars? Fuck, bro, it was already 94, but whatever. What the fuck ever. But I'm Super glad that I got it! Thank you for making that video for me, even though I didn't and I didn't even get to see it until after I bought it, so. Oh my gosh. But I'm super excited! I don't think mine comes till like July or something. It is what it is, I guess.",

    "voice_to_text": "when I first saw that price I said wow that's so high it's not even the highest that I've seen I saw a girl she was joking she was jokingly trying to buy floor tickets for like an NCT dream concert and it said 4K for what\ud83e\udd14 4K for what bro\ud83e\uddd0 like it's that's too crazy is and the thing is the NCT Dream pre sale was good it was really good because they didn't let you just buy the membership whenever you wanted it was you buy the membership and then you wait like 24 hours before and then you can get your code to get into the pre sale I'm like okay so it was mad chill it was mad clean for that pre sale I went in there I got three tickets for around $300 divided that by up in the 100s all them tickets came to around a little bit over 100 beautiful hmm any the one time I'm happy with SM whoever at SM did that get all your flowers \ud83d\udc90 get a raise because you deserve that so much\ud83d\udcc8 because if you don't do it that way pre sell does not matter at this point pre sell does not matter\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I don't do pre sale at all I just wait wait like a week or two and then you'll get a reasonable it's still high don't get me wrong it's still crazy high but a reasonable ticket like txt I saw them last time when they came to Charlotte right what I spent over like two something for a nosebleed \ud83e\ude78ticket I said I was gonna go because they were in Charlotte and they never come to North Carolina so I'm like okay cool this time I said if I see a ticket I am not going if I'm all the way in the back and that seat is as expensive as I did the last time I said it needs to be in the one hundreds for a reasonable price and it was it was cheaper than when I spent on those nosebleeds and I'm still in the one hundreds in a good view at and I waited wha\u23f2\ufe0f a week I waited a week for them prices to go down cause everybody would like oh man I can't get a ticket god easy good um the one that was easy and I just did general admission was P1 Harmony for their Atlanta stop that that was great it was like one something I don't know exactly where I am in the auditorium but it's not a bad seat I could see everything focus on but there are two things I wanna say one the people who bought their tickets for NCT Dream and then because it got opened early at like 4:00 o'clock in the morning and then had to get their stuff refunded\ud83d\ude31 how are y'all doing \ud83e\udd14 cause I feel bad for you because you were there for the opportune time and then your money gets refunded and you're like wait \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude2b but that was my money to buy this ticket and now you stuck in the back is like I had floor and now it's gone oh oh \ud83d\ude2b I feel bad for you that was mad messed up but I also know whoever at ticketmaster is getting remed for that one secondly secondly different K pop group altogether those people that are able to afford the floor seats for multiple stops how do you do that\ud83e\udd14 like how does that happen cause I keep on hearing about enhyphen and the same cyclical people getting floor seats how is that happening how much money are you making to be able to do that\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc40 like you grown? grown and you how cause even if you're grown right we've been seeing these prices for just the general price that these K pop groups have been putting down they be like oh be like 600 500 700 dollars before FEES and you just got like yeah\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb5 just got a couple grand and then you gonna do the flight to the next stop in the hotel doing that getting possibly getting parking and getting rental feeding yourself do y'all have jobs \ud83e\uddd0 cause you should apparently y'all do before how much money you put down I don't how anyway my moral of the story is stop doing these pre sales unless these companies start doing what NCT Dream did there's no point in doing these these pre sales anymore just wait a couple weeks because that dynamic pricing can't kick in if nobody's there to do that crap the people who actually do their presale thing can get a reasonable price and then it just trickles down later on",

    "voice_to_text": "hello good morning um if you haven't watched Eileen's video go back and watch the video I woke up to this MiniMoni video this morning and I had so many thoughts and then I saw Eileen's TikTok about it and it she was saying a lot of the same things I wanted to say so since she wants an answer I figured I would give my idea I have been speculating now not just me some others have been speculating I have been speculating ever since Yoongi's last d day behind video came out from the last concert in Seoul not the final the last concert in Seoul that the maknaes went to that behind the video that we got a few weeks ago and he goes backstage after the concert and the maknaes are all there waiting for them and Jimin had his shirt off for some reason but there was a conversation had where Jimin said my album is done now remember this was been in June of last year 2023 um so uh face had been done and promotions for face had been done for a while a while like a couple of months at that point but he said I'm done with my album and Yoongi said oh it's all finished now which immediately sensors went off in my brain because why would they talk about face that way when clearly face had been done for months like even promotions had been done because he finished up his promotions in April pretty much right around the time the d day came out so my brain immediately went what if what if this bitch has also been worked what if he had more songs and he just didn't have enough ready for a full album so he released face as an EP but he's still been working on these other songs and he's planning on releasing another EP of course I could be completely wrong but then they come out with this Mini and Moni album exchange exchange that that indicates some sort of equivalency you you understand you understand like it's not just it wouldn't just be Jimin receiving Namjoon's album exchange implies that there's something that's going to be given back so what is it Jimin I suspect that perhaps it's another EP a mini album that perhaps he was he didn't quite or maybe the other songs just didn't quite fit in with face but he was still working on them and wanted to finish them and wanted to release them so perhaps we have another EP coming our way maybe it's just a single but something something Jimin has more up his sleeve and I feel like we're going to get it we're going to find out about it through this album exchange it says Album Exchange this is fuel to the fire in my brain cause I've been saying people been like no we couldn't possibly record another album and I was starting to feel a little crazy for thinking that and now I'm feeling a different kind of crazy I'm feeling like delulu crazy like Jimin did you did you record it did you did you make another EP for us is it gonna release sometime this year is that did you guys record this album exchange so that you could talk about each other's albums also namjoon did you do this same thing with Taehyung and Jung Kook because I would love to see that too we all love Suchwita  if we could have some sort of what if because you share your song recs all the time hear me out hear me out because I clearly namjoon is watching this hear me out namjoon you share your song recommendations all the time what if you just had your own show that was like a music exchange where you had people on and you guys just exchanged music and talked about music my god that would be so good okay I gotta go freak out about this some more but let me know what you guys think okay okay bye",

But let me just go through everything that is Day 6 related that I have right here because Day 6 are my old so I have quite a bit of them. Okay, so on the small shelf I have my signed shoot me album. That's the first signed Day 6 album I have. Then I have forever, which doesn't really fit. I know. Everything's a mess right now. And I have my two one pill albums. I have the other one somewhere else. Then I have the Sunrise album and I have remember us, you've part 2 and honorary mention my J album. On top of that shelf we have the even of day summer vacation stuff, I think the 4th Gen fan club, and my Moonrise final. Also have Bang laying here in his fancy suit. And my sign gravity album, but I don't really know where to put that right now. Plus my forever poster you get with the forever album and one of my concert posters from Soul. Then we have two letters with notes because I bought one and then I got one for free. Then um. Concert DVD and the book of us. And then 4th gen fan club thingy I just put up there. We have the night lamp or whatever it is she got with the 3rd gen fan club and First version light band with Daydream under it. And then we have the Japanese releases, or at least some of them. We have unlock stop the rain and if. And then we have third version of the Light Band with the 3rd gen fan club. We have the memory book and the 3rd gen fan club photobook something. Yeah, and young case eternal in the corner. I only have one version of this, but the young one itinerary. And then the youth World Tour DVD. Oh, let me not mess anything up. And yeah, he's just still chilling there, don't mind him. So we have the entire book of us series except the gravity version. I have signed that. I don't have duplicates of that. And then the two first versions of the light band with Moonrise standing right there in the back. And we have out of the blue by Dawn. I didn't know a physical version of this like album existed before I went to Korea, which maybe I should have known. Also forgot to mention, right next to the young one I have my other version of Moonrise. Then we have today which is the first mini album, and the Best Day which is one of the Japanese releases, I don't really remember which one. And I have my cup sleeves which quite a bit of these are of Yankee because I was there when it was his birthday in Korea. Also have the 2019 season's greetings Hiding in the back. And of course, we can't forget. Um, yeah. Yeah. I have a song. Jin. Also, photo cards. I don't really collect. I just have the ones that I've pulled mostly, and then I've bought a couple because I thought it would be nice to have. But. Yeah, I kinda wanna buy more photo cards, but I'm also like. Photo cards are not really my thing. Oh, went a bit too far. Yeah. So I have some, but not a lot.",

This is my K pop cup sleeve moment. I never know what to do with them, so they always just kind of go on the wall. This is the Hongjoong corner. That is a tiny photo of Min Yoongi eating a French fry. Here is a Taylor Swift CD clock that my dad made for me. And also a be awesome sign that he made for me. I did not ask for that one. He just made it one day. So now it will stay on my wall until I die. This is my reputation Snake Karen. She is currently a witch, as you can see by her costume. And then underneath my target birds is the loser lover sign from the IT franchise. And then Jung Jung Jung and Yoongi saying hello.",

I see some of y'all in the comments like thinking that it's funny, giggling about it. But do we need to address again that a fan site does not equal a saucing? Yes, it's pretty common for a fan site to also be a saucing. But there are people that are just fan sites that show up to concerts, bring these cameras, and take really good pictures. And of course there are negatives to that, especially if they profit off of it. Or they purposely do that just to sell the photos. But by just seeing someone at a concert next to you that has one of those cameras, you can't automatically assume that they are saucing. Now if there's added context to the situation where this saw saying was acting purposely rude or sitting in a seat that they weren't supposed to be in, or if they laid hands on this person first, I would understand. But it just seems like out of nowhere this girl's trying to take a picture and this person, OP, does not agree with the fact that she has a big camera like that. But let's all have a level set and agree that it is not okay to lay hands on each other just because you don't agree with it."

This \u201coh I'm a real fan because I've been around for longer.\u201d \u201coh I'm a real fan because I know their birthdays.\u201d \u201cI'm a real fan because I stream their music 24 hours a day.\u201d I don't know if this is a hot take, but I don't think you're entitled to a concert ticket or merch or whatever just because you've been a fan for longer. At the end of the day, they're making the same amount of money from someone buying a ticket, whether they've been a fan for three months or a fan since six years ago. If anything it's a good thing seeing people promote this tour! People go to concerts all the time and then become fans because of it! And if they have more people coming to the tour,  they're more likely to come back for another one! I don't get why you're mad."

    "voice_to_text": "Stays are coming through my DMS to tell me to myself, aside from the fact that stays are bullying. Literally one of the loveliest days on this app. The racism issuing this fandom has been here. And it's so stupid too, because the people that you Stan are people of color. But anyways, let's get into it. In 2,021, Hyunjin was under fire for the whole blackface thingy. People were asking him to apologize and everything. And when stray kids finally posted an apology, people went crazy in the fucking comments. People were like, no, all lives matter. It's not just black lives matter. A lot, a lot of states were saying this. And on top of that, a lot of black states were getting hate messages, death threats telling them to leave the fandom or to off themselves. And I'm like, what the actual hell? Like, in that situation, I can understand if you think that they didn't have to apologize, but when it doesn't concern you, you shut the fuck up. Right? And this has been going on since the beginning of Stray Kids, because when Chan wore the cornrows at that show, that award show, like, people were like, no, you can't do that! You can't do that! And the amount of hate black fans got for saying that, for telling him that that was cultural appropriation. Bullying this poor girl because she decides to put morals over K pop. More worried about your face getting the Amount of streams that you want them to have, then about your face. Doing the right thing and collaborating with the right people and not hanging out with fucking Zionists. Like, do you understand how fucking crazy that is? A lot of people here or so performative, or posting, oh, free Palestine, reposting videos for Palestine and stuff like that. But then you're like, no, I won't participate in this boycott because it's affecting Stray Kids. Girl, Stray Kids has so many fucking songs you can stream. This is not gonna kill them."

Look at what it's causing. Look at what it's causing. The most horrible time for this to happen for stray kids. Like, they're getting all these opportunities. They are gonna be known for this. And y'all could have made a difference because in all the media outlets, it could have been straight kids are releasing a collab. However, this is how the fans feel. Stray Kids are in a collab with Charlie Puth. However, this is the message from the fans. Are they being silenced? Is the company forcing them to do collabs they don't agree with? Those could have been the headlines."

    "voice_to_text": "On bubble in the past 24 hours, also with all eight Instagram accounts. They have not. Please go watch the full video that I just did so you can kind of get a better idea of, like, the point I'm trying to make here. But multiple people have already brought up the point that Stray Kids have been completely silent as soon as this collab. I refuse to say the name of the song cause I am not promoting it at all. This collab. Um, they have not said anything once it was released. And even though, yes, that is true, and yes, it is saying something to us, like the fact that, like, we're reading it in a certain way, because, like, they usually do say something. I will say, though, as much as I can see that they are possibly becoming aware of the situation or now are aware of it and they know what's going on, and they're refusing to, like, engage with anything now, even though they're doing that and we're receiving that message that way, I still think that given how in the past, when they were silenced for one reason or another and they weren't allowed to make statements about anything, they have found a way to say something. Chan specifically has found a way to communicate with us and let us know that he's hurt us and he's learning and he is trying to do better. So as much as I am acknowledging That they are being silent about the collab now that it's released and they are not promoting it at all themselves. Personally, I am still keeping an eye out because the benefit of the doubt is getting smaller. And as much as I love straight kids and as much as I love their music and want to support their music, they are part of a company that's part of the problem. And if removing myself from the fandom for a very short time by blocking them or whatever you wanna consider me doing by blocking them, if that's what it takes to send a message out to the company, that's what we need to do. Like, at this point, it's not like at this point, it's not about who's a fan of who, who's most supportive or not. We are talking about companies that are funding the killing of innocent people. I have gotten so many comments in the videos that I've posted saying, what's the point of this? The company is the one that's a Zionist. The company is the one that's taking the money from these people. The come. Okay, then the company is making money through Stray Kids. Cut off the money through Stray Kids.",

Okay, fair enough. In western media, you have the ROM com, but the ROM com kind of died out, right? So there wasn't really anything decent romance levels coming out. Okay, like, maybe around, like, 2,010. Like, the romcom was dead. So what. What do we have for love? Like, sure, you had TV shows, but the. The focus was never on love. It was the TV show with love. No, but that wasn't. Love wasn't the main focus, right? Unlike K drama. So I was super into ROM coms. I watched every single fucking ROM com I could possibly find that sounded interesting, which was most of them. Um. And then I kind of watched them all already. So then my ex was, like, super into anime, so I got super into anime. I really like the ones that were romances, but the problem with romance anime is usually it's only one season and they cancel it. So, okay, yeah, there's manga, not for TV. There's not really anything to watch. So then I was like, let me check out K drama. And, like, that's the thing. There's always gonna be another K drama. And even if there's not really any decent romance K dramas coming out, the moment, like, what one you can do The J dramas and the C dramas and the Thai dramas and all that kind of stuff. But, like, there's also, like, a massive backlog like this. You. You never gonna run out of K drama to watch. Like, you're never gonna run out. There's always gonna be something, even if it's not exactly what you're looking for. Like, there's always gonna be something. Like, you. You have to admit, as K drama watchers, in comparison to, like, what western media there is, we're very well fed because, like, what. What western media have. They have Bridgerton. That's fucking it, really. Like, what else is there? Okay, you have wrong cons, when it comes to TV shows, Bridgerton, maybe, like, Love Sick. Yeah. There's not a lot.",

    "voice_to_text": "This stays. Armies and blinks working together. That is the unholy Trinity. You have truly done some. I need y'all to understand how wild this actually is, that the unholy Trinity that she just mentioned was actually, like, summoned together. And just to show how, like, these paparazzi photographers really brought K pop fans together during Kingdom, in their final performance, as the one that we were gonna vote for, to make sure they win. Right? They did remixes of iconic songs. Icon, one of the performers, one of the. Sorry, one of the groups competing, they performed with Lisa from Blackpink. Okay. They performed with her. She was there. And Stray Kids did their gods do to do Deadpool whole thing. That went viral. Whatever. But while we were voting for those two performances, like, as international fans, everyone, we had to go on YouTube and stream it. The streams, what we're gonna count as vote. Well, given that they were both, like, Black Pink songs that were, like, involved or, like, Lisa was part of icon, Stray Kids use Black Pink for a song. All the fandoms. And when I say all the fandoms, even fandoms that didn't have groups competing in Kingdom got together to vote against Stray Kids because they were not gonna have Stray Kids win with a Black Pink song when one of the other people actually had a Black Pink member in the group. My words are really not coming to me today. They were not gonna have. This is their logic. They were not gonna have someone using a black pink song beat a group that actually had a black pink member in it. That was the whole thing. And when I tell you every single fandom and their mother decided to vote for icon will stream icons performance instead of stray kids and stays. We were in the trenches. We were streaming all on our own. I mean, obviously, like, there was other people that knew that it was ridiculous that the fandoms are doing this. And, like, they were Maltese and like 18. You were helping as well. Like, don't get me wrong, around Kingdom is when, like, stay teenies really derailed. We used to be married. What happened anyways? Little sidetracked. My point is, is that these photographers messed up so bad that they brought together three of the bigger fandoms that usually don't really interact with each other and kind of, like majority of the time kind of beef with each other for no reason. Honestly, I think fan wars are dumb. This is the kind of fan where I'm down for the war against the people that disrespect K pop idols."

That was abysmal. That was horrific. We know that the American media is trash. We know the American paparazzi is trash. Always have been, probably always will be. They are the scourge of the earth. But to have them treat these boys like this, it's hard to form words because this was such a big opportunity for the boys. This was a huge deal. This was great for their exposure. This was great for their careers. And then to turn around and see that there were comments like in this previous video that I stitched made. Not only that, but I have seen the racist comments that I have seen surface that they experience while on that carpet. Awful. Disgusting, horrific. I hope every single one of them loses their jobs. Because in no dimension was that acceptable behavior. Shame on all of you.",

Which I understand but..*sighs* I really\u2026like..I would want to take a picture with them. But..I don't know. That's the thing..like I would..I might try to make it obvious that I\u2019m a fan. Oh wow my eyes look nice \ud83d\ude33 sorry.. Ummm..I don't know like,Iike I really don't know. Because now I would feel bad to admit that I would want to take picture with them. And I would actually go and.. I would be REALLY shy I feel like. (I would be like): \u201cHello ummm..\u201d Dudeeeee,I really don't know dude. Like when..I swear I swear the reason why I'm..so like..hesitant is because.. Well..this is..I guess it's a hypothetical question \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude05 I think..that's the word. Because..I don't think anything like that would happen to me. Because again,I'm not a lucky person. But if it did like..I would REALLY want to take a picture with them. That's the thing..but I don't want to bother them..cause you know\u2026 I got hiccups,like..Oh ! \ud83d\ude2f that was my throat uhhh.. Also for some reason I keep imagining an outside restaurant \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab I-I don't know I have a spec-specific picture in my head,which is so weird. Wowwwww that's so specific,wait..I-I'm kinda..like..wait..why and how ?? Everything is so specific in my head,I don't know why and how that's..even..yeah that's crazy. Like I imagined that..wow ! okay,sorry anyways..Like I would want to take a picture with them. But then again like..ahem,I think I'm hesitating because most people don't,say that they wouldn't because it's not respectful or anything.. But I don't know..I feel like I would regret it a lot. Like sure..it may not be as respectful and I-I try to make it as fast as possible. But I feel like I couldn't live with myself, if I don't..like.. Take a picture with them or try to talk to them or anything. Yeahhhhh,that's just me though. Plus, it would be so nice to talk to them. Like really talk to them. Also I keep imagining a restaurant. And I know..it's..rude. But I don't know. I feel like it..if anything I would meet them at a restaurant. Which is actually like..VERY rare because you know there's many restaurants. Like the odds of that\u2026?? I don't know unless you\u2019re in Korea then..that\u2019s..so,yeah ! And I saw like or like.. read a comment like if a restaurant..that would be re-disrespectful. Not rude eh..sorry not ehhh.. You know..but like a mall or whatever.. I guess it would be fine. I don't know..but yeahhh. I-I think I would genuinely pass out. Like I would pass out..I would die,I was like..I'll be like.. Then I would pass out. But then I would like..get up and I'm like..and then I'll maybe go up to them. Now the thing is..I would go up to them I just.. I don't know..I keep thinking about a restaurant and I feel like that was extra extra disrespectful. Like they just want to eat. But if they were just out,like at a mall.. I feel like that's not really rude. Cause..I don't know it just..like.I don't know there's a difference. There's just..a difference. I don't know how to explain it. But yeah, chow meinnn..okay.",

But it really is sad to see them go. If you guys had DIRECTV, you know that they had like, K pop channel. One of them was Audi, Dawn TV and Simply K pop. I literally recorded every performance from nature and Dream Note. Um, even since like, their debut song for like, so my love. Their song girls was literally revolutionary. Like, they were truly the essence of what made K pop. K pop for like, 2018 era. I hope they're gonna make like, personal Instagram cause I really do wanna keep up with them.
