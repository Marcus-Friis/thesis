Look, Corey, I don't know you very well, but you're a creator with a pretty good sized platform. And according to your bio, you talk about mom stuff. So I just want you to take a second and look at this from a different perspective. Let's just reverse the genders here. Say that there was a man that was on this platform and he made a video about how being a single dad is so hard. And he has take care of himself for his birthday because nobody cares. And he used that post to gain shit loads of sympathy and make shit loads of money. But then we come to find out that his kids have been taken away from him because he's a criminal. We also find out that he owes more than $20,000 in back child support. And that the only reason he doesn't have visitation of his kids is because he won't pay his child support. Then we also find out that he con people out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by faking having cancer. You making this video defending him, you still saying the same things you said in this video? No, you wouldn't and you know it.",

    "voice_to_text": "It makes me question, what the hell do our government be doing with our tax dollars? They funnel the money overseas, whether through direct contributions to a country or through our nation's largest weapons manufacturers, who then funnel that money back to our elected leadership through lobbyists. And they make themselves rich. And the funny thing is, they don't hide it. Like, they're not hiding the fact that they're doing this. I mean, they make it very fucking obvious this is what they're doing. Like, take Lockheed Martin, for example. Last year, the United States government spent $47.7 billion with Lockheed Martin, which, insanely enough, represented 93% of Lockheed Martin's revenue for the year. Without our money, they wouldn't exist. But anyway, after the United States government gave them 47 billion, lucky then proceeded to spend more than a hundred million dollars lobbying the government. Those are all in the forms of gifts, trips and all kinds of other bullshit for elected representatives. Oh, and the funniest part, nearly 80% of the money we gave to Lockheed Martin, we borrowed. So we borrowed the money with interest to give it to a government contractor, who then took a nice chunk of that money and spend it on the representatives that voted to give them the money in the first place. And none of this is hidden. They're not deceiving anyone. This is all publicly disclosed. And that's not even counting all the smaller contracts. You know, those contracts that are given out to small Contracting firms that are generally owned by friends of the congressmen who push the Bill to pay them. Like, bro, you have to think about the fact that last year, all by itself, when we look at all discretionary spending, we spent $861 billion on defense, 80% of that on other countries defense. And we spend around 700 billion on everything that's not defense. We spent more last year from discretionary spending on defense for other nations than we did on everything else in the US. Every other government program, whether it's science or housing or anything, all of that together was less than what we spent on the defense of other countries. So to answer your question, that's what they're doing with our money.",

    "voice_to_text": "me to take your criticism to heart I'd first have to value your opinion this comment right here is what distinguishes leaders from influencers I was asked this question the other day on a post and never got around to answering it and then the older millennial gave me the perfect opportunity so even though he doesn't care about my opinion he probably sees me as a bleeding heart Liberal it is what it is here's the difference between influencers and leaders influence is a prerequisite for leadership and the older millennial has a ton of influence has a ton of followers and congratulations to him however the difference between someone with influence and a leader is a leader has virtue influence gives you followers virtue gives you direction to lead those followers into the challenge here is the moment you say you don't value the opinions of those who disagree with you you immediately make it possible only for you to lead people who already agree with you the problem with that is if they already agree with you they're already at where you're at that means you're not leading anyone anywhere you're just creating an echo chamber a community of people that already agree with you who are already where they are and you're giving them no hope to move in a direction that is better you just create a chamber where everyone complains about the same shit and has no opportunity or access to a better life or a better future that's not leadership and I know older millennial doesn't claim to be a leader by the way I'm not criticizing the older millennial for his leadership I'm just answering the question someone asked and using the older millennial as an example this right here is a difference between influencers and leaders if you are not willing to be held accountable by those you don't like or don't agree with you are not a leader and again I'm not saying older millennial ever claimed to be a leader of any sort but I made a video last week is my second most popular video ever about Harrison Bucker and I was corrected multiple times in the comments and I said thank you for holding me accountable some of those people use some of the mistakes I made in that video as a way to completely disregard my comments and the importance of my argument and you know what it's my fault for giving them the opportunity to do that I'm a former special education teacher so yeah the older millennials comments about disabled people is deeply disturbing for me but at the same time I care about the older millennial because him and everyone inside his echo chamber they go vote they go vote they have jobs and they touch the lives of their neighbours and a better life for the older millennial is a better life for the people in his community who are impacted by his presence I care about the older millennial I care about everyone in his comment section that agrees with him I care about everyone who considers himself an American because I value American values I believe in the freedom of speech but for you to say that you don't care about half of Americans means you don't care about freedom of speech you don't have any virtue whatsoever you are not a man of your word you do not care about what it means to be an American you go against everything that America stands for the moment you say that you don't value the opinions of other people who disagree with you and by the way I hold that same idea in my personal life if you don't live a life that I wanna live I don't care about your criticism about my personal life not about public discourse not about who gets what rights the idea that you don't value other people's opinions no longer applies when it comes to opinions about the public the way we operate as a collective yes your personal life I wouldn't care about my opinion either and I don't care about yours when it comes to my personal life but when it comes to how we spend funds that we all collectively pull together I care about your opinion a little bit so yeah you should care again if you just wanna be an old influencer on TikTok go ahead if you wanna be a leader of your community I challenge you to accept accountability",

But, Midas touch, this is what you do after you say something that's wrong. You take the video down and you admit you were wrong. But that's not what you do. No. You continue to pay Harry Sisson, even though he spells nothing but misinformation, and he uses your sources to do it, like you paid him thousands of dollars to spread bullshit over and over and over again. So, yes, I was wrong. I used the wrong picture. That was not his speech in the Bronx. My bad. But if I could admit that I was wrong as a content creator, as just a person who makes videos on TikTok, why can't you as a media organization? Like, it's okay, bro. All of us are wrong from time to time. You take the video down and you move on. How about you fucking try it?",

You know, the Tyreek Hill that was convicted of domestic violence? Not like the oh, he shoved his wife domestic violence. No. According to the police report, he threw his pregnant girlfriend around like a rag doll, punched her in the face, sat on her and punched her in the stomach. In her pregnant stomach, and choked her till she passed out. He pled guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation. And you cheered for him for six years straight. Where the fuck was your TikTok about that? Oh, that's right. You didn't make one. So while a man beating the shit out of his pregnant girlfriend isn't enough to get you to make a TikTok, a Catholic giving a speech at a Catholic college about Catholic values is? Don't worry. I know this isn't about values for you. This is an attention grab. You're no longer a cheerleader, and now you need the attention. Well, I know I'm not the only one calling you out, so enjoy that attention.",

Now I'm wondering if I need to add chips or. People on TikTok are putting out hacks so that you can get a bowl, get a side of tortilla, and then you can actually make a full burrito. But Chipotle on that bullshit. And I just like to point out that for the same price as 25 burritos. 25 bullshit ass burritos from Chipotle, you can join the MCU. You can actually be part of an entity that's fighting against this. Or you can get 25 bullshit burritos. Hey, it's up to you, but if you're interested in the MCU, check out the pinned videos in my profile, then click that link in my bio. I'm always available to answer questions as well. But yeah, fuck Chipotle.",

Your mods then proceeded to mute me anytime I made a point. And then anytime I tried to correct a lie you told, your mom's muted me again. So since there was no actual possibility of debating with you live on TikTok, I just made videos correcting your lies. You then proceeded to send me a cease and desist from a very expensive law firm. And contrary to you saying that, the cease and desist was all about a shirt, that was only a tiny part of it. See, the rest of it was your lawyer saying that I couldn't say mean things about you. You literally sent me the lawyer equivalent of Mommy, make him stop. And then I invited you and Chris Maori down to Florida. I said I would pay for your flights, I pay for your hotel. All you had to do was sit down for a live round table with me. And conservative ain't then. You dodge that for the better part of nine months. that I got more followers in nine months than you did in four years, now you're really interested in a debate. Funny how that works.",

If Democrats actually cared about defeating Donald Trump, they would force him to get a ceasefire by using the full powers of the presidency (like HW, Carter and Reagan did) and then force him to step down as the candidate to have a contested convention so they can nominate a pro-ceasefire/progressive candidate to unite the base. But Liberals and Democrats continue to support and prop up Biden as he still allows a literal g*nocide continue to unalive Palestinains every single day. Its 2016 all over again, except even worse.

Well, if you have been watching, Michael Cohen made his debut on the stand today, and he didn't blow up. He didn't act out, he didn't go crazy. He was smooth, calculating, and calm. He was believable for a prosecution witness. And Donald Trump was pissed. Pissed, pissed. Where he ended up doing this on the video. Like I said before, he may have violated his gag order. Again, I would stay tuned for this, because like I said, Michael Cohen comes back. We don't know what the hell will happen tomorrow. Check out that video for context and clarity.

With that being said, I wanna set this young man straight, because apparently this kid really ain't getting it, all right? And I would want. Oh, and by the way, ladies, I want you to basically go and frequent this young man's page and let him know about said Lawrence Taylor, for instance. Probably kind of spread the truth around a little bit about him, because this is gonna be hard to hear. You see, Donald Trump has done this bullshit before, alright? He's done it in 2,016. He tried to do it in 2020 and he lost in 2020. He did it in 2,016 and was successful at it because people thought that he was a breath of fresh air. No one wanted Democrats that actually hold power and office. And we all got duped. That's right, we all got duped. I wasn't duped. I voted for Hillary. But nevertheless, elections are elections. It wasn't until 2,020 where he couldn't get the black vote. Lawrence Taylor wasn't around then. Where was he then? Now all of a sudden he talks about he met this man. Really? You know, it's not a real good idea to bring somebody up there that looks like, you know, he hasn't done anything in the last, what, 20 years? After his retirement, he played in a couple of movies. Little Giants. What was the other one? Any given Sunday hasn't really done too much, and also, believe it or not, is a registered sex offender. Yeah, he is. I'm sorry, but he is. And Donald Trump is reaching right now because a lot of people are not playing this game with him anymore. They're not. The last four years of this man's presidency under his watch basically showed the fact that racism ran wild under his watch. George Floyd, Jacob Blake, a mob. Mob Barry, Brianna Taylor, to name a few. The protest that went around the run around this country and around the world for police brutality, and what did this man do? Nothing. Nothing at all. All he did was complain about democratic cities and Republican cities. Buildings being burned down, businesses being looted. We all knew that there were certain individuals that were peppering inside these protests that were either policemen or white supremacist groups trying to cause anarchy and chaos. Nevertheless, Donald Trump didn't do a damn thing. And now, since this man is doing his campaigning in a courtroom, he's about maybe this close to being a bitch to the state of New York. Very fitting. Just want to let you know that, kid, check out this video for context and clarity. You have a wonderful day.",

I think it's time for me to set this child straight since you brought up your statistics and everything else that came across your video. I hate to break it to you, but during the middle of a speech, basically almost everybody in that entire 80,000 left. Oh yeah, there's video out there to support it. Not only that, not only that, Donald Trump is melting down. Now, if he goes out there and says he believes in himself and all that sort of junk, he's gonna need some help. Especially when he's praising fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter and shit. And I'm not making this up, my friend. Because when you're praising fictional characters played by Anthony Hopkins and shit, you really lose your supporters very, very quickly. And by the way, another thing that happened. Who's Jimmy Connors? I mean, ain't that the tennis player? Cause he mentioned him too. Like I said, Happy Mother's Day for all the mothers in the world out there.

And I know that's a weird statement to hear, but it's the truth. There is no purple on the light spectrum. There are no purple photons. See, our vision sees in a three color light spectrum of red, green and blue. You've probably heard the term RGB. That's red, green and blue. So our eyes basically have sensors that detect red, green and blue. The way your brain is supposed to work, when it sees color, it's supposed to detect how much red, green and blue you're seeing. So normally, if your brain sees very little red and very little blue, your green sensors would pick up because green is between red and blue. But if your brain sees very little red, very little blue, and your green sensors don't pick up any green, your brain essentially short circuits and you see purple. Like all purple is, is the absence of green. It's not actually purple, it is simply your brain malfunctioning.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today, Trump lawyer John Sauer told the court that as President, Trump could murder Americans and never be prosecuted for it after leaving office. Yeah, cause Obama already did that. Like this is recent history, guys. Why are we pretending that didn't happen? President Obama ordered a drone strike on a restaurant in a country that we are not at war with. And he did that specifically to murder a sixteen year old American citizen who had not been convicted or tried for any crime. Like he knowingly did that and admitted it to the American public. How is that not murder? And if you're gonna be okay with him doing that, if you're gonna be okay with President Obama using the United States military to murder a 16 year old American citizen in a foreign nation, why the fuck are you acting so crazy about Trump saying he would have immunity? Obama murdered an American citizen that hadn't been convicted of any fucking crime whatsoever. So stop clutching your fucking pearls over the idea of presidential immunity. If you're gonna prosecute Trump, you better prosecute Obama.",

    "voice_to_text": "so I find it funny that the um Donald Trump is saying that the latest violation of the gag order that Judgmentron has placed on him now the 10th time he's warned him and threatened him with jail time for violating the gag order they will hold them in contempt of court I think it's and then Trump comes back and says well he keeps violating my constitutional rights to say what I want to say you know again pushing that whole narrative that uh the right to speech has no bounds and and is just you know whatever you wanna say how you wanna say where you wanna say is protected by the Constitution it's the same lunacy that the left uses right that that and I find it interesting that we talk about some of my content on my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there curious formula uh talks about the lunacy of the left and the right when it comes to the Constitution I can think of no better example than Donald Trump on the right talking about how the Constitution his Constitution rights are being abridged and you know that's not what the Constitution you know says I should have the right to free speech unassailable likewise on the left I put up a a comment to somebody who put on a viral video here on TikTok or might have on Instagram that had women who had on t shirts that had political speech at a council meeting and they were wearing them and the council said hey they have to leave if they're gonna wear those shirts and and people were like that's wrong um we have the right to free speech we can wear a T-shirt that has a political message on here and you're bridging my my right to free speech that was on the left and I put a comment and said you know that I maybe even supported what the the comment that was on the t shirts that they people were wearing but that the council city council wherever town council every right to restrict uh that form of speech and it goes to what people don't understand about the Constitution people use the Constitution for whatever they want to use it because I bet those same people wore the t shirts in the courtroom who were Liberal will probably say that Donald Trump doesn't have the right um to say what he wants to say and I'm sure I'm sure would say the same about these people who wore who wore some of these leftist things on their t shirts they don't have the right to say they wanna say people just use the Constitution for what they want and and they base their decisions based on the ideology about what is appropriate speech and what is protected speech by the Constitution and not what it actually says listen folks the Constitution does give you the right to free speech but it's not it is not under underbridgeable it is not it is not without regulation it is not without bounds right we all know the statement that's been made famous you can't yell out fire in a crowded theater that's putting a restriction on speech the government has the right to restrict speech and a public venue to time manner and place they can do that it's like when I was on a city council in New Jersey the city council had the right to say that 25 people can speak during the hearing of citizens you may not like it you may not agree with it right and that they and and but but we had the right to do so now if you didn't like that you have the right to vote us out of office and put somebody else then who said I'm not gonna just have 25 people speaking at a council meeting at the hearing of citizens we have the right to put a restriction on time three to five minutes or whatever the time frame was that's not restricting your speed you don't have the right to speak 150 people don't have the right to speak at a council meeting if that's what the council wants they don't have the right to speak for an hour at a time if that's not what the council wants um that's the reality of it and Donald Trump yes a court can restrict what you can say when you're on trial to the people who are wearing the t shirts on the left at a council meeting yes they can say you no one can wear any t shirts with political speech at a council meeting that is not restrict your right to free speech you can wear your T-shirt outside of that room you can wear your your your T-shirt anywhere you want to Donald Trump you can say what you wanna say as long as it doesn't violate the order that you're supposed to be under when you're under when you're on trial you can't say those kind of things about jurors and the judge because you don't have the right to say that I just think it's really really interesting that in America today and throughout the world the problem of people looking and using institutional documents like the Constitution or declaration of independence or or or the Bill of rights or or any number of federal laws and statutes and regulations and and tell people like this is violative of that this is not what the founders wanted this is not this is not what you should be doing based on ideology is tearing this nation apart what's good for the goose is good for the gander and as I said it is a far gone conclusion well settled law that the government has the right to restrict speech based on time manner and place and if you don't like it then ask for an amendment to the to the law or challenge it in court and have it go up to the Supreme Court to make a new a new analysis of it but it's the same lunacy it's the same hypocrisy that's evident on the left and on the right Donald Trump is just the most um most visual and most um um um up to date sort of problem with it but it's a problem on the left and the right tell me what you think and if you have an alternative opinion subscribe like and comment below also go to my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there free speech is not based on your ideology free speech is a right that has regulation because all rights under the Constitution have regulation stay curious and think it ain't",

Because if you watch this dude's videos, like, this is a black man, this is a black man going to UCLA, and anytime he goes anywhere near these encampment, it's not brown students, it's not black students, it's not Palestinians or gossins or Asians or any of that shit. No, it is a bunch of white people telling a black man where he can go on campus. It is a bunch of white students saying, you don't belong here and trying to force a black man to leave their area. I mean, let's be real, at its core, that's what's going on. This is white people exercising their privilege. This is white people exercising their privilege to tell a black man that he doesn't belong there. This is white people telling a black man where he can be and especially where he can't be. How the fuck have white liberals gone so far that now they think they're right, committing racism? Cause let's be real, if these white kids were conservative, and this black dude was Liberal, and all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he can and can't go, all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he is and isn't welcome, that would be called racism. Every one of those white kids would be called a racist piece of Shit. But somehow, because they're Liberal, we just ignore the racism. I'm certainly not going to",

I'm interested you to respond to that. And you got your face in your hands. What do you got to say to Scott? I have to say. I mean, look. I mean, you know, Scott's lying. And that's the problem with the Republican Party. It is continually addicted to lies. What am I? Wait a minute. What am I? What am I? You're lying. You're lying. You're lying, Scott. You're lying about the law. You're lying about what the jury was charged to find. They don't have to find an underlying crime. They had to find the intent to cover up an underlying crime. And the underlying crime was pretty obvious. What was the crime? You ran for public office, Scott. You. You ran for public office, Scott. You know, you can't take money from somebody and reimburse them to. For. As a. You know, if it's a campaign, you know that damn well. And you. Okay, fine. You're close enough.

Scott is. Scott is our colleague, and we're gonna treat him respectfully as such. Continue. Well, you should. Here's my question. If it is an obvious crime, why did the department of justice and the Federal Election Commission take a pass on it for the federal election? They should have prosecuted it. Should have been prosecuted on January 21. On January 21, 2,021. Let's look at this, okay? That's what we all know. This is the thing about Donald Trump. He's never been. He's never been. Donald Trump has been let off. He should have been indicted for. And the fact of the matter is, Donald Trump isn't treated special. But he wasn't. Hold on, please. David. It doesn't",

And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it.

Now, obviously, they didn't televise the trial, but reporters have already said what the prosecution said in their closing argument. That they acknowledge that Michael Cohen is a convicted purger, both in court and before Congress. They acknowledge that Cohen recently lied to a judge and falsified documents to get out of his probation. They also acknowledge that Cohen got caught lying three times on the stand in this trial by itself. But then they just said, well, despite all that, he's telling the truth about his accusations against Trump, which is a fucking batshit crazy argument to make. You're saying that, yes, he has lied in the past, yes, he has been convicted of lying. Yes, he has recently lied and forged documents to a judge, and, yes, he lied on the stand three separate times in one testimony. But what he said about Trump is true. He lied to the court about not wanting a pardon from Trump, and they proved that by showing the affidavit he signed requesting a pardon. He lied about not wanting revenge against Trump, and to prove it, they played his podcast where he said he wanted revenge against Trump. Also decided not to talk about the fact that Michael Cohen admitted to embezzling money from the Trump Organization. They basically just said everything Cohen lied about was to protect Trump. And that Michael Cohen, while he would lie to protect Trump, he would never lie to protect himself. Yeah, I mean, let's see how that works out.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hmm. So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date.",

The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground.

I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me.

But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions.

    "voice_to_text": "California. What the fuck is with the stoplights on your own ramps? So I went to San Jose for work last week, and I saw something that I've never seen in any other state. Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights. Somebody from California explain this to me.",

    "view_count": 210040,
    "voice_to_text": "When this trial against Trump is over, Michael Cohen is going to prison for a very long time. And it has nothing to do with all the crimes he's already been convicted of. It's because he just admitted to committing so many more fucking crimes. So he was asked on the stand about the $50,000 The Trump Organization gave him to pay Redfinch for IT services, where he admitted that only $20,000 of that actually went to Redfinch, and he kept the other 30,000. He said he believed it was a bonus he was due. Like, at its most basic, that's embezzlement. It's also theft by deception, theft under false pretenses, forgery because he made a fake invoice, wire fraud, male fraud, and even unjust enrichment. And the trial to charge him with all that would be the easiest shit ever. They could just replay his testimony from this trial, because he was asked about this directly, and he admitted to it directly. Trump's attorney asked him directly, did you steal from the Trump Organization? And he answered, yes, sir. That is an admission of guilt. The only way he escapes going to prison is they don't charge him with this crime. Which would be kind of weird to not do, considering he just admitted to committing the crime. It would be the easiest case ever. And the funniest thing was to watch the media try to defend what Cohen did. Lawrence O'Donnell actually said, oh, this wasn't so much Embezzlement, but more of a forced bonus. That's not how that shit works, Lawrence. You don't get to lie to a company, say you need money for these services, and then pocket some of it. That is embezzlement and fraud. Here's the thing. Even if Alvin Bragg doesn't actually prosecute Michael Cohen for this, the Trump Organization is gonna Sue Michael Cohen into the fucking ground. Michael Cohen, if he somehow manages to avoid prison, is going to be broke for the rest of his fucking life. Because the Trump Organization is not just gonna come for that 30 grand now. They're gonna come for far more damages than that. And it's not gonna be hard, cause he fucking admitted to it. Like, if you actually zoom out on this trial, it's kinda wild, because you have to think that this entire trial revolves around a convicted liar, perjurer, and a disbarred attorney, as well as a prostitute. Those are the only people who have anything to say in this case against Trump. And we've already found out when Stormy Daniels took the stand in this case, she lied. Like, that's been proven. And when Michael Cohen took the stand in this case, he was found to lie three times in one testimony. All of that proven as well. And now he just admitted to committing embezzlement against the Trump Organization. And Michael Cohen, hilariously, is still wondering why Trump didn't make him a part of his administration. It's cause You're a fucking criminal, Mike.",

The statute only provides me with two. One is fine of up to $1,000 for each violation. The other is jail. And I don't wanna exercise the jail option. It would be inconvenient.

    "voice_to_text": "Well, get ready, folks. President Biden just called out Donald Trump to debate him in a new video he just released. Take a look at it. Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hadn't shown up for debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. Let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. And in addition to this video, Biden put out a statement saying that he accepted the June 27th debate offer from CNN. And he accepted the second offer from ABC to have a debate with Donald Trump on September 10th. And then, well, Donald Trump accepted the dates. Well, so there will be two presidential debates as of now. And President Biden is right. He beat Donald Trump in the debates in 2020, and he's gonna do it again in 2024. And look, my prediction is that Donald Trump is not gonna show up for these debates. He's a terrible debater. He's gotten significantly worse since 2016 and even 2020, when people see how crazy he is in comparison to Joe Biden, who has done a lot of good stuff and is sane, they won't like him very much anymore. So if Donald Trump doesn't show up, he'll look like a coward. And if he does, he loses. It's a lose lose for the Trump campaign. Biden just boxed him in.",

But there's innocent humans out in Gaza getting murdered with our dollars. And those precious human lives are an extension of us. I can't get up here in a fur coat, jump around and pretend while in my gut and the ancestors yelling you better step up for us and sisters so much.

Have we not Learned the lessons, my love? The self centering around what is potentially threatening to us is actually at the root of what disconnects all of us. The word genocide is such a point of contention for some that it's more hurtful than seeing dead babies getting pulled out of the crumbled cement in the dust. Comparative suffering leads to believing the lie. There's a them and there's a us. It's a lie. We don't own this earth. We're just guests here, my love. And at some point in time we drew lines in the MUD based on the colour of our skin, the gods we worshipped and The divine up above. And historically, we've exploited black and brown bodies to climb up the rungs. But the latter doesn't work when it depends on the oppression of some. Hmm. Hmm. And I've been hearing the earth cry lately. Yeah, the deepest cries. My, oh, my, what have we done? We got some work to do to unlearn and rewire the plugs that are short circuiting in a selfish cycle. Than we're blind to the drug that we're all addicted to. Me, myself, I. And not us. In this moment in time, we're being called to rise and become. See ourselves in the pain of others and not separate from them. And i'mma say it till I die with my chest to the sky. Free Palestine!

So recently, a portal was installed in Dublin in New York, and it's supposed to act as a live camera between both locations. But it hasn't even been four days since it was installed. And we had a woman get arrested because of the portal for blocking people from seeing the screen. We had a flip off battle between Dublin and New York where people were flipping each other off, which started on Dublin side. A man also decided to do this in front of the portal, surprising everyone on the New York side. And now, out of disrespect, someone decided to show a picture of September 11 on Dublin side again. This all happened in under a week, and they're contemplating on doing something back to Dublin because of this. Many are also wanting the portal to be removed, specifically. Typically after this incident, now people are not happy. And all the problems we had regarding the portal surprisingly seem to be coming from Dublin. These problems, however, were anticipated, and it's the reason why the portal won't be up for much longer. Right now, it's scheduled to be removed in November. And many are glad that it's gonna be gone since it's been causing nothing but problems. And who knows, we might be getting the removal date even earlier if something crazier happens.",

According to the latest court filing, crooked Judge Cannon is now vacating the late may trial start date, claiming that pre trial deadlines have not been met and therefore the jury is not prepared to be presented with the facts in this case. But the only reason that pre trial deadlines have not been met is because Judge Cannon has been deliberately and intentionally delaying and delaying this case at the request of the man who appointed her to her position, the criminal defendant Donald Trump himself. So unfortunately, this postponement likely means that Donald Trump will not be going to trial for the crimes he committed or for the classified documents that he stole from the United States government in 2,024. And that is a complete and utter travesty to the rule of law, because justice delayed is justice denied.",

And I wanna be clear with you, legally and otherwise, both in the context of this trial and just him running for president right now. He has every right to talk that way, to describe himself how he wants. But as for the claim there, I can tell you factually, Donald Trump has rarely taken personal legal sacrifices. And the many different cases and probes that have been stared him and others, he often lets even his former close aids get in trouble, get subpoenaed, pay big legal bills, or even go to jail.

    "voice_to_text": "I find you in criminal contempt for the 10th time, said Justice Juan Mershawn, who said he is concerned that Donald Trump has not taken the heat of his prior findings. Going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sentence. The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. This gag order. He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order. But again, understanding the gravity of that situation and really what it would go into and making that decision happen.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on Wednesday vowed to force a vote next week on Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s (R-LA) ouster, setting up a scenario in which Democrats will provide the votes needed to save a Republican speaker\u2019s job.   \u201cI think the American people need to see a recorded vote,\u201d the Georgia firebrand told reporters. \u201cI think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d   Hardline Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated with Speaker Johnson, pointing to him frequently turning to Democrats for their support in passing key legislation like Ukraine aid, government funding and FISA warrantless surveillance.   \u201cMike Johnson is giving them everything they want,\u201d Rep. Greene said. \u201cI find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson. And you want to know something? I want to see it happen.\u201d   Rep. Greene initially filed her motion to vacate last month, but held off on triggering a vote, trying to use it as leverage to wield influence over the speaker. When she makes the motion \u201cprivileged\u201d next week, it will require the House to act on it within two legislative days.   The House will likely vote on a motion to table the motion to vacate, which will require a simple majority to shelve the effort.   So far, only two other Republicans have joined Rep. Greene\u2019s effort \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ) \u2014 but given the GOP\u2019s very slim majority, that would likely be enough to strip the speaker of his gavel absent Democratic support.   House Democratic leaders on Tuesday announced they would vote to table the motion, saying it was time to \u201cturn the page\u201d on the chaos in the House that\u2019s been driven by the hardline faction of the Republican conference.   Rep. Greene acknowledged her motion is likely to fail but said it would serve to get lawmakers on record.   \u201cIf this vote fails and the whole conference, the whole Congress, supports the \u2018uniparty,\u2019 let me tell you something, that is not a failure, it\u2019s a win for the American people because that\u2019s a list of names,\u201d she said.   #marjorietaylorgreene #speakerofthehouse #mikejohnson #cspan  ",

At the request of the university president, police cleared out a camp of pro Palestine protesters on the school's campus. The night before, protesters erected an encampment of around 50 tens on the main campus Lawton calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and what university president Doctor Manus Shafiq called a violation of quote, a long list of rules and policies. An email to students she seek wrote quote, I authorized the New York police departments and begin clearing the encampment. I took this extraordinary step because of these extraordinary circumstances. New York City Mayor Eric Adams waited on the incident at a press conference, echoing Shafique's message that the protesters had violated university policy with their 30 hour long demonstration. Amongst the protestors was Erisa Hirsey, daughter of democratic congresswoman Elon Omar. Hirsey and two others were suspended from Columbia and Barnard College, Columbia Sister School, for participating in the encampment. In total, 108 people were arrested. It was the first time mass arrest had been made on Columbia's campus since 1968 when students demonstrated against the Vietnam War. It wasn't the only time police interviewed on the Ivy League campus this week. This Wednesday, April 17th, police were on site as students protested the war in Gaza while University President Doctor Shafiq testified about anti Semitism on campus before Congress.",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I bring you a fresh book publishing scandal. For the Atlantic, the writer Tyler Austin Harper wrote an expos of the New York Times bestseller White Rural Rage, and he argues that the authors of this book conveniently misinterpreted research and data in order to prove their own thesis. I'm gonna focus on two main problems with the book White Rural Rage. The thesis of the book is that white rural voters pose a unique threat to American democracy. But as Harper points out in the Atlantic, the authors of this book never bother to define what the word rural means. The word rural is defined by different academic researchers in different ways, and the authors of this book, instead of picking one definition that would work for their argument, just decide not to choose a definition of all. So rural could mean anything. Avoiding giving a definition of what you mean by the word rural, which is in the title of your own book, Harper says, is like deciding to write a book about Irish people and then drawing on studies of Irish people from Ireland, Irish Americans, people who took a 23 and me test and Learned they were Irish, and people who like to get drunk in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day. The second big problem with this book is that to prove their thesis that the threat of political violence is particularly acute in white rural America, they cite an article titled The Rise of Political Violence in the United States that directly contradicts the claim they are making. This whole scandal reminds me of 2019 when Naomi Wolf had a book coming out about how gay men were treated in the UK in the 19th century. And then while she was doing this BBC interview, the interviewer asked her about her interpretation of this two word phrase that basically her entire thesis was based on, and she had completely misinterpreted those two words, meaning the entire point of her book was null and void.",

So, the minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us, regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have, or who we voted for. But we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition, or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for, and died for. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work, no interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get The attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't.
