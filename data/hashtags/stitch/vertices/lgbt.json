    "voice_to_text": "what is something that you really appreciate about your therapist? so I struggle with anxiety like a lot of bitches on the planet but my anxiety revolves around this like fear of real or imagined abandonment like I feel like people are going to like \u201cfind me out\u201d or see that I'm like truly a shitty person deep down and then like lose interest in me and dip and I've had a lot of therapists prior to the one I have now and the ones prior have always like on with the approach of like oh let's figure out things that you like about yourself and try to combat these inner feelings and realize that you are a good person and you are interesting and like it has helped with my self confidence a little bit but it hasn't really like helped with the fear of abandonment you know and what I really appreciate about therapist that I have now is that he decides to hold up like a mirror to my anxiety a little bit and what I mean by that is like he'll come back at me with like an outside perspective of my anxiety and like give me insight that I don't necessarily see when I'm in my own head and I'll give a few examples like my friend group in college like rapidly started expanding at one point and it made me super nervous cause I was scared that the friends that I have I had then we're going to lose interest in me and like latch on to these new friends instead and just like completely like cut me off and I remember talking to him about this like one specific person I was like \u201cyeah I'm just like kind of mad and annoyed they were like that this person was spending one on one time with this new friend and like they were laughing and having fun together and like without me you know I felt like excluded and I felt like my friend was losing interest in me in favor of this new person\u201d and then my therapist was like \u201cokay so you are mad and upset that your friend is happy and building new relationships that make them happy?\u201d and I had to like literally pause and I was like that look that makes me sound like a fucking dick cause like my anxiety wasn't like \u201coh you're mad because your friend's happy\u201d my anxiety was being like \u201coh you're mad because your friend is leaving you\u201d but from the outside perspective yeah it definitely looks like I'm mad at my friends for making new connections that make them happy and like another example is like when I'm meeting new people I always think that they like immediately hate me or like judging me or like think I'm stupid or whatever and again it's a very self hatred type of thought and anxious thought but my therapist paused and was like \u201cisn't it kind of rude of you to think that this random person you don't know is that mean that they're just gonna start immediately judging you?\u201d and then I was like yeah you're right that is kind of a mean thing of me to do like nothing has made me want to change my behaviour more so than realizing how my actions and my thoughts can affect other people and I've never had another therapist like brave enough I guess to like challenge my thoughts that way and I just really really appreciate it about him",

And dental dams are even more expensive because you have to buy them in bulk online. So instead of purchasing these, I go to Planned Parenthood and they give away bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives and even lube. They give it all away free in giant bags. So if you wanna practice safe sex and you wanna support an amazing organization, go to Planned Parenthood, let them know you wanna be safe and they will give you bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives. And if you are in between partners, be sure to get tested while you are there. It is a good idea to make sure you aren't bringing anything into your next relationship. So remember, practice safe sex and have fun.",

    "voice_to_text": "that was trans content creator Lily Tino talking about her gender reassignment surgery while sitting on a veranda outside at Disney World the video has gone viral and is getting a lot of negative responses and rightly so because nothing irritates me more than a self serving advocate Lily is very much aware that what she has just done is inappropriate in the environment in which she has done it there is nothing wrong with talking about gender reassignment surgery and educating people at an elementary level in the way that Lily was doing so in the video there is everything wrong with the environment that Lily chose to do it in and Lily knows that because Lily continuously says in the video I'm gonna get thrown out of Disney World for doing this because Lily knows that talking about sexually explicit content talking about adult genitalia in an environment that is specifically for children and families is a really bad idea it is an inappropriate thing to be doing but the thing with Lily is Lily doesn't care because her content is intentionally rage baiting the transphobes and is intentionally rage baiting the internet to engage with her videos so that she could potentially get finance or she just gets lots of views maybe she just enjoys pissing everybody off I don't know but it's an intentional strategy tactic so that people pay Lily specifically attention it has nothing to do with the desire to educate people on trans issues or on gender reassignment surgery it has everything to do with the fact that Lily wants to centre themselves and enrage people and rage bait people on purpose so that they'll engage with her and she'll be benefited from it potentially by finances because it doesn't matter if your content is being engaged with negatively or positively on TikTok you're still gonna get compensation if you get over a certain amount of engagement and nothing annoys me more than seeing an advocate do that to their community on purpose because we all know this has nothing to do with transgenderism that is not why people are angry at you people are angry at you because you are talking about adult genitalia and a children's environment which is inappropriate regardless of your gender if you are CIS if you are trans if you are non binary talking about genitalia an environment saturated with young people is completely inappropriate behaviour and I do not want to hear the argument of it's appropriate anyway we need to educate on trans rights and stuff listen you cannot be talking about genitalia like that in Disneyland in front of families because you couldn't do that if you were sis if I sat there and talked about my knob in the middle of Disneyland no one's gonna be very impressed with me either you know it's inappropriate so the content is not what's wrong it's the environment that you're doing in and Lily knows that and Lily is selling out intentionally to the rage baiters to prove point to herself that she can and get get this content to skyrocket and go viral that's what this is about and in doing so she's throwing the community the trans community under the bus because there are trans people and queer people who have fought and who work incredibly hard every day of their lives to try and undo the damage of history and undo and unpick the myths about transgenderism about queerness by actually educating people properly Lily is not trying to do that Lily is trying to anger people on purpose and in doing so in a child like a child friendly environment Lily is playing straight into the hands of the transphobes and she knows it she is helping to perpetrate the myths that trans people are inherently dangerous around kids JK Rowling is gonna look at this sort of content and use it and weaponize it against the trans community and Lily doesn't care as long as Lily's videos are getting likes and uh engagement it has nothing to do with wanting to educate people about transgender issues it has everything to do with Lily doing this on purpose for Lily's own self and it just makes my blood boil to think about all of the trans people and the queer people who are gonna go to Disney World land or work at Disneyland who are gonna be confronted by other people now because of this video because we all know that negative content like this about the trans community is gonna go far more viral than anything positive and so people are gonna be walking through Disneyland now and when they see a trans person be that a visitor or be that an employee they are just gonna think about this video because Lily has done this on such a viral scale enraged so many people with such intent but this is gonna be the first thing that people think about when they see a trans person at Disneyland Lily has single handedly raised question marks for all of the Disney parents who see Disney in their algorithm all of the time as to whether or not trans people are safe to be around whether with their kids that is what Lily has done because it is naive to believe that everyone is aware of transitions and everyone is a bigot that is not the case a lot of people are not aware of transitions and if you're just a family with kids you know and it's just not on your radar whatsoever and this is the first thing that you see maybe you're planning a vacation and the algorithm throw this this up you are gonna be immediately jumping to transphobic and homophobic rhetoric in your own head Lily has provided the foundation for hatred towards trans people she has helped to perpetrate and solidify and validate that myth that has been age old that queer people are inherently dangerous to kids and that is disgusting because Lily is doing it for her own benefit this has nothing to do with education nothing at all this is not progressive for the trans movement this is not freedom and if you think that because you're queer because you're trans and you can talk about these things wherever the hell you wanna talk about them then you really need to have a look at yourself and go this is not appropriate you can talk about anything in the right setting and children do need educating on transitions absolutely we need to teach children about gender we need to teach children about different people from different walks of life but we don't need to be doing it unprofessionally inappropriately while they're on a family holiday or day out with you know talking about genitals and doing it in the way that you are talking about your marshmallow tunnel you know it's inappropriate and that's the issue it's got nothing to do with the content because you can educate children on this but not at Disneyland not against the wills of those around them you know it's just inappropriate and it's makes my blood boil to think that Lily has done so much harm with this video on purpose on purpose go on their TikTok and look at all of their content it is intentionally rage baity Lily benefits from people getting angry at her and so she plays into it and in doing so massively damages her own community but it's okay because she benefits and that is just it's so disgusting",

My mutual posted this, and as a mattress actress myself, I just had to highlight some of the messages that I get because they're amazing. You can pause to read at the end, but I just wanted to say there's people talking about how they've never seen the representation of a butch and found dynamic like there. There are also people that find it healing and have said that they learn they can be intimate and intentional while also still being carnivorous and devouring their partner. And then there are these sweet guys who will come in and be like, is it okay that I'm here? Because, like, I know you're a lesbian. Wanna make sure you're comfortable. And I really appreciate that. I think I've built and fostered a really great community of people. I think everyone's welcome of any gender, orientation. I think anyone can benefit from healthy intimacy, representation. As well as the blogs that I write that go along with each video, I post two times a week almost. If you wanna follow the blog and join the community, you can find me on Instagram. I got so lucky with the kind of messages I get here. I'll show them now.",

Uh, it's still incredibly, uh, not accepted in the world to be transgender. Um, it's still seen as freakish and weird. People are still hate, crimed and killed just for being trans. Um, so when all you hear your entire life is anti LGBTQ rhetoric, uh, you wanna disassociate your sis, disassociate, disassociate yourself. You wanna disassociate yourself from them, from LGBTQ+ people, because you don't want that hate. You don't wanna be hated against. So you pretend like, oh, you did that. Those feelings you have don't exist, and you try to live the life that people have placed on you. And that's why Chris did that. And then I don't want to put words in her mouth, but she was probably like, I don't care what. How people will react to this. I want to be happy. So she came out as hope. She really is.

For some reason, in second grade, I got this, like, urge to tell people that I was cousins with Dylan and Cole Sprouse. You know, Zack, Cody. Off those two. I said Cody. Um, I would literally have my friends, they would write me letters because I told them, oh, yeah, like, I've been hanging out with Ashley Tisdale, Zac Efron, and Jesse McCartney. Um, I'm gonna be having a party with Dylan and Cole this weekend. And so I literally had these friends write letters to Justin McCartney. Ashley Tisdale. Justin McCartney was, like, the most popular, so I had a ton of letters given to me. Just every day, I would collect these letters and, um, to Alia Hagen, Olivia, Dicky, Maggie, Petro, I do apologize. You guys probably know by now that I am not.

And just to add, those email addresses that, yes, you, Alia, Olivia, and Maggie were emailing, that was me. Okay? It was me. Dylan Sprouse 14 Yahoo com. Me.",

    "voice_to_text": "And so many cisgender critics are breaking this down to a film about fandom and friendship and that is just so wrong I actually think it is super important that the message of I saw the TV glow just goes over the heads of so many cis people because it is not exploitative the movie is not like here is this trans person let's all feel bad for this trans person this movie is not invite cis people to pity a trans person for 90 minutes this movie points at the cis audience and says you either understand what this person is going through or you think they are mentally ill so many trans movies are like this person is so haunted and they're so brave for being themselves and they're so hated by society and they're so misunderstood and I saw the TV glow I was like no this person is not brave this person is suffering this person is dying and nobody cares and they know it they know that that's going on but they do not care they're looking the other way in the movie the Justice Smith character is like if I don't think about it it's not real and it didn't happen which reminds me of a lot of things that are going on right now but I think that that's also like how cis people view trans people just because like trans people as a group have become like a tool for like Cis people and for like the cis political spectrum this is like kind of gone away but do you remember like right after October 7th a bunch of people like what you can't you have to vote for Joe Biden you have to vote for Joe Biden because of trans people that was always something that made me like deeply uncomfortable my suffering is not a tool for you to use to prop up like a monster  this is not something to fix by voting for the right person there's only something that you can fix by paying attention by actually seeing people and that's like what's part of what's so powerful about the movie is that it's like it's not just that you need to give people access to these things it's that you need to like let people feel free to use them none of that matters if people are still forced into the closet so people don't feel free to be themselves the problem is not just the government is not just Republicans the problem is his people it is you not paying attention not caring not seeing people",

Maybe there are queer people checking him, and, you know, I'm just not seeing it, but I should be seeing it far more than I am. Like, it. It.

I obviously could not have anticipated the amount of response that I'd get to that. And it's sad, really, to think that there are so many people out there who are struggling. And I promise I will stop making videos about this, but it is blowing my mind a little bit, because, like, what can we do as adults? It's so hard to make friends, but there are so many of us that are there just wanting to make friends, and I wish I could do something about it, like on a big scale, um, but on a. On a smaller scale. I have made a WhatsApp group, um, which is at the minute, about 150 people. And I made a discord server, which is about 100 people. And it's just been amazing to see people interacting with each other, to see people having a laugh. I've not laughed so much in such a long time. We've had, uh, among us nights, we've had call of duty. We've had many, many voice notes in the WhatsApp. And people who said, I'm scared to join, I'm nervous to join. What if no one likes me? Are now in there everyday chatting, talking, sharing pictures, talking about our gardening, talking about books. It's just been incredible. I've tried really hard to make sure that I've Replied to every single message, every single comment. And I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me in whatever way from this video. If I have missed your comment, if I have missed your message, I'm sorry. I'm really trying to get through everything. Um. It's just been like, on a level that I just don't. I never knew could even be a thing. I don't know how influencers do it because I. This is a full time job. Just. Just replying to. To these messages. But not in a bad way, in the best way, because it's so great to meet people and it's been just fantastic. So once again, if you wanna join the WhatsApp, if you wanna join the discord, please send me a direct message. Or if you just want a friend, please just send me a message. It doesn't have to be that you join the groups. If you just want someone to chat to, I am here. But if you do wanna join the groups, I can guarantee you that there is an amazing person or people multiple in both of those groups. So just waiting to be your friend.",

Let's talk about the fact that when sexual assaults do occur on college campuses, 99.7% of the time it is cisgender men who are sexually assaulting cisgender women. And 85% of the time sexual assaults on transgender people are also perpetrated by cisgender men. Let's talk about the fact that 32% of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having to withhold food and water from themselves in order to make it through a workday without having to use the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that 8% of those same group of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having had urinary tract infections as resulted withholding water from themselves and holding in using the restroom for an entire work day. Let's talk about the fact that doctors are aware of this. And in fact, when there's when a doctor who knows how to work with trans people is screening a patient, it's one thing that they know to look for because it's so common compared to the rest of the population to have urinary tract infections as a result of anxiety around the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that when I was in high school, a friend of mine who was out as trans had to cross the street To use the a different restroom in a different building every single time they needed to relieve themselves. Let's talk about the fact that I've been sexually assaulted and it didn't matter what was on my birth certificate. Let's talk about the fact that everyone fucking deserves to be safe. And instead of trying to work towards a safer world, you're contributing to rape culture by blaming transgender women instead of facing up to the fact that it's cisgender men, cisgender straight men who specifically are causing all of these issues around safety.",

Ever since I was young I knew something was different about me I knew that I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom I didn't fit in with the other boys Uh, I like things that they said only \"women\" like Like, I liked the color pink I liked the color purple Uh, and that was because I knew that I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom When I became an adolescent and I started to look at myself in the mirror and the puberty I was going through didn't align with what I knew was in my mind When- whenever I looked in the mirror it looked like I was staring at a mockery that my body was laughing at myself and taunting me with this prison I wanted to hurt myself I wanted to change I wanted to fight against this thing that was all consuming and inevitable... because I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom Some days I'd go into the shower and I turned the water up high I turned up so high it felt like the skin was melting off my bones I wanted pain I want to be free from this body I wanted to do anything to get out of it... because I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom Eventually I went to Planned Parenthood and I spoke with psychiatrist and it turned out it was a lot easier to get on HRT and I felt this immense relief because I was finally free from this curse that I've had all my life now I could assault women in the --- women's restroom I grew my hair out I went thrifting found some nice pieces I got some makeup and I learned how to put a little bit on this isn't too much but I'm proud of what I've gotten to because now I can assault women in the women's restroom",

Um, a lot of black women have been talking about, and they are the ones that you should listen to when it comes to that conversation. But even I am gonna say, as a white person, stop being fucking racist. You make our community look like fucking clowns. With that being said, I'm gonna go to the next point. You do realise that first of all, if trans rights are gonna be stripped away, your rights are gonna be next. First of all, the. The conservatives all around the world used. Are using the same tactics that they used against gay people way back, way back. Dehumanizing, demonizing and all that kind of stuff. And also, the real people you should be scared of touching, your little nieces, little nieces and nephews are youth pastors, like cisgender men. And sure, there's few more predators. There's few more predators, too, okay? But, SIS, trans people are responsible for most sexual related crimes. And it's a quick Google search. Like, yes, I'm not denying that, um, that trans people can't. Can't commit crimes, but that does not give you the fucking right to demonize us. Like, I'm not even a trans woman. I will with my whole heart and fucking soul stand With my trans men, women, non binary people, everyone. People. POC, trans people, BIPOC, trans people, everyone. I'm just so fucking mad that a car has to come from inside of the house. But, yeah, here we are. And also, um, I'm not gonna talk about how you, uh, tell white people, who are rightfully also uncomfortable by you basing your caricature off of a black woman, how you tell them to shut up when you're not even black yourself. You're not even black yourself. You're not even black. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit.",

So basically the reason why he believes that trans women should not be allowed in women's restrooms is because the fear of them hurting little children because they were once biological men first. And to an extent, I kind of like, understand where it's coming from, but in the same context, trans women at once again are not men. They're not men. They do not think the way that a lot of these biological men do. They do not see the water in the way that a lot of these other biological men do. And it's perpetuating this dangerous ass narrative that queer people are trans people are pedophiles. And it's just like, what a narrative that has long been falsely tied to the queer community from straight people. And it's just like, really gross and it's awful. Not only that, but the huge reason why people are agreeing with him is because he's assembling the straightness, and straight people love it when gay people, they might just straightness and they can use us as a puppet to perpetuate a narrative that is fucking wrong. When a lot of these are ape cases and cases against children are committed by self identifying straight men, and like, it's just wrong and I don't know. This video is weird. And to be honest, I think it lacks a lot of thought process. I get where it's coming from, but in the same tone, it's weird.",

She does a great job calling out Lily this entire process. Um, hi, Lily. Me again. Thanks for a little shout out in your video, Queen. You didn't do it directly. I know, because there's a lot of people that made videos about it. Mine got like 4 50 k, I think. So, yeah, I think you probably saw it. Um, you are still aware that it was wrong. And we knew this was gonna be, like, the fake apology you're gonna give us. What. What's the goal here? What's the angle? You wanna be the one to, like, normalize talking about what your business is down there in front of children and the world to see? No, don't. If you want to have that conversation off to the side, or maybe not at a kid's place, I could even live with that, like, more than I can with how you did it. But the fact that you want to come out here and you're talking about being visibly trans and being visibly queer and all these spaces, that's not what you're doing. What you're doing is visibly making a mockery of us and making it so much harder on just regular, everyday trans people because you have this massive following. I'm just a nobody trans person on the internet. You know? I'm not Gonna get seen by millions of people, you know, but whatever. I hope you're having fun, queen. Go back to, like, trying to get waiters cancelled or whatever, like, stick you're going for next. Love that. For you.",

    "voice_to_text": "I've seen a lot of posts going around about why everybody's getting sober, and I'm gonna explain to you why this is happening. If you haven't seen the original creator's video, go back and watch it now, because he makes a really, really good point about how we're literally just getting smarter as a society and realizing that alcohol is horrible for us and we should probably not be drinking it the way we did every single weekend. Now being 24, almost 25, I think I'm in the age group where I have outgrown those 19 20, 21 year old college days where I felt it was really cool to just get blackout drunk and make really stupid mistakes. But I do want to add another layer to this, specifically in regards to the gay community and the LGBTQ community. So many of us spent our lives trying to prove that we are worth it, trying to prove to other people that we have a place and that we are productive members of society. And in doing so, we found ourselves in really demanding work environments, 9 to 5 corporate jobs that don't allow us to properly process and feel our emotions the way that humans should do. I think we can all agree that in 9 to 5 work schedule, especially in New York City, which is where I live, is actually the exact opposite of how humans were meant to live. This being said, it's very profitable for bars. Um, to cater to that emotional wound that a lot of adults, gay people are carrying. Hence why, especially in the gay community, it seen as such a cool, fun thing to just go out and do a ton of drugs, drink a ton of alcohol, go to these circuit parties, just go to the bar. That's, like, the only activity, it feels like, that gay men want to do in New York City anymore. I think everybody has to learn this lesson for themselves, though, to really, really, truly understand. And if that means embarrassing yourself, draining your bank account, feeling horrible self esteem issues because you've gone out and drink every single night for two weeks, then so be it. But as a collective community, so many of us are ready to heal. So many of us are tired of being slaves to our own emotional wounding, being slaves to our own lust and the lust of others. And the only way it's gonna heal and the only way it's gonna start is by making collective decisions to do shadow work, inner healing, and forgive the ones that have hurt us to the point that we can't move on. Because everybody deserves to move on.",

    "voice_to_text": "One thing I find consistently interesting is the comfortability of bisexual women to get on the internet and come into clear spaces to complain about biphobia, when most of the time that is the most clear interaction you have had in your entire life is to get on here and complain about it. Because you don't enter queer spaces, you don't engage with the community at all because you're too busy dating homophobic, heterosexual, cisgender men. And you wonder why we don't wanna date you, because the majority of the time we have nothing in common. I don't have really anything in common with people that probably center men in their lives. Not saying you all do, but if you consistently dated men and only men, and you sit around with your friends and talk about men, we probably have nothing in common. Why would I want to date somebody like that? I probably. I'm not really even friends with people like that, so why would I wanna date you? Most of you do not know how to conduct yourself within queer spaces. Most of you don't know how to treat women because the only example you have of that is how your boyfriends treat you and all the other men that are circulating around you. Because majority of you hang out with heterosexual people and not queer people. That's why you don't have clear experiences. That's why they're not knocking down your doorstep. And then you get on here And act surprised. And it's the internalized misogyny and internalized homophobia which is really, like, blatant at the fact that you feel more comfortable coming over here to complain instead of complaining to the people that are majority actually being actively homophobic and biphobic, but those are the people you're still choosing to date. So it's a really strong cognitive dissonance. And I don't understand where it's not clicking that lesbians don't wanna participate with that type of mindset. Like, I, I, I don't, and I'm no lesbian is here. We are not responsible for holding your hand through queer experiences. Sure, there's some lesbians that would gladly do it, but it is not our cross to carry at all. So it's the same thing as if someone's in the closet. I'm 23. I'm not dating somebody that's in the closet. I'm not doing that. I'm not saying that being in the closet is bad. Some people need to be in the closet. I'm not participating in a relationship with someone in the closet because I don't want to, and I shouldn't have to, because that is more weight for me to carry when relationships are already hard. Me having to teach you how to be queer is not my job, and it's not any other lesbians job. So maybe do a little deconstruction, check your ego out the door, and then come over here and engage peacefully with people that are actively queer in their everyday lives and have To deal with it. And not people that are participating in heterosexual relationships, which are widely and socially acceptable. So I don't know. Y'all just have a lot to say, and I would just really like it if you kept the same energy with everybody in your life, instead of coming over here and leaving, starting a complaint box with people that you don't even interact with anyways.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi there. For those of you who are not the guy that made the video that I just stitched, go ahead and go back and watch his video, because I think it's important for context. But for the guy who made the video: hi. I'm a Queer man, and I think there are some really unique insights that I might be able to give you that we can l share and maybe learn together? I think that your video has a lot of valid points, and I think that it can really help foster some empathy. The first thing I wanna talk about is that, you talk about how your friends and your family do not have or bear any responsibility for the way that they view you, and while that might be accurate to a degree, because as you acknowledge society does this thing, it is also on them to see you for who you are. That is valid. And I found myself vibing with a lot of what you're saying just in terms of my own experience of coming out as Queer and about how I have to mask in certain settings. I can't just automatically be who I am everywhere, and I think that because you at least present to be a cisgendered, straight man -- and I could be wrong on that so please feel free to correct me -- because that is my impression of you. And because your world experience seems to indicate that, it seems to me that what you're not getting is that you have not been used to having to face this? You haven't had to really question this before? But I've had to deal with it in my coming out and even in my day to day life... We as Queer people, a lot of times we have to be a certain way, in certain settings. We aren't allowed to just be who we are. Even when it comes to Pride events we're expected to be polite or respectful or out of the way and we're expected to not really push boundaries or things like that... That's a societal thing. And it puts us in a box, and it feels exactly the way you're talking about... and it sucks. and at least from my experience, because I'm only speaking from my experience. That's how it is for me, and it is so hard. It is so hard. And a lot of times it is the cisgendered straight people who have the hardest time getting it, but then here you're saying a lot of these things, and I think that that is what is... what is that cognitive dissonance for you. I think that you're dealing with an experience that your life hasn't had you face, really. I think that this experience is probably also a lot more common among people than we give others credit for, and I think it's important that we have these conversations, and we're open and honest about it, and together we can foster empathy, and we can learn to be better together. When it comes to any feminine thing... (\"feminine,\" right?) I like to paint my nails. but I have straight friends who like to paint their nails. I know people who like to do that. I know straight men who wear makeup, even though I like to wear makeup, I'm the one that gets criticized for it, right? Even if you can't tell that I'm doing it, and it's just one of those things that... It's society, man. It's society. and that's why you hear people in certain communities always talking about, we need to question these things in society. That's why we need to try to work to basically deconstruct all these things that we have been told,  because it's hard. Life is hard. Everyone is just looking for love. Everyone is just looking for support. Everyone is just looking for a little bit of dignity. that's the way life is, and unfortunately, there are some of us who have to face this more often. I would question your constant excusing of your loved ones not acknowledging this for you. because that's something that we as Queer people have to face pretty early on too, is that, there is a degree of responsibility on our loved ones to be accepting of what we're going through and to acknowledge us. That is just a baseline for respect and love, and if those people are constantly making your problems about themselves, then that's a problem with them, and I would question if that's a healthy relationship? And if you maybe don't need to work on that... or even maybe question how much you should invest in those relationships. Right? For me, when I came out, my parents said something like, \"You know we love you, but we don't love your partner, and we don't love the what you do and blah blah blah...\" Right? They were being kind of horrible, because what they really were telling me is they love an idea of me and when that idea of me does not match... Lord, that... if you hear that, that's the squirrels fighting in front of me. They're right in front of me, because the animals where I am are kind of tame. Sorry about that. lizard brain... But, my parents were telling me they love an idea of me. They weren't telling me they love me. Even though that's what their words were saying that's not what they were actually saying. They love an idea of me and they were not willing to do the work. So I had to more or less cut them down significantly as far as how much I interact with them. You may choose differently for yourself, but just wanted to offer some insights and maybe help a little bit. I know that it's hard what you're going through and I think that your specific experience offers a really unique opportunity to foster empathy and growth and maybe you can use your experience to compare with others and share with others who don't have the reach that someone like me or anyone else would have? Together we can help each other be better, and maybe make the world a little bit of a better place? So... peace, love. Remember, everyone deserves  love, respect, and dignity. Everyone. Thank you for listening. Sorry for the length of the video, and I hope this helps.\u2764\ufe0f",

But wait, no, you knew that it was wrong because your video starts with you saying that you're gonna get banned from Disney. So not only you did this, but you also knew that it was wrong and fucking disgusting. There is an appropriate time and space for educating people on such things, because, yes, talking about such things is beneficial, but not in fucking Disneyland, where kids run around you, and believe me, they do not want to listen about your genitals.

And she is probably the way you dress, she's probably in not into females or you're not her type. If you keep thinking that way, you're not gonna get nobody. I'm pretty sure everybody wants you. But at the end of the day, buddy, you can't think that way. You probably fail at so many things, you. You probably look at me like, you know what? I'm gonna give this a try. And then you succeeded, you know, if you understand where I'm coming from. That makes no sense. Do all mask and lesbians think like this? I'm just asking. Just asking. If I shoot my shot at somebody and they reject me, I probably think that I'm not their type. They're not into people like me, you know? Are they not into people, like, with mental illness or not?

but it's almost like when you are asking for something and god universe whoever if you have a higher belief it's almost like you will not be handed something you are not ready for you may feel like you are ready for it but it's almost like are you truly ready to handle the love that you are asking for type of thing of course you may not know that until you get into a relationship you know what I mean until you see that for yourself but it's almost like in these cases and that emphasizes heavily amongst everybody it is okay and it is understandable to feel romantically alone it is okay to feel how you are feeling it is okay to feel these heavy emotions that comes with feeling alone isolated with romantic love it is okay to feel how you feel and allow yourself to be validated about that even when no one else around you is and the best piece of advice I can say is you know the phrase let it hurt let it heal let it let it go it's almost like allow yourself had to feel it right journal it out cry it out scream it out do what you need to do in a healthy way but also try not to focus try not to dwell too much almost emotion because the more you fixate on this sad feeling the more that's going to keep it's gonna keep you in this spiral it's only going to keep you further in this this no this loop but that's easier than done but you know it all starts somewhere even if by doing simple things and this goes to my next point when you feel these in moments of intense emotion the triggers the best thing you can do is to be there for yourself not to say in the whole self care way right but in those moments we really feel very rough we feel very hard on yourself when you feel very pessimistic those are the most important times to where you can need to be there for yourself where you willing to tell yourself I am worthy of love I am deserving of love I am meant for love it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks love is meant for me because my heart is open and my prayers have been said and this isn't about me but from personal experience I resonate with every single thing that she said in that video I felt that exact way before it's almost like why I've been doing so much been trying so hard and it feels like the love that comes easy for others doesn't come easy for me it feels like I'm it feels like I'm cursed with another person's curse it's almost like I'm going through a battle that's not mine type of thing so it's almost like as easy it is to keep yourself in the victim mentality try to use that as instead of asking why in a victim way try to change that why into to like okay so why isn't this happening am I still healing from something ? do I have something too work on? am I truly ready for the love that I seek you know it can be different areas and I hope I'm making sense here but I'm trying not to dive too far off topic but the main point is I want to let everyone know that it is okay again it is okay to feel romantically alone that feeling of loneliness with love it is okay to feel how you are feeling validate yourself journals out screaming out crying out do what you need to do but this is your reassurance this is my reassurance to you guys that love is on the way especially you have been praying your intentions have been set your heart knows that your heart is open the more it's almost like it may not seem like it but you have already what you've already said is all like it's already wrapped up in a nice little package ready to be shipped to you it's just a matter of time of when it is ready to come your way and when you are ready to receive it what you require is a lot different to others that's where you need to stop comparing your journey to others well why is this person in a relationship and I'm not that's comparison is the thief of joy this person may have wanted a salad and you wanted the steak dinner and in relationships they wanted something different than you did and that is okay you may at the end of the day your food still gonna come you're not gonna be exempt from it may take a little longer because what you require something different you require more you desire more you want something more fulfilling keep that in mind when you witness a lot of relationships happening around you keep in mind that I am not exempt from a relationship I just require something different and my what I desire is already on the way it's already I put the order in it's on the way the order's the package is about to be shipped and delivered to me but yeah just know that you guys are definitely meant for love all you guys you guys are deserving you guys are worthy of it and again remember to always validate your emotions because despite the hustle culture despite the money culture culture whatever maybe whatever people may tell you it is okay to want love it is okay to crave love it is okay to desire love but try not to let your focus of wanting love cloud out the happiness that you can bring in for yourself and bring it in your life in the present moment the more you focus on the future and what you don't have the more you steal your own happiness in the present and as annoying as it may seem as annoying as it is to have to remain patient that's the best thing for you to do instead of focusing on it and spiraling so just continue to do what you're doing continue to establish yourself to secure yourself and try not to look as relationship as reward from it you know try to just do things for you for your life establish yourself for you make happy memories for you and love will come love will come it always does and never fails love comes when you're not looking and chasing after it because I believe that the moment you hyperfixate on love and you put your happiness on a relationship you steal your joy away at the end of the day a relationship should be in addition to not instead of that isn't to say that you know she cause she didn't say it but ultimately again it's just uh it's understandable if you're tired exhausted stressed anxious about love just know it is coming it's just gonna take a little more time and that's okay because it's gonna be something worth waiting for",

Being trans and someone who was significantly being impacted by years of disordered eating, lack of movement and quite frankly hiding behind mt weight has been a lot to work through.  I\u2019m so in love with the gym, the affirming feeling of working out, and the mental health rewards that I\u2019ve found in this process.

To garner the reaction that Cara and Georgia had to Priya and the voting, um, because I don't know it, I, I need it to make sense, that reaction I, I get TV shows will cut things to make things more dramatic and seem a certain type of way, but I'd really love to know what they had cut out, um, just to understand their reaction a little bit more, because it's so jarring, like, so jarring how they react.",

And, um, you might recall, it was because I've been writing a book, and my parents kept asking to read it, and so I had come out to them to explain that it was a bisexual fantasy. And it went terribly, and I lost everything for a book that I thought I was just gonna digitally publish on Amazon and maybe four people would read. And it was really just for me. I wrote it for an audience of one. I wrote the book I always wanted to see myself in. And at the time, I didn't have this online community that I have now. And for no reason at all, you turn this book that four people were supposed to see into a bestseller. I have no publishing house, no agent. You did this. And today is its birthday. Happy birthday, the Knight in the moon.",

The Bible defines pride as having an arrogant, haughty attitude that leads to an inflated sense of self or self importance. You know, like a kicker telling anyone what they should be doing. That is different from Gay Pride. LGBTQIA+ pride is about standing up against injustice and oppression and saying we are who we are and we are here, and we're not going anywhere. We want equal rights, and we just. It's not about being better than anyone else. It is about, like, standing our ground and just, like, being okay with who we are. Like Psalms, chapter 82, verse 3, that says to defend the weak in the oppressed. Or Proverbs, chapter 31, verse 8, that says to defend the rights of the needy. Or Isaiah, chapter 1, verse 17, that literally says, do good, seek justice, and correct oppression. HARRISON and I know, I know. When a word has two meanings, it's really hard. And I was raised Catholic. I know we don't read the Bible. I know that. But this is all work that you get to do as a spiritual person. I had to do it in deconstructing my faith and learning to be a proud queer person. But, um, Google's free.",

Now, I've never been on the dating app, so I kind of empathize for all these stories that I hear, but I met mine at Starbucks. He was my barista. He was making me coffee every day.

No, it's not fine when you accommodate haters by letting them feel comfortable having their fucking hateful beliefs. It's why we still have these fucking haters. They gain ground that way. I have so much fucking disrespect for people who say that. I don't, I, I think what you said after that was something that I would be in agreement with usually, but because you said that, like, I totally checked out from you. Who told you that that was an okay standard to have? Tell a homophobic parent of a queer child that they have a right to their homophobic beliefs, that's fine. No, it's the fuck not. Or even tell a homophobic parent to a non queer child that they have a right to their beliefs, that's fine. No, it's the fuck not. Jesus fucking Christ, like, why the fuck do I feel like I have to be fucking parents to older people than me, you know, cause they have such fucking bad takes. I'm so fucking sick of that standard. You're fucking selling yourself short by saying that, by the way. I do not give you fucking consent to tell that fucking closet case, Harrison Buttner that he has a right to his homophobic beliefs, that's fine. The fuck. Who the fuck are you? And this isn't just to this creator that I'm stitch, if you feel like, like, That ideology, that, like, way of thinking that people have a right to their beliefs, even if they're hateful. You still have a lot of, like, work to do on yourself. A lot of things to deconstruct and unpack. it's a fucking burden for me to have to tell people older than, you know, like, how to just be a fucking decent person. So, again, for any fucking idiots in the back, no, it's not okay for them to have those beliefs, and it's not fucking fine. Get better.",

    "voice_to_text": "Can we talk about why you've never seen a smart Twink? Strong disagree. Let's do some gay science. So I've never seen a Twink who doesn't have something extraordinary about them. And by large, they are academically very gifted. But let's try and figure this out. So I would agree that the Twink persona, the TP, it does include, you know, dumb. It has. It has a legally ball on to ask thing about it. But this is where I think things diverge. I think this persona, then entering this culture, happens after they have gone through school, after they have gone through, like, everything. So they end up being bullied, right? And they end up going through bad things before the Twink persona. And what do people who are bullied do? They sit in their room. And what happens when you sit in your room? You learn shit. And so this is the theory I have for whitewink. Inexplicable skill that no one knows about or why. They have a series of random things that they know how to do that there is no explanation. And this goes to my greater thesis of the peak of this example is the drag Queens, because they know how to do everything. You ever talk to a drag queen? They're very intelligent. So, yeah, I think the Twink persona expects you to be dumb. But prior to getting the Twink persona, because you're gay, you sit in your room a lot. You Learn a lot of shit. And then once you're in Twink persona, there are other expectations. Uh, you know, you have to learn how to dress. You have to learn how to do, you know, your face, whatever. That you put those skills to use, furthering them. And then when you hit twink death, right around 20 or 21, you have to bring back the other skills. And that leads to the final goal of drag.",

    "voice_to_text": "hi hi I'm really happy about everything you said everything every point that you said was perfect but I would like to just focus on exactly that sentence was where you say that western ideologies are not gonna come with western bombs but this is exactly plays in the agenda that people like to hear that being queer is actually western ideology but it's not western ideology I am Arab I am queer we exist we've always existed and on the second I would like to remind everybody that all the homophobic law that came at least to my area in the Wena region and West Asia North Africa came with colonization and let me tell you about how it happened in Egypt okay so I'm not gonna really mention dates because I'm not really good at remembering dates but this is exactly what happened British colon colonizers were there British soldiers were in Egypt you know Egypt was colonized by the British for at least eighty years and without of course adding up all the revolting against them whatever we did again but guess who was really really really working against the British sex workers in Egypt and a small tiny info sex work in Egypt has never been illegal since ancient Egypt there has been sex workers in Egypt legally working part of the society and it's a wizard respectful respectful job still the British king and of course they started working against the British so do what did the British do they went to street called high as Bakay and basically they burned the entire street so according to some people some books I think I read but most of these books are in Arabic so I don't know how to bring them here but some books actually mention that they even went inside every single house and they threw all their all of their cardboards all of their wooden items their furniture all of their stuff they threw it from top of the buildings and they burned the entire street and that's when they put one of the laws that now are taking homophobic almost most of the home people almost of the gay or the LGBT community in Egypt this law was basically that you cannot do anything against morality this word doesn't even exist in Islam this thing of like against nature against morality it absolutely does not exist in Islam so this is not western ideology so basically the first law one of the first laws that were put in Egypt against the jury community was put by the british to control sex workers and that's it another case was also Lebanon by the French Tunisia Morocco Algeria by the French Ghana by the British so we cannot ever say we can never say there's the western ideals it's just wrong it's just plays exactly for their agenda for these homophobic for these islamophobic people that this one I've always been fucking there homophobic and they killed everybody in the world and they killed all the queers and all the gays but I would like to also introduce you to I'm a Rocky researcher his name is Mussa Al Shadeedi  and he's being attacked massively in his country and Iraq but he actually talked to me about the connection between the insane homophobia that's happened in Iraq and the connection with the American invasion so basically after I don't know if you know this or not but Abu Ghreib it's not incident torture accident that the when the American soldiers basically started torturing Iraqi prisoners and and there I don't know dungeons and undergrounds or whatever and the pictures emerged and all of us in the Middle East we all of us we have seen all of us have seen that my dad saw that and we were even using CDs to see these stuff because what did the Americans have look what of the Americans have done to us the problem with this is and also she did he mentions this in his book which is basically the return of the colonizer to its youth but but he basically mentions how an act of love between two people man and man woman and woman or non binary people or whatever the gender was these two acts used to be for love between people till the American army came and they used it to humiliate them they used this technique they used sexual activities that could should be and could be consensual and between lovers to humiliate the men or to humiliate the population and then you have an explosion of homophobia in the area this is what happens on a second thought also there's another book I don't remember the writer's name but it's called ishtihet a lot of which basically meaning fetishism of the Arabs and let's talk about the entire history of how Europe used to perceive the Arabs and how they basically put a microscope on our sexuality and how we're doing things and don't get me wrong fucking Arabs were having so much fun sex parties gayness queerness and this is not western ideologies and we can ask the ottoman empire that califord the Abbasid Empire the fatimater empire all of them we have existed in the Islamic nation in the big Islamic OMA till colonialism and Europe started to come to us till the Western Christian ideology started to hitting us also the last thing that I would mention in the book is to have a lot of which is the fitzism of of Arabs um it talks about how Westerns Westerners or white people when they came to Turkey or they came to the Islamic OMA and they saw all this the sexual activities they shamed us they shamed us for it and they called the Arabs the people that do sodomy this is basically how they identify the Arabs are the people that you have anal sex because when one of the books actually they said they were very relieved to find one share one uh big king and the Islamic era that actually liked women and they were very surprised because he was one of a kind for them and it was how finally they found one that was decent like them they shamed us for our sexual activities and then they took it away from us and then they categorized it and then they start to say let's be inclusive this is what happened in our history the last thing I would say is if you if me or or Mosa Shadidi what we've been trying to do for the lessons I came to France is to basically look for my queer Arab art for my queer Islamic art and guess where it is it's in the louv metropolitan and Italy I cannot have access to it I do not have access to it Musa Shadidi at the beginning of his book regard most Amor Sabah and if you want it I can send it to you and we've been trying to translate this book so many times but needs a lot of funds of course it doesn't play perfectly for the western agenda but so beginning of his book he writes a whole big paragraph about how many museums he thinks for allowing him to take a look at our art at him as a researcher and basically he's saying absolutely no thanks to the Louvre or I think it's another British um museum that refused to give him access and they put all of the square art in their fucking in the in the in the junk in the in the closet where I don't know what you call it yeah they keep it in their storage so basically not even people that can go there can see I cannot find my queer earth I cannot find my queer Islamic art I cannot find my queer air freak African art because it's still in the houses of western elites and it's not a western ideology we've existed in an entire throughout the entire history of time and the last thing I do not feel as a part of the LGBT community anymore and I prefer saying queer because all I saw after October 7th and all of these western medias that have been talking about my identity and playing with my identity to justify the killing and the genocide of people I do not feel like I belong to the LGBT community anymore not these western ideals not these western ideologies last thing funny story the word sohop which is basically what lesbians do it in Arabic it's called sohop which basically means grinding grinding the Islamic scholar that went to Egypt he found women doing something very bizarre and he wrote about it and this is what all these Arab or Muslim researchers have been doing some of them are not even Arab they were just Muslim some of them were Iranian some of them were from India some of them were from all over the Islamic OMA if you try to find any of these books you will find them marked as erotica on Google you will find that you can really access them you can even see them all of these were researches that were done by Muslim scholars all over the Islamic Uma all over the Islamic times and",

    "voice_to_text": "not only do I really like this video it also helped me pinpoint a feeling that I've been trying to get at for a few years now people really don't help their friends anymore with things that they're struggling with and of course I think there's many different reasons for that happening obviously the biggest one being that we had a pandemic and we were all isolated from each other for about two or three years but especially for people in my age group for example I turned 23 this week and I remember having relationships in high school like this where I was very hands on I was very intuitively like I know that you need help with this you can't help yourself so I'm going to help you do it but even outside of things like a pandemic I think whenever you encounter different kinds of rejection when you encounter different kinds of rejection when you go through certain conflicts or just separations with friends or if you just have a lot of shame whether it comes from friends or family you kind of develop this attitude where you decide to be hands off on people's struggles even if they clearly need help for some people it's like a self preservation thing where they're like this is gonna inconvenience me too much I'm already over simulated all the time I can't afford to help them which is very unfortunate but more often than not that is one group of people the other side is people who are more prone to be obedient who are more prone to feeling shame and just like low self esteem because you think oh I can like sense in my spirit that this person needs help but I don't wanna make them angry by you know trying to do this for them because like oh I'm pushing at their boundaries they obviously don't want help they obviously you know they got it they got it because it it just makes you feel less overwhelmed and you don't wanna lose them and it it's it's really kind of a complicated thing to think about but I think the worst part about it is that over time you do lose that intuitiveness not with just others but with yourself and even with my partner my partner and I met in 2022 and I have had to relearn how to like be a good person like I've had to relearn how to be a girl's girl just because and neurodivergent neurodivergence goes into this too obviously because like when your brain gets used to one thing for so long and you're prone to feeling shame around certain things you have to tell yourself that it's safe to do these \u201cnew\u201d things and so I had to relearn how to be a Girl's girl I had to relearn how to like be open and like be kind and not be afraid of everything because that's really what it is it's just fear and something as beautiful as this is helping someone eat when they clearly can't do it themselves is needs to be more normalized I'm tired of having the same conversation about can you give your friend a ride to the airport like obviously you can this is what we're made for and I just I'm really happy to see that video and I just wanted to speak on that so yeah",

    "voice_to_text": "what age do you consider someone to have come out quote unquote later in life or to be I think to answer this question we need to consider what does it mean to bloom what does society think blooming means because what even is that word you know but I think what society is saying is\u2026 \u2728puberty\u2728 so let's replace bloom with puberty okay when do people when do Homo sapiens experience puberty around the ages of 12 13 right however let's give them a little bit more Grace let's say that not all people experience puberty by 13 let's say some of them experience puberty later so around the beginning of high school let's say 14 15 16 okay um so basically biology textbooks say that during puberty a lot of changes are happening to someone's body (including the brain) and one of them is basically figuring out who you are sexually attracted to and people start getting you know crushes or whatever sexual feelings I know it it sounds gross when you think of a 13 year old having those thoughts but it's been scientifically proven so okay so if you didn't know who you were sexually attracted to by puberty then you're technically considered a late bloomer yeah so if you didn't come out by high school you're technically a late bloomer but let's go beyond this I think the feeling of being a late bloomer is actually a \u2728feeling\u2728 and not like something you can figure out through puberty I think if you came out in college so after puberty we can like assume that you are above 18 in college and you are therefore an adult and therefore you have gone through puberty um but if you did figure out in college that you were queer um and you don't feel like a late boomer then you're not because I think it is majorly just a feeling but personally I came out in college I figured out I was queer in college and I do feel like I'm a late bloomer because I keep thinking keep wondering what would my life look like if I had come out earlier I keep having these recurring thoughts and I don't think somebody who wasn't a late Bloomer has them now the reason why I didn't know is well there might be a lot of reasons but I think one of the major major reasons was I live in a country where being queer was more taboo than in the United States and so I did not know any queer people in real life except for one trans person but even he wasn't considered Trans (other people used she/her on him \ud83d\ude22) did he know he was trans? I don't know he's dead now unfortunately I can't go ask them um but I didn't know any queer people in real life I did not know any queer people who were my age definitely not and so I also didn't see any queer presentation in media until I was 16 years old and so how how would I know that being queer was a possibility for me if I had never seen it it's like when you don't know the possibility of the existence of something how can you know it even exists in the first place It\u2019s like when you don't know What you don't know, you know? there's a lot that we don't know that we don't know but anyway I keep thinking about this what would my life look like if I knew and the truth is I will never know but I did come to the realisation that I'm queer during college and I'm very happy that I did and I'm very happy that the internet algorithm supported my journey because real life would have made it much much harder to figure it out um because my queer awakening was like a celebrity that I found on YouTube so but yeah if you if you feel like a late bloomer then you are one I guess but I also understand why people who are much much older than me might think that I don't deserve to be called a late bloomer because that's like much more extreme like to them maybe that word might hold more weight like somebody who comes out in their 30s Is a late bloomer but I feel like if you can see yourself in a feeling and when somebody describes a feeling you resonate with it then I guess you are allowed to use it I mean I'm not like going out and telling people I'm a late bloomer lesbian no I'm just you know I usually tell people when I have come out if they ask me and usually figuring out in college that you're queer is like a common ish experience but not necessarily everyone figured out then a lot of people did figure it out earlier so I guess it's different for a lot of people I feel like I'm this point I'm just rambling but you get what I'm saying yeah",

I went to the Ren Faire this year. I also went last year. It was pretty fun. I like going to art exhibits and museums. I love Doctor Who, and every year I go to a doctor who convention. I have a small business that I've had for five years where I sell my art, crochet, and jewelry. I like to look for rocks and fossils, stuff to get all dolled up and go for fancy tea to go to the gardens. I'm not very good at it, but I do enjoy dancing. Here's me dancing with Rico Nasty. She's really nice. Here's me doing stand up and drag. I really enjoyed doing comedy. I used to figure skate competitively when I was little, and I really love doing it now. I don't do it competitively, and I'm not very good anymore, but I find it really, really fun. I'm much more balanced on ice than I am on ground. I went to an oddities and curiosities expo. It was really fun. A bit ago, I rescued and care for this butterfly that fell outside my building that had a crumpled wing. And then when she passed away, I preserved and pinned her. I love for the butterflies so much that I ended up getting and raising some other butterflies. And then Releasing them. They were so cute. But, yeah, I can't say I'm too interested in Taylor Swift. So I guess my life is pretty boring and I'm just really normal.",

I mean, it wasn't the worst of the night, that surely has to go to Ireland, but somehow they did really well. God knows I. Because it was awful. A bunch of screaming people, that is all it was. But Ollie Alexander's was just gay erotica, simple as that. And for a show that should be including children, children should be able to watch it. It's a singing competition, that's it. So why is it always got to be who can be the most controversial? What? Why is that? Why do people need to do that? I mean, always was just a bunch of naked men just thrusting and just shaking about. And he's singing with shambolic. It was shaky, it was poor, the sound was awful, the song is crap anyway, no wonder we got zero points from the wider public outside of the UK. Now, one guy I have no problem seeing, you know, men dancing about, I'm fine with that. But why do you need to always, always shove it down people's throats? Why do gay people always need to do that? Because it just makes us all look really, really shallow. You can enjoy that and that's fine. You can do that, it's fine. But why does someone like that have to represent the UK and a worldwide audience to what, I think 200 million People watch it every year and it's no wonder we do so badly. The one year that the UK has done well in the last god knows how many years is two years ago with Sam Ryder. And why is that? Because we put art and talent above everything else and we should have won. The only reason we didn't win was because everyone gave Ukraine the sympathy vote. Since then, we've had a girl who hates the UK who can't sing. I can't even remember her name, but she was awful and no one's heard of her since. Now we've got Ollie Alexander, who the week before said that the UK flag is controversial. You can't sing. He puts gay erotica in his performance and then wonders why he doesn't do well. He actually gets humiliated and probably now his singing career has gone down the pan, if it hadn't already. Why can't we just get back to a time where art and the singing talent and vocalisation was put at the top of the tree. That was more important than anything else. Why now is choreography and how someone is gonna be so controversial and how controversial can I be? Why is that always put to the top? Singing is down here. How controversial can I be? Is put up there for simply likes and attention. And it's just really, really embarrassing. And it's no wonder the UK just shouts every year with people as. As woke as You are doing your revision for, like. Like Ollie. Ollie Alexander. It's no wonder he's so bad with people like that. They're running the show for the UK, so we're always gonna do badly when you've got way for lefties ruining it for everybody else.",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, so I'm seeing this narrative being put out there that doctor who is now. It's actually really interesting about how people are finally realising that doctor who is woke. And they think it's only just begun with Jodie Whitaker. Well, as said in the other video, it's been going on a bit longer than that. I mean, it actually started at the beginning of Doctor Who. I mean, they give some really good examples. Um, the meep pronouns thing, though, where the meep goes, I just go by the meep. That's actually called back to Tom Baker, who basically used the doctor as well. What the meep said is what Tom Baker said in one dot 2 episodes. And if you're going to Sarah Jane Adventures, where Matt Smith did a crossover, Clyde asked him, you know, if you can regenerate and look like anything, could you also be black? And he said, yes. And now we have it. Judy, get well. They're not. That's not the first time it happened, because Peter Capaldi caused another Time Lord to generate and he went from a white old man to a young black woman. But the gist is, Time Lords are literally gender benders. They can change their gender with every regeneration, whatever they please. I mean, if regeneration is only brought up because William Hartnell couldn't continue with the series due to his health, but it's brilliant how there's really, there's no gender in the Time Lord world, because They can be man, they can be woman, they can be non binary, they can be whatever they want. They can change their appearance, they can be white, black, they can be Chinese, they can be Japanese, they can be Korean, they can be Russian, etc. Just a regeneration. And yet they think now it's gone woke. I mean that's like people watching Star Trek and thinking it's just now gone woke when it's been woke since it first began. I mean you do realise that a lot of SCI fi's are woke? I mean there's Andromeda until the later series where went really really wrong. There's Stargate SG one, Stargate Atlantis, Star Wars, X Men, you name it, it's woke. It always has been, always will be. And there's nothing wrong with that. So love it or hate it, it's here to stay.",

    "voice_to_text": "this video upsets me for a couple different reasons um but let me just give you kind of like a general basis with this uh Lily lives in a very Liberal state she is from San Francisco um she has access to a lot more freedoms and things like that than most trans people in the United States who are living in red states um and she definitely comes from a place of privilege when she is doing things like this um number two I definitely realized that this video is rage bait I fully understand it I get that she is posting this video because she's trying to get the likes the views and the stitches basically what I'm doing right now but at this point it needs to be addressed um our country is not a supportive place for trans people um there are laws in multiple red states that have come out trying to basically take us out of the public view take us out of the forefront basically trying to shut down every person who is trans um and because of that being able to get bottom surgery is extremely extremely difficult um it has always been difficult it is always going to be hard to be able to do that because it is expensive um a lot of insurances don't wanna cover it uh the prep in order to be able to lead up to it is expensive and then also being out of work for multiple months as you recover is expensive um and Lily good for her is able to do all of these things leading up to it as a preparation for her being able to do something that was her choice however this video is fire for the far right and the conservative community that wants to basically erase trans people from public view public eye and basically from existence from a lot of the laws that they're kind of putting out there if you go to her comments it is full of anti trans like rhetoric and it is just insane amounts of transphobia that we're seeing in that in that comment section um and the issue with that is is that this video is never going to affect Lily it's never going to affect her being able to get her bottom surgery it's never going to affect her personally in the way that um a lot of people may think that it might um she posted that previous video with the Kurt Cobain and she's still doing the same things now um however it is going to affect those who do not come from a place of privilege or live in an area of privilege like Lily does and this is just going to fuel the fires you know um they're trying to label us as sand ofrendas and as mentos and unwell and saying that the a lot of the anti gay laws in schools and everything saying that they're trying to indoctrinate children into the LGBT community which I just don't understand what they think the queer community is um and this video doesn't help and this video is going to be used as proof and as a reason to further push those conservative talking points of indoctrination sand ofrendas mentos, x y and z which is just not factual and not true um and so Lily is sitting here making these videos talking about oh yeah I'm able to do this and oh yeah I have to do this and oh I need a little touch up here and X y and Z surrounded by children in Disney haha and it makes me sit here and think to myself I'm like okay you are either blissfully uneducated and unaware which means that you shouldn't be posting online or you are so narcissistic and so self centered that you don't give a shit about the harm that you're doing because what you were doing is you were sitting on your high pedestal talking about all of these things while there's so many people who are struggling and suffering and you are pulling up the ladder behind you because you are already on your way you're going to be stopping other people from being able to do what they want so at the end of the day all I really have to say about this video is block her don't talk about her let her fade into existence let her live her privileged life Lily hug you you're dangerous to our community we don't accept you you are doing more harm than good and honestly trans rights matter go out and vote research your candidates and let's make this country a better place and let's not feed into the bullshit that this video is anymore",

I'm a trans woman on the internet who runs a little trans news segment. I am not the trans police, so I just wanted to clarify that first. I'm a trans news anchor. And anyway, what I wanted to say with this is that Lily is intentionally making rage bait content. She's very aware of what she's doing because she does it a lot. She usually does it in the form of, like, waiters misgendering her and things like that to kind of get our attention with things. And something that our community gets hit a lot on is that we don't police our own people. And there's a time and place for everything, and this is absolutely not it. So I am calling you out for this. You should not have talked about your bottom surgery at Disney. Monitors and conservatives love to fear monger us and prioritize that like propaganda is that we do all these horrible, horrible things and like, you know, say these things to. Around children, things like that. And as much as we fight against that, and then you come out here and make a video that gets seen by 1.5 million people. Was inappropriate. It's wrong. You should not have done it, and it's gonna make us all look bad. I think you should apologize.",

I've got the sad playlists I've got I've got receipts okay like for as long as they're saying that they knew for they would have had *plenty* of time to like prepare for me to come out and learn and I don't know just like change their actions, I guess? so I don't know I'm choosing to believe that they were BS\u2019in a little bit when they said that they knew for so long yeah you can retroactively see the signs but I mean come on. anyway does this make sense do you do you all like see my thought process?? let me know",

I don't know, dude, that makes no fucking sense. But the reason why they chose that artist for Eurovision was because she was non binary and shows the spectrum of genders that actually exist in reality. Also, they chose her because she's representing Celtic paganism, and in Ireland, Celtic paganism is a big thing. You know, it's kind of how we got Halloween and stuff. And the kind of the point of Eurovision is to represent the country you're from and that country's culture. Like, I'm sorry, you want Eurovision to be all about your religion and your faith and your culture, but that's not what Eurovision is about. It's about celebrating your culture and the place that you're from. And Celtic paganism is a big part of Irish culture in history. Has nothing to do with Satanism or evil or wickedness. Whatever you fucking said in this video. Ireland just chose an artist that was good at representing not only the LGBT community, but also their culture and history. But if you wanna blow up godly artists, simple. Tell them to make actually good fucking music. Music that represents the culture and society that they live in. And then maybe, just maybe, the Eurovision committee will choose that song to represent their country. So get off your high Horse and realize that other religions and other cultures exist in around the world. It's not all Christianity.",

Mind you, I was in my early 20s and in active addiction, so naturally, I was intrigued, but I did want clarification because it didn't really sit well with me. Although he was initially charged with first degree murder, it was brought down to a lesser charge because he didn't actually commit the murder. He was just driving the getaway car of his friend, who then murdered somebody. But, yeah, I never talk to him again after that. Thank god I finally found my husband, because it is scary out there.

Maybe it's a good thing TikTok is getting banned, because as a black creator, I just wanna find made shit like this. Oh my shit would be taken down. My account bananas should be reported. When any other race or ethnicity does shit like this, other than black people, it gets pushed out, it goes viral, it does numbers, it's up for days, maybe even weeks. But when black people do anything semi against the grain, oh girl we are silence. And even queer voices too. And TikTok is just known for being racist. TikTok is kind of racist. TikTok is also kind of homophobic, sadly. And I'm just thinking, man, maybe this is just a good thing that TikTok is being taken down and been added and whatever from the US, because, like, this is not okay. This is not okay.",

Call me naive, but I had no idea there were actually people out there, members of our community, gatekeeping what being trans is like, it's some kind of test. Like, if you don't get all of the optional stuff, then you're not trans. That's wild to me. Like, the only thing that makes a person not trans is being sis. Like, take me for example, I've been on hormones now for like 9 months or something, and the hormones have fixed my dysphoria. Isn't that the point? That you look in the mirror and you feel good, that you feel comfortable in your own skin? Like, haven't I achieved what I set out to do with my transition? I look good, I feel good, it's changed my mood, it's changed so much about me for the better. Great. Fixed, right? Like. Like gender affirming care saves lives. And everything else is. Is extra. It's optional. If you need more stuff to make you feel happy, to make you feel right in your own skin, like voice training, like certain surgeries. Great. More power to you. I hope you can be happy. But I'm good. And I don't think that only being on hormones, the hormones that have saved my life as a trans person, makes me any less trans. It's wild. If I get Voice training, that's something I choose to do, but I don't have to. Like, my voice doesn't really give me dysphoria. It's just upsetting if I get misgendered when I'm on the phone to someone or something, but it's not a big deal. I don't hate my voice, and I don't like surgery. I'm not made of money. I can't afford all these surgeries that I don't need. When I look in the mirror, I don't think, oh, chin wrong, nose wrong, forehead wrong. Some people do, and those people can be trans or sis. People get surgeries if they think it'll make them feel more comfortable, but it's. It's optional stuff. I had no idea that there were things that make you trans and things that don't. And if you don't go far enough with this stuff, then you're not transgender. Are we joking? I'm a very, very happy trans woman on her hormones, feeling great. Isn't that enough? I'm me now. What is wrong with our community if there are people gatekeeping like this? No, no, not there for that. Not. Not having it.",

And to that I always say, just because you can talk about something, does that mean you should? Just because you can talk about a certain thing or talk in a certain way, does that mean you should? You know, I'm never gonna walk into a mechanic shop and start busting their balls. I'm never gonna walk into a mechanic shop and go, huh, you're using those kind of wrenches. Or watch you become a mechanic. There's so many other things you could be, you know, I'm never gonna do that. You know why? Because I know nothing about being a fucking mechanic. It's not my place to speak on it. But, you know, straight people like to speak on being gay a whole lot. They do, you know, because a lot of straight people see being gay as a sin. You know, I see that a lot in my live chats. You know, religious people saying, change your ways. This is a sin. And then saying whatever they want about being gay because they think they're saving somebody. They have the whole Messiah complex, you know, I See that a lot. I see a lot of straight people who just don't understand what it means to be gay, so they start gay bashing, and there's no repercussion to it, you know, so they just do it. I've seen that a whole lot. You know, I've seen plenty of people who are straight talk about gay stuff, talk about gay things in interesting ways. I've had straight people tell me that I have bottom energy, which it's like, okay, not sure you really get to say that, but, you know, go off, I suppose. I just think. I don't think straight people have ever been uncomfortable to talk about gay things, make gay jokes, you know, I think they've just been quiet about their opinions about it, but I don't think they've ever been uncomfortable, because I see it every day, and I agree. You know, some things aren't yours to talk about, and that's okay. That's why we meet people, that's why we share our stories. You know, that's why we brought in our horizons, because we don't get to know everything. Which means while we can talk about everything, maybe we should",

    "voice_to_text": "so I wanna talk about this in terms of disability accessibility because this is something I want people to understand about the differences between the able bodied people in these communities and the people who are disabled and what we have to consider and this is no criticism of anybody else who can roll with it you know I was in my 20s and I was the type of person who would go out all night partying and still be coming down off of of you know the the sparkle of the evening and end up rolling straight into PT at 4:30 in the morning for the next day I was working 60 to 80 hours a week and still finding time to to party like I understand that life I'm also disabled and 40 now I don't have that energy I don't have that and it causes a certain level of logistics that a lot of people just don't know about they just don't understand the cost and the thing is that it's a cost both of energy and time but also cost literally so for example the cost of just getting to a place energy wise logistics wise you may be able to run into the airport throw your stuff on the the conveyor belt and get through the airport just fine if you're me you have to make sure you're there make sure you're there early enough that people can convey you there because you can't walk across all the terminals and survive or you're gonna put punish your body to the point of walking because they aren't actually taking care of the disability services the way they're supposed to and making sure that you can transport any kind of mobility devices with you which they break far too often like these are logistics that are just baseline things of getting access to places and the fact look up the number of wheelchairs that get broken by airlines every year uh then you have to get to the venue and you have to have a place in the venue because if you don't get a room in the venue you're not gonna have the energy to get through the entire day so you have to be able to rest you can't even just do everything because you don't have the energy to and those places very rarely consider people in wheelchairs they very often have tables too close together and lots of people milling about and people who aren't listening who stand in your way or ableist people who refuse to act like you even exist because you're inconveniencing them by needing to get past them in a wheelchair um there's a lot of really really absurd shit that happens and so every single thing every single thing that happens at this is more energy more work more uh like output to try and figure out and logistically handle you cannot improvise if everybody wants to go out to an after party and go to a you know a restaurant is that restaurant accessible does it have food that is safe is it there's a whole other level of of logistics to consider that you just can't improvise the way other people can and it gets really really isolating because everyone else just wants to go and they're gonna go and so you end up compromising and just going yeah okay fine everyone go have fun have fun right you don't get to do those things and then afterwards you have all of the same logistics to get back and everybody else just drops and runs with it because they don't have to worry about those things And good for them like I don't begrudge people the fact that they don't have to worry about these things but it is something that logistically a lot of us who are disabled can't engage in these things we can't take an extra week off of work we can't take an extra week to recover with the flare that's gonna happen from all of the travel and all of the stress and all of the overclocking ourselves outside of our tolerances even if we would love to be there even if it would be beneficially professionally to be there we can't afford it energy and and otherwise and so this is just something I wanna bring attention to it's something that it means I very often don't have the same kinds of professional vetting that other people do because I can't be in those spaces I can't afford the amount of overtaxing baselines it takes to even access those spaces and a lot of people just don't realise that so I just wanted to talk about it thank you for giving me the time to uh vent about it because it's just something a lot of people don't seem to get when they can just go ahead and roll straight into another week of of work or whatever else they do because for some of us that's not even an option and so very often we opt out because we can't get our money's worth to go to these kinds of events anyways",

    "voice_to_text": "thank you so much for asking this genuine question and for looking for solutions because this is a very important topic and there have been some really horrible laws passed especially here where I live in Utah now I'm not transgender but I know a lot of transgender individuals including um some family members and so the people in my family that are transgender are um assigned female at birth a fab and so now they look like the first picture you showed the man they sound like a man they look like a man and they are a man and so really it is like if you have to go and explain oh that's actually a girl that is really hurtful and offensive to the person because their whole life they have been battling body dysmorphia and they it does not feel right for them to be a girl or a boy you know however they were assigned at birth and if they have finally got up the courage to transition whether medically or not and they are presenting as a female or a male we need to respect them and their pronouns and their names and honestly honestly they just have to go to the bathroom and I kind of like your solution will work for sure like I like I think we should have all gender restrooms or individual restrooms and if you are really concerned about your children being hurt in a public restroom go with them go with them into the restroom um you know because that that's the only way you can protect them but honestly I like I said I know a lot of transgender people and they are very mild loving kind individuals because they have been bullied and hurt their whole lives and they do not want to do that to people they want Equality they want they just want to go pee in peace and where they feel comfortable and actually like I would feel more comfortable in a one stall bathroom because I don't like to poop and have people hear it right so I like your solution but um just yeah I mean maybe teach your children about different kinds of people because there aren't only two genders there's actually a lot of intersex people people born with both and many many different ways that it presents and sometimes these kids were not told that they were intersex and then they grow up and they're like why do I feel like a boy and they're like oh yeah when you were born you had whatever you know and it's like yeah so the medical professionals have been unethical and I'm going off on attention now so bathrooms I like your idea but also education educate yourself I love the the genuine question and the the love that you presented in it in mostly you know so um yeah just maybe think about teaching your child that you know people there's gay people and there's transgender people and there's you know whenever she's ready for those topics you know so um yeah just thanks again",

    "voice_to_text": "SVP for this wedding is by scanning the QR code on the like. So this woman is basically complaining that she's received an invite to a wedding, and her nan and her mum have also received an invite to a wedding, and she's mad because the only way to RSVP is through a QR code. And as a 2024 bride who has also given the only way to RSVP on my invites through QR code, I have some thoughts. And the first thought is, why we so quick to dismiss the older people can learn how to use technology? Like, they're older, they're not inept, like, they still got brains. They can learn to use technology. Like my 97 year old Nan, like, we sat down with her and showed how to do it and she was like, oh, that's really cool, that's really easy. I'll know how to do that again in future. That's it, that's all it takes. Like, old people, they're not stupid, they can learn how to do things. And also, like, if somebody really doesn't know how to use QR code, or maybe doesn't have the technology to be able to use it, which I know some people don't, I really don't care if people just drop me a text to be like, by the way, didn't really know how to use it, so just let you know we can come. And then I ask them what food they want because that's one of the Choices on the QR code and that's it. It's done. For me as a bride, doing a QR code has been so much easier than anything else because I don't have to. Like, it just all goes into a Google form then goes into a spreadsheet for me. Or I like look at the responses, put in spreadsheet and that's it. So for like, me as a bride, it saves so much admin cause I'm not constantly chasing people up. Like it's easy. Most people receive the invite and just did it straight away so it takes 30 seconds. The main reason why me and my fiance decided to go with QR code over the traditional like, post it back is because postage is so freaking expensive now. Like, we weren't about to ask people to go to the post office to post a letter or go and buy a whole book of stamps just to send us our invite back. Because I'd like. Most people don't have stamps in the house nowadays. Like, especially young people. Like, I personally don't. I don't remember last time I used a stamp. So I'm not gonna ask people to go and go all the way to post office, buy stamps, post it. And with the state of our postal system right now, who knows if things will even reply reply even arrive back here. Like really? Like, is it going to? Probably not. Then I'm gonna be chasing people up and it's Just gonna be a nightmare. Like QR code. Speaking from a bright perspective is so much easier. So much easier. I, I don't get the problem. I really don't.",

Nobody's suggesting the fucking child transitions at goddamn 5, okay? As a matter of fact, they just lowered the age. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health just lower the suggested age to 14, not fucking 5! And the only reason why they lowered it to fourteen was because they thought it was unethical to withhold that treatment, because at that age, when puberty is happening, that can lead to more gender identity issues and more body dysmorphia and otherwise. But it's 14, not five. And prior to that, it was 16, not five. So stop with the bullshit and the bigotry and the stupidity. Fuck!",

Let's start there. But in his video, he's talking about how he does not show affection towards his significant other or whoever it is that he has at the house in front of his son. What's wrong with that? And he goes on with a valid point. What happens if his son goes over to his friend's house and does what he saw his dad doing? Now, we all know that there's homophobes out there. I mean, his son could be teased, he could be beat up, all sorts of different things. He's protecting his child. What is wrong with that? Furthermore, it amazes me how so many people have so much to say about how other people are raising their kids. Specifically the ones that don't have any. Where do they do that at? Where do you have the right? Leave this man alone, please.",

When you respond in a completely neutral and, um, non confrontational tone. They do not know. They do not know what to do with it. If you say, well, I'm a lesbian, regardless of whether or not it's true, they're gonna take that as an invitation to engage more in another way. And you're still not gonna win.

    "voice_to_text": "To the bitches in my comments calling me a self hating gay, I have a question for you. So what do I? And I have an answer. You're pathetic. It's that simple. Like, why are you surprised that people are calling you self hating when you're literally out here fucking expressing internally homophobic ideas? Why are we surprised? Why do people get so surprised when we call a spade a spade? You were literally out here shucking and driving, tap dancing on your knees, groveling for these fucking straight people that are probably gonna vote for you to fucking not even have rights. They're literally fucking doing it as we speak. But you're sitting here kikiing with them like they give a fuck about you or like they actually care about what the fuck you're saying when all they're doing is using a gay voice like yours. Who's fucking tab dancing? Another Christian Walker wannabe ass fucking lame ass nigga. Yeah, they're using somebody like you to fucking give a voice to their own homophobic fucking opinions. That's all that's happening. You're just a token. Every community has these. We got our black Republicans, we have our gays who want to act like they are the moral police of the LGBT community. We got our women who want to be pick me's and tell them what to do. Every fucking marginalized community has people like you who wanna blame the community and like fucking act like you're the one exception. That's just so reasonable that everybody else is just tripping. Shut up. Like you were honestly, seriously pathetic, you sitting here talking about some. Oh, well what if they see it and then like, your argument in itself is so fucking stupid because, okay, so if a straight couple raises a child, they do PDA in front of them, what's gonna happen, quote unquote according to your argument, when they go and perform that same behavior on another child, then what? Are they not potentially also gonna be in trouble for doing sexual acts as a child? Like, what the fuck kind of stupid ass fucking argument is that? Like, are you serious, bro? People need to see healthy relationships in general, regardless if you have a straight, uh, parents or if you have parents that aren't straight. Especially if you have parents that are straight. Because society already does not like fucking showing people who are fucking same sex in in relationships, even raised children or be families in general. So people do need to see people in love. Like, I don't. I don't. And then you got goofy ass people in the comments on some. I don't even hug my man in front of my kids. I don't even kiss my man in front of my kids. I don't even. You're all fucking liars. You're literally fucking liars. Because be serious, bro. Y'all hold yourself to a different standard then you hold gay people. You act like gay People or just supposed to act like best friends all the fucking time and never hold hands or nothing in front of children because they're gonna corrupt you. You're. You're pathetic. Seriously, you're pathetic. And literally just be straight and leave the fucking community cause we don't want anything to do with people like you. You're a sad and pathetic person.",

I'm not a racist, I'm not a homophobe, I'm not a transphobe. Mate, you don't get to decide that for yourself. But I'm an ally. A gay man is literally sitting here telling you you're being homophobic, and your response is, nah, nobody knows the oppression more than the community that's oppressed. I don't tell black people that I'm not racist. Or if they say that, I'm being racist because they know what racism is more than I will ever know as a white presenting person. And if somebody says that to me, it's a moment of reflection, not defense. Because the reality of life is that we're born in, into the systems of oppression. And if we're not in that oppressed group, then at times when we're called out by those oppressed communities, it's a time for reflection. It's not a. It's not an attack on your personhood. It's not attack on you personally. So it's like, I can admit that there is unpacking of my own racism. I was born into it. It's not my. Not my fault. It becomes my fault when I don't wanna do the work, when I don't wanna unpack stuff. And that's what this person's doing. It's so tiring, man. Just don't take it as a personal attack. Understand the dynamics of the society that you were born into and unpack it. Then you become an ally. Then you're not being homophobic. Listen, listen.",

But the cookie doesn't count. No, the cookie didn't count. I'm making a sandwich. Kay's taking hers apart. I'm just gonna go for it. All right, ready? The only correct way to put Taylor a cupcake. Oh, wow. Magnificent. Amazing. Spectacular. The only right way to eat a cupcake. Proceeds to make an entire mess. This is so good. Just frosting. It's fantastic. It tastes like cookie dough.

And now I am on my way to a job interview. I had to go back to the house to change clothes. I saw her with my very own eyes. Do you think she said anything to me about these? No. Do you know what? Flappers? My gas. The fact that I've never had a yard sale, and they said that is something everybody should experience. So we're getting rid of a whole bunch of our stuff and having a yard sale on Saturday. Instead of donating to goodwill, where it doesn't benefit anybody, we're gonna take the proceeds and we're going to donate them to the women and children's shelter. Do you not mean parachute? She had to give away. Great. Listen, a great man once said, if you can't afford to buy two, don't buy one. Where's mine? I didn't think so.",

I'm so happy that another feminine, gay black man is bringing this to the light. Let's talk about it. Thank you for speaking about this as well. But yes, uh, black women have given me a way harder time with my gay experience than black men have online and in real life. No, I'm not generalizing all black women, but this is just my experience. Black women who have came across feel like they own femininity, and they weaponize that against you. They feel like everything that you have, hair, nails, makeup, clothes, body, personality, is theirs, like you stole it from them. Which isn't the case at all. Although there's been a lot of black women who have accepted me and loved me. Of course, on the other side of the coin, the amount of homophobia that comes from black women specifically, it's shocking. Now, this doesn't make my love for black women any less. Obviously, I love y'all, but I'm just so happy that I've seen another person talking about this, because we need to fix this problem.",

They\u2019re just being GLAMOROUS with their makeup, and I personally think they\u2019re doing an amazing job.  Now, for some unnecessary reason, you think its the idea to clown this individual just because theyre living their life. I had someone do my makeup before, and I LOVED it. The comment section is rubbing salt into their wound, even going as far as to clown his whole life. What is wrong with you people commenting on that post, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Now, do me a favor and leave the kid alone. I am sure you\u2019re just trying to ruin his day. He\u2019s enjoying the makeup (which I LOVE by the way), and doing his own thing. #fyp #lgbtqia #lgbt #lgbtq #bullyingawareness #bully #homophobiaisntcool ",

Second of all, is it, like, do you find any sort of, like, satisfaction with being homophobic? Like, what's your end goal with that? And third of all, how do you feel if someone made fun of the way that you live your life? Huh? Huh? How about that for a change? How would you feel if someone made fun of you and the way you live your life? He's a. He's a kid. He's a kid. Let him live his life. He can be. He can be part of the LGBTQ+, no problem. There's nothing wrong with that community. Literally, just let him live his life. Like, is it that hard? Like, the comments, right, the comments of that video, right, are not helping. They're not anywhere near as better. They're even still making fun of that person as well. That they're saying stuff like, I just wish I was born in the 80s so that this whole stuff wasn't allowed. It's horrible, man. Just let the. Let the kid just live his life, okay?",

Well, first of all, I'm actually really glad this creator is saying this. A little harsh, but there is such a myth. As a couple specialist, I hear so often people comparing which attachment style is worse and which automatically highlights theirs as better or more secure. And in reality, we're all difficult. We all have shit. We're all bringing it into it, the relationship. And what you do in that place, in that position, when you're highlighting your partners struggles, insecurities, burdens they bring into it, when you're highlighting it, you're actually putting each other at odds. And from this place, you will be enemies. You go to war. Because we have to know how to reach our partner in a way that brings them relief. So because we're not born anxious or avoidant, because attachment styles are not personalities, we can actually help our partner move towards security by offering them relief in the moment that they're being activated. And we do it for each other. This is a couple's problem. So if you're one of those people who are like, hey, you are so avoided. I can't be with avoidance or I can't be with anxious people, just know you're difficult, too.",

I don't think you understand. 16 year old me, 15 16, was saying the most dumbass shit. Trans people do not have periods. We have, you know, period symptoms, but that does not equal a period. I don't know what it would be called, but it's definitely not that. And I definitely should not have boxed it that way. I have no idea how to talk about the new experiences of trans people who are on healthcare that makes them able to basically live their life authentically, but it definitely was not to step on any of the other girls toes. Okay? So just know, if someone said I had a period, or said that I said I have a period, that wasn't me. I am not that girl no more. With that said, I think that people definitely need to be more gracious towards trans people whenever they're speaking about their experiences. And do not have a name for some of the experiences that they're going through. Because we are so new in society, even though we've been here for years. Don't get that. And I think that was the reason why I ignored that topic for so long. But I kind of poked fun at it in my new song. I was like, that's on period. Call her beyond dream Mitchell, because sometimes beyond dream Mitchell in The past could have been ignorant. So, yeah. But, yeah. I love you, dolls.

But sometimes you have to draw a hard line in your beliefs and what you think. I just don't think that that should be pushed on children. I will never believe that. I think children are innocent and I. They don't understand what's going on. And I don't want my two year old, whenever he's two, coming up to me and being like, what is this? I don't want that for my family, for my son. I don't think it's right. Do I love you still? Yes, absolutely. But I am not going to introduce my son to that. So we're gonna stick with Bluey.",

    "video_description": "The UK government has introduced regulations to halt new private prescriptions of puberty blockers for under-18s in one of its final acts before the general election. No new patients under the age of 18 in England, Wales and Scotland will be given hormones to suppress puberty if they are experiencing gender dysphoria, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announced on Wednesday (29 May). The medicine prevents puberty from starting by blocking the hormones \u2013 such as testosterone and oestrogen \u2013 that lead to changes in the body. In the case of trans youth, this can delay unwanted physical changes such as menstruation, breast growth, voice changes or facial-hair growth.  The emergency ban will last from 3 June to 3 September and will apply to prescriptions written by UK private doctors and those registered in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. The medicines in question consist of, or contain, buserelin, gonadorelin, goserelin, leuprorelin acetate, nafarelin, or triptorelin. Patients who already have prescriptions will continue to be able to access them, the DHSC said, and the medicines will remain available for other uses. The government\u2019s move comes after the release of the Cass report and a similar decision by NHS England to stop prescribing the medicine to trans youth at its gender identity clinics. In March, NHS England decided that puberty blockers would only be available to young people as part of clinical trials. \u201cOutside of a research setting, puberty-suppressing hormones should not be routinely commissioned for children and adolescents,\u201d a spokesperson said. Sky News reported the government described the move as a \u201clandmark decision\u201d and in the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d.  However, transgender youth charity Mermaids labelled the decision \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d and a \u201cfurther restriction of support offered to trans children and young people\u201d. Wales and Scotland announced pauses to prescribing puberty blockers, in the wake of the report. The Cass report, an independent review into the provision of healthcare for trans youth in England, was published in April and urged medics to use \u201cextreme caution\u201d when prescribing puberty blockers to children and young people. The 400-page report into England\u2019s model of care for trans under-18s claimed there was \u201cweak evidence\u201d suggesting that puberty-blocking hormones positively or negatively impact gender dysphoria and branded as \u201cpoor quality\u201d historical studies into their effectiveness. Dr Hilary Cass, who led the review, said: \u201cWhat I am recommending is an expansion of capacity across the country, grounded in paediatric services and delivered in a consistent way\u2026 a much more holistic offer of care that considers the child as a whole person and not just through the lens of their gender identity, and the development of a robust research environment to provide evidence on long-term outcomes and efficacy of different interventions so that future care is informed by robust evidence.\u201d #pubertyblockers #transrights #genderaffirmingcare #protecttranskids #ukpolitics #uknews #lgbtq ",

    "voice_to_text": "I realize that you're trying to invalidate me, but, girl, this is actually one of the best examples I've seen to this day. Hear me out for a second. In this example, coffee would replace woman. Caffeinated would be for cisgender, and decaffeinated would be for transgender. Now, I'm sure that we can all agree that they're both coffee. They look the same, some might even say they taste the same. But there is a clear difference between the two. But Misty is absolutely right in that most people assume that coffee is caffeinated. I agree 100% that most people would not call their coffee caffeinated, because it's usually a given. But let's say that you're out in the world and you happen to be drinking a decaffeinated coffee today, and someone comes up to you and asks, hey, what are you drinking? You may very well feel inclined to share that it's a decaffeinated coffee. But then again, it's also really none of that person's business, and you can just tell him that it's a coffee. It's really up to you as to whether or not you wanna share if it's decaffeinated. Now, with all of that said and done, just because we assume that coffee is caffeinated does not mean that we shouldn't have this word at all. There is still a clear meaning and purpose to the word caffeinated. And perhaps you're having a conversation with a friend about whether or not decaffeinated coffee or caffeinated Coffee taste better or is better for your overall health. Both of those words are still very helpful when we're having open discussions about how these two differ or what our views and opinions are about the two. And it would be much harder to have this exact same conversation without that word. Caffeinated. You could definitely try your best to have this conversation, but it's gonna end up getting very messy and very confusing because at the end of the day, they're both coffee. And that is exactly the purpose of these terms. You don't have to constantly use them to distinguish the two. Caffeinated and decaffinated are adjectives that help us describe a noun. Cisgender and transgender are also adjectives that describe a noun. So Misty, thank you so much for this amazing example. Hope this helps.",

Um, I have a niece and she just turned 5 today, and I've only been transitioning and presenting femme in front of her for like maybe like 8 months or something. Um, and it's just really interesting, like, seeing how they perceive you and like, understand things as you go through these changes. It's just really funny because the first thing that she said to me when I came out to her today was, you're not a girl, you're a boy. And I'm like, I changed and now I'm a girl. And then she goes, no, you're a, you're a boy. I saw you kissing a girl. Like, oh no, not explain both lesbianism and being trans to this five year old. Now obviously me and my sister, like, we're trying to do this in like an educational way, um, because I feel like it is a lot for a kids to try like wrap their heads around, especially at the age of five. And so we basically just said like, hey, like, it's okay. Sometimes boys like boys and sometimes girls like girls. And if you really want to, when you're older and you grow up, you can change your gender. And so like, she just like, really didn't want to call me a girl, which is okay. She's still learning and like, there's not like a lot of like queer representation for her, um, and it's just so Lovely. Because as I was leaving today, she called me a fancy girl. She's like, bye, fancy girl. And where did this come from? What? And she wouldn't stop calling me fancy girl as I was leaving. And so, like, I don't know. I just really don't know what goes on in children's heads and, like, what they're taught. And it's just, like, it's kind of, like, cute and, like, kind of, like, admirable to, like, see, like, how a child, like, perceives trans people, because they. I feel like they, like, understand it a lot better than, like, adults do sometimes, because there's so much prejudice built up, and they don't understand that being trans isn't, like, a, like, typical thing. And so, I don't know. It was just, like, a funny moment when she just kept coming. Pretty girl. As I was leaving, I was like, oh, that's so sweet.",

I'm not Gypsy Rose, but I'm Jennifer. I spent six years in federal prison, and these are my stories of before, during, and after incarceration. Now, one of my favorite things to make was pizzas, but tasted with those crackers was super creative. I'm gonna do something a little bit different. So I've heard that the feds no longer have microwaves, which is a bummer. You're gonna lay your tortilla flat and hit it with a fork on both sides. You wanna make sure you get a lot of holes in it. Pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. In prison, we didn't have pizza sauce, so we would use ketchup and make a sauce. I, I burned it. I burned the first one. You gotta watch it. But look a crisp up. We're gonna try again. Okay, round two. Now, this time I gotta watch it. I was talking and not paying attention. You wanna take it out every, like, 20 seconds and see how it's forming a bubble. You wanna pop that, and you don't want any bubbles. And again, see little bubbles. This step is so important or it will burn like my last one did. So make sure you get all those bubbles out. So this is what you're gonna end up. With you hear that? It's hard. It's like a flatbread pizza. Mix ketchup, Italian seasoning and garlic. Mix it together really well. I like to add a little bit of Velveeta cheese in mine to make it more creamy. I also put a layer of Velveeta cheese on my tortilla before I add my sauce just cause I like it cheesy. Now my toppings of choice are pineapple and pepperoni. You can use whatever you want. We had dried pineapple on commissary. So I would chop them up and do this and then add cheese. You would have to get cheese from the kitchen from one of your hookup. And of course I wasn't recording when I took it out of the microwave. But this is what it looks like. Would you try this? Let me know in the comments.",

Can be a bit annoying. If you're watching this and you're a powerlifter, you can be a little bit annoying for gym owners. Bringing a lot of bags, you make a lot of noise, you sniff salts, you get chalk everywhere. Can also be a bit off putting for other members cause maybe it doesn't serve these types of people. We have powerlifting gyms, we have Crossfit boxes. We have gyms for those specific training modalities. Fair play to the guy though. I think he did it in the right way cause that must be a hard conversation to have. Especially with a dude squatting that much weight. He's clearly a big geezer. I wouldn't really like to do that. We've never had to do it cause our gyms kind of open for for everyone. We do like powerlifters, we do like bodybuilders, we do like crossfitters, we like a bit of mess.

And between that documentary and the conversations that we've been having on TikTok about the 4B movement and men and women and dating and how everyone is upset and unsatisfied, why are we pretending like this is working? I think we're on the precipice where we're finally gonna stop that. But I think when something is so prevalent as cheating has been for men, it begs the question, do you wanna be doing this? Because I don't think that men want to be married. And I think that women have historically needed to be married. And maybe we don't wanna be married either. At least we don't want to be married in the traditional sense of what marriage has meant. I think that there may be people out there that want a partnership. But do men even want monogamy? I mean, honestly, I think it's okay to just tell the truth if. If most men don't want monogamy, maybe we need to have a deeper conversation about what this looks like. I don't think that the nuclear family works anyways. The idea of the nuclear family originated based on slavery and based on a very large extended family system where there were sometimes hundreds of people maintaining a home, which was probably significantly larger than the small homes that were living in. But the point is, we were not made to raise children with just two adults and a lot of Us are also now raising children with just one adult. And none of this works. It doesn't work. So what we're doing is we are resenting each other for a systemic problem that honestly has nothing to do with us. And I think if there is a time for us to have this deeper conversation of what do we really want? What do we want this to look like? Because if. If most men don't want monogamy, what they really want is just somebody to maintain a home for them, that's something we need to talk about. The damage that it does to children and a woman when they find out that their entire life is a lie and that their dad is with a bunch of other women is really extensive. I've lived it as a child. I've lived it as an adult. It's not good. It's not a good thing. And I think that you'll find as a man that most women just want you to be honest. Like, if you were to tell a woman, this is what I'm looking for, I'm looking for X, Y, and Z, there are probably women out there that will be into that. But the problem comes with the lying. You don't have to live in a way that you don't want to. No one is making us do this. But I think, again, the societal difficulty that comes with not being married is real. It's very real. There is so Much pressure. And the truth is that men make more money when they're married. Even men who are divorced make $9,000 more per year. And again, I think that has a lot to do with our social structure. But if we're not happy with this, we can stop.",

    "voice_to_text": "So as I was editing today's reel, I came across this anecdote, and I think it might be the one Rachel's asking about. So basically, ginger tells the story of a three year old girl who puts lipstick on the dog, even though she knows she's not supposed to, and lies about it and says it was an action figure named Doug. And the little girl kind of doubles down, and you can see here Ginger's kind of, uh, humorous, storytelling, relatable style that's throughout the book. So she relates this anecdote where the three year old, um, keeps saying it's, uh, the action figure, ends up getting sent to a room, ends up missing her brother's soccer game, which she's really sad about. And so she cries herself to sleep. And at that point, the mom wakes in and wakes her up because, quote, she doesn't want her to go to sleep with this sin weighing heavy on her heart. So she wakes the daughter up, and eventually the daughter kind of fesses up and cries and feels bad. And the mom says, it makes you feel bad to tell lies, doesn't it? You know, honey, the sad way that you feel right now is the same way god feels when you tell a lie. And I note that because that kind of anthropomorphization of god shows up a lot in Christian parenting teaching. Like, oh, as a way to motivate children. Like, this makes god sad when you Do this. And in the end, after all of this, so after missing the game, after being in the room, after crying yourself to sleep, she still gets a spanking. To let her know that, um, her sin was that serious.",

I wanted to say it, but I didn't want to run the risk of offending. It is incredible. Okay. You are rocking a car part like nobody's business. Gaga, talk to me about this. Like, how heavy is this? This is by Silva. This is. You know, I don't really know how heavy it is. I didn't weigh it before I wore it, but I really love it. It's super industrial and interesting, and I just really love working with everybody on my team. Nicolas. Incredible. Sarah, Frederick, everybody that's here. Um, many of them worked on the chromatic ball, and so it's kind of nice to be here tonight to keep creating and doing something new. Absolutely. In the Chromatic Ball tour, I mean, you broke audience records. Dodger Stadium for this. This film. 52,000 little Monsters, 30 cameras. What, of all of the things that you kind of needed to put this together, blew your mind the most? What made even Gaga stop and say, oh, we really did that? You know, it's always the fans. Yeah, it. Every time I see the fans, I think to myself, I can't believe that I get to do this for a living. I can't believe I got so lucky to also have fans that are really excited for things that Are new all the time. Every album that I make is usually a new genre of music. Every time I putting a show together, I am doing something that I've never done before, even if I'm looking back at things that I've made. So it's the fans. They are. They're down for it all.

Sign legislation protecting children and banning child sex changes. House Bill 4 6 2 4, named the help not harm Bill, prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from receiving sex change surgery or any form of puberty blockers or hormones, with the noteworthy exception for children that enter puberty early. It also protects parental rights by ensuring that either the vice principal or principal has to inform the parents if their child wants to go by a different name, different pronouns, or anything that doesn't match their actual sex. This kind of legislation is common sense. Children cannot consent to this kind of stuff. So the question is, where are the other 25 states and why do they seem to think that children can consent?",

All in the past week bro we have had a player enter the top 5 all time in scoring. Dawana Bonner. And she did so by passing her ex wife Candice Dupree. And she scored the record breaking bucket off of a pass from her current fiance Alyssa Thomas. First of all, imagine your ex passing you on the all time scoring list. Second of all, imagine her doing it off of a pass that she got from her new girl. But that wasn't the only couple drama that happened this week with that same team. Dijonay Carrington plays with Dewana Bonner on the Connecticut Sun and she committed a hard foul against fever player Erica Wheeler. And after this foul was committed, Erica Wheeler went to go get in her face and she got pushed back by her own teammate Melissa Smith. Melissa Smith also happens to be Dejonay Carrington's ex girlfriend, which had a bunch of people questioning why did you just defend your ex over your own teammate? But the WNBA is insane because of what other league do you have players dating each other? Man fuck Caitlin Clark. This shit is real life, love and basketball.",

This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the Cold War. Putin's Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine and will not stop there. If he succeeds, that war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threatened regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society. Here at home, China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing a lead. And technology and migration is being weaponized by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to charter course to a secure future. You must choose in this election who has that plan.

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, I have a question that specifically for people that are in the LGBTQ community, and if you're not in that community, I want you to go to the comments and check out what their answers are because I already know what it's gonna be. So look y'all, I already know that there are people out there who refer to themselves as maps, and we all know who the these people are and that they're trying to make themselves a part of your community. How do you feel about that? Do any of you guys watch shredder smiles, PB Touchers, and purple headed pamper eaters in your community? Do you accept them? Would you ever accept them? How does it make you feel when they try to insert themselves into your community? How does it feel when other people try to associate you guys with them? As I got a lot of homies y'all and I've talked to them all and they are 1,000% not down with the sickness. I also understand that there might be some people out there who don't have the same access to be able to openly and freely communicate with people in your community. So I thought it might be nice to make an open forum right here, right now in the comments so that you can let those type of people know exactly where y'all stand on this. I love y'all.",

Speaking of his mama family and not his daddy side of family, like we don't exist, right? So he say he. This is taking up time. He said the two days that he spent over here feel like a whole week.

Like I've traumatized him and did anything wrong to this little boy. We have done so much stuff, so much fun things. Spend time together, play basketball together, go amusement parks, go swimming, take riding in toys like this. He had the nerve to choose his mama. Look at the camera, gay. Choose his mama over me. Like I'm around here. Treat him wrong. What kid don't wanna be around a daddy? Please tell me. And as a daddy, is hurt because I know his Mama got something to do with it too. But still, he's old enough to make his own decisions. And he chooses mama over his daddy, his flesh and blood, somebody that can teach him how to be a man. But he wanna be up on a woman all day. Look at the camera, gay. Tell people how you don't love your daddy and how you rather be with your mama and time over here is boring and you don't want to spend time with your daddy. Tell people how you don't want to spend time with your daddy. And you, he act like I. I haven't been picking him up all these years. Like what? What is the problem? Like this not your first time at my house. But yeah, he hurt my feelings, world. He really hurt my feelings. And you can't take that back, gay. I'm gonna give you what you want. And I'm erase myself out of your life. I'm give you what you want. Gay, that is so messed up on so many levels. You know, I would never tell my daddy nothing like that. My dad was in my life.

However, it was all a big lie, because Vivian was actually born male, as stated in her Japanese, Spanish and other language versions that remained unchanged in the original release on the Nintendo Switch. This issue has been fixed and all dialogues concerning Vivian's transition have been altered, removing the offensive slurs Belgium used to her litter simply for being a transgender character, now scolding her instead for being somewhat clumsy. Nintendo didn't wanna leave the character situation unresolved and it's thought to explain Vivian's story in the best way possible with a touching moment where she confesses to Mario that at a certain point in her life, she realized she was not the brother of Marilyn and Belgium, but their sister.",

I feel like hieroglyphics would be easier to understand at this point. Let's try to make two plus two equal four. You go by he him pronouns, but you don't wanna be referred to as a man, so you recognize and still wanna be referred to as a woman. Which while still adopting the he him pronoun set, claiming that you're trans while simultaneously not doing a single thing to transition. Yep. Nope. The math is not math thing. And then people wonder why the trans community is not taken seriously. The movement is being diminished. Being trans is not a trend that you just hop on. It's not a community that you just attach yourself to just because. Sounds like you might just be a little self conscious about your body, which is nothing to be ashamed of. A lot of people go through that. But to try to adopt the he him pronoun set and then claim that that makes you trans. No, I'm not buying it. Stop making it harder for everybody else in the community. Thank you. Let me know. What you guys think in the comments about this video? I love you guys and I will see you in the next one.",

So I was just out looking for some chicken at the woods in Chopin Placewood and I didn't find any of those, but I did find someone else, which I'll post after this video. But when we're walking along is Yasmin and taking the dog lychee, someone came out of the bushes and after a while they're just having a wee and then someone else walked past with a dog and went to the bushes. Strange. And then somebody else came past with a vape and went to the same place. So I just thought it must be hunters. And there was a car. I thought they must be hunting or legally doing something. Anyway, walked on a bit, found what I wanted to find. Um, and then got back to the car park and as we're walking back to the car park, there was lots of cars with their doors open. You probably know where I'm going with this one. Um. And then a transvestite will pass me. Um. Ha ha ha! Yeah. And then I did a bit of research in the car and um, yeah, it's a well known dog inside. So there you go. Could you believe it? Don't go to chop them or Cobham Place Woods. It is a full on dog inside.",

To the heights! Harrison Booker is a Christian man who holds Christian values and he gave a speech that was filled with Christian values at a Christian college to Christian students and after giving this specific speech to his intended audience he received a standing ovation both men and women alike were in this crowd and everybody stood up and cheered for this man when he was done the people that his message was intended for heard it and received it well the people who got offended by his message either aren't the ones who the message was intended for in the first place or they're just not ready to come to terms with  the absolute truth he was speaking he wasn't targeting women by diminishing the value of their degrees and telling them that their only sense of purpose will come from being a homemaker even though an uncharitable analysis of a 60 second clipped out portion of his 20 minute speech may suggest that he addressed the men also and told them that their role in family life was just as important the truth is most people both men and women will find most of their value, sense of purpose, and fulfillment in their family life because the people in your life who you love and care about the most will always be more important than any degree or how you choose to earn money for the rest of your life and that was the truth that he was getting at",

You all know Elmo from this app. Red hair Muppet, always yelling about something. Do you really expect us to believe that you're unbiased in your opinions about pet rocks? Oh, and who is this? Rosita. You all know Rosita. So someone explain to me what Elmo and Rosita are doing at the White House. Sesame Street? More like Pennsylvania Avenue, am I right? And Elmo thought he could hide this from us, this thing that he proudly posted on his social media for all of us to see. Nice try, fed Mo. How much did they pay you? That's how ridiculous you all sound when you say this shit. Just because someone goes to a meeting with people in the government does not make them a goddamn fed. Just because you disagree with someone does not make them a goddamn fed. These contrarian types, these down with everything that's uptight people, are not capable of building anything because their entire practice is tearing things. Tearing people down for the sake of tearing them down. It's vulture behavior. Some people who hold the same political positions as you are just more pragmatic. Any healthy movement has pragmatists and idealists. You need both. When it becomes unhealthy is when a movement is so pragmatic that it has no Ideals and therefore no morals and no movement. Or become so idealistic with no pragmatism that it becomes nothing but foot stomping and contrarianism and purity testing and self cannibalization. Stop copjacking people, it is so toxic.",

It is completely different than a hip replacement because it's a body part that is not discussed in public in front of kids. It's not appropriate. It doesn't matter if you're trans or not.

We had a cool run. I'm grateful for what happens. I'm not here to seek sympathy for that. But when we broke up, verbatim, it went exactly the same as my last two, which is them essentially telling me that everything is going really well. I've treated them incredibly. I'm very emotionally available. Communication is great. We get along greats. Dates have been fun. They're very mentally attracted to me, and they have no doubt I would be a good partner. But the catch is that they are not physically attracted to me. And then, um. But times I've asked, well, what is it that you're not attracted to? Because if there's something, glarian that I need to address, then, like, I should definitely want to be aware of that. Like, do I have bad breath? Do I need to. Do I need to lose more weight? And they said no. Like, they can't put a finger on it. Um, it's more of a vibe thing. So I come here today more as a last resort, because this has just been a pattern where I haven't really gotten a clear answer, and the internet is brutally honest. So I just want to know, what am I doing wrong? Is there something about myself physically that I need to Address. Or is there, um. Is this more of an emotional thing? And is this something that, like, no one has the heart to tell me that I'm just not aware of right now? I'm. Yeah, I'm not here to seek sympathy. I just really, like, genuinely want to know, like, what. What am I doing wrong? Or is. Is this. Is there something, like, I need to consider, like, about myself?",

Like, look at them, they're fat, they're skinny, they're different shapes than they used to be! And this is such a fascinating response to me because Usopp looked like this after a few weeks on that island. If this usopp showed up on Sabayote, they would have been like oh yeah, that's Usopp. I guess he gained some weight. If Usopp had the ability to go from super skinny to super fat to super ripped over the course of two years, then it's not that strange to think any of the Straw Hats could have ended up looking like any of the fake Straw Hats.

    "voice_to_text": "What is the lie that you told us, a kid, that was so bad that you thought your childhood was over? Mine was that I had a twin. First of all, I was lying to teach somebody a lesson. I had a friend named Amber who was a liar. She wasn't even my friend. She's just a girl in my class. But she kept lying. I was like, i'mma get her back, and i'mma lie to her. So I told Amber that I had a twin sister named Amanda. And then my teacher was like, Shawty, you have a twin? I wasn't gonna let up. I had to keep the lie going. Yeah, I got a twin now I really dragged it out. I said I had another twin who went to a magnet school in our district. She was 10 times more than me. That's the only reason why we didn't go to the same school. Teacher felt so bad. She was like, Shawty, you're so smart. So is your sister. You guys should be in the same school together to make your mom's life easier. I thought she was just being sweet. So I kept bringing in pictures of me as a baby. And I was like, this is her. This is me. This is her. This is me. I don't know why she believed me. As an adult woman, why would you believe a 7 year old girl saying this? Anyways, I kept this lie going for Like, maybe two months. Some days I'd come in with, like, my hair different way, just to keep the lie going, you know? I thought at some point, my teacher knew I was joking, but I wasn't lying to her. I was lying to my classmate Amber. Anyways, parent teacher conference comes up. Had good grades. I thought I was smooth. I come home, my mom's like, Shawty, who's Amanda? I. My whole body was shaking up. I cried, I cried, I cried. And you know what I did to get out the situation? I lied again. My mom was like, why would you lie about this? At the time, my little brother did not live with us. He was staying with my grandma. I was like, I just miss my brother so much. I was just making up siblings. And my mom didn't believe me again. Like, I was a pathological liar. I don't lie no more, because clearly I was really. Get away with that shit, but, yeah. What did you lie about",

TikTok will give me a couple of cents, and, um, those couple of sense add up. Um, because of you watching my TikTok videos, last month, I was able to pay rent, um, from what I made just by you watching my videos. And when you're fighting cancer and you can't work and you can't provide for your family, it's everything. If you've been following my journey, you know that we have been fighting tooth and nail with my disability. Um, they keep denying it because they're saying that my cancer was pre existing. We're still fighting them on that, so we're just relying on my amazing wife and, um, her income. She's a hairstylist. Although currently she's out of commission because she has done something to her thumb and she's unable to work. Um, when it rains, it pours. But just watching this. It's been a minute, 20 seconds. You watching this this long has helped my family. It Has helped us pay the light Bill. It has helped us put food on the table. It is helped. Paid one of the four code pays. I have next week. I have chemo next week. So. You're thinking about me on Monday. I could use your prayers and good vibes, but, um. Yeah. You guys have stayed this long. When I say it is life changing, I mean that.

My car is busted, and I've talked to my husband, my father in law, my best friend's husband, some other men that I know, and they're all saying that I have a blown head gasket due to not properly taking care of my car, basically due to not getting oil changes. Okay, but, like, first of all, yes, there was a light on, but I always take that as, like, a suggestion. I'm, like, always like, oh, I got time. I know this is my fault, and I'm very disappointed in myself, but does your husband remind you to get your oil changed or no? Okay, second of all, I always have lights on in my car, and I am mad at myself and disappointed. But more than that, I'm, like, more scared because I know my husband's very gonna be upset. Like, he is upset. He already knows. So basically, what happened was two days ago, I went to go get Mia from school, and my car started smoking. So I ran in and got my husband, and he was like, oh, girl, like, of course it is. Go get your oil change. And I'm like, now you tell me, why didn't you remind me? So I went got my oil change, and as I was pulling out from the oil change place, they didn't Say anything? They were like, there was a point where four of the people at Valvoline were, like, all surrounding the front of my car, and I was like, hmm. But they didn't say anything, so whatever. As I was pulling out from getting my oil change, it was smoking. But I thought just stuff. Just had to, like, clear out a bit. Um, but it was driving funny. It felt, like, heavy. It was making a rattling noise. And I was like, I think it's more than just getting my oil change. There's something going on in here. And then I just got in the car to go tanning, and it is smoking so bad, I can't drive it. I don't feel safe driving it. And I'm pretty sure I ruined my car from being an irresponsible idiot. But I'm just a girl. Like, I really wish my husband. I love to blame other people for my problems, if you haven't noticed. I wish he would have just reminded me, like, that light is a suggestion, isn't it? Yeah. It's literally. Honestly, it might even be more than two years. Like, I cannot remember the last. I've had this car for three years. I remember because when I got the car, they said I got two free oil changes, and I only got one of the free oil changes. So maybe it's been three years. I gotta go.",

    "voice_to_text": "Bad built, butch body, which I had to look at my notes to read. Any regrets about that kind of language, especially given that you were trying to make a point, frankly, about decorum in the hearing room? I have no regrets, and I'll tell you why. Because Marjorie Taylor Greene is the type of person that if you give her an inch, she'll take a mile. And the fact that they continue to allow her to break the rules of decorum over and over and over, whether it's the state of the union that the president is delivering and she's wearing a MAGA hat or otherwise. The reason that she didn't have committee assignments before was because she did not know how to conduct herself as a member of Congress. And so if I just sit there and say, oh, well, Marjorie said it about me, what's to stop her to continue to do it again and again? And at the end of the day, I was elected as a representative of Congress, but that doesn't mean that I'm supposed to be somebody's doormat. But Michelle Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. Are those days basically over? Um, I don't know that we can even call this a low. I mean, she goes to hell, and then I do my best to remind her as to why she should not cross me. So one of your colleagues, Jamie Raskin, actually suggested that some members might Have been drinking. Others have said that as well. Making that suggestion. That's a pretty serious allegation. Do you think that that played a factor here? I think when Marjorie Taylor Greene. It doesn't require alcohol for her to be unhinged. I'll be perfectly honest. I don't know. I don't have any facts to that, so, you know, I won't say and I won't participate in rumors when I don't have any facts behind it. So you also called Greene racist, what she said about you. Why is that? Yeah, because as I've received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress, a lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factful way, what they would try to do is say, oh, look at her hair, or look at her nails, or look at her lashes. And they would all then associate anything that I do as a form of beautification with being, quote, unquote ghetto. And so to me, she was just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there. Because I am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she's never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me. A black woman who sits On the committee. And then of course she went after AOC and called her unintelligent.

Okay, so you said one thing LED to another, but in my head, for some reason, I see two things lead to another, but there's neither here nor there. You took entirely too long to tell this story, so let me try to break it down for the people in less than a minute. So, apparently his mom and his dad split up when he was a young boy. His dad then went off and had another child by another woman. His mom, being who she was, didn't want him to know he had another brother, so they didn't really interact again. This was 19 years ago. Fast forward. He finds his brother on TikTok. Him and his brother interact, and they get to know each other. And somehow they end up in California at the Grandmama house. He get to the Grandmama house, and the grandmama say, this will can stay, but you can't stay. I don't know what he did for him not to be able to stay with his grandma, but therefore, another video. So anywho, they end up camping out in the car. He say they were sober, but also in the same breath, he say that one of them thought that they was god and one of thought that they were Jesus. Uh, so I would think they weren't sober, cause he did then say they was on mushrooms and all. I Would say, today to them was some hell of a mushrooms. And he said, fast forward. A week later, the little brother said, oh, I think we should be together. And then at this point, I don't know if they were still in California, cause this sound like something they do in West Virginia. I'm sorry. Let's get back to the story. In the older brother tells the younger brother that, oh no, we can't be together. Well, apparently what he meant by that was no strings attached, because the next week, he slept with his little brother. And now they don't talk. Kinda like most people when you break up with your ex. But this ex just so happened to be his little brother. There you go.",

I shouldn't have to play a game where all I say is hi and the whole game is thrown and I'm in hell for the next 40 minutes because men are being emotional about it. That is not normal and that's not how the old Cod days were. Because I promise you, as a man, you have never had somebody throw on the basis of your gender. That doesn't happen. You can say it happens. You're lying. I'm sorry. I don't know why that's such a common thing in the comments of my videos. You guys wanna be oppressed so bad that you look at a man calling me a telling me he's gonna tell me to get back in the kitchen and say it's not a woman thing and say that that happens to you too. It doesn't. There's a reason that historically male dominated spaces are known for being toxic and unsafe. That goes for gaming, that goes for sports. Any male dominated space is a bad one. That's not me being sexist. That is me saying there is an inherent issue with the way that you guys have your locker room talk that makes everybody else feel unsafe. I don't know how you could possibly find it fun to make other people feel unsafe. No woman is Asking men to make gaming a safe space with sunshine and rainbows and everything. But could you please be normal? Because I wanna be able to enjoy playing the game without my life being threatened, without my body being threatened. Because I'm existing as a woman and men are the ones making it unsafe. I do not care if you feel targeted by me saying men, or if you feel attacked by me saying men, you are part of the problem. If you feel attacked by that, you're part of the problem. If you say, just mute them, you're part of the problem. If you sit there and let them say that me and you don't intervene, you are part of the problem. Because I have a lot of male friends, a normal male friends who don't say slurs and don't threaten people and just play like normal. I understand it is not all men. But if you are not one of the men doing this, it is entirely on you to help stop the men who are. If you don't understand that, and you don't understand power imbalances and gender hierarchy, it's not my place to teach you. I'm not your mother, I'm not your teacher. Close the game for five minutes and educate yourself. But stop making this a bad experience for everybody else who's just trying to play the game.",

I confirmed they closed at 10. I quickly drove up there only to be told the store closed at 9:45, but it says online and on the door 10. Why did i have to argue with employees about closing the store before time? One guy said they close at 9:45 while the other asked me to name a store that stays open that late. @Dollar General please do better. It took 2 minutes to grab what i needed and checkout. I stood there and argued with them longer than it took to get my items before they let me in. The employees on Woodson Rd don\u2019t care about business. Only getting out right at 10.   #dollargeneral #poorcustomerservice #fyp ",

Y'all heard it. So what is this? And my sister works for corporate, so I know. That's why I just drove 25 minutes to get here, because it said online that y'all close the 10. So you can. And when I'm coming in here to get some tissue, and I know exactly what I want, there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to walk through this door and get what I want and what I need. I work at a bank, and at the bank, if you walk in and 4:59, we're gonna let you in and do your transaction because you made it before the time we close. So do you close at 9:45? Bye. Bye. Uh, so why does it not say you close at 9:45 online? Why does it not say online you close at 9:40? No, I'm asking you. You work here, and you're closing the doors. Thank you.",

People online are calling the speech demeaning to working women and also say it is mysogynstic.  A\u00a0petition\u00a0was even started to have him removed from the\u00a0Super Bowl\u00a0champion's roster, which has now reached over 100,000 signatures.  He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend. And, also in the speech he criticised Pride month, a particularly important time for the\u00a0LGBTQ+ rights movement. #lifeandstyle #HarrisonButker #TaylorSwift #NFL #KansasCityChiefs #Chiefs #Butker",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.",

Can you imagine losing your father, your mother, your grandmother, and going through one of the biggest transitions in life that you can possibly have? Becoming a star, all while having no parental guidance, no familial guidance, no nothing. Early 20s is already a difficult time for most people. She went through her transitional years in front of the world, in the midst of accomplishing her life's dream, which is again something that most people don't get to do so young. While going through legal battles with her label, graduating college, falling out with friends, falling out with your icons, having difficulty dating, turning to alcohol because you feel like the weight of the world is on you, and then being assaulted and not just getting shot, but having people questioning your story, your integrity, everything. And in the midst of having your so called partner cheat on you. Like watching this girl succeed and make it on her first tour and having people singing her songs word for word, I just know that has to feel amazing and feel like she is just on cloud nine. And I love that for her because I feel like she deserves",

The report states: \u201cIt is important that schools take a cautious approach to teaching about this sensitive topic, and do not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum\". Many have already compared the new guidance to Section 28, the anti-LGBTQ law introduced by Margaret Thatcher in 1988 which banned local authorities and schools from \"promoting homosexuality\", which wasn't repealed in the UK until 2003. At the time, it was the first piece of anti-gay legislation to be introduced in the UK for 100 years and was a direct response to calls for greater equality from LGBTQ+ activists. Thatcher encapsulated the sinister intentions behind this law in her infamous 1987 Conservative Party conference speech. She said: \"Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay\u2026 All of those children are being cheated out of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated.\u201d Amnesty UK have published a statement condemning the new guidance, writing: \"A whole generation of LGBTI children and young people were left scarred by Section 28 - we should strive not to make the same mistakes again.\" #rishisunak #margaretthatcher #section28 #transrights #lgbtq #conservatives ",

No one, like no outside source, can change their mind or change their laws. This is what they're implementing.

Then he goes on to say that Isabelle, his wife, has no regrets about giving up her dream of having a career. Isabel's dream of having a career might not have come true, but if you ask her today if she has any regrets on her decision, she would laugh out loud. Now, his wife is truly happy with that decision. I absolutely support her. I think being a wife and mother are beautiful things. I think addressing women specifically and saying, this is your purpose is really unfortunate, to put it mildly. You know, she is happy and healthy. They have a great marriage, great family. Then I'm all for it. For them. I fear that may not be the case, but I. I pray that I'm wrong. Also, by the way, this is his company, MD Keller, for which he is a co founder, and the college where he gave this commencement speech. It is listed as an organization that his company fully endorses. Now, there is something he said that I actually agree with. It has to do with men being absent from their homes. But I'm sure we have different thoughts on why that is. Here's that clip. Absence of men in the home is what plays a large role in the violence we see all around the nation. Other Countries do not have nearly the same absentee father rates as we find here in the. He also spends quite a bit of time arguing for traditional Latin Masses. And I understand he's talking at a Catholic church. Seems a little odd to me. Why is he arguing so hard for this, like at a college graduation? It just seems kind of out of place. I don't know. Just like, a little odd. Last clip about cost of living is extremely important that you actually think about the places you are moving to. Who is the bishop? What kind of parishes are there? Do they offer the TLM and have priests who embrace their priestly vocation? Cost of living must not be the only arbiter of your choice. That's pretty rich coming from a multi millionaire. It doesn't have to worry about the cost of living all that much. Anyways, just wanna share some clips with y'all.",

Because I've seen women do it. Would you like me to answer the question? Go ahead. Okay. Because biologically, we. Our bodies change over time. They'll naturally gain and lose weight in different circumstances. And your worth as a spouse, whether you are a husband or a wife, is not derived by your weight. That's just a shallow thing. Now, I think that both husbands and wives. But it's your job to be attractive. It's your job to be attractive. I think husbands and wives should both maintain attractiveness. But why do you always like. Why do you always have to bring it back? Cause right now. Right now. Right now. Right now. Because we're asking about the deal for men. So I'm looking at this from the man's point of view. What does the man get out of it? Is this a good deal? He gets. He gets. He gets a woman for an in shape wife. He gets a woman. He can't even say 120 pounds. Can I. Can I. Can I answer the question? I'm asking. I'm asking. He gets a woman who's promised to stay with him even though statistically, He'll gain 30 or 40 pounds. And that cause that women's job has far more of a job to be beautiful than men. You know, men's job is to protect and provide. What is wrong with a man asking that she says a certain way? Cause it's. Cause it's shallow. It's fine to ask someone to be healthy. And it's fine to encourage your spouse to maintain attractiveness, not to just let yourself go. But that's the same for husbands and wives. Neither should just let themselves go. But at the same time, each one should. Each one should be merciful, knowing that time and age come for all of us.",

Or man, where has this been my whole life? High speed rail, affordable healthcare, nice infrastructure. The reality is, this is how life should be. This is how our tax dollars should be spent. As tax paying citizens, we deserve the best public services at least. Hmm, I wonder where all the money is going. But anyway, it's 2025. Upgrades to daily public services should be a right, not a luxury. It is almost as if they care more about upgrading our phones versus upgrading daily essentials. It was just the other day when we realized that none of these third world countries outside of the US are in the future. Their government just knows how to put tax dollars to use in a different way. Could you imagine how the USA would look if they positively innovated technology? It is definitely not normal to see people struggling or homeless. A lot of the things that people think are normal in the US definitely are not. Once you step out of the comfort zone and travel, you really begin to understand what is supposed to Be normal and how public systems are supposed to be.",

The problem is he's speaking to young women at their graduation, basically telling them their worth is tied to being a mother and wife. Specifically stated that he felt that his wife's life or vocation didn't really begin until she became a mother. That's really insulting for those of us who are A, aren't married, B, aren't mothers, and C, who maybe find value in academia. You're literally at a graduation where the sole purpose of the ceremony is to celebrate what a woman or a man has done over the course of four or five years to obtain a specific degree in which they're going to utilize as a career. And while I didn't listen to the whole thing, it did sound a bit self indulgent. It was a diatribe of his political beliefs and really came from an utter place of privilege and the Assumption of what he thinks women should be excited about. And so, no, I don't think it's appropriate at a college graduation to share those viewpoints. I don't care if he's Catholic, I don't care what kind of a college it is. The idea that a woman's worth is tied to her homemaking status or her ability to be a wife is like it's stuck in the stone ages.",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

It ain't got nothing to do with Billy Port of being gay or even being on Elmo. Cause they could have put any gay black man on there. But why do you have to put it in dresses and heels? Every gay man don't wear dresses and heels. And if it is gonna be displayed to a kid, cause you have young kids who already know what they like. If that is the case, that's not what the whole gay world is built upon. Nails, heels, dresses, wigs and gowns. That's first and foremost not for a kid. So when I say it's the time and the place, you. He could have wore that dress that he was anywhere else. Why he couldn't put on his suit inside? For a kid's cartoon, it's not that motherfucking important. That's the part charge failing to realize. It ain't got nothing to do with nobody accepting you or not accepting you. It's not for a kid. What grown ass man is even comfortable walking around some kids with some heels on? The community. I'mma say it since ain't nobody else gonna say it. It's so many boys walking around with dresses, heels, makeup and skirts on. That that's why a lot of people have a hard time respecting the transgender community. Because you have so many clowns walking around, people cannot identify what's trans and what's not. And you have people that have put blood, sweat and tears, mental and everything. And today and today, transition and shit like that. And it goes out the window. Because you have so many men with beards and mustaches and nails on. That is made of mockery out of people life who live this shit every motherfucking day. It's a lot of the boys from the community that fucks it up for our trans women. Because you got so many of y'all walking around in skirts and shirts. Bitch, nobody knows what real trans is anymore.",

    "voice_to_text": "this is a great question that I get asked all the time so I thought I'd do a little video to explain because my way of getting an agent wasn't necessarily the usual um usual way so basically when you go to musical theatre college or like a drama school acting school whatever the usual way is that your college will put on a um showcase a performance a show at the end of your third year where\u00a0they'll\u00a0invite\u00a0loads\u00a0of\u00a0agents agents come along your informations there for agents to contact you they watch the show they say I like them you contact you Merry Christmas you get yourself an agent because I went to for whatever reason I actually don't know I think things have changed now that but we didn't have any agent showcase we didn't have um Agent you know a musical that they can come and watch we didn't have a showcase we had a summer show that the whole college was involved in and the agents would come and watch but you know they might see someone they really like and they'd be like first year so they weren't available to them and it wasn't specifically for agents it was just so happened like if agents happened to buy tickets and come and watch they could so really weirdly we had to kind of go like the underground back route to get agents and it was kind of a thing where it wasn't really discussed because you weren't really allowed to contact agents even though everyone did and I'm sure the staff all knew the people contacted agents but we weren't really allowed to discuss it I don't know why it was so weird but basically what happened was is that um agents were either coming and you would either hear from friends at so and so and tonight because they've maybe emailed them but you could email but we would email ahead to say hi by college during this summer show and I've got feature or whatever like please come and watch so I contacted a few agents and then I also had um someone I knew who had graduated that college a couple years before me and their agent came to watch and they messaged me and said hey my agent watch the show um she'd love to have a meeting with you can I put you in contact and I said yes and that's actually the agent I ended up with um but also other um like third years of the time so by the time I got to 3rd year people who were in my 3rd year who were with agents their agents would come and watch and then use them to contact us so I get messages from people being like hey my agent came to watch um the show the other day they'd love to have a meeting with you can I put you in contact that way um and then the other agents that I met with were just people that I'd reached out to and they said yeah would love a meeting and then you have your meetings and like some agencies were really keen to have a meeting with me and then I went for a meeting thought it went all well and then they didn't offer me representation I think it really just depends on like your vibe like if the agent feels like they're gonna get on with you if you feel like you're gonna get on your agent and yeah I went to a meeting with my current agent while I was in third year sat down with her and had a coffee and we just had a chat and really really got on with her and I was like yeah this is gonna work really well and it has um and she actually approached me because I had a solo to open the college summer show which is another whole story within itself so maybe I'll tell that story here sometimes it's quite funny story um but yeah she was like really keen to meet with me and yeah it all went really well so that's how we got ages at our college it was a bit of a different way so if you go to a university or college or whatever musical theatre college that don't allow you access to agents in the like um conventional way it's not impossible and also if you don't end up going to a college and training in musical theatre and doing it that way it's also not impossible to get agents and there are always ways in",

    "voice_to_text": "So it's, like, common knowledge. I'm not a gardener, I'm a beekeeper, right? Like, we all know that. But recently, I got into gardening again because I've had friends come over, they bring over their gardening tools, and I'm like, well, you're not gonna garden by yourself, babe. Which got me thinking, I can't only be gardening when you come over. I have to be able to garden by myself. So I had this crazy little idea since I got my little gardening tools. Now, what if I set a timer on my phone for every five minutes? And every time the timer goes off, I have to garden. we're gonna figure out how many times I can garden every five minutes before I tap out. What do you say? I knew you'd be into it. Let's get it. First thing, let me set a timer. Now, let's take the first one so I can start this timer. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight was cash. I'm making a new one. And I'm also going to make it two every five minutes, because I feel like I'm not challenging myself. And that was eight and nine, 10 and 11, 12 and 13, 14, 15. Holy shit. 16, 17, 18, 19. I need to hit one more. It was cashed. Okay. Twenty and a half, if you count the cashed. I just, like, got up and walked around for a second to, like, stretch my legs and stuff. And, um, I forgot why I was telling you that. So, after harvesting 20 gardens, um. Yeah. Yep. Side note, I just realized how still my hands are. These fuckers are rock solid. I ain't moving. Jesus Christ, man. You don't understand. I have anxiety really, really bad. I shake like a Chihuahua. Dude, I ain't moving is nice.",

You might have heard of him. You actually, you probably haven't, cause we've seen your hair in a hospital bed. As if he just went through the pains of labor and is in some form of recovery. The poor child is screaming and crying out for a mother that it will never know. Tell me you know nothing about newborns without saying you know nothing about newborns. I mean, I don't know if you know this, but when they come out, they, um, they cry. It's pretty natural. It's natural thing. There is no excuse for this crap to be legal. There's no socially redemptive value. And a deranged lunatic man purchasing a child and taking them and intentionally depriving them of a much needed mother in their life. Do you fact check anything? Anything at all? This guy's pretty well known and his surrogacy journey was everywhere. He didn't buy a baby. His sister carried a baby for him and his partner in a loving and caring way. And this whole painting that a trans person bought a baby and then held it like they were pretending to be a woman is just Bullshit. And this. This is the hate speech that we have going on where we could just change the narrative of a picture, and people believe it. People are commenting all over the place that we allow people with mental health issues to have a baby, which clearly there is nothing that shows in this picture that anybody has any mental health issues. Trans community does not have mental health issues to where they cannot care for a baby. Gay community does not have mental issue mental health issues where they cannot care for a baby. But this kid right here, this kid, I hope he never has children. Because I can tell you, if the kids don't turn out in any way, shape or form that he pleases, he will probably just throw them on the street and make them somebody else's problem. Yep.",

    "voice_to_text": "Outfits inspired by Mask Lesbians, part 2. Guys, I'm brand new to this. My stylist friend Corey Carter just took me shopping, like, a couple weeks ago. I'm standing on the handsomely broad shoulders of 1,005 six masks. I'm clay in the Potter's hands. I'm but a wee babe cradled in the strong yet tender arms of lesbian love. And I thank you for it. Now, you guys ask for more outfits, and for my ex Mormon friends in the comments, you shall receive it through the veil of TikTok. Let's go. But before we get started, we got to remember where we came from. This is a picture of me before the mask fashion algorithm snatched me out of obscurity. This outfit is white noise in more ways than one. If this was a sound, I'd be asleep. My hair looks like you could surf on it. But we're in post algorithm times. Let's see the looks. There he is. This guy looks like he probably drinks IPAs and avoids going fishing with his Republican uncle, but he looks damn good doing it. We got the high tops with the green shorts and the hat. And glasses, cause you guys asked for more glasses. Historically, I've struggled with brown clothes, but we're leaning in. We're finding our way. We got a crop tee. We're back with the pearls. A little Easter egg art for you last of us fans. Lastly, we got this gym. I have not had the Confidence to wear this out in public. So I'll just share it with millions of people on TikTok. Cause that totally makes sense. We got the dangly pearl earring, the high waisted trousers, and we got a little fake nose ring because you guys wouldn't leave me alone about it. But this outfit is a perfect example of, like, a masculine look with just a little feminine. Just you. Just a little spice, just a little something. Shout out again to the, uh, mask lesbians on my algorithm for bringing me to the light and teaching me your ways.",

Since the cast and the journey, we have to go back in 2017. Twice upon a time, the show has been hit with these comments left and right. But what if I said. And hold on, maybe it's always been that way. Let's start with the casting of an openly gay man as an openly gay, or at least boy character. And everyone loves him. He's a fan favourite. What about openly gay characters like Bill parts? Or, hell, even boy ones like River Song? Look, there she is. There she is. But you get my point? That there has always been this kind of representation in doctor who. Now, I'm not saying that this new era, you know, isn't kinda pushing it with certain little scenes. Like, I completely agree. That is pushing the boat out a little bit too much. I don't know, maybe it's just me. What do you guys think is doctor who to work now? Let me know.",

So take it from me, a certified EMT, do not put that in your butt.",

    "voice_to_text": "Here's a tip on how to look less insecure in public. I'll just stand up so I can show you. Okay, so the main thing is don't look pussy with the mannerisms in the shit that you do. One thing, I used to do a lot of nervous tick fuck with my shirt when I felt uncomfortable in public where I just felt weird. I would like do this and try to hide my stomach cause I just felt off and it was a nervous take of mine. So the way to counter that and not make it look insecure is just look down at it. So if you notice that you're like, visioning with your shit, just stop and look at it. Fix your shirt, get it situated. If you got a piece of lint on it, grab it, pull it off. Be intentional with the action. Don't do the whole pussy thing and like, be so scared and timid. And the other thing with fidgeting, like if you wear jewelry and stuff. A lot of people wear jewelry to have something to fidget with, but it can make you look insecure as fuck. The same thing applies if you're fidgeting and you feel uncomfortable or you feel like your bracelet has flipped or moved around and you're trying to just like, silently flip it, look down at it, whatever is flipped, just fix it and you're done. When you try not to pull attention to something is when It draws more attention. So if you're gonna fix your shirt, fix the motherfucker. If you're gonna fix your bracelets, fix them. And stop doing the little scared, timid eyes. This is just a little tip. Something physical to help you. But if you have anything mental you wanna know about confidence to leave in the comments. Ask away. Let's start a series of this shit.",

And if we being honest, it really don't look like Claire's wanna be married. Yeah, he said he's wanted to, but I feel like he wants to because he feels like you want to. He wants to keep saying that so that you don't leave and to keep giving you hope and into. And, you know, keep having you wishing and shit. No, baby, no, baby.

For life. This will be a simple but very important evolution as we seek to ensure that everyone feels welcome in Scouting.\u201d The change is expected to come into effect by February 2025 on the organisation\u2019s 115th anniversary, according to the Boy Scouts of America. Girls aged seven to 10 years have been able to join the scouting organisation\u2019s program since at least 2018, with girls aged 11 to 17 being permitted to join a year later. Boy Scouts of America wrote at the time that the decision was requested by families for years to help consolidate programs for their children, according to CNN. The decision to change its name to best acclimate who is allows to participate in Boy Scouts of America programs has, predictably, been heavily criticised by right-wing organisations which have called the decision \u201cwoke.\u201d The infamous right-wing social media account, Libs of TikTok, said the decision was \u201cunreal\u201d in a post complaining about the Boy Scouts of America making itself more welcoming. \u201cWhy do they have to ruin everything,\u201d the account\u2019s owner, Chaya Raichik, wrote. Despite the backlash, Krone has insisted that the future of the organisation remains bright, saying to the Associated Press: \u201cIn the next 100 years we want any youth in America to feel very, very welcome to come into our programs.\u201d \u201cPart of my job is to reduce all the barriers I possible can for people to accept us as an organisation and to join,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt sends a really strong message to everyone in America that they can come to this program.\u201d More than 1 million under-18s are currently enrolled in Boy Scouts of America programs across the US, including 176,234 girls and young women. 6,000 of those girls are believed to have earned their Eagle Scout rank \u2013 the highest rank attainable in a BSA program for participants who have earned a minimum of 21 merit badges and been a Life Scout for at least six months. Boy Scouts of America alumni include former presidents, including Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford, astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Stars Wars actor Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg. #boyscouts #boyscoutsofamerica #tedcruz #libsoftiktok #usnews #republicans #ComfortSegredos ",

The video with this woman calling herself a witch was from Eurovision. And you think to yourself, how do these people get on these platforms? Because the world is being ran by wickedness. Are y'all starting to open up and see it yet? Because we've been talking about it with a lot of different American artists. There's been too many people going to concerts that are demonic. How do you call yourself a person of god? How do you call yourself a Christian and still listen to these people and still watch these people? I said it before, and it's happening now even more. The veil is being lifted. And you have a choice whether you wanna go with the world or whether you wanna go with god. And if you are still watching these people, if you are still listening to these people, you are going with the world. It's time to wake up, my brothers and sisters, because this is only gonna Get worse. And your mind is either going to be sealed in the world in a beast consciousness, or your mind is going to be sealed with the name of God, Jorhe vavhe, meaning you'll be in God's character and function. But if it's sealed with the world, you will be in the world's character and function. But that choice will ultimately be up to you. Now is the cutoff time. Make it happen before it's too late. God bless. Shalom.",

I'm walking home at night and this girl had a bomb outfit on. I'm talking dress to the nines. Wherever she was coming from, she tore that down. I was feeling myself walking home, but I had to stop and say, girl, you look good. When I tell you, the look on her face gags me. Curse, clutch, eyes wide. One girl was genuinely scared, which honestly kind of saddens me. I could tell she was scrambling for her words, but the first thing that came up was, oh, I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend. One thing about me. I'mma make sure the girls feel comfortable. Had to clear my voice and I said, oh, baby, you look so good. And the gayest voice I could. Right when I did that, my girl unclench her purse, eyes relax until she was so relieved. It's all for a little bit. Afterwards, I said, girl, what you choose a right.

Hedman, 64, pulled out of the Denmark Open when set to play defending champion 27-year-old Noa-Lynn van Leuven in the quarter finals, Fox News reported. Although it was initially reported that she had pulled out due to illness, Hedman confirmed on Twitter/X that she refused to play Van Leuven. \u201cNo fake illness, I said I wouldn\u2019t play a man in a women\u2019s event,\u201d she wrote, misgendering Van Leuven. \u201cThis subject [is] causing much angst in the sport I love. People can be whoever they want in life, but I don\u2019t think biological-born men should compete in women\u2019s sport.\u201d Van Leuven went on to lose to Beau Greaves in the semi-finals.  Former US college swimmer Riley Gaines, who has made a name for herself by campaigning against trans women competing in women\u2019s sports, offered to pay Hedman\u2019s lost prize money. The winner of the Denmark Open receives 12,000 Krona (approximately \u00a31,400).  \u201cThank you for your kind offer,\u201d Hedman replied. \u201cDenmark Darts paid me out in full for the event.\u201d Matthew Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation, has previously spoken out in support of Van Leuven, explaining that she complies with the organisation\u2019s transgender participation policy. In an interview with Online Darts, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our policy in darts, it\u2019s a policy we are very comfortable with.

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

Then he showed up with that mush that I see in the beginning. I don't give a damn. One thing I'm gonna do is eat up some short locks. So, you know, I had to wash his hair. So I put it in a little ponytails and wash them. This was after the wash. So as I get to cut afterwards, I see his hair is longer than I thought. Or his hair grew quick as hell in him. 3 weeks. Either way I went, I'm like, I think I might be able to do a style. If I do one, are you gonna want it? Cause he's under the pressure. He's not gonna get a style because my job, he only booked for retwists. So I used to retwist that real quick and I'm thinking, already straight back for barrels, but the ones in the front wasn't going. So I tried to do the first one and I just stopped in the middle of my. Let me just do the back first and see how I come out. Gray said, take that shit down, and I took that shit down. Psych now. Yeah, that was me who didn't like It. And I'm never gonna get something that I wouldn't even walk out the doorway. So I'm always check with shot first. We decided to go with this. Yeah.

This is from a parade that happened in the east side of San Jose during Cinco de Mayo. The person that posted the original video called them drag Queens. Although I am unsure, because as far as I know, drag Queens tend to be very exaggerated. And this is pretty mellow. So I love for somebody to educate me here. But now let's listen to the original commentary. Dude, they had drag Queens at the Cinco de Mayo. Pray for East San Jose. It wasn't on the flyer announced. Um, nothing wrong with drag Queens. Nothing wrong with gay people. I have a gay uncle, we have a. I have a trans nephew. The thing is, not everybody raises their sons to be feminized. And you know, not everyone raises their sons, uh, to wear dresses. Matter of fact, a lot of, lot of fathers be like, dude, guys don't wear dresses. And if he grows up to wanna wear dresses, is fine. But us, his fathers and parents, um, some of us are, you know, very, very, how do you say, careful about what's planted in our kids minds at a very influential young age. They don't got drag Queens in the Portuguese festivals. They don't got drag Queens with the Vietnamese celebrating their stuff. The Indian community don't have drag Queens. The Pacific honors don't got drag Queens. Not wrong. With drag Queens. But how come? It was the gay parade, we got the drag Queens, and now guess who has drag Queens now? The East Side Saturday Cinco de Mayo parade. I'm just. Maybe I'm tripping. Let's ask community. The account is that East Side San Jose at times. Keeps calling himself the news but seems a little biased to be honest. He has his comments limited so it's really hard to have a discourse unless you're already following him. But I feel some type of way about his commentary here, so I wanna start this conversation. Despite him saying over and over again that he doesn't have a problem with it, it sure sounds like he does. I'll make a part two. I'll fully dive into what I think about this for some foreshadowing though. I think our community needs to continue to evolve in mind. Says that the one that he's pushing forward here only hold us back. The folks in that video you later on Laugh At are members of our community, are freely expressing themselves, and they're not harming anyone. I think it's a wonderful message for you to learn to express themselves freely as well, but for media. I'll make a long video about this. For now, just let me know what do you all think.",

while but it just I don't think it fits me anymore so sure sure sure got it well we can definitely make big changes and maintain length at the same time I'm not super attached to the length okay so let's start with the overall hanging length down through here first could you point where you would be open to trimming it to I'd say probably like here okay so what I'm getting from you is you're okay with taking length off yes but then I want to clarify do you still want it to fall below your shoulders then I mean I'm okay either way if it's a little bit above that's fine a little bit below that's fine okay but you're looking to take off length yes yes a significant amount I think a significant amount and you could still have it fall below your shoulders okay and that's still going to feel like a change because we're going to be doing um other stuff in the haircuts make it look different as well but taking this amount off would be fantastic for you okay getting that just like brought up oh yeah really beautiful yeah on you okay so then let's talk about the stuff around the face here so this stuff around the face you're saying I want to kind of enhance what's going on yeah there are some pretty curly curly yeah but as of right now it's all kind of one length so the way that we could change it is we could do some face framing layers okay a bang situation um did you have any ideas for the stuff that was around your face so if you have any pictures so I have a couple I'm just kind of like not super like set really I guess on anything cause I think for me it's hard to like like I look at a haircut on somebody else and I'm like oh yeah that's super cute but I can't envision it on myself sure if that makes sense maybe just cause it's been pretty much my whole life that it's look the same way and I'm like it's just kinda boring right see what do we got I love the name of your board can I share it with everyone yeah cool gay aunt hair that's the goal that's the goal okay yes the pictures help the pictures help slowly yeah and see that's why I'm not like that yeah and I feel like that would work I feel like really well with my natural waves yes I love that one can we scroll down a little bit more yeah is that it these are the ones yeah okay which one's your favorite though I like this one yep and I also like this one I just like how it's voluminous it's fun like there's something happening lots of texture layers stuff like that so okay these two haircuts are very similar they they do still kind of fall a little bit below the shoulders this one here is cut shorter around the face so like if she pushes this back it's above the shoulders I just love that one yeah I think I think I do like how it's like shorter up here and longer in the back I think when I put it up to you that'll look really cute absolutely okay so I'm gonna talk more about what I see in that photo okay um in addition to taking off the link which we already talked about we've moved on to the front part which in this photo is shorter it's not a full bang but it's certainly significantly shorter than what you have going on it's cut shorter in the middle to something longer so that you can like push it up and off your face if you would like I think that would look fantastic I love that idea yes so like in the picture it's probably like cheekbone length maybe okay just kissing the sides of the eyebrows so are you comfortable when I hold this stuff up here it just makes me a little bit nervous with the like curliness right here so we could leave it a little bit longer okay let's do that first and we'll see what happens with the curls and then we can make game time decision if you wanna take it shorter okay but I think leaving it you know like cheekbone length will have enough length on it if it does spring up it's not gonna look crazy and you'll have enough length that if you need to use a blow dryer to like style it a little bit it won't be hard okay I'm just worried that they're gonna go yeah so I get that well what we'll do is we will be conservative okay so that it doesn't spring up okay you can certainly have shorter pieces around your face I understand that concern we will definitely talk through that look at this little teeny bit yeah they just I don't know they just do whatever they just do what they do yeah I can't wait to get them wet and see what happens okay so this through here is also significantly different and in the photo what I see is a lot more layering and I see the layers also being shorter but cut in such a way that there isn't a bunch of fullness taken away from the end so it's not cut so that it like tapers and gets really skinny around the bottom you still see a lot of fullness down through the bottom and then there are also shorter pieces okay brought up through here so we bring up the length here and then this is all cut shorter too I think that's gonna be fantastic absolutely you can use your imagination when I yep and this oh my gosh I'm so excited for this yes okay so we're popping up the length we are doing some layering around the face fully aware we're nervous about how the curls gonna be so we're gonna do it conservatively and slowly to see what happens and then what we're going to do is significantly layer the hair after we pop up the length but we aren't going to layer it in a way that makes it like really skinny and tapered around the bottom there's a lot of fullness a lot of movement and a lot of peaceiness through this okay I think that's fantastic yes yes yes let's do it",

Women want men who are leaders, and they want those men to lead them. The more that a woman has to tell her partner what to do, how to think, who to be, the less attracted she is to that partner. What women need to really understand is that the reason why they desire this is because it puts them in a feminine space to where they don't need to do the work all the time. Because guess what? Beauty speaks volumes, doesn't need to do anything. It's already amplifying what's around it. And that feminine state is the most authentic state for a woman. But when the man's a leader, makes her feel safe. And when she feels safe, she flourishes as a woman. But what if the woman's a leader? She's looking for a leader that can out lead her. You better bet your husband leaves you, or else you won't respect him. I'm a leader, so I'm gonna go for a weak man. No, you went for a weak man because you didn't believe that there was a leader that can outclass you. Why don't you feel good enough",

Um, and as you know, I've made myself alone so after it. Yeah. Brilliant. Um, anyway, I wanted to ask about like maybe your relationship with like, um, like gender and like expression, like masculinity and femininity. Cause I've always noticed even before you and Georgia became more like vocal but trans rights that you're always like, not afraid to show like femininity. And that inspires me to embrace it, to, you know, a bit traumatized by it cause I'm trans. Um, I'm only like, how is that changed over the years if, if changed at all? Cause I remember also reading something about like you in the 90s also being like not afraid to be called gay or something. Yeah, and that as well. So like, I wonder, um, like in now this environment with like more transparency and stuff like, has that for you personally changed at all? Don't know. This changes with this. I've hopefully learnt as that as that community has found ways of defining itself and and and and has provided a Sort of, you know, when I was a kid, the idea of. Of being non binary wasn't something that existed. It wasn't a concept. Uh, and. And. And I've. I've seen that emerge and people able to express themselves through that, and I only ever seems positive, as far as I can see. And I think the. The. The kind of. The weaponization of trans rights, gay rights, actually. Well, actually, when I was a teenager, I remember gay rights being weaponized politically, and that always felt ugly and nasty. And now we look back on that 30 years later, and those people are clearly on the wrong side of history. And now there's a sort of similar weaponization of these topics being taken by mostly the right wing or a certain section of society with trying to create fraction and conflict and division where it need be, where it is just about people being themselves and not, you know, need to. You don't need to be bothered about it. Just fuck off and let me move in. And that. That's the best, you know, that's, you know, it's just. It's that sense of just wanting people to be allowed to exist. And I think that there are, you know, that there are no ways of expressing gender identity, sexuality that are more nuanced than they once were. And that only seems to be positive if that helps people to know who they are and see who they are and Communicate to the world who they are. So why. I mean, that. That. My sense of that is just that we have to be in the world. That. That's. It's just common sense, baby. And. And, uh. I just. I think that's a very ugly, uh, use of. Use of these. Some people are being very, um. What am I trying to say? Uh.",

Now, if you don't understand what this creator is trying to insinuate, they're basically insinuating that female to male trans people only exist because of SA trauma that happened early on in life. But they're also being a prime example of god giving someone as much sense as they gave a rock and as much audacity as he gave a peacock. Because my original post was talking about essay performed against men, predominantly by men, and kept quiet due to the action or in action of other men. And this man decided to center his own opinion out of left field. And because it was out of a field about trans people, it tells me that more than likely he has secret desire that he is ashamed of. Because hate is very close to horniness. Say it with me now. If opinion requires facts to be valid, and it does not have facts, it is therefore not valid. And opinions are not peni. The little dangling that he is ashamed of. Not everybody needs to see it or hear it. But in the comment section of my video talking about my own essay, do you know the people that were ridiculing the most? Who are they? Men. And it is men like that creator and other men like the ones ridiculing me up and Down my original post. Are the reason why men are less likely, significantly so, to come forward about the essay. Did you know it is currently estimated that one in six men are victims and survivors of essay? And it's only an estimate. Because men do not come forward about it less they be deemed weak, ridiculed by their peers, and get no support by their peers when they come forward. Now, for reference, the essay in question I was talking about there happened when I was five, when I was five, and it was performed by 14 age men. And that was the first incident. Other incidents that happened later on in my life were performed by much older men. Now, I know it is not my fault. I know I did nothing wrong, honey. I know that. I have worked through it. I have spoken on stage about this, in advocacy, I have talked about this in articles. And that is why people are choosing the bear, because more often, they're the ones perpetrating the assault or they're the reason why the assault doesn't get reported or believed. And no, I'm not tagging the creator here, because that's what they want. They want the attention, because they have no talent in any other way of life other than spouting this turf nonsense that they are proudly a part of. This is for the Men SA survivors, okay? You did not deserve any of that. You are not to Blame for it. You are still worthy of love. And you are wonderful. And I'm so sorry that that happened to you, my darling.",

By the department of justice for creating things to make it seem like the consumer has no choice but to use apple products with apple products, basically monopolizing their products and making it very hard for androids to interact with iPhone products and not be treated like it's a different brand. Examples of this include when you get pictures from androids, and they always look a little dusty, but when you get a. A picture from an iPhone, it's always clear. I thought that was just a technology in the mechanics. No, no. Another example of this is, like I mentioned earlier, when you get a text message from Android, it could be blue, but apple was like, now be gonna make it green, so they be feeling icky and gross when they text Android. You see, it's all marketing. That's crazy. IPhone was. Android is literally a marketing scheme, a marketing tactic. Because, in fact, I worked in phones, and iPhones and androids literally have the same exact qualities. Everything. Sometimes androids have more advanced technology, if you will, and iPhone will get it years later. This, that, and third, they make each Other's parts. Another example of this is when you transfer data from an iPhone iPhone, it's a seamless and flawless experience. Ask me how I know this. I sold phones for years before I got into marketing, but from iPhone to iPhone is a seamless transition. From Android to iPhone, you can have all type of difficulties, all type of things not working and everything not transferring over. So it was all literally making sense. for years I knew androids and iPhones were no better than one another, but what I didn't know was apple was doing it on purpose. They're literally doing it on purpose. So for the whole. Which one is better, iPhone or Android? They the same. Different brand, same purpose, same thing.",

Like, I have people in the comments who are like, that's exactly what it means, and they're straight. No, that's not what I mean. If you're a straight girl and you have intermittent relationships with a straight guy and you have heteronormative sex, then I'm telling you right now, it's usually the dynamic is that the guy does all the work and the girl just does whatever just lays there. Right? That's the dynamic you guys are thinking, and that would be the norm. If you were to look up, like, intimate videos or whatever, and on the internet, then that's what you're gonna find a lot of the times is like that dynamic, specifically in heteronormative relationship. Sorry, not even heteronormative heterosexual relationship. But that's not necessarily how that works. In lesbian community and lesbian community, there isn't a norm of how intimate times work. You know what I mean? That's why we come up with terms to get an idea of what is it that you're into. That's why I'm so sick and tired of people like you. And this is a joke. I'm just tired of people who demonize pillow princes, cause this is what they think it means, and that's not what that means. Like, I love pillow princes. You have.

I don't know if y'all seen that, but, like, let's talk about it, cause i'mma use my platform for this, because why would I not? They're trying to say that the New Testament is a hate speech toward a certain religious group, and I'm not gonna say the name on here cause y'all ain't gonna be trying to take my TikTok down. They're trying to say that the New Testament is a hate speech. And I read the whole Bill, and pretty much they're trying to provoke people on college campuses from talking about the war and, you know, watermelon versus Israel. That's what they're trying to do right now. Um, so with that being said, they're passing a Bill that is going to cause people not to be able to talk about the people of Israel, the certain religious background of Israel. I'm just not saying the name cause they gonna try to take my video down. They ended up bringing the Bible up into this, saying that if they pass this Bill, it's going to have an effect on the Bible. And saying that if they pass the Bill is pretty much, you know, like, the Bible correlates exactly with the Bill. So that means that we're not gonna be able to read the Bible. Like, we can't talk about the Bible or nothing like that. Well, in particular, the New Testament, but it's just like, All the things in the world we got going on, y'all always trying to bash Christianity, always trying to take Jesus down, which you'll never do, because one thing I know about Christians, we stand 10 toes for Jesus. Like, you're not gonna tell me I can't read a Bible. I'm sorry. Wear the handcuffs, wear the handcuffs. Wear the handcuffs, baby on. Wear the handcuffs, cause I'm gonna have to go to jail. Like, you're not gonna tell me I cannot read a Bible or pray to god or Jesus. Every time I see somebody try to say that Christianity isn't real, think of these moments when they, like, go out their way to make sure that they pick on the Bible. Make sure you remember this. Remember all the times they pick on Christians, they try to ban the Bible. They ban the Bible in Utah and schools saying that it was, you know, violent and all these other things. I mean, okay, so, yeah, I just wanted to come on here and talk about that. You know, for a second I felt scared, but then I'm like, at the end of the day, prophecy has to be fulfilled. But I really don't personally think they're gonna pass this law because it's gonna be too much outrage, y'all. Like, it's gonna be an outrage if they do that. Like, that's just that.",

Time lapse. Oh, familiar. Gosh dang. This was a great cheese. The whole thing is coated in this super sweet blueberry sauce and mixed with the creamy butteriness of this goat cheese. It was like I was eating a cheesecake. It was like a blueberry cheesecake or it. It kinda tasted like Chobani. I never got Chobani flip as a kid growing up cause my mom thought it was kind of a waste of money, and she's kinda right cause I would never buy. I think the vanilla is mixed in with the cheese, which really brings out that rich flavor of the goat cheese. This is like the Pinnacle of sweet cheeses. I could eat this whole thing, but I'm not gonna cause I'm out of Lactaid. I'm going to Isonok in like a second here. I'll just save it for when I'm back. Overall, this was a great cheese. Probably the best sweet cheese I've had so far. I'm gonna give it a 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10 bonus round green apple. I recently said in a video that I was colorblind. Some of you guys in the comments were like, oh, so that's why you always look at the. The name instead of the color. And you're right. Most of the Time with this lighting specifically, I can't tell the difference between a green apple and a cherry.",

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

    "voice_to_text": "How to know if white cock or black cock is right for you? Let's talk about it. It's important to know that both will get the job done. But depending on your needs and what you need to fill, one is definitely better than the other. In my case, I will be choosing the black cock for the front. If you are working with a large gap or a hole, you will see that this is going to work beautifully. Now for the back door, my preferences? A white cock. As you can see here, the slit that I need to fill is much smaller. I know some of you may be thinking it's a little excessive to have two different cocks to get the job done, but I am all about the max efficiency and the shortest amount of time. It's also important to have the right size tip for the hole that you need to fill. Even if your cock is well used and pretty beat up like this one, don't worry, it will still work. Now the black cock is fairly new to me, but I did decide to go with a larger tip due to the size of the hole that I am working with today. You're gonna wanna hold it firmly and apply light pressure to the tip and then gently rub it into the crease or hole that you are wanting to fill. It can be a little nerve wracking at first, but don't Be afraid to really get in there and really work it into the area, as any excess mess can be cleaned up at a later time. Once you have filled the hole, you're gonna wanna take your finger and gently rub along everywhere you have put the caulk. I advise that you use a glove for Protection. Fortunately, I didn't have one handy and I was eager to get the job done, so I went ahead and went without. Not afraid. I think this gives a very smooth finish. Pro tip you're always gonna wanna keep a rag around if you're not using a glove, just to clean the excess mess off of your hands. Sometimes it gets a little sticky when it gets hard. Now that it is hard, I am very satisfied with the result.",

What do you do when that little boy that has seen you kiss a man in the mouth and hold his hand and do all that cuddle lovey dovey shit? What do you do when your little boy goes over to somebody else house and he does it because he thinks that it's okay when it's really not? And now somebody wanna harm my baby or they whooping on him or mistreating him because they're calling him gay? What do you do then? When are y'all bitches don't get it through your head that it's just not okay and it's the time and the place? That doesn't make me a self hating gay, that does not make me not love myself. This gay shit just ain't that important to the point where my key has to see it. What about his well being, huh? That's my question for y'all bitches that's always in my comments asking me or telling me what I should and shouldn't be doing. Why is this gay shit that important, huh?",

So we're not just adding beer to mead, but we're actually combining their ingredients and letting them ferment together. For beer, that's malt extract, and for mead, it's just honey. So I'm no expert on beer making, and if you are, I could use some tips. But from what I can find, this malt needs to be added to boiled water, and this just helps kill off any bacteria and also makes it super easy to mix in. And I ended up using one full pound of malt, which will be combined with two pounds of honey. This ratio was honestly kind of a shot in the dark. For most meter recipes, I'll use three pounds of honey, but malt extract actually has a lot of fermentable sugar, and so we don't need as much. With the warm malt, the honey dissolved super easily, but I want to let it cool down to room temperature before adding the rest of the ingredients. Once cooled, I hydrated the yeast and added that to the mix along with a few grams of yeast nutrient. Honestly, I have no clue how the yeast will handle this combination of sugar, but if all the sugars converted, this should get close to 16% ABV, which would be crazy. Luckily the yeast didn't mine cause they started fermenting the next Day. It was actually way more foamy than it usually is. Is that typical with beer? So now we'll come back once this is finished and see how it turns out. So stay tuned.",

I thought she maybe feeling down, so I reached out to her. And, you know, during the call, I also Learned some other things about other sides of the family. And, um, you know, she was talking about. She's like, you know, I, I, I get why. You know, a lot of men, when they get married, their wives kind of start to, you know, channel, you know, what they're doing or, you know, influencer decisions. It's like any, any group when you get married. And so I, thinking that I'm making a funny little joke, say, well, mom, at least you don't have to worry about that happening with me. And she Point Blank just says, I actually pray that it does happen with you, Darren. I pray that every day. So here we are, 12 years later. 12 years later and still doesn't believe it. Doesn't believe I'm gay, doesn't believe I'm into guys, doesn't still hopes I've see the lighter change, I guess, and, you know, it is just. It is. It is just frustrating. It's so frustrating. And mind you, I call them twice a Week. I call them twice a week. And it's, you know, we don't talk a lot about it because it kind of became clear that, like, there wasn't really me. Us talking about it wouldn't solve it. She doesn't want to change her mind. I don't know where my dad is at this point. Um, he was actually the better one of the two when they found out, thanks to reading some text messages as sending to a French boy back in the day. Um, but, yeah, it's weird, and it's like, you know, I don't want to lose the family, but it's so frustrating to know that despite everything, you know, despite everything, I. This is still just. This is not changed in those 12 years. Like, really, not at all. Not at all. The. The only change that we don't have talks about it with her, like, getting upset or making out. Like, I was deceptive in my teenage years for not being. Not coming out, and I'm like, well, you've shown that you would have taken it so freaking well. But, yeah, um, if you and your family have. If you're LGBT and you have a weird relationship with that in your family, I. I see you. I see you. Especially if it's not, like, the worst, because if it's the worst, I get cutting it out and cutting them out 1,000%. But also when it's not like they fully accept or they're embracing, it's just weird. It's just weird to navigate. And, um. Yeah, I don't know what the answer is, but. I see you. I feel you.

Kaya basically shaded every trans bitch on the goddamn market, basically saying that, like, oh, any bitch that was a gay man before her transition, she's not a trans woman. That's a man. Now, if y'all don't know who Kai is, is this bitch right here. Now, does she not look familiar? Maybe I'm part of the same community that we all are in. Amen. But what I don't stand for is bullying other trans bitches because you think that. You eating, baby, this plate is still full, so I'm about to eat that ass up real quick. Amen. Last time I checked, you were on Musically going by a totally different name. We're not gonna use it. But you are by a totally different name, doing shit like this as if we all weren't. Okay. But you were a gay man, if I'm not mistaken. If I'm not mistaken, I was here before your transition, babe. Yeah, I was. Oh, trying to clock another bitches T or whatever the fuck I wanna use. Whatever the fuck I wanna say is crazy to me. A lot of trans girls were gay men before they transitioned. Amen. I have not seen, not One trans bitch be a straight man before she transition. I have yet to see that. The day that I see that, i'mma be flabbergasted. But as of right now, that's not something I have seen. That doesn't mean they don't exist. It just means I haven't seen it yet. Amen. Amen. So before you decide to clock another bitch basically saying she was a man beforehand, baby, you sure the fuck was too. Amen. You were gay before. Amen. I'm just saying because. And if y'all gonna talk y'all shit, baby, please add a bitch. Please add everybody. I wasn't added. I was just putting my two cents in. That was it. Because I'm like, bitch, ain't no way. One trans girl telling another trans girl that she was a man, a gay man beforehand.

I get made fun of in the comments all the time based off of my appearance and the fact that people think that I look and sound Manish. I post on TikTok because being transgender is fun, and people need to learn that. It's important that other people are communicated to, that being a part of this community is fun and enriching and nice, and it makes you happy. Tomorrow I'm in a Shakespeare performance where I'm playing two characters, and one of them is a man and one of them is a woman. And I couldn't be happier that I got to explore my artistic life in this way, where I can explore different genders of performance. My transgender friends are all super nice to me and inviting and, like, the sweetest people you'll ever meet in your life, because they know what it's like for people to hate them because of who they are, so they make sure that you feel accepted with them. As much as I wish that I was born female, like, it's so enriching to have transform throughout the course of my life into this beautiful woman. Even if my glasses fall out whenever I swing my hair. Like, look at me! I got to see this person grow in a way that cisgender people will never be able to experience, and that's something so beautiful. Being trans Is fun and beautiful, and that's why I post on here. Trans joy is real and it's important.",

    "voice_to_text": "I wanna know what people always ask me. They always wanna know, how would I feel if my son turned out to be gay? I've even had people call me a self hating gay because of my response from this. But to answer that question, I will be devastated. And you wanna know why I would be devastated? It's because I live in this world every day where I'm not accepted. I walk in rooms and people still turn their face up at me. I have me and who still won't shake my hand or judge me because of what they feel like I do in the privacy of my own bedroom. So when you ask the question of how would I feel about it? I would be devastated because I would never want my kid to live and go through what it is that I have experienced and went through. Then secondly, you get those people out there who automatically feel like he's gonna be gay because he's being raised in a gay household. Well, let's. Let's clear that up really quick. What I do in my bedroom does not make me or disqualify me from being a parent. My kid don't see to me and kissing and to me and holding hands and to me and laid up, because that's not the reality of what I want him to do. I'm not raising him to think that what I do and how I live my life is okay. Me and date women and reproduce is what I'm guiding him to be. I never am raising a kid to think that LGBT is the way to go. Or the fact that he's a boy, he should date boys. No, you're a boy, you should date a woman. And I monitor the things that he see. My son don't see to me. And kissing in the mouth, he don't see to me. And holding hands, he don't see to me. And later, he don't see to me. And humping, he don't see me dancing and bogging. I have lost a lot of gay friends in this present day because a lot of them feel like I act funny or I don't involve them in my real lifestyle. And you wanna know what the real answer to that is? I am acting funny and I don't involve them. Because at the end of the day, I am raising a son who needs to see a certain type of protocol. My lifestyle, the LGBT, what I do, that's grown up business, okay? And as far as women, a lot of women been sucking each other's pussies for a long motherfucking time, and they don't take them away from being a mother. So why the fuck me want to get fucked by a man? Takes away from me being a man and a father. That's because a lot of y'all bitches don't know grown UPS and bedroom business. Your kids should know what The fuck you doing in your bedroom? Your kids should know what grown folks do. Yokia should know what game means at such a young age. Because you are in control of the things that they see. You feel me? So yeah, bitch, I'll be devastated cause y'all bitches are still so judgmental and cruel.",

So if you're. If you're not down with that, so to speak, if. If you're of another religion that's not. Of that you've given access to non godly entities to make your decisions. Representative listing, could you bring us back to HB 68, please? What? I'm concerned that he's calling our members demons and saying that that's why we support this. Are we against this Bill? Hopefully human entities, but like, what you allow to rule your spirit, your soul and a body, right? And what you allow to rule in the spirit controls your physical soul and your body. If you're in order, a lot of times your body's in control. Uses the spirit feed to feed its energy. That's. It's kind of a medical, physical conversation. Not call you demons or just bring up the fact you might be possessed in making decisions. Without the discernment of god. All right. And I will just say in behalf of my members and those who represent of other religious backgrounds, that the. Any opposition to this Bill, I will strongly say, is not from possession by demons. Um, but. So thank you very much.",

White torture is a type of psychological torture technique aimed at complete sensory deprivation and isolation. A prisoner is held in a cell that deprives them of all senses and identity. It is particularly used in Iran. However, there is also evidence of its use by Venezuela and United States intelligence services. The prisoner is deprived of all color. Their cell is completely white, the walls, floor, and ceiling, as well as their clothes and food. Neon tubes are positioned above the occupant in such a way that no shadows appear. The cell is soundproof and void of any sound, voices, or social interaction. Guards stand in silence, dressed in all white, wearing padded shoes to avoid making any noise. Prisoners cannot hear anything but themselves in terms of taste and smell. The prisoner is fed white food, classically unseasoned rice, to deprive them of these senses. Further, all surfaces are smooth, robbing them of the variability of touch sensations. Detainees are often held for months or even years. The effects of white torture are well documented in a number of testimonials. Typically, prisoners will become depersonalized by losing personal identity for extended periods of isolation. Other effects can include hallucinations or psychosis. It was documented in the case of Amir Fakravar, who was arrested in his native Iran and subjected to white torture for eight months in 2004. While the physical pain of sensory Deprivation is minimal compared to other torture techniques. The psychological damage is beyond compare. Vakravar was quoted as saying when he was released, he was not a normal person anymore and could no longer remember even the faces of his parents.",

And if we being honest, if they asked us would we rather be stuck in the woods with a bear or woman, I probably be stuck in the woods with a bear because I never seen a mama bear pick her kids up on Friday and drop them off at her grandma house and don't pick them up until Sunday night. I never seen a mama bear wake up one day and just decide that she's unhappy so the whole house has to be unhappy and she leaves her marriage and her kids. I never seen a mama bear put her babies in a microwave and turn it off for an excess amount of time to ultimately kill her child because of postpartum. I never heard a mama bear saying that her youngest kid was getting bullied by her two older kids, so she killed her two older kids and kept them in the freezer for years while people were searching for her kids. I never once, like, had these type of things come from a mama bear. So I'm pretty much skeptical of dealing with a woman in the woods. I'm sorry. I'm just putting it out there.",

But I remember in, like, 2015, 2016, when all of these men drag Queens and men became, like, sort of the face of the makeup community. Now, the thing is, men are doing their makeup to appear like women, to kind of cosplay as women. That's literally what drag is, right? It's men cosplaying as women. So naturally, like, when a man is cosplaying as a woman, they're doing all this, like, heavy, heavy contouring and structuring and this, like, thick, thick makeup to try to, you know, raise your cheekbones, chisel your cheekbones, lift your face, cover your beard. And then they became the ones teaching these young girls had to do their makeup. I remember doing my first book tour, and one of the moms was like, just so much highlighter. And look into the line of people waiting to meet me, and there was so much highlighter. You know, they say that Gen Z is, like, aging more quickly. I'm gonna go ahead and blame that. Like, all of these products, all of this makeup, we didn't really have that. The thing that's, like, really triggering this in me is I just used my foundation as my concealer, and I was like, this is the whole point of, like, a buildable foundation, right, is you can put a Little bit more in places that you need a little bit more. But at some point, all foundation became, like, we need full, full coverage. And that became, like, the standard is, like, we don't need all that. Do you have, like, severe, severe acne? Okay. Then you might need, like, very full coverage. Do you have relatively clear skin with, like, some blemishes or circles under your eyes? Then you don't need a full coverage foundation. And I'm. I'm glad that, like, this, like, clean girl aesthetic is coming back, because I think it's healthier for women. I think it's more natural for women. And, like, listen, I'm really not trying to be the girl who's, like, makeup shaming, you know what I mean? Like, that's not me. But when we're talking about, like, these beauty standards, of these expectations of women and what we should be doing, a lot of women feel like they have to have this super full coverage look in order to be pretty. And if you like the full coverage look, that's wonderful.",

The people of York are proper grafters, but what UK city has the laziest people? Coming in at number five, it's Manchester with 6.4% of the city's population on unemployment benefits. At number four, we move next door to Oldham with 6.6% of people on the dole. Making it into the top three, it's your favourite city? It's Bradford. Bradford currently has 6.9% of its residents claiming benefits. At number two we have the city of Wolverhampton with a whopping 7.3% of its residents unemployed. But is anyone surprised? There can't be many jobs to work in Wolverhampton. And finally at number one and crown, the UK's Dole Dossa capital with a staggering 8.9% of its population claiming unemployment benefits, it's Birmingham.",

Every time we hear a big alpha man complain about how there's no good women, we're actually hearing him telling himself about his lack of masculinity. When a man steps up and puts the work in, he naturally attracts good women. Women feel safe to be around him, and he has the opportunity to catch the woman of his dreams. One of my favorite videos on the internet is a loving husband saying that he had to earn the love of his wife and earn her femininity. It is on men to earn the goodness of a woman. You don't just pick up a woman at an adoption center like she's a pet and say, oh, you better be a good woman. It is on a man to earn that. Men used to jump through hoops to even be in the presence of a woman. Even a lot of our own grandfathers went through unimaginal lengths to get the affection and attention of our grandmothers. But now women are supposed to settle for men who make TikTok videos, slamming them in their womanhood and having the audacity to say, there's no good women. No, sir. They're just out in the world avoiding men like you and waiting on real men who put the work in to earn them.",

The stems in the undersides of the leaves are covered with tiny hairs called tricombs. They'll stick into your skin like a needle and inject chemicals, including histamine. It doesn't feel too good, but they're one of the most nutritious plants on earth. I like to cut the top half of the plant. And early spring is the best time to pick them. They won't taste as bitter as they will later on in the year, and they'll be more nutritious. Now I'll rinse them off in the stream. And I'll have to deactivate the sting by cooking them. I'll put a little water in my pot, not too much, and I'll let it come to a boil. Sometimes I boil them or just saute them. But today I'm gonna steam them. The heat will deactivate the sting. So after my water comes to a boil, I'll stuff a bunch of them into the pot. I usually steam them for around seven to 10 minutes. Still covered in hairs, but they don't sting anymore. I've read that these are even more nutritious than spinach or kale. They're even high in protein. It tastes just like spinach with maybe more of a nutty flavor. Kind of like walnuts. Very good.",

Because they didn't really have a, um, you know, a cure for it, and everybody was passing away. So I advocated for the gay community. I did fundraisers for the HIV projects. And I look at the community today and how entitled and how they label everybody and they judge everybody, and they say they're diminished and oppressed, and it's. I don't even recognize anymore. I did all that hard work, and all I wanted to do was be accepted. I didn't want to push my lifestyle on anybody. I didn't want to screw myself.

I just want shot. I just want y'all just hear me out. I just want y'all to slow it down and realize that social media isn't real life. Pull up all you fucking stat. One in six women will be attacked by a man her lifetime. Only 1 in 1 million people have a chance to be attacked by a bear. Let's think about this. You live with and walk past in your life, probably hundreds of thousands of men. You will probably never fucking just walk past a bear. All right? So no shit. Okay. I'm in Jacksonville, Florida, Chance, and I'm gonna walk up on a Kodiak bear. What the fuck? Limb to none. Ever in life? Never. You go to the zoo? Fuck you talk about? That's one. That's proximity. The way y'all bring this shit up is ridiculous. The way that that should have been, the way that question should have been asked. Would you rather be in the lost in the woods with a bear that wants to kill you or a man that wants to kill you? The bear that wants to harm you or a man that wants to harm you? But you could get the real fucking answers. I never hit a woman violently. I never put a violent Hand on a woman. I never sexually assaulted a woman. No, none of that, ever. Now, I never even called a woman out of her fucking name. Not to her face. I think all that is terrible and wrong, but y'all acting like men are scarier than bears. You ain't watch enough nature documentaries, baby. Oh, watch the one where they trying to get the pictures of that big ass bear any. And the light from the flash scares them and. And a startled bear. I swear to fucking god, the earth moved when he got startled. Let's go. Just go watch a few fucking videos. The way y'all be. The way y'all. Boy, you dumb as hell.",

    "voice_to_text": "Let's do trashy recession era makeup. Going quite orange and cakey with the foundation. To research this look, I watched a bunch of makeup tutorials from, like, 2,000 nine, 2,010, and I was amazed at how low budget content was back then. Like, these creators had a webcam and a dream. Brows for this look are quite arched and squared off. A black pencil in the water line is essential. I'm applying a black base all over the lid. Now, using a cream base was really popular back then because powder eyeshadows weren't as good, so you needed something tacky for them to stick to. Buffing that out, I actually have a wet and wild eyeshadow trio from around this time, and you can see that the shade still says brow bone in it. This one was presumably for the crease and lid, so I'm not gonna use this exact product, but we're gonna create a similar silvery smoky eye using the Juvia's Place Magic palette. I'm taking one of the silver shades on my finger and just tapping that into the black base. Next, I'm packing a black eyeshadow into the outer V, smoking out the lower lash line, adding an ultra bright shimmer highlight to the inner corner and the brow bone, adding some glitter winged liner mascara. Modern nude lipsticks are a lot deeper than they were back then, so instead, I'm gonna start off with my foundation. Yikes. Okay. Mixing in a bright pink lipstick, I Caved and added a darker lip liner. I know it's not authentic, but the pale lip was not looking good. Now let's add some big lashes. And this is the final recession core makeup. I feel like I'm ready to pop bottles in the club. How did you dress during the recession? Let us know in the comments. Until next time. Bye.",

Got to be talking about a different Noah or a different arc, because something's not adding up here. What does the name no way mean? It's gotta mean something. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I am called Funny Toss. The vampire of the Blue Moon left to me his name as well as his famed grimoire, yet I am but a human. What day? His name is just as confusing as no ways. So this guy's Bonnie Toss? Except, psych. No, he's not. He's about to team up with a man named after Noah from the Bible. Except, psych. No, he's not. Wonderful. You'll start immediately. No, I'm sorry. All I heard from you was a resounding yes! Oh, psych. No, they're not. Noah and Bonnie Toss feel like every Bungo Stray Dogs character split into two people. And I can pinpoint which character is one into which. Vani Toss is Dazai mixed with Rompo. And no way is Atsushi mixed with Kunikita. How this Vani Toss would meet his end? By my own hand, of course. That's how this episode ends. This like how 90% of all Wattpad stories and their first chapter. His baby blue eyes were so piercing, so enthralling. And soon they would be completely lifeless.

One thing that I noticed real quick was that I was actually more toxic than I thought, and I was so quick to yell and go off. I didn't even give myself time enough to just process stuff before just yelling in and go off. And when I got with my girlfriend, I knew she was not going for none of that. Like, she set the tone very quickly that we were gonna talk to each other and not yell. When you're so used to acting a certain way, it is so hard to unlearn toxic behaviors, and that has been the hardest thing for me. But I was able to do it. On top of thriving in chaos. I was so used to drama going on in my relationship, arguing, fighting, not talking to each other, giving each other the silent treatment, that once I transition to a healthy relationship, it was like, hmm, do she like me? Like, it's kind of, like, boring, but the whole time, this is what a normal relationship supposed to feel like. You not supposed to be getting to it with your partner all the time, cussing them out all the time to feel like it's love. Love is peaceful. Love has been really peaceful. When you unlearn those toxic traits and really work on yourself, for yourself and For your partner. So I wanna hear y'all",

Cause now you got your counterparts in your peers asking behind your back if you even capable of keeping a relationship, keeping a man and keeping a woman, etc. See, a lot of y'all felt triggered by that settle video, which was eye opening to me. Because obviously we have a lot of women living in the state of delusion, thinking that they just gonna find the most perfect man ever. And if not, and they can't find that, they'll just be single. As if that's supposed to do any type of advancement to our society. Ask yourself, what is your purpose on the earth as a woman if you're not seeking some type of family, and especially family of your own? Like, what exactly are you trying to accomplish on this earth? Are you trying to be masculine or what? Like, what's the deal?",

Okay, but you directed this video and some, uh, fans of, uh, of, uh, um, Jack's banner, a little upset cause he's barely in the video. I gave him a cameo.

Yeah. And my, my, I may. I came up with the plot, which was that he would Watch me dance for basically the entire duration of the song. And at the end, I'd be like, there he is! Ha ha!",

    "voice_to_text": "first things first I'm sorry if I seem off in this video but usually when I film I pretend like I'm talking to a close friend or a loved one or even like I'm presenting but I realized that I don't have anyone that I consistently talk to about what I'm gonna talk about here so I'm just kind of free balling it I'm just a little nervous because it's something I'm going through right now and it's not easy to talk about so quite frankly I don't want to talk about it but especially given recent events I think it's important to talk about these things openly in case anyone can learn from it or just feel seen and heard now for the thing that I'm going through I'm a first year medical student and last Friday we all had our first cardiology exam on the heart and stuff and it was a pretty hard exam quite frankly but fortunately the class average was an 80% unfortunately however I got a 53.5 like I don't know what to say after that out of 166 students that took the exam I ranked 165th .9th percentile I think like 0.9th and while I'm definitely not happy to admit that I already did all the math for the grades I need to get for the rest of the year to pass the course and all that jazz like I'll actually be fine academically that's not the problem here the real problem that upsets me is actually the same one that caused me to do poorly in the first place and it's just the knowledge that I don't have anyone that I personally know that I can talk to about this period don't get me wrong I've been blessed with friends and family that most of the time I tell most things to and I am very grateful for them but with stuff like this from experience I can tell you it does not go well if I bring it to them and that is no fault of their own or my own I say it's not on my end because I've spent the past two to three years in therapy learning how to open up about such things one on one with another person plus the whole reason I created this page was so I could journal and open up about my thoughts while also teaching other people how to do the same and it's worked so far so I know I can consistently communicate my emotions in a healthy manner and I say it's not my friends and family's fault because it's nothing that they actively do and nothing unique to them it's simply because they view me as a quote unquote \u201ccalm and collected\u201d man and I put that label in quotes because it's not one that I gave to myself and quite frankly it's not how I view myself it's just the label that I haven't been able to shake for like years now and I only know it exists because a weird number of people have just walked up to me and said something along those lines for most people that label or that of a \u201creal man\u201d is associated with the personality type of someone who is mentally tough a problem solver a leader so on and so forth like the person that you go to to solve your problems not the one that comes to you and says I feel like I let myself down on that exam and I'm sad about it so when I as a man bring up such problems to said people I give them cognitive dissonance specifically between three concepts in their mind 1 their labeling of me as a man 2 their understanding of how valid and serious my emotions and problems are and 3 their understanding of what a man is and what masculinity means and because of like how your brain resolves cognitive dissonance one of these things has to go so their brain can work and these things can agree now number three is not being touched their understanding of what a man is and what masculinity means no one is changing that unless they really want to because that is one of like their base views of life many people view male female masculinity femininity as like the binary code to life so that get that out of the way that\u2019s staying with this one safe and sound that means we have to get rid of either the value of your emotions as a man or the fact that you are an adult man in the first place this is the part that's about to get very real for all the guys watching when we get rid of this one that's when we get people like not really caring about your problems or kind of getting that glazed look when you tell them about the thing that they asked about and they're just like oh my god that that sucks bro but you're you're good though right and you go yeah and then they just go about their day as if you didn't tell them anything when you get rid of the man title in my experience best case scenario they have a panic attack like they can't handle what's going on with you and they think that like you're not gonna be able to handle it on your own so they need to freak out and you end up having to use your personal emotional energy to calm them down and then go and handle whatever you needed to handle on your own with less energy than you had before as if you were spending all this energy just to stay afloat and tread water and you tell someone you care about that like you're tired and you don't wanna deal with this anymore and they freak out so much that they jump in with you start drowning make you save them jump out and then you have to just continue as you were here's the kicker all of that will happen in any flavor person like irregardless of gender or where they're from or whatever and on top of that it is completely independent of who you are as a man what your relationship is to them how good you are at communicating your emotions like it just happens when you're facing that while you're already going through something on your own and kind of just expected to carry it on your own it is by far one of the most emotionally isolating feelings there is and as great as things like therapy and doing the work and healing are they can't help you here because this is something not only outside of yourself but it's not even on an individual level it's a societal and cultural problem I think the worst part is that many people see this opinion as controversial or inflammatory even though it's not actually pointing the finger at anyone and it's more so just talking about a common experience that way too many men resonate with and I think anytime that many people feel such a feeling there has to be validity behind it",

New Girl. We've seen this type of character over and over again. The Corky, weird girl. But for some reason, Zoe Deschanel just. Just rub me the wrong way to where by the time you get to the second or third season, you're not watching this show for her. Let's be real. Reason everyone watches the show is because of these four right here. Next is gotta be Peyton from one Tree Hill. Listen, I am a one Tree Hill stand. I am a 90s kid. But Peyton, I'm Team Brooke all the way. We get it, you're the emo girl. You hate everything about the world cause your mom tragically passed away. But that makes no excuse that she is easily the worst friend of all time. She's constantly me, me, me. Doesn't give a shit about any of her friends. Team Brooke all the way. And last, but certainly not least is Ted Mosby from how I met your mother. This man, throughout the entire of the show, claims that he just wants to find true love. But at every turn during the show, just constantly makes excuses and whines about every last thing. So by the time you get to the end of the show, you don't give a fuck how we found love. Let's be Real. We all watch the show for Marshall and Barney. That's it.",

Seals can be naturally curious and love checking out swimmers and divers. However, they can be aggressive. Once you've determined that the seal is just curious and doesn't mind you being in their territory, you can just relax and enjoy the encounter. The seal is nicknamed Onyx, and he loves to check out my knees. You can see a sharp claws poking my legs there. On this day, Onyx kept checking out my fins and my legs. It's important to remember that even though these are harbor seals and they're pretty docile, they still can buy it if they want to. I dug down to the bottom to see what else was down there. I slowly turned around, and I thought that Onyx had left, but then I looked up and realized that he was looking down at me the whole time. Onyx was one of the first seals to ever grab my leg and play with my fins, so I always love seeing him in the water. Sometimes he'll also check out my camera. He's also very elegant when he swims, watch how he soars underneath the kelp canopy and comes back to me. He likes to use his for flippers, like little airplane wings, before he grabs onto my leg. I didn't have a wetsuit on this day, so I could feel his sharp claws. On my bare skin. Then he twirled away and I waved goodbye. Thanks for watching my videos, and I'll see you on the next one.",

This Florida Senate's comeback to pride flags being in classrooms is ICONIC A rainbow flag is intended to indoctrinate  both the concept to students that there are such a thing as transgender, that you can change gender, that seggsuality, uh, you know, should be celebrated, if it goes against heteroseggsuality. Because it doesn't, it doesn't promote heteroseggsuality, it promotes homoseggsuality. It promotes biseggsual, and it promotes everything except homoseggsual- everything except heteroseggsuality. So that's indoctrination. The we kept hearing about queer students an adult does not have the right to put  that label on a child, that label queer has to do with seggsual activity and if the child is below 18 that is a form of grooming that is a form of seggsual grooming and read it really \ud83d\udc40 when you say a queer student that should not be those two words should not be just- You should stop talking.",

    "voice_to_text": "I want to cook up some crystals in my kitchen. So I got this special metal called bismuth and put it in a pan. I stoked up the stove top, and this stuff melted very quickly. On high. The solid metal turned to liquid, and I even added more chunks to the mix so that I could get a huge pool of liquid metal in the pan. After a while, all the solid bismuth melted into liquid. At that point, I skimmed the top for impurities, and the molten bismuth shimmered like a mirror. Once melted, I had to let the bismuth slowly solidify on low. When the top it hardened, I punched a hole in there, and then I poured out the liquid core to expose the crystals inside. To visualize the crystals, I busted out the top, and what I had was a big homemade geode. I got fragments of crystal, and these things were all sorts of geometric designs and colors. Some of the crystals actually look like cityscapes.",

    "voice_to_text": "Girls, what do we think about thong bikini bottoms? I feel like this is an ongoing debate. Everyone has their own opinion. I would not ask men about this because they're very strong on opinions, but they don't have a say when it comes to this. Okay. Strictly for the girls. I personally grew up in Hawaii, so, like, I grew up with girls wearing little bikini bottoms, like, literally strings. And I feel like back home, no one judges. Girls post about it all the time. I'm like, we live on a beach. What do you expect? Like, full coverage just doesn't do it all the time. And I get when we're younger. Like, when I was younger, my parents never allowed me to, but now I wear cheekier bottoms. Like, super cheeky bottoms. But then when I first came to the mainland or, like, Arizona, I felt like I was getting judged and stared at, and I wore the bikini bottoms I had because those are the only things I had. Like, I never had full coverage bottoms except for my surf ones. Like, even when I went surfing, I would wear cheeky bottoms. But, like, when I moved here, it was just, like, I felt like I was getting judged so hard. And, yeah, I've seen college girls wear cheeky bottoms, but, like, I'm talking strings. Like, I'm talking, what do we think about them? Because, like, I don't know. Like, I feel like it's such a Controversial topic. Like, some people love cheeky. Cheeky bikini bottom, some people are against it, like, fully. So, like, what. What's the deal? Clearly, I have no problem with cheeky bikini bottoms. Like, I just ordered one recently, and, like, I'm literally gonna show you guys. Like, this is the back. This is the back. Like, it's basically a string, covers basically nothing. But, like, I'm perfectly fine with wearing it, but, like, when I wear it on in public, I feel like I'm getting so judged. So, like, what do we think?",

The flag was immediately removed, according to Jake Dressler, an attorney who was at the event with a friend who took the video and shared it with CNN. The incident took place in a public space that is off the Yale campus during a demonstration sponsored by several groups in Connecticut, according to the school. #cnn #hanukkah #menorah #isreal ",

You feel confused, you don't understand how you could have reacted that way because you've never seen yourself act like that before and you don't even feel like yourself. You end up feeling guilty about the way that you reacted and ashamed of your behavior. You end up feeling doubtful of whether or not you're the abuser in the relationship because of how extreme and out of character your reaction was. Partner collects some type of evidence like a video of your reaction to try to use against you and create fear in you that everyone's gonna think that you are the narcissist or the abuser. Reaction came out of self defense, meaning you didn't initiate this interaction. If you can relate to some or all of these, you may have experienced reactive abuse where the narcissist pushes you and pushes you and pushes you until you snap and then tries to use your reaction against you to deflect from the fact that they're actually the abuser.",

I don't think I'm done crying for the next few, I don't know, undetermined amount of hours, but we just gonna ride these waves as they come along and think about heaven later. As of recently, I don't like. Me, personally, I don't like to share when I've experienced a transition with certain relationships in my lives where they cease to exist. If I don't want to get bombarded with the cliche bullshit of, I'm sorry for your lost, my condolences. Hey, this woman must be in. Oh, I. I really. I hate it. I hate it, which is why I've decided to just not say anything. However, the other thing that irritates me about it is this entire time, we haven't come up with anything more heartfelt or personal or just not cliche that would make someone feel like you're being disingenuous. Why? Because we, you know, we just don't know what else to say. Well, I got you. I have something that you can say now, all right? In the light that someone has. And the reason I'm not calling and the reason I'm not saying. A loss. First of all, I can't lose anything that didn't belong to me, okay? What I was able to do was experience someone. That experience was unique to us, and it was amazing, and it fulfilled me, and it made me feel seen, it made me feel supported, it made me feel loved. And so, Now that experience has now come to an end, and so that is not a loss. That is actually a gain. So instead of losing, because I didn't lose anything, you can just say, congratulations. Congratulate me for having such an amazing experience with another human being. Congratulate me for being able to feel love in a unique way. Congratulate me for having discernment about who's in my space, because this person have my back. This person embraced me. Fuck acceptance. They embraced me. So congratulate me. I was able to experience something beautiful like that. No more losses, no more condolences. Congratulate. Congratulate me. Congratulations. It must have been so beautiful. It was. Must have been hilarious. It was. It was a hoot, a holler and a howl I I",

Which means she's out of the poke up. And I don't have a co pilot. It wasn't an accident. Bianca behind it. How do you know? Doesn't matter. You and I are going to take her down tomorrow. Wait, you're joining the Black Cats for me? I want to humiliate Bianca so badly that the bitter taste of defeat burns in her throat. Yeah, but mostly you're doing it because we're friends, right? Tell me how she keeps swimming. It's a real brain cramp. The past 2 years, no other boat has made it across the lake and back without sinking. Sounds like sabotage. There are no rules in the Po Cup. And she is a Siren, which makes her master of the water. Then we just need to beat her at her own game. Omg, you look perfect. Only thing, where are your whiskers? Ask again and you'll be down to 8 lives. Focus. What do we have here? The rest of the litter. For the record, I don't believe I'm better than everyone else. Just that I'm better than you. I want to welcome you all to the Edgar Allan Po Cup. This is one of Neville greatest annual traditions, stating back 125 years. Each team must row across the Raven Island, pull a flag from crackstone's Crypt and hustle back without sinking or being sunk. First team to cross a finish line with their flag wins the cup and bragging rights for a year, as well as some special privileges. Let the Pole Cup begin!",
