So for anyone that doesn't know who that man is there, it's Irish actor John Connors and he's currently promoting his new movie The Black Gulf through his socials. Um. Because he says in that video that the powers that be are tryna suppress the message behind the movie and they basically don't want the people of Ireland watching and listening to what he has to say on screen. So no, I'll be honest, I'd been watching the movie regardless cause I'd be partial to a bit of John Connors. I think he's a fantastic actor. But what he would say is that I knew nothing about it until I saw his TikTok. Which speaks volumes to me. Uh, it. It, it obviously shows that it someone is trying to suppress the movie. Um. So John has gone aboard himself and he's promoting it through his own social. So I said I'd give it a share, but I need the Irish especially. Even if you don't like John or his acting or whatever the case may be, I'd strenuously advise you to go and watch the movie. Um. Cause if John is saying that there's a big impartment and possibly scandalous message behind it, then I would take it at first value to be honest. So best of luck John and uh. I'll certainly be going home today after work and clicking the link in his bio to Watch the movie myself, and, uh, I expect it to be a good watch.",

I didn't even like that movie when I finally got around to seeing it but it it just it just kept making money and people kept going to see it and I know that's a little easier for like a family movie but for instance I even remember when I was younger Batman Begins Batman Begins was not some mega blockbuster the way The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight rises were, it didn't do that well it's opening weekend but everyone who went to see it really liked it and we all told our friends I was at the midnight premiere of that movie and it was half full but you better believe I went home and told everyone yo this is an awesome Batman movie you guys should definitely go see this and people did but why have we just given up on that idea and I know I know all the reasons that movies aren't doing as well right now they're all listed in the original the original post about you know movie theater prices and everything like that but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to see that a movie is maybe worth the expense if all of your friends are telling you hey this movie is worth spending a little bit of money and and taking a few hours out of your time to go see because Furiosa is it fucking ruled it wasn't quite as good as Fury Road but I mean that's an incredibly high bar to clear I I would place it a solid third in the Mad Max movies behind maybe behind Fury Road and maybe just under The Road Warrior but well ahead of Mad Max and well well ahead of Beyond Thunderdome and it was great some of the most incredible driving stunts you've ever seen Anya Taylor Joy did a very very good job doing a very tough thing which was taking up a role that was made iconic by Charlize Theron and she really really really did a great job of making it her own and it's very much a movie worth going to see and I I hope people continue to do that because that would be a very good thing for movie theaters and movies in general because this movie is definitely worth it",

But the whole time I was watching this video, I was thinking to myself, what was the first movie that cost $100 million to make? Who in the right mind came to a production company and said, dude, I'm gonna need 100 mill, but trust me, I'm gonna deliver and it's gonna be okay. I need that hundred mil. And it goes on to change the price of blockbusters for the rest of movies history to this day. To where now we are getting up to the point where blockbusters are hundred to 300 million dollars to make now. And that would be none other than James motherfucking Cameron. Why am I not surprised? This dude has been paving the way for blockbusters his entire life. And this was before he made Titanic, which went over a billion dollars. They gave this man, James Cameron, 100 mill for True Lies. And boy, oh boy, did Cameron Fucking deliver. So, yes, at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger probably get made $20 million to $30 million for his role in this. He was in A very expensive person to have on set, but he was worth it. And then you pair with Jamie Lee Curtis, who probably did not cost too much, probably a little bit, but the two of them would carry this movie for sure. And it Was an amazing decision. What did he spend the rest of that money on? Extremely crazy practical effects that look so real. There's a scene at the end where he's literally climbing on, like, this jet fighter pilot. And it is the most insane thing ever. And it's just the most James Cameron thing ever. To be the first person to make a hundred million dollar movie. This movie goes on to make almost $400 million in the box office. A little under than that. So it kind of. It probably broke even, maybe made a little bit of money for them, but at the same time, that's just crazy. I love James Cameron. Dude is fucking amazing.",

It was confirmed to be gypsum through receipts of set pieces that other historians have brought up. And to everybody in the comments bringing up the munchkin that was supposedly in the background of the scene where the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Dorothy are hopping off to see the wizard, that is a myth and it is in fact a crane. As you can watch the original video rather than looking up images that people have posted and potentially doctored, you can see the crane extend its neck to look like a person is in the background. However, this is not the case and if you want more context with any of this, go check out Oz Vlog. She is a historian on Wizard of Oz."

Like, they. They're almost there, they're almost there. Bigotry in all forms, no matter what it is, is entirely illogical. There's no logic behind bigotry. They may spew out all the pseudoscience, but that's not the case. It's exactly the same in the Marvel Universe. There's no logic to the reason why the mutants are hated. But Captain America and the Avengers aren't. That's the point. That's the point of the X Men. That's why they were created.

    "voice_to_text": "Tripp, I wanted to honor your transparency and I wanna let you know from my perspective and my lived experience that's exactly what it looks like people too often with toxic positivity trying to tell us something that we are incapable of doing at that moment it literally took two years before that memory stopped playing like a loop in my mind it played really intensely the first few months and then it subsided then I relocated to Virginia and for an entire year every day driving to work it played in my mind it played over and over and over again and I moved to Virginia a year after Mark transition from this world and I struggled to try to find those good memories that I knew existed but they were cloaked and they were hidden by that last day that last day of Mark have going into cardiac arrest in the hotel room the emergency medical people coming in seeing myself at the end of the hallway screaming into a phone telling family and friends what was going on getting to the hospital everything about that day and climbing onto that table with his body thinking I would never see him again that entire day played over and over again I am sorry but I am glad that you're sharing and that people know that when that movie is playing over and over there's nothing wrong with us this is what grief looks like and you're sharing is helping somebody else know they're not alone so I wanted you to know you are not alone either my widow or brother we are on this together and in time there is a possibility of a changing and for me after those two years I begin to remember a lot of sweet memories a lot of wonderful memories that I had truly forgotten and didn't know they existed in the beginning so I hope the same for you I hope it doesn't last two years but whatever the time is it will be the time that your brain is ready and know I am here with you",

That's. That was one of most traumatic. I didn't expect that. That through me. Even above Glenn's death in Walking Dead, you know what I mean? That we knew someone was gonna get it. But to have all them 12 heads on the spikes, that was brutal. Um, after that, Quinton Fields, one Tree Hill, when you get shots in the. The convenience store, that was, um. That was an awful one for me to take. But No. 1 out of all of them. And comment if you agree, tell me someone is better. George is deaf in Grey's anatomy, and he types and writes around double 0 7. And she goes, oh, my god. That there. I still get choked up with it. That there was a. Was a massive shock for me. There are loads, obviously, game of Thrones, there's a few in that.

    "voice_to_text": "You can't currently legally watch 28 Days Later anywhere. It's not streaming. What I say this is why we collect physical media. That's why you gotta go out there and buy physical media. If I wanna watch 28 Days Later, I go to my shelf, pop the disc in and enjoy the movie. This is why owning physical media is important. Because you don't have to worry about a company or a streaming service to take that away from you. If it's yours physically, it's yours forever. So if you have it digitally, you don't really own it because the studio still on the rights. And if they wanna pull the movie out of streaming services or even places that you buy movies digitally, they can take it away from you. And has happened to me before with Disney. I think physical media is important and everybody should find their favorite movies and own it, at least physically. You don't have to own every movie, you just have to own the ones you love. Also, this is going for crazy prices on eBay. Don't buy for a crazy price. Go to like a pawn shop or yard sale. You'll probably find it for cheap. But do I hear $2,000 for this?"

David Lowry's A Ghost Story very good. Transformers generational picture when Harry Met Sally. All time ROM com obviously. Cursed the Black Pearl. Past lives is a good movie. All of the Lord of the rings movies. Mask of the Phantasm. Could also throw like the flashpoint paradox on this list. Almost famous after sun. Keep it going with coming of age American Pie. The mummy is a very good movie. I think. Spider Man 2 of course. Also across the Spider Verse, into the Spider Verse, yada yada. Pacific Rim is good. Hero is very good. Back to the future is extremely good. Malignant Bangs and Dune Part 2 and Dune Part 1 perfect as well.",

    "voice_to_text": "None of this Goofy Movie resurgence among millennial adults should be shocking anyone. Nostalgia operates in thirty year waves. It always has, it always will. The 80s loved the 50s. The 90s loved 60s. The 00s loved 70s And we just got out of a massive 80s nostalgia wave off the 2010. We\u2019re now entering the 90s era of cycle. And so, with that said, The Goofy Movie now finding a place among millennial adults is exactly what we\u2019d expect to see. That said, I had a movie screening of the Goofy Movie last summer here in my building. Pulled out the projector, we did the whole thing and I'll tell you, it was a massive hit. That movie plays. It rocks. It kicks ass. It\u2019s not just that one song. That whole movie is excellent. It\u2019s a wonderful father son road trip adventure film. It genuinely\u2026 if you have a moment, watch the Goofy Movie. It slaps. Cannot recommend it enough but yes, that song is an earworm. It\u2019s going to stick with us forever because that movie is that good, and also we are just in this part of the nostalgia cycle.",

And I am currently in the midst of creating a proof of concept short film titled Bud. If you want to learn more about the story, the mission, the impact, all that fun stuff, feel free to click the video that it's stitched from. But this is sort of a reminder that we are in our final three days of fundraising, uh, for the film. And we're at a solid 36% fundraising, which is absolutely amazing. we wanna try to make it to at least 50% within these next three days. So anything is appreciated. Keep spreading the word. Um, we still have our fun perks, but we also implemented a fun little dare board where if you pledge a certain amount, you can dare me and our producer Zach to do some embarrassing things such as a TikTok dance or I'll draw a portrait of you. Attempted, of course. Um, or write you a personalized Haiku. Lots of different fun things to choose from. Uh, some of them are first come, first serve, so um, definitely get it while it's hot. You can find the stairboard on our Instagram at bud dot short film, where you can also find the link to our campaign in the bio of our Instagram. And also The bio of my TikTok.

So you guys should all go back and watch this whole TikTok, cause it's very informative and it's all 100% accurate. But the one thing left out of it is that, uh, George Wallace knows his wife has cancer. He's known for years, he just hasn't told her. It's like, you know, the doctors told him. He was like, we'll just ignore it and I'll just run her as a puppet governor at that point. So that was a thing that happened. And there's also a scene in the 2,014 movie Selma featuring George Wallace speaking to President Lyndon Johnson, played by Tom Wilkinson. Wallace is played by Tim Roth. And LBJ basically says to him in the Oval Office, like, why are you doing this, George? Why are you. Why are you taking up this segregational position? You've never been about that. You've always been about helping the poor. And like, he basically tells them, that's just how it is and that's what it's got to be like. For right now, it's the only way I can win. I did the accent there at Liam, but here, here's the clip. Check it out. George, why are you doing this? Your whole career has been working for the poor. Why you off on this black thing? Because you can't have a satisfy. First is the front seat of the bus, next is take over the parts. Then it's A public schools, then it's voting, then it's jobs, then it's distribution.

    "voice_to_text": "What is your favorite dream movie? The movie that no one on this planet has seen except for you. I genuinely think I might be one of the only people in the world to see this movie. Please let me know if you have seen it. But Napoleon, the 1994 movie about this dog, it's. It's basically about this dog in Australia and he lives with some, like, rich white people in the suburbs and then somehow ends up in this basket with balloons. And like, he's like obsessed with being a wild dog. He's like, I don't wanna be with the rich people in the suburbs. Like, I wanna be a wild dog and do some wild shit. He ends up in this basket and ends up going to this like, island somewhere in Australia where, like, shits just hit in the fan and he's trying to be a wild dog. And this bird over here, essentially he is Simba and this is Zazu, but if Zazu was bloodthirsty. And I'll give an example of that shortly, because this movie is also a musical with bangers like this from knock off Zazu tacos, land to kill. Haha. And then the music picks up. Whatever. The entire movie is literally just like them shooting these animals, doing whatever and then putting voice overs over it so there's none of that CGI shit. Remember this was the mid to late 90s. But if you are looking for a piece of nostalgia, Feel good movie from childhood and you've never seen this movie? Highly recommend even though I haven't watched it since I was seven. From what I can remember the plot was pretty good. And if you have watched this, please let me know if you because like, I've literally never heard anyone else in my entire life talk about this movie other than my brother who watched it with me. This is an Australian movie. Have no idea how my mom got hands on it, but please let me know if you've seen it.",

But in the movie The Parent Trap, the 1990s version with Lindsay Lohan, there's the scene at the end where they all go on the camping trip, and they have Meredith Blake, the villain, is with them, and she's about to get in her tent for the night, and she starts clicking these sticks together, and just this condescending tone, like, oh, my god, what are you doing? And she's like, I'm trying to scare away the mountain lions. And like, oh, my god. She's like, there are no mountain lions up here, are there? And they're like, no, you moron. And I don't make it my business to defend villains from 1990s Disney movies, but California has a huge mountain lion population. There is an entire page on the California Fish and wildlife website dedicated to mountain lions, how to avoid them when you are camping, what to do if you ever encounter one. And I just think that in that moment, we could cut Meredith Blake a little bit of slack. And frankly, Nick Parker, Dennis Quaid, one half of the stupidest custody arrangement in the history of divorce court, should be aware that these woods that he is taking his children into do, in fact, have mountain lions.",

And I said, no, I'm gonna like my favorite superhero, Static Shock. Anyway, I did end up getting this, and I only lasted five minutes, like any fraternity guy, but it was only $15. Like, that's worth it. Next we have Martinelli's apple cider. My mom got this for us for New Years, and I said, did we just inherit a bunch of money from a long lost relative because of what is going on here? Also, is this even legal? Because I'm 10. If the FBI finds about this, I think we're cooked. I went and brag to all my friends that it was related to Bill Gates, cause I didn't know what's going on. This is $3, so. Oops. And finally have kiddie pools. I begged my parents for one of these, and they were like, just use the garden hose, which was not the same and had a very harsh jet feature that my brother loved to spray at me. And that's why this year hangs a little bit lower than this one to this day. Anyway, these are $8, and we seem to find the money. For when the dog got hot in the summer.

There is an episode of Criminal Minds where they come to a stop on a gravel road and it's just this screeching sound. Endgame when Tony Stark turns up at the Avengers compound. He's doing like 30 miles an hour on a really gentle curve, coming in to see Captain America. And you just say Urgh! As he's going around. Cause I've been driving for 20 years.

    "voice_to_text": "I'm absolutely baffled by the fact that we still haven't gotten a Darth Vader movie. Unpopular opinion here, but I actually think that's for the best that we don't get a Darth Vader movie. I only say that because of Disney Star Wars track record since 2015. Look at the sequels. They are near enough universally hated by a lot of the fanbase. And you look at some of the Disney shows like book of Boba Fett the acolyte, that hasn't even come out yet. That is getting ratioed beyond high heaven. And you've even got the Obi Wan Kenobi series that was so hyped people watched it, and now very much indifferent about it. Some people like it, some people love it, some people absolutely bloody hate it. And Star Wars at this moment in time is very hit and miss. There's moments where you like, oh, this is awesome, and then there's moments that just make everyone go, why would you do that? If they were to do a Darth Vader solo movie, I don't think Disney Star Wars would actually show it that much respect. Even if it's the greatest character of all time, because he is, I don't think they would treat him or treat the movie or the source material with that much respect I still believe that they would push some sort of political ideology or agenda towards Darth Vader. And yes, Star Wars is very much political, but it was subtle with It. And now it isn't. And if they were to do it now, it would be very. It be off. And I think a lot of people also as well. I think if you're doing a Darth Vader movie, it wouldn't be bad if you have the voice actor come in to do the role. But I think a lot of people just want James Old Jones. And even if Hayden Christensen is in the role as well, if he has like flashbacks to his younger days with Padme, then maybe it could work. Cause there's many stories in the comics where Darth Vader is an absolute badass. We see him like, just go through motherfuckers left, right and center like he usually does. But in Prime Vader, we've never seen Prime Vader in the big screen, so it would be really awesome to see it. But I don't think Disney Star Wars would do that. I don't think they'd show this villain be a villain because for the past couple years there's this notion that not everyone is bad. And yeah, we know what happens to Vader in the end. We know that he comes back to the light, but there is a time where he is just 100% full Sith bad motherfucker. So I don't think Disney would push that because they like the agenda now that not everyone is as they seem. Because there's always a reason behind it. We have to sympathize with villains now? No, Sometimes you just gotta let a villain be a villain. And Darth Vader, instantly one of the greatest villains and characters from Anakin to Vader. Brilliant. I don't think they'd respect that. I don't think they would fully embrace that. They would not embrace the dark side. It would not let me rule the galaxy. But I don't know. Let me know what you think. I mean, I personally would love a Vader film, but not right now. Not while Disney Star Wars is close to death.",

Well, I got a zero on the AP exam, so no. Like, I did make the basketball team, but they did ask me to be the mascot. Honestly, it's, like, better than making the team. It's a big deal to be the Milford masks sea turtle. The mascot. Oh, they haven't washed that costume since, like, the 70s. I'm pretty sure it's just mostly mold now. They just pawn that off on some unsuspecting friend. Teacher, my parents are gonna be so mad at me if I get a C. Can we please have some extra credit? I gave you extra credit last week. You didn't do okay, but, like, I didn't know I was gonna need it then. Hey, teacher, here's my extra credit assignment of tracking our family genealogy back to ancient times for two extra credit points. I hope you enjoy this sick game you're playing. I can't believe school starts at 7:00. Like, is the sun even up? Why do they wanna torture us? Well, I have 5:30 conditioning before school, and then practice from 3 to 6 after school. And then I have to go home and do homework and apply to colleges. When do I sleep? Ha ha.",

Another group test? Can we take it individually? Cause Kevin's missed half the classes, and Rebecca thinks that a stakeholder is a medium rare ribeye. Running for student government president because I've only been here a month, but I'm ready to make some big changes at this school. What does our student government do? Oh, well, last year the vice president embezzled the whole budget for her trip to Cabo, so they could only afford to pass out expired Skittles on exam day. Yes. So it's like an app? And it's like Tinder and Yelp together. So you can leave people reviews after your date with them? Yeah, me and Harold are developing it together. It'll probably be big enough by the time I graduate that I'll be a CEO full time. What are my goals after I graduate? Oh, well, I don't wanna ask for too much, but I would really love healthcare and, like, an office with air conditioning."

You wanna know why? The rest of us have to. All right, it's in. It's foolish to think that you can wait this long between seasons and still hold crowd engagement. It's the same problem Rick and Morty had, alright? When you take too long, you lose your fans. That's the way it works. I get it. Like, strikes. There was covid. Like, there's all these things that happened. But if you're not gonna put the pedal to the metal when you have the opportunity, you're gonna lose the opportunity. So I'm hoping to god that the fifth season is the last one. I might watch it if I'm willing to renew my Netflix subscription to do so, but, yeah, cut the cord. It's done.",

Those are already just RPGs but done as movies might as well just go full out Follow for more heist movies",

Let's start off at the fact that this boy was straight up cheating on her. And then he got the nerve to be mad because she had to make curfew. You're mad because I have to go make curfew. And then he gonna end up dumping her. Like, how do you cheat on me and dump me? And then he invited the girl out. He invited Monica out to go on a date with a girl he was taking out. I could write a whole dissertation on how this movie was not romantic. Phenomenal film. Love it. Will always watch it. But nothing about it was romantic at all. Monica deserve better. That's all I wanna say."

Like, there were multiple times throughout this movie where I was physically like, this shit is putting me to sleep. And the only exciting part. The only exciting part of this movie is the little last five seconds of the movie where the old man is looking at the woman and he's like, your child's name is Damien. That's it. Like, the only exciting part of this movie. And this movie was so fucking boring. You guys? Like, I reviewed it on my YouTube channel, but I hated it. I hated it. Like, this movie was just so terrible. I'm sorry. Definitely the first almond. It was not as bad as Madame Web. Haha. It was not as bad as Madame Web, I will give you guys that. But it was a pretty fucking terrible movie. I would not recommend this. I like the old man. I like the 2,006 version. Like, it was cool. Didn't watch The original, original one.
