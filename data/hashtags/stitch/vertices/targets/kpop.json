    "voice_to_text": "This is honestly unbelievable. So last night the. The Conservative Party here in the UK, Rishi Sunak, they just announced that if they win the general election on July 4th next month, they will be bringing back national mandatory service for when you turn eighteen. This is not a joke, this is 100% serious. So basically now if they do win, going forward, if you're 18 years old, both male and female, you'll have a choice of either doing one year full time in the military or if you don't wanna do that, you will have to volunteer one weekend every month for a year, carrying out a community service. So say goodbye to your weekends because this is mandatory for any of you that. That that think you're just gonna refuse to do this. You will face potentially non criminal sanctions if you do. Oh, and here's the kicker. So this isn't some plan that's like scheduled for 10 years in the future. They say that the first teenagers to take part in this will be in September 2025 next year. So I guess the natural question is why? Well, Rishi says here that it will bring back the national spirit that emerged during the pandemic. And that his two daughters, well, they will too be doing their national services. Well, so yeah, I mean you're probably thinking at this point like, okay, well, fine, no one's gonna vote for him now. But I kind of think it could be the exact Opposite. Like, yeah, young people, they would hate it and that they're not gonna vote. But conservatives are not really after young people's votes. Like, their majority is like 40 to 70+. Like, I don't know, just think about how many people in the older generation look down at Gen Z, Gen Alpha and think, like, you're far too soft nowadays, you know, you need to get off of TikTok. And a good year in the military, that'll really sort you out. So, yeah, I mean, it's hard to believe, but I. I think that this is gonna get more support than you think. But anyway, let me know what you guys think about it. Do you think it's good? Do you think it's bad? Just let those comments rip.",

    "voice_to_text": "I got to a place in my career, we sold out 10,000 people to Jones Beach. I mean it was like the height of everything for me. And it was right around the time I figured out how my live nation contract worked. It was right around the time I figured out how my record deal actually worked. How did that make you feel? It was like panic attacks. It was like oh my gosh, if A plus B equals C, I'm never gonna pay this back. I'mma be on the road 11 months a year just trying to pay back live nation. They're getting everybody coming 12 ways 12 times Tuesday. Are you with live nation? No, I paid myself out of the deal and I had to pay 25% extra on what they advanced me. When you figure that out on the road and you're thinking man, why did we buy 300 rolls of toilet paper? Why do we have to spend this much on catering everyday? Wait a second, what? In my contract it says, cause it's not their money, you gotta spend this much on catering and it comes out of my pocket? Yeah, then I have to pay an advance back. And by the way, the advance that you have to give me is only on hard ticket sales. So the concept called peanuts, parking and alcohol. When I sell out 10,000 people at Jones Beach, the person who buys a twenty dollar hot dog I don't see a dime of that. Person who buys forty dollars for parking, I don't see a dime of that. And the person who buys twenty dollar vodka and Red Bull, I don't see a dime of that. And then you advance me a million dollars and tell me I'm rich. To then find out that you're making four million dollars a night. It takes me 36 shows to pay back one million dollar you advance me. It's a loan. It's a fake loan. It's a fake loan that it's like, we're gonna give you a loan so you can make our money off of your creation. And then it hit me, oh my gosh, they own all the venues. It's a monopoly. So then now they just want my body in this room so they can sell food and alcohol. So then they're gonna make tons of money. And then they got me like schlepping around the United States talking about I wanna be famous. So when you figure that out, Joe Small pays $20 for a hot dog and I don't see that. And if I'm only making my advance back on hard ticket sales, that means I have to sell out every single venue in order to not go in the red. Cause I'm only paying my advance back on hard ticket sales. And by the way, reserve the right in the contract to put the tickets on sale. So when it's $100 a ticket and they do Their summer blowout sale. The tickets are only $10. So instead of me paying back $90 a ticket, right before I go on tour, they drop a John Bellion sale and the tickets are only $10."

He must be hard. Many are saying how her attitude is very selfish and how she doesn't care about her fans who are actually studying, which comes into the next topic. Due to all of the memes made over that post, many decided to bring back her Coachella performance. Her recent Instagram post is being filled of nets, some comments saying how she should be grateful of even being in Luceraphim Boon Che ah what are you gonna do? There's not a single good comment here. So are you still gonna claim it's a forced hate? Please just try out the CSAT.",

But we are not here today because live Nation ticket masters conduct is inconvenient or frustrating. We are here because, as we allege, that conduct is anti competitive and illegal. Our complaint makes clear what happens when a monopolis dedicates its resources to entrenching its monopoly power and insulating itself from competition rather than investing in better products and services. We alleged that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live concert industry in the United States for far too long. It is time to break it up.",

All I saw on that phone was a list of phone numbers. A past online post from 2008, allegedly made by the singer's mom, has resurfaced. The post alleged that Zico was swearing at his girlfriend, calling her a B word and kicked her desk repeatedly. His teacher was witnessed his hot temper. The post also allegedly included a picture of him, his mom and his teacher. Some people have said that they are glad he is finally being exposed and that male idols are not to be trusted.",

And I've been like, oh, should I put a, like, hollow sleeve in there? Do you put a photo card in there? What do you do? Right? And it just occurred to me just now that I could cut that out. I could cut that spot out of the page, and then it wouldn't be there. It just be a hole. Would it look better as a hole? I don't know. Let's find out. I'm getting Scissors. I thought at first, exact knife, but I feel like this would be more precise. Like, you just snip a hole in the middle and then cut around it. Gem is my assistant, so I'm not gonna be an insane person. I'm gonna take out the cards first. Okay, here's the result. Let's put the cards in. Okay. Why do I think it looks kind of good? Obviously, you have to be careful. Okay. That looks kind of goofy as shit. You know, you just gotta be sure not to clip any of the, like, seam. I don't think it's terrible. It's probably one of my better diys. It's not the stupidest thing I've done today, but I kind of, like, there's just nothing there. Like, there's nothing meant to be there. So they just be a little black, almost like a black filler. Right? There. So weird to have like 60 pages with a hole in the center. I probably won't do this on my pages just because as much as I love Meow Cafe, these still aren't the pages for me. You know, I've said before, like, I want, um, a pocket that will fit a no sleeve photo card perfectly. And these just kind of like, are sliding all over the place because of the extra room. So do I wanna go through all the effort to trim like 60 pages of a middle hole? Probably not, but you never know what I'll get up to. But you know what else could be cute is say you got this hole here, right? And you've got a wider black binder. Sure. You could put a different sticker there, like each week so there's like a different filler and it'd be on every page cause there's a hole in every page. It's late. I'm getting up to some weird diys",

    "voice_to_text": "remember the Burning Sun scandal where multiple kpop idols were involved in the \ud83c\udf47ing and \ud83d\udea6ing of young women through a nightclub that one of them owned in Seoul South Korea well BBC just dropped a documentary about it with new details and footage that has never been seen before whether you've seen it or not let's talk about it so if you know anything about Kpop you know that before BTS there was a group called Big Bang and the youngest member of the group was a guy named Seungri who was only 15 when they debuted well Seungri became known for his partying lifestyle and he loved the partying lavish lifestyle so much that he even became to be known as Seungtsby known after The Great Gatsby he opened up a club in the most affluent district of Seoul South Korea known as Gangnam at the Le Meridian Hotel known as the Burning Sun and Seungri and a couple of his other kpop idol friends including Choi Jong-hoon who was the lead guitarist of the Korean rock band known as FT Island Jung Joon-young who was a very popular singer at the time amongst a couple of other kpop idols but these three were the most active and they would send each other videos to a group chat of themselves taking advantage of women for instance in this video before he says hey friend he had just \ud83e\udef4 a woman who clearly did not want that to happen those videos of themselves taking advantage of and forcing themselves onto women were \ud83e\udee3\ud83c\udfa5 videos which means that they were completely \ud83d\udeab legal and they would laugh about it and I mean they would laugh about some of the most despicable things that I've ever read yep and at Seungri\u2019s club the Burning Sun which at the time was the largest and most hyped up club in all of Seoul South Korea and because it was so hot at the time they were able to sell VIP tables for upwards of $75,000 a table some nights and because they paid such a disgusting number for just a table at a club these men would think that they deserve something more for paying $75,000 a table and because the club was owned by Seungri who himself was using the club to \ud83c\udf47 women they set aside an area that was further down below than the rest of the club that was built specifically for the use of the Super VIP customer and if one of the VIPs fancied one of the women that were at the club that night it would be the responsibility of the employees of Burning Sun to get that woman for the VIP no matter what it took and this is an actual text exchange between some of the workers that worked there to help find a woman and often times they would use sub stances to incapacitate these women for instance a young woman who frequented the Burning Sun decided to get a VIP table with all of her girlfriends one night and after only one or two drinks she started to feel really \ud83e\udd74 and in fact the last thing she remembers is telling one of her girlfriends I think I need to stop drinking because I'm feeling way too \ud83e\udd74 only after one or two drinks and the next thing she knows she wakes up without clothes in a hotel room with a guy that she doesn't know afterwards in order to be able to go home safely even after she told the man \u201cplease\u201d \u201cI just wanna go home because I miss my mother\u201d he forced her to take a selfie with her where she's forced to smile and put up a peace sign so that afterwards he could say that it was all consensual a female patron of the Burning Sun was\u00a0even\u00a0secretly\u00a0recorded\u00a0while\u00a0being\u00a0essayed\u00a0inside\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0red\u00a0bathroom and went viral after it was uploaded online Jung Joon-young and Choi Jong-hoon even\u00a0gng\u00a0\ud83c\udf47\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0Jung\u00a0Joon-young's\u00a0fans\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0club\u00a0with\u00a0multiple\u00a0other\u00a0men and secretly \ud83c\udfa5 it and they quite literally thought that they were above the law and\u00a0they\u00a0essentially\u00a0[were] because they had a really high ranking man in the police department in their pocket who ended up being so high ranking that he worked directly for the president of Korea his identity was only revealed because K pop idol Hara knew Choi Jong-hoon from their training days before they debuted used her connection to urge Choi Jong-hoon to give her the identity of that police officer that she then gave over to the reporter who then shortly after outing this high ranking police officer allegedly took her own lyf even before this scandal broke Seungri who was under the YG label starred in this documentary for Netflix called YG's Future Strategy Office where they pretended like all of the misfits from the YG label were being sent to this office and in that documentary every single member of Blackpink talked about how uncomfortable Seungri made them feel and Jennie from Blackpink at one point on stage in front of a live audience even said to Seungri hey I heard you say that I touched your shoulder at the background but I never did that Jung Joon-young was only sentenced to 6 years in prison after being convicted of essay as well as secretly \ud83c\udfa5 women and then had his sentence reduced to 5 years because he wrote a letter about how sorry he was Choi Jong-hoon was only sentenced to 5 years in prison after being convicted of 2 separate instances of gng essay and then had a sentence reduced to 2yrs and 6 months because he reached his settlement with his victims Seungri was only sentenced to 3 years in prison for 9 different charges but was released only after 18 months is currently now a free man and was even seen doing appearances in Malaysia as recently as January of this year and even with the closing of the Burning Sun close to 5 years ago the nightclubs in South Korea are still actively participating in the \ud83d\udea6ing of young women with the system that shows that they clearly don't care about the well being and safety of Korean women it's no wonder that Korean women are fighting the ptrchry  and refusing to mate with Korean men",

So today is gonna be the sale if you are from America, specifically Los Angeles. I am gonna be talking about my time zone. It says that it releases for the pre order on May 21st at 11 a m. That is May 20th at 7 p m. So I'm gonna post this video, and it's probably gonna be in about an hour. That is gonna be released. Now, if you're ordering from us, once you hit 7:00, you are gonna be able to pre order the poster set or you can pre order the D day, like, original DVD thing. Now, if you're doing Weaver Shop Global, it is gonna be all three options. So you have the poster set with the DVD, you have the DV itself, and then you have the poster set. To be clear that it's not a DVD, it is a QR code. So it's a digital thing. And when you order from global, you actually get, um, separate pre order benefits depending on which one you buy. US doesn't have that option. So yes, 7:00 today. Rooting for you, bestie.",

And guess what? There were people putting price tags on all the lumber. Now imagine the power of what you guys just did in a few hours. Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

In true Australian fashion, he loves a good ham and cheese toastie with a barbecue sauce. The real question for y'all though is if part of your cheese starts molding, do you throw it out or do you just cut off the mold and continue to eat it? Sorry to all the Australians because they made the most pathetic little cheese toastie with the last bits of bread I had. However, it was incredibly delicious and I definitely make it again. Jake says the sign of a true cheese toastie is that it's squish, and that made mine very crispy. Like listen to that crunch for lunch. One of you actually suggested chapagetti with spam for Jake's Day. I've never made this combination before, but it was delicious. Chapagetti is an S tier instant noodle in my book. Always. And I added some spinach for a healthy colon. And lastly, Jake's favorite Korean dish is kimchi, so I made that for dinner. However, I realized I was out of tofu at the very last second, so I tried substituting that protein with eggs, which was weird but good. I'm so sorry Jake for these janky meals. I obviously flopped my grocery run. Either way, this was delicious and I still thoroughly enjoyed these. And let me know which member I should eat Like next"

That is the night that this screenshot was taken from. He says after his New York concert with 21 Savage, Christopher was called to meet Drake at the Mark Hotel. They had a blast listening to new beats and he confirms he was not violated in any way. He also talks about the rumor that a hotel security guard was fired for letting him wait inside of the hotel. He believes that this rumor is true and he feels bad. He also apologizes to the guard and his family. He addresses the rumor that he accepted hush money from Drake and the backlash that he follows underage high school girls on Instagram. says he doesn't know anything about the Drake and Kendrick beef. He's a hard working journalist and doesn't have rappers on Speed Dialtsby the mole or the snitch in the forward of the Article. They say that Christopher has been advised to unfollow all minors on Instagram. So there you have it. Christopher says nothing bad happened with Drake.",

    "voice_to_text": "like I'll give an example my two main boy group biases Jimin from BTS and WooYoung from ateez the whole reason why I started biasing them um over my original biases in both of those groups  solely because of their style and I know that seems really superficial but it's a lot deeper than that right um I bias them now more you know personality their abilities performers um stage presence you know humor like all that stuff I just love them but when it comes down to it the reason why they're my biases is because of their style and\u00a0because\u00a0I\u00a0liked\u00a0their\u00a0style\u00a0so\u00a0much I was like I kind of wanna change up my style and dress up a little bit more like them and I'm gonna be real changing my style solely because of these two men and it is it's solely because these two men it's not for any other reason it's I saw the way that they dressed in certain music videos or certain performances or certain certain just outings and I was just like I'm\u00a0jealous I'm\u00a0jealous\u00a0of\u00a0how\u00a0they\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0themselves I'm jealous how they can sometimes dress a little bit more feminine and not feel weird about it right like I was someone who like always\u00a0chased\u00a0onto\u00a0masculinity\u00a0right I always like I had to be the most masculine because I'm a short guy right a lot of short guys have this masculinity problem where they have to over masculinize themselves and they're scared of being at all the slightest hint of like being considered feminine cause you're already short these two men changed my life these two men changed my life just by trying to emulate some of their outfits and then getting a little bit more adventurous with my style stepping outside of my like my comfort zone and dressing in ways that I truly feel like embody me I now dress in ways where I truly feel like this is me this is not somebody that I'm trying to be this is me and it is done wonders for my confidence it is done wonders for uh my relationships it is done wonders for everything I do not feel like that I'm putting on an act anymore and it's solely thanks to these two men I love these two men um let me give you an example I\u00a0saw\u00a0wooyoung\u00a0wearing\u00a0like\u00a0stuff\u00a0like\u00a0this\u00a0and\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0like let me buy some fuzzy jackets let me buy some fuzzy jackets let me look at this look at this one it's bright blue it's baby blue fuzzy jacket like\u00a0I\u00a0would\u00a0never\u00a0have\u00a0even\u00a0questioned I would never have even thought about dressing like something like this before I\u00a0found\u00a0wooyoung here's one of my favorite Jimin outfits um it's just a kimono robe with you know white pants white shirt brown belt it's very simple but kimono robe pulls it all together and here is like my outfit that I made for uh the PTD Las Vegas and it's the same thing white white right I emulated him and before like finding Jimin I never never would have worn something like that in my life and there is this thing that you ask like a lot of guys um who don't put effort into the way that they dress which is I didn't put effort into the way that I dress before um is like do you remember the last time someone gave you a compliment on your outfit and they could be like yeah it was uh two years ago at this grocery store the person said I liked they liked my shirt so I bought 17 versions of that exact same shirt and they can tell you the exact same moment and now it's like ever since I found my actual style and not trying to to be somebody I wasn't I get compliments all time and this isn't like a flex that I get compliments all time it's just like when you dress like you when you dress like who you are people\u00a0can people can sense that people vibe with it people love it they're like wow this is different this is them this is I love it I love seeing it and without those two I never would be the person that I am today I would never be the confidence I am today I would never have this TikTok account probably because I wouldn't have the confidence to be posting like this without those two people so yeah those are those are my uh that's my reason on why I have uh those two biases so like do you what's yours and um if you wanna help out a family in need uh there's a gofundme in my bio you should check it out thanks",

    "voice_to_text": "so it hasn't been formally announced but there\u2019s suspicion that Stray Kids are gonna be on Jimmy Fallon next week so Jimmy recently put out this Instagram story where he was supporting the lose my breath collaboration with Charlie Puth and on his Instagram account it looks like he's now following Stray Kids and Charlie Puth probably not a coincidence but Michael Phelps and Laufey were just on his show this week so the reason I'm bringing this up is because on TikTok you might have seen there's currently this block party going on I've seen people mention that people should go to Jimmy Fallon's page and block everybody that he follows and then blocking him at the end so now of course Stray Kids is now associated with Jimmy Fallon and all of these things I'm sure the boys are super excited to be on you know Jimmy Fallon this will be their first time but I really wish it wasn't under these circumstances again nothing has been formally announced but it's just not a coincidence Jimmy Fallon doesn't do things by coincidence they must be performing or being on the show In the past, Stray Kids they just kind of come in and come out like they don't stay around unless they\u2019re doing something or waiting for something to promote so the fact that they're still in the States this long probably means they'll be on the show and they'll be on the show with Charlie Puth I guess we'll just have to see what happens",

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

We are giving stray kids the benefit of the doubt because we don't know what their contractually obligated to do or say right now. We don't know how long this has been in the works and how long ago that contract was signed. The benefit is very small, I will admit, but it's there. But I saw a distribution post like the line distribution. 66% of that song is Charlie Puth. 66%. And based on, um, what I've heard from people that have listened to it with alternative methods, the song is made at best because Stray Kids really weren't involved with it. They have credits on it, but it's the bare minimum credit.",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys. If you'd like to support this work please text DONATE to 43438"

So thank you to Tommy for inviting us, all eight of us. What was it like dressed, getting dressed by Tommy Hilfiger? Um, we had a lot of fitting sessions, but, um, they all went really smoothly, and I personally really, really like everyone's fit. So, yes, I'm seeing lots of, like, sexy men around here. But you're the Queen. Always. And Tommy. Tommy, your Spring 2024 campaign revisited your iconic style of modern prep. What was it about working with stray kids that inspired you? They are as modern as you can get. They are modern prep, and they're global superstars. They are a K pop band from Korea, and they're embarking upon a 40 city tour, and they pack stadiums with 80,000 people. Oh, wow. And they have a wild fan base all over the world. Yeah, just a little bit popular. What are you most looking forward to when you go inside? Tommy, because this is not your first met, what is it that still excites you about coming to the met each year? Well, this is the event of the year, and it's full of energy. Um, we love seeing what people are wearing because this is the one chance people get to really sort of wear whatever they want. True. As long As it's within keeping of the theme. Yes. We wanna make sure that Anna also approves. Absolutely, yes. It was so lovely to see all of you meet. You all have so much fun inside. Have a wonderful evening. Thank you.",

But then it's kind of awkward to if you start recording them secretly because then they're gonna end up finding out and they're gonna be like, why the is fucking recording me? But then also I kind of wanna record because I wanna show my friends and I wanna have evidence backing up my claims saying that I saw in hyphen shopping at the same store I was.

Anyways, back to the original reason why I was making this video. New tour said by Joshua Hong himself. Uh huh. I was gonna stitch my previous prediction video on here, but it wasn't recording my audio, so we're gonna stick with a new post. But I do have some new predictions based off this information and also based on the fact that they basically confirmed Carrot Land. Um, in July I think DK accidentally said on live and then they all confirmed basically like a new album, another album the second half of the year. So based off that and this, based off like the formula that 17 and I guess K pop in general has, you know, set out, they're gonna do Caroline in July, and then probably at Caroline, or like a little after, they're gonna announce the second album of the year. Another album, come back in August, they're probably gonna announce world tour. Just saying. That makes me so nervous. Oh my goodness. Ticket sales, all that will happen probably within like, knowing them in like a week. And then I feel like the actual comeback will be in October. Based off You know the formula they got going on? Um, because that'll be like, six months from now, and then tour will happen in, like, November, December. That is my new prediction for the rest of the year.",

    "voice_to_text": "so last night it was announced that Nature has disbanded now none of us are shocked by this we've known this for a while especially with how inactive they've been and the girls haven't necessarily been quiet about it but it still sucks so much a lot of us thought they were disbanded quietly probably months ago I have been with nature since shortly after their debut I was there for Loha's introduction Gaga's leave Sohees introduction  oh and the some&love leak can anybody remember that they uploaded it like a day early unlisted there's that signed album and this one they were the first group I ever had a fan call with and that album is signed to my whole name which is why I don't have it on display but they were an amazing first fan call they were all so great to talk to I get to talk to Chaebin Sohee Lu Haru Sunshine and Uchae you know because the group was never without multiple hiatus highlights being Haru recreating all of her favorite photocard poses for me of the cards that I had having a great conversation with Sunshine because she was fairly fluent in English and talking about her favorite promotional times speaking of I'm hoping now we actually get an update of how Sunshine and Lu even are it's been way too long they've always been such an important group to me and if they ever do anything in the future I will be there waiting for them but a quick look at their photo cards I collected as much Haru as I could multiple of them are signed I'm still missing a few over cards though cause nature cards have never been easy to come by more here two more the rest of the members all the way back to the debut era when they use name tags on these cards lu's orange hair and all of these fan meet cards so the last ones they did with all of the members we will miss you nature and I think girls and limbo will always live on",

And then after googling it, apparently it only seats 650 people, and it's in a high. In a high school, I think. What in the world? I mean, I don't know how popular this group is, and they. But they have no LA date, so I'm thinking this will sell out. I don't know. Can someone some. Can more K pop groups come to San Diego? Please?",

This trend might be due to their global appeal or the rhythmic charm that English phrases add. Have you ever come across a song with slightly awkward English lyrics that initially made you go \u201cohh?\u201d but then you found yourself loving it anyway? It's like the catchiness of the tune outweighs any linguistic quirks, and you can't resist hitting replay and singing along, awkward lyrics and all! \ud83d\ude06\ud83c\udfb6 In this interview, I asked K-Pop fans about these songs\u2014those with awkward English lyrics that are still absolute bops. Some fans even say that the more awkward the English, the more of a bop the song becomes! \ud83e\udd29 What are your thoughts on the songs discussed in the video?

Well, the first day, because after dinner, we went to her car and thinking, okay, I gotta go. And I went for the kiss and kind of fumbled it, and I asked for a do over, and she said yes. And it was much better, as it was exactly what I was planning. I knew I know how to do this. This was the rest of my life. Yeah. You know, counted on this one little moment, and it worked, you know, and we've been together ever since. That. That fateful afternoon, time disappeared. It was just her and I. The night we got married, we went to this little restaurant. I, you know, got down on one knee and did the whole nine yards. But what had happened is the kitchen, just before this, had a revolt and walked. They went on strike when you propose. They walked out of the kitchen. On my knee? Yeah. And all of a sudden, the lights go out, and, you know, it's just a little candlelight on everybody's table, like, I did this. And so I did propose. She did accept. You just feel everything is right in the world. As long as this is together, as long as this is happening, you can do anything. What's your name? Monterey Morrissey Hunter.",

    "voice_to_text": "Why your birth order actually really matters. So the following is part 3 of a four part series determining which is the superior sibling. Okay, I have to start out with this one because statistically, the youngest child is the most likely to turn out gay. Over 20 years ago, these two researchers demonstrated that the probability of a boy growing up to be gay increases for each older brother born by the same mother. The startling phenomena was then confirmed in multiple studies based on independent populations totalling over 10,000 subjects. And meta analysis indicated that between 15% and 29% of gay men owe their sexual orientation to this effect. Okay then. But apart from being gay, according to psychologist Doctor Frank Soloway's research, lostborns generally aren't the strongest or the smartest in the room. So they develop their own ways of winning attention. Their natural charms with an outgoing and social personality. No surprise then that many famous actors and comedians are babies of the family. Youngest children do, however, tend to have the lowest IQs, as a 2,007 study show that the more older siblings one has, the lower ones IQ is. And I, um, youngest of 10. Not ideal. Youngest children generally also receive the least discipline and get away with a lot more, leading them to engage in risk your behavior and go into higher risk, more creative careers. Also, just a warning. But according to psychologist Kevin Lehman in his book couples consisting of Two last borns are also the most likely to get into death. And the series finale comes tomorrow. And we're looking at you, only children."

Blood, Sweat and tears is obviously there, but. Dude, I'm gonna say Pied Piper. I think Pied Piper is one of the best songs ever. If I could count solo songs, which I don't know if I'm allowed to, I'm gonna say euphoria, because euphoria by Jungkook is. Is a top 5 song ever. Just like not even K pop is ever. My favorite Black Pink song. It's close, you know? Forever Youngs there, but Maji Maktodom, dude, as if it's your last. That's number one for me. Best twice song ever. This one gets harder. I think it's been likey for a long time, but when I heard dance the night away in person, like, when I went to their concert, that shit changed me. Yeah, I don't know. I think. I think it's still likey, but dance the night away is right there. My favorite EXO song. Hasn't changed since the day I got into them, and the first song I heard from them was monster. So, yeah, it's been monster ever since. And then again, if I could do solo songs, Rover by Chi is. Yeah, it's different. Tell me, for these four groups, though, BTS, Blackpink, twice, EXO, what are your favorite songs for me to them? Okay, okay."

Nobody knows how to break music right now. Each person I talk to in the industry is more depressed about this than the person I talked to before them. I'm gonna be real here. I think we're at a point where a lot of these big, mainstream, popular artists aren't connecting with any sort of fan base or audience. A lot of their songs aren't written by themselves. They're written by other people and then just performed by these singers. Whatever. I think people miss that authenticity that came with the singer songwriter persona. Sort of like Taylor Swift, she writes her own songs there about her own personal experiences, so people really connect to that. I feel like with all this ghost riding and this industry plant sort of stuff, a lot of times people just don't feel connected to it, they don't feel inspired by it, and they want something real. Nobody wants to listen to something that just feels like a product that was just created for them to buy. It's just no fun."
