    "voice_to_text": "If you can take the time out to put your signature on a missile, to write little messages, little cute messages on missiles, then that's a clear sign that you're not under any threat. Because if you needed to use them bitches, you would be using them bitches. And I think anybody that signed one of those missiles, whether they were 7 or 70, should be charged with international hate crime and publicly executed. Because there's no greater sign that you're not under any dress, that you have time to sign the missiles, that means you're completely on the offense. These people are fucking sick, bro. We know the majority of people being killed here are children, and you're signing missiles. Putting heart sign is just like bread. These are real demons. Not to mention. Not to mention billions, billions of US tax dollars that's going to that. Y'all just pulling up. You know, the thing is, is that I haven't really posted much about this stuff because protesting awareness is not enough. Whenever people, whenever y'all are ready to completely disengage from this system, then I'm with it. Cause protest. Like, bro, we've been. People been protesting since October, and they ain't stop shit. They stop sending our fucking tax money over there. They ain't stopped shit. We've been boycotting shit, they ain't stopped shit. They still signing missiles. The only thing that can happen. Like, bro, first of all, this life is not permanent. This life ain't permanent. What you got to lose? What? Like, what are we. We're holding on to comfort. And it's like, if you care that much about people dying, and you know that, you're actively, you're a participant, too. I'm a participant as well. I go to work every day. My fucking tax dollars paid for some of those missiles that got signed. That just is what it is. Um, but until they're not gonna. We're not gonna engage in a violent rebellion, because most people don't have a capacity for violence, which is why this is so outrageous. But also, people don't wanna give up their comfort. So, I mean, yeah, you can protest and bring awareness to it, but that ain't stop the bombs from dropping. And nobody. Y'all just ain't ready to disengage from the system completely. You don't want to see this shit collapse. Let's just be real, cause it don't. Like, does it stop with Palestinians? Does it stop in the Congo? Does it stop in Sudan in about 10 years? What's your job gonna be worth? Are you. Are you. Is your job gonna be valuable to society? Or will you be better fit to be doing prison labor? It's a question you need to ask yourself. And pay attention what's going on and tell me it's not a possibility you might lose your job, lose your fucking house. Lose your job to AI, lose your job to a robot. Lose your fucking home? Can't pay your Bills illegal to be homeless now you're a prison laborer doing the jobs they don't wanna pay for. Honestly, man, you might just keep buying the Pop Tarts."

We have been, I think, very strident in our condemnations about the deaths of innocent civilians. These deaths are not excused from that. But we have to understand what happened here. What is the administration going to do? Whether it was a tragic mistake or deliberate. Well, let's see what the investigation says. So you're gonna wait for the Israelis to investigate? Let's see what the investigation comes up with. If we had done this, I think we would want the benefit of having the opportunity to investigate it and to figure out what happened.

    "voice_to_text": "Why would white feminists who oppose patriarchy support the most significant patriarchal system ever created: Islam? Why would they cancel and silence Middle Eastern feminists? invalidating their experiences and suffering calling them Islamophobic Why would LGBT activists support the most homophobic patriarchy and march alongside anti Semites? I believe most people watching this agree that societies only evolve with constant self challenge We question our ideas and concepts and apply critical thinking to evolve our consciousness. Without this, we stagnate individually and culturally. But why would someone who considers themselves progressive and open minded claim progress for themselves and deny it to others based on race and culture? and a good example would be: It's okay to criticise the Catholic Church but criticising Islam is Islamophobic. This behaviour exemplifies white supremacy and racism. For absolutely irrational reasons many feminists or intellectual progressives refuse to let culturally stagnating societies evolve out of their archive concepts and refuse to recognise the injustice and brutality of theocratic societies even if it means ignoring misogyny and homophobia. This is a problem because culture matters and you can judge a culture's quality by how it treats women, children and animals. So why aren't these feminists and intellectuals making sense? Because people become irrational when driven by fear and lack of identity. These individuals are preoccupied with their white guilt and shame. To free themselves they recreate themselves as part of something bigger, righteous, intellectually and morally superior etc. Heinz Kundani called it moral narcissism, however, moral narcissism is limited individually. This pathology is rooted in tribalism and is part of a larger picture. It's collective narcissism, connecting all victims. Their simplistic worldview which divides humanity into oppressed oppressors is the hellmark of narcissistic pathology called splitting. It helps them cope with their difficulty tolerating their ambiguity and contradictions inherent in humans: It\u2019s an all or nothing perspective and precisely what Obi-Wan Kenobi was talking about when he said \u201conly a Sith deals in absolutes\u201c They simulate empathy but it's synthetic fundamentally inverted and attached to grandusity, entitlement, and self righteousness, fitting the DSM-5 definition of narcissism to the T. Self-victimization is a crucial part of the narcissistic shame compensation mechanism. By positioning themselves as perpetual victims of societal structures or historical injustices, they deflect responsibility for reality. This self-victimization protects their ego from confronting their privilege and allows them to adapt a moral high ground without genuine self reflection or change. And their proclaimed social justice narrative is a veneer for deeper insecurities and unresolved issues. They believe they uniquely understand and can solve the world's problems. In reality they reinforce the very power structures they claim to oppose. This toxic cycle of guilt, victimization and grandulity\u2026 of course, inhibits genuine empathy and critical thinking, keeping them and the groups they claim to support had locked in Arrested Development. So, what is the role of our institutions in all this madness? It's a toxic dance of the narcissist and the co-dependent: the abuser and the enabler. Our governments and institutions are co-dependent, and the Woke, BDS, DEI, etc. far-left, are the self-victimizing narcissists. It's a poisonous trade where everyone, except the narcissist, loses unless we set boundaries for the raging goblin that is tirelessly rolling on the supermarket floor.",

We've talked about what could potentially happen here for a lot of years, but it looks like some critical stuff going down. If you don't know, we have an incident just took place outside of Fort Liberty, former Fort Bragg, in North Carolina. We have two illegal migrants that were spying on Special Forces colonel, snapping photos of his family and his kids. And he caught them. It was competition. He shot and killed one of them. This is a big deal, because other colonels, other people are going on, like Fox News, and they're saying that this is a huge threat. They're in here, they're spying on our top level generals at their homes here in this country, and now they've been engaged. They go on to say that here in this country, these illegal migrants are showing up and our military facilities two to three times a week. A week? That brazen, whoever was just ignoring it, right? Two or three times a week, they're showing up at our military bases, and they're getting turned away. Now, the ones that are showing up at the basis are showing up acting like they're trying to document for some kind of. Whatever excuse they give. They do have passports, the ones that show up there, and they seem to be the forward unit of this invasion of Course, we know there's millions in here at this point. They are also state that they are rolling up on our basis with drones, two to three times a week. Incursions. So our bases are getting infiltrated by drones and these dudes rolling up on them in packs. And they're rolling up on our kernels at their homes, spying on them. Hello? How much more are. Are people waiting for? What are you waiting for? Them to show up at your house taking pictures like, dude, you better get ready. You better get it already locked and loaded. Everything that you got. You better get with your neighbors. You better get plans together. They're here. Enemies here. Cause you've been sold out. They brought them here. So you better get the training. Better be taking your extra time, your extra money. You better get ready. This ain't no joke. They're here just like they rode in the Trojan horse and at night they sprung. It's like they're waiting for their moment. And once it begins, there ain't no going back. This country will never be the same. You better get ready. I'm warning you. I'm warning you, I'm warning you. I'm warning you. It's that time. So y'all better be prepping full scale. Better be training. You better be training. You better be getting with your people. You better be doing everything it takes right now, while you got the time. Before time's up, we got a big event coming. And as soon as a series of events goes into motion, it's like Domino's, one after another, and it won't stop. So a heads up here, I'm gonna leave some links below. Make sure to check out the video clip on my Twitter as well. You can hear from the colonel's mouth talking with an admiral on their Navy. Admiral talking about what's going on.",

And there is a video of a man who holds up a burnt Palestinian baby, and the baby's head is completely decapitated. And the videos are just of burnt people. That video was the very first video I woke up to this morning, and I had to cover my mouth to stop myself from screaming and sobbing. This is a sickness that we are watching.

Wait, you mean they bombed Rafa after Hamas was using Rafa to fire rockets at TEL Aviv? Israel has the Iron Dome. It's not the same thing. It absolutely is the same thing. Just because Israel actually cares about their people and invest in infrastructure to keep them safe does not mean that they just have to suffer abuse from the hands of a terrorist organization. Hamas clearly doesn't care about their people and that's why they jeopardize them by shooting rockets from Safezone so that they could create the perfect PR situation. Israel shouldn't be in Rafa to begin with. Yeah, you know what else shouldn't be in Rafa? Members of Hamas terrorist tunnels. 200 to be exact. Hidden hostages. Hostages, bodies, weapons, rockets flying at Israel. There's a lot of things that shouldn't be in Rafa. Rafa is supposed to be a safe zone. It doesn't matter what happens there. Nope. Under international law it actually loses protected status once it starts to be used for military operations. Which is exactly what happened today. A safe zone does not mean safe from the consequences of your own action."

He chronicled his experiences in his book, Almost Black the True Story of how I got into Medical School by pretending to be black. DJ Joko Choco Ingham joins me now. So you were studying statistics at the university of Chicago, and you say to yourself, I don't stand a chance with my 3.1. What did you do? Well, I shaved my head, I trimmed my eyelashes, and I decided to join the organization of black students so I can apply to medical school as a black man. I also used my middle name, JoJo. I subsequently interviewed at medical schools across the country and, uh, managed to get waitlisted at Washington University and the university of Pennsylvania, then ranked the second and the third and fourth best medical schools in the country and got into, uh, ST. Louis university, uh, school of medicine, despite the fact that my pretty pitiful 3.1 GPA was dramatically lower than their average of, uh, three, uh, 3.7. Now, I want you to process what you just heard. This man basically just said, yeah, I knew my GPA was terrible for what I wanted to do, so what I basically did is I went and pretended I was black, because I know they lower the standards for black people, and I got in somewhere. He was like, this 3.1 GPA is not Gonna cut it for my race, but if I act like a different race, I can have a lower GPA and still get in. Again, this is quite literally them lowering the standard for black people. And what that does is it puts into question if that black person is actually qualified. If you're lowering the standard for black people to get into the school, why aren't you lowering the standard for them to pass classes in the school? Why not have all the test scores similar for the people that get into the school? I think too many schools are now looking to have a diverse skin color within their universities rather than having the best students in their universities. In my opinion, it should be the best students in the universities, not so much focus on their skin color. if you get to the point where you've got a plethora of options and so many, uh, test scores are very similar, then I can maybe see, you know, maybe looking at some diversity at that point. Maybe, but having lower scores for certain races of people, to me, is, uh, discriminatory, and it's playing favorites. And again, it puts in the question the legitimacy of those black students who were going to those universities.",

See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome."

    "voice_to_text": "Europe is divided over whether or not to arrest Natanyahu should the ICC issue an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister. The different positions can be broadly divided into three main groups. The first group has spoken out against the ICC, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the UK, meaning they are unlikely to arrest him. On the flip side, a second group of European countries has backed the ICC, saying they would arrest Natanya who should he visit, including Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and Norway. And the third group consists of countries who are on the fence about the whole thing. These countries, namely France and Germany, are strong allies of Israel and have criticized the ICT for allegedly equating them with Hamas. Despite this, they have said that they respect the independence of the court and would in fact arrest Matanyahu should he visit. Overall, the ICT arrest warrants are forcing European nations to make a decision respect the ICC decision and international law even when it goes against them, or back their longtime ally Israel, thereby further exposing western double standards and weakening their international legal system.",

    "voice_to_text": "Five things you need to know about the arrest warrants being pursued for the leaders of Hamas and Israel. One. The ICC International Criminal Court is governed by the Rome Statute, which is made up of 124 member states from all around the world. Notably absent from that membership list is Israel, the United States, and quite a few other major nations. On that list is Palestine, having a ceded in 2,015, which means that any crimes committed in Gaza do fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. 2. The ICC International Criminal Court is different from the ICC, The International Court of justice. The ICC is designed to prosecute individuals accused of committing international crimes, like we see here, whereas the ICC, the International Court of justice, is designed to resolve disputes between nations. That is where South Africa has brought the genocide case against the state of Israel. 3. This next step could take weeks or even months. What happens now is that three judges inside of the ICC review the available evidence and if it's sufficient, will move forward and issue the arrest warrants for the leaders of Hamas and Israel. Which leads into point number four. The ICC does not have the capability to conduct arrests for anyone to be brought to justice under this system. The ICC requires that any of their 124 member states conduct that arrest, detain the individual, and move them to the HAG to face prosecution. And 5 we should expect Israel to Push back as to whether or not the ICC has jurisdiction here at all. Likely what they'll argue has to do with the primacy of domestic jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court is designed to be a court of last resort, not first resort. What that means is if these cases could be heard at the local, state, or national level, they should be before being brought to the ICC. That is probably an argument that Israel make in the coming days or weeks.",

If there's something in my videos that you feel is no longer benefiting you, if you feel like you don't enjoy them anymore, you're not learning anymore. Whatever the case may be, by all means, please unfollow. I will unfollow people like that. As soon as they start disrupting my peace, I'm leaving. Cause a girly will protect her peace and I so highly recommend that you do the same. So if I'm disrupting your peace, by all means feel free to unfollow. And I'm sorry that it came to that. If there's something that you don't like in my videos or the way I'm going about things you think is wrong, by all means reach out. I love talking to you guys. I Learned so, so much from my followers. Genuinely, you guys are some of the smartest people I've ever met. But at the end of the day, if you think that leaving a comment saying well, you're not doing things my way, so you lost my support is going to change anything, it's not. Respectfully, I don't need your support. I appreciate it. Genuinely and whole heartedly, I love you guys so much, but I'm not going to change the way I do things just to accommodate you. And to think that I should is narcissism. You are more than welcome to go advocate for Whatever cause you have and whatever way that pleases you, you're more than welcome to have an open dialogue with me about the way that I do things. But you're not going to do this. On top of the fact, I'd also like to point out, if somebody says something wrong very publicly, then I'm going to very publicly correct them. And I expect people to do the same to me. Because when you publicly spread misinformation and then only correct it privately, you are letting that misinformation spread and grow. And I will not be accommodating Hamas misinformation campaign against innocent Israelis. So Miss Rachel felt comfortable saying what she had to say publicly. I feel comfortable calling her out publicly, and that's just what it's gonna be."

Now, for World Biodiversity Day Today, I had plans to show you a video of my three year old walking through our land on the mountain. But I've decided instead to show you something that I think is really important. So if you wanna see my three year old, go to the Handmade Palace sign Instagram page, and you'll see her there and the land. I'm up on our roof, okay? We have a rooftop garden, which means our roof looks a bit different than other people's because I'm gonna hang my laundry up here. What I wanna show you are these guys. These are water tanks, okay? Every Palestinian house has water tanks on their roofs. Let me show you the neighborhood. Okay. See that? That's how you can tell the difference between an Israeli settlement and Palestinian houses. Because we have water tanks. Why do we have water tanks? Well, that's because our water is stolen. The Israelis built settlements on top of our two main aquifers in the West Bank, and they've destroyed most of our artisan wells. Moreover, it is illegal for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to harvest rainwater because the state of Israel says we are in charge. We control everything. And rainwater is the property of the state of Israel. So our water comes from Baladiyat, Ramallah. The municipality Of Ramallah. And it comes once a week. So true story, this. Yesterday I was showering, and the hot water starts getting really, like, thin, I don't know, and just not a lot coming out. So I'm like, okay, really fast. Armpits, vagina, butt. Okay. And then by the time I had soap on myself, it was gone. So I was like, cold water. I'll have a cold shower. So I turn it all the way over to cold, and I'm, like, trying to rinse it off. And I get myself kind of cleaned off, but not really enough. And I'm like, let me just get my face. I get my face, and by then it's totally dry. So I get out of the shower soaking, dripping wet, and I go to the sink thinking, there's gotta be a little bit of water left in the pipe. And I'm, like, washing my face off, and there's soap in my eyes, and I barely got it and pretty much had to use a towel to get the soap off. Now, obviously, the situation Gaza is 100 times worth, because worse, because the Israelis deny them clean drinking water or any kind of water. It's just, like, incredibly inhumane. But what I wanna say to you is that beyond the seas. Fire! We still have to acknowledge that there is incredible injustice that is 76 years long here in occupied Palestine. Because we are a colonized land and a colonized people. And One of the things that is most basic as a human right is water. And our water is colonized. So happy world. Uh, I don't know. Biodiversity, Environmental Day, whatever it is, and please help. And the injustice here and around the world, because water is a basic human right for everybody, not just colonial powers where you have all the world's resources and you waste them."

It will cast an everlasting Mark of shame on the international court. Israel is waging a just war against Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas massacre. 12 Jews raped Jewish women, burned Jewish babies, took hundreds hostage. Now, in the face of these, ours, Mr. Khan creates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas. This is like creating a moral equivalence after September 11th between President Bush and Osama bin Laden. Or during World War 2 between FDR and Hitler. What a travesty of justice. What a disgrace! The prosecutor is absurd. Charges against me and Israel's defense minister. A million attempt to deny Israel the basic right of self defense. And I assure you one thing. This attempt will utterly fail. 80 years ago, the Jewish people were totally defenseless against our enemies. Those days are over. Now the Jewish people have a state. And we have an army to defend our state. Not withstanding the blood libals, Mister Khan is leveled. Israel will continue to wage this war in full compliance with international law. We will continue to take unprecedented measures to get innocent civilians out of harm's way and to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need in Gaza. Mr. Khan also said to dangerous president that undermines every democracy's right to defend itself against terror organizations and aggressors. The ICC has no jurisdiction over Israel, and Mr. Khan's actions will not stop us from waging our just war against Hamas. But Mr. Khan's abuse of this authority will turn the ICC into nothing more than a farce. He's doing something else. He is callously pouring gasoline on the fires of anti Semitism that are raging across the world. Through this incendiary decision, Mr. Khan takes his place among the great anti Semites in modern times. He now stands alongside those infamous German judges who donned their robes and upheld laws that denied the Jewish people their most basic rights and enabled the Nazis to perpetrate the worst crime in history. Two weeks ago, on Holocaust Memorial Day, I pledged this. No amount of pressure and no decision in any international form will prevent Israel from defending itself against those who seek our destruction. To all the enemies of Israel, including their collaborators in The Hague, I renew that pledge today. Israel will wage our war against Hamas until that war is won. Because never again is now.",

Doctor Hemoy lives in the United States and was a former US Army combat surgeon who is now in Gaza. Earlier this week, he posted a message for President Biden, and I think all of you need to hear it. As a US Army combat surgeon, veteran and international crisis first responder, I've built my life on service in the belief in the US government. I took a hippocratic oath to help people, whoever they are, wherever they are. When the call came in December 2,023, the doctors were needed through the World Health Organization. And being specialized in combat trauma and reconstructive surgery, I signed up to serve. I have never in my career witness the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza. I arrived in Rafaa as a part of a team coordinated by the WHO. We understood the dire conditions and plan to leave together in two weeks. On May 13th, in violation of international law, our team of medical professionals were denied exit. I want our president to know that we are not safe. When the call came in to evacuate, I was asked to choose to either evacuate and leave my team behind or stay with them. I could not, in good conscious, leave my team behind. That is not what I was Taught. That is not the Soldier's Creed. We don't leave Americans behind. This is against our values as Americans. As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team. And as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans. This burden falls on the international community and President Biden to use their full influence to ensure medical personnel can continue their critical work without being put in harm's way. We worry that the European hospital we are currently in will suffer a similar fate of Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, where humanitarian workers, patients and civilians were massacred. As for our patients, it is with a very heavy heart that we will ultimately leave them behind without care. And this responsibility remains in the hands of the international community. We entered with a commitment to be relieved with another medical team, and now this, too, is being denied. The people of Gaza deserve more than their burnt out, collapsed medical healthcare system. To my wife, daughters, and son, I know that it hurts that I am not coming home this weekend, and I am sorry, but I know that you are proud. And I am upholding my oath to never leave anyone behind. This man is a hero. I just ask, um, if you are still watching, that you pray for this incredible doctor, um, for both his safety and that he can complete his mission in saving lives and providing care. I would be so proud. If that was my dad, if that was my. My husband, my colleague. Whatever. Um. Doctor Hawami is a hero. And I, too, pray that European hospital is protected, because we have seen what Israel does to hospitals.",

    "voice_to_text": "Finally, after seven month and a half today, that I have reasonable grounds to believe, on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and minister of defence, you have gallant, bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes committed on the territory of the state of Palestine from at least October 8th, 2023. The crimes include starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, willfully causing great suffering, serious injury to body or health or cruel treatment, willful killing or murder and intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population, as well as crimes against humanity of extermination and or murder, persecution and allegations of crimes of committing other inhuman acts. My office submits that these individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival. My office charges Netanyahu and Galant as co perpetrators and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes. So this was Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, who announced today that his office submitted applications to the court in order to issue arrest warrants against the Prime Minister of Israel, Binjamin Netanyahu, and the Defense Minister of Israel, UAV Galan. In addition to that, the same obligation was submitted against three members of the leadership of Hamas, Yahya Sinoi, Ismail Hani and Dave, who's in charge of Al Qasam Brigade. So now you need to understand that this is very important step in order to Save god the remaining of any shred of credibility for the rule of the international law. Because we cannot have war criminals commanding extermination armies with no consequences. But what is ridiculous is that the American politicians, senators, Congress members running out of their way, threatening the ICC and publicly acting like gangsters on behalf of the Israeli state, threatening the international institution. So now, according to Karim Khan, there are high credible evidence supporting the application. So what happens if the court actually issue those arrest warrants? Will Netanyaho be arrested if he travels? The answer is look at Bhutan. Bhutan actually has an arrest warrant and he actually travels without problems. But he travels to the countries that are not party to the ICC. So couple of months ago he was supposed to go to South Africa, but he didn't because he was risking to be arrested because South Africa is party to the ICC. In addition to that, after the arrest, Warren Putin was classified as a war criminal. And that's why the majority of the western counties claim not to have ties with him or with Russia. Now the question is, will the western countries, specifically the United State and the United Kingdom and Germany, cut ties with the Israeli government and sanction Israel? Let me know what do you think of this in the comments. Don't forget share this video button in your stories and duet it. This is very important please. And check the link in my Bio, if you wanna help the people in the north of Gaza. See you next video. Ciao."

    "voice_to_text": "Obviously it's a big event today, so I'm going to read you some headlines from a few years ago to bring you back to what it was like under the former guy. It's a little bit of chaos, but nonetheless. Uh, so first one is Trump promised this Wisconsin town and manufacturing boom. It never arrived. Foxcon factory jobs touted by Trump will not come to pass. Trump's highly touted Foxcon project falls short of its promises. And my favorite one, enormous bait and switch. Foxcon factory jobs touted by Trump not coming to Wisconsin. But let's fast forward to today. So we're in that same town referencing those articles in Wisconsin, and Microsoft is announcing a huge investment creating thousands of good paying jobs for hard working people. So what's your reaction to those headlines? Well, first of all, Trump talked about infrastructure, what he's gonna build. We have construction week every week for four years. He didn't build a damn thing. Nothing. And I decided when I got elected into office, I was gonna build this economy from the middle out, in the bottom up. For real, not a joke. And invest in America. Invest in American enterprises. And so I've been able to gain respect and support of a lot of major corporations. And all of a sudden they get a call from Microsoft saying that they wanna get engaged and we're talking about investing literally billions of dollars. But you know what they're doing beside that? They're not only doing that, also funding pipeline to hire people from this community college we're in, as well as people who are involved in high schools, let them know the technological capacity is needed. So this gonna create, literally, over time, thousands of good things. Oh, no, it's so great.",

    "voice_to_text": "I've realized that I'm actually in the wrong for getting mad at Miss Rachel for her pro Palestine narrative, because it's not her fault that that's the only type of language that community can understand is at her level. So I decided to be nice and try to re explain history and a way that they'll understand. Because sometimes when our friends can't understand what we're saying, it means that we have to repeat ourselves a lot of times, and that can get frustrating. Can you say frustrating? That means a really bad feeling, like you're very annoyed. So I'm going to explain it at your level, because sometimes when we rephrase things for our friends, it can help them not understand. So let's do a short history lesson in a pro Palestine friendly way, starting with the British Mandate of Palestine. Please do not laugh at our friends drawing. Not all of us are good at drawing. But this is the British Mandate of Palestine. Can you say British? Why is it called the British Mandate of Palestine? Because the British owned it. Do you know where the word Palestine comes from? No, friends. It's not an Arab word. It actually comes from the Romans. Good job. I'm so proud of you. And right here, when we hear the chant from the river to the sea, they're talking about the Mediterranean Sea all the way to the Jordan River. That's not very nice to be yelling the push. Our friends Out of an entire country. That makes me sad. After the British Mandate of Palestine, when the British decided that they wanted to share the country, we had three different proposed countries. Can you say Jordan? Jordan. Good job. And is Jordan bigger than Israel? Palestine land. It is. Good job, friends. Jordan is bigger, but we don't say that Jordan is occupying Palestinian land. That's what we like to call a double standard. A double standard is when you have one set of rules for one group of people, and a different set for another one. That's not good. We don't like double standards. The proposal included Israel and Palestine sharing the land. We like sharing. Sharing is good, so that all of our friends can get a piece. But unfortunately, it didn't go that way. See, with sharing, Israel said, yes, we will share. Palestine said, no, I don't wanna share. I want all of it. Palestine was being very, very greedy. That made Britain mad, because Britain owned the land, and they were trying to be nice and share with their friends. They didn't like that Palestine was being very, very greedy. So after that, Palestine decided to form the Arab Liberation Army with all of their friends. To try to gang up on little Israel. Israel was a lot smaller, and that hurt their feelings. They hurt them really, really badly. And we don't hurt our friends. But they didn't know that little Israel actually packs A big punch. And it didn't exactly go the way that they planned. So what did we learn here? We Learned a few things. Number one, we Learned that we should share. Number two, we learn that we can't always get what we want. And number three, don't hit our friends. Because sometimes they'll kick your ass. In six days. Hope you guys enjoyed today's lesson.",

I don't know army terms, so if I get the army terms wrong, don't fucking come to me. I was a closeted queer dude at the time this story was told, so I wasn't actively trying to learn Army Army terms unless it would get me closer to army men, but. Anyway, he tells me about how one of his teammates, again team I don't know, companions whatever, was captured and his unit did like a rescue operation where they parachuted behind enemy lions, snuck into the place where this guy was being held, and rescued him all before the enemy had even noticed they were there. Why do I retell this story now, seven months into the so called Hamas war? Because what the fuck, right? If the IDF is capable of daring rescue operations such as that, how are they incapable of taking out Hamas leadership without killing tens of thousands of other people? It doesn't make any sense. Which is why either the IDF is deliberately committing a genocide or is actually way more inept than they have ever let the rest of the world know about.",

    "voice_to_text": "And so much of what we're seeing, particularly on TikTok, about what's going on in the Middle East is woefully false. But it's also incredibly slanted pro Hamas, anti Israel. And it is, you know, not any place where anyone should go to get information about complex matters like what is going on there. Huh? Where should they go then? Hell, who should they listen to if not the primary sources that are live video footage of children blown to bits, mothers wailing in agony, trapped under rubble? Should they listen to politicians who routinely lie to them and write laws that favor themselves and their corporate and lobbying donors who investigate themselves when accused of crimes against the American public, only to surprisingly state they've discovered that they've done nothing wrong? Should they listen to mainstream media who, not to go out in foil hat on you, is bought and paid for, used by the rich and powerful to sway the public into believing a chosen narrative? Should they listen to Hillary the hawk, whose rap sheet in the Middle East is far from favoring peace or at the very least, the interests of American citizens? The woman who said, and I quote, that Americans should get over themselves if they're not happy with the candidate options for presidency? The woman who left American citizens to die in the Middle East? Now, it would be dishonest to pretend that social media can't muddy the information that people are getting because there are So many people posting videos. People with biases, people who are ill intentioned, people who are well intentioned but confused themselves. But this isn't 2001 anymore. This isn't 2012 anymore, where we'd have to wait for a sterilized press release from our oligarchs to have any insight on what's happening around the world, our involvement in it, and take it at face value. It is all at our fingertips. And no, possibly muddy in the beginning, it all comes to light eventually. Now, if I were you and wanted to win people over in some way, and I know you're one to double down on whatever behavior contributed to your past losses instead of seeking to improve it, hence why your communication style with the American public hasn't changed since you lost to Trump, even though it should have.

Social media has rotted my brain. There's a genocide taking place overseas, the wealth disparity in the US has reached the tipping point, and we're about to have a Hunger Games. Let them eat cake, they say from their positions of power. But when it comes to speaking on the injustices of the world, they are silent.

I do not support isn't real. I don't believe isn't real is a real place. I believe it's an American colony made up by the United States of America so they can kill brown people and steal their land under the guise of it technically being a different country, but it's actually just the United States and sheep's clothing. Because that's all the United States of America has ever done since its inception is kill brown people and steal their land. I do not support isn't real in any fathomable way, shape, or form beyond its capacity to crumble. I am very pro watermelon people, and I have been ever since I first Learned about what this conflict even was. Back when I was in high school, I used to run a Taylor Swift Stan account on Twitter and one of my mutuals named nayama ended up going to prison for several months because she refused to join the IDF.

But it made people even more mad because she said she wasn't an elite because I'm not elite, I'm a normal person. But Minnie pointed out she lives in an elite apartment in New York where she pays $17,000 per month which is around $200,000 a year on her rent. We're inside a 17 thousand dollar month apartment in Soho. This backlash started after she posted a video at the Met Gala using the let them eat cake sound which caused people to call her out of touch, referencing this sound to Marie Antoinette, Queen of France when she was told her people couldn't afford bread. Then she supposedly said let them eat cake. As over 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, many can't afford to buy groceries. And with all the current issues happening around the world which made people start the block out revolution against all celebrities unless celebrities start speaking about issues and give back.",

    "voice_to_text": "For those who don't know, I didn't know either until recent events. The EBU, who are doing the Eurovision Song Contest, created an anti booing system in 2,015, when Russia was booed, which basically means that whenever an artist gets booed, they play fake applause on TV. And with Israel performing this year, there are quite some booze, and you don't hear anything on TV. What the fuck? Um. I feel betrayed. I feel shocked. For me, the Eurovision stands for freedom and diversity and democracy. But manipulating what the people are seeing on TV gives me the biggest North Korea vibes ever. Like, if North Korea does it, it's propaganda, it's manipulation. But when the EBU does it, it's supposed to be Protection. Don't get me wrong, yes, you want to make this event as unpolitical as possible, but I'm sorry, the Eurovision has never been. Has never been unpolitical. It got created because of politics. Every year, there are songs who are political. Every second year, every third year, a political song wins. Konshita Wars was a political song. 2 years ago was a political song. You cannot call a competition your vision and have nationalities compete against each other and call it unpolitical. If you don't want a live audience reaction, don't have a live audience in there, because their opinions are as valid as everybody else's. And if there's booze, me as a watcher, I want to hear the booze. I don't wanna be fooled. I don't wanna Be bullshitted. And what you're doing with this anti booing system is manipulating the whole event. And I feel betrayed. I feel shocked. I feel like I'm in a simulation or something, because this is so fucking weird. If there's people who are booing, then let them. Don't fake it. And if you want to protect the artist, protect them. Give her security, give her therapy. But you're not protecting them. While she stands on stage and hears all the booze, she's hearing that, you're not protecting her. Don't fool yourself. You're faking. You're faking the event. You're manipulating it. And as a Eurovision fan and former Eurovision artist, I'm. I'm really disappointed.",

    "voice_to_text": "Of course. War is horrible. So why did the Palestinians initiate this war with their vicious attack on Israelis on October 7th? Well, they didn't. What do you mean, they didn't? They didn't. This war has been going on for 75 years. Israel initiated it in 1948 by ethnically cleansing 750,000 people. We must expel Arabs. We must expel Arabs and take their places. We must expel Arabs and take their places. And if we have to use force, not to dispossess the Arabs of the negative and Trans Jordan, but to guarantee our own right to settle in those places, then we have force at our disposal. David Ben Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, said that in 1937. And that's what they proceeded to do. The people in Gaza, this is what you need to understand. The people in Gaza, over 80% of them are refugees. Many of them are from a place called Majdal, Askelon, in what is now southern Israel, in a city called Ashkelon. And they were dragged from their homes and driven from their homes, placed in prison camps, barbed wire prison camps, and then dumped in trucks in 1950 into the Gaza Strip, where they would be permanently warehoused. And then Israel proceeded to move Arab Jewish refugees and Russians into Ashkelon to prevent them from ever coming back. And pass laws to prevent Arabs, Palestinians from being able to return to their homes. 750,000 were ethnically cleansed. Sit 8 for 18 years. The remaining Palestinians, 100,000 were internally displaced inside Israel. The remaining were put under military rule. They were under military occupation until 1966. Then in 1967, Israel violently, in a war it initiated, occupies Gaza, occupies the West Bank, occupies the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights in East Jerusalem, and then invades Lebanon in 1982, attacking Palestinian refugees there. Puts Gaza under siege in 2005. No. No one can get in or out without Israeli military permission. We must kill and kill all day, every day. That's according to Arnon Sofa. Sofa and Israeli government consultant to help decide this, devise the siege of Gaza. For years, Israel would not allow certain chocolates and A2 paper into Gaza. And then they began these brutal military assaults, which they call mowing the lawn. Slaughtering a few people will leave Hamas intact, but keep them a lesson, teach them a lesson. And I talked to you about those assaults that took place on Gaza. So this didn't come out of a vacuum. This. You're not gonna be able to hold people under siege, then cut them off from the world, and then expect them to just play along. That doesn't mean that I celebrate what happened on October 7th. It should have never had to happen. The reason it happened is because of the Israel lobby here, the genocide Democrats and the genocide Republicans, who deny the Palestinians any right to have the right to have rights. And it's the right to have rights, That defines you as a citizen. They're citizens of nothing. And now we see what Israel really thinks of them, really thinks of their children. Gaza has become a graveyard for children, according to UN Secretary General Antonio Gutterrez. So this didn't start on October 7th, and it's not going to end when there's a ceasefire.",

    "voice_to_text": "You guys know, I don't chime in too much. First off, I'll apologize for the bumpy ass video. Our roads aren't exactly the best around here. But I did want to address this comment. So the video was not intended or what we're doing, not intended to be political in any way. Humanitarian only. And when Chanel found this stuff and wanted to do it, I asked her a couple questions and, you know, we talked about it and it was 100% humanitarian effort based. You know, try to help a family in a bad situation. That was it. So, you know, we. She knows. Not even very political at all. Um, I am very opinionated politically. I try to keep that stuff to myself cause I think it gets pushed around too much. It's nice to get a break from that. So, um, you know, I try to avoid doing stuff like that. However, like just helping out a family, it doesn't mean like I'm gonna throw myself in the middle of a freaking, you know, centuries old conflict between two nations. Like that is. That stuff in the Middle East is so complicated that 99.9% of the people who are spouting off and spewing different opinions on it, they don't even know the half of it or the gist of it at all. They're just, you know, you get one little nugget information and you base your opinion on that, which is fine. Like, I don't have any problem. With that. But there's so much nuance, there's so much to the whole matter that say, I'm not gonna interject myself into that. She knows. Not going to. Most people don't even understand it. So all the video is, it's not about supporting one nation over another nation or anything like that. All it is is she found a family that needed a little bit of assistance to try to get out of a bad situation. I can support that. If. If that's too much, then we don't. Then don't. Don't donate, don't do anything. That's fine with us. I don't expect everyone. I mean, I know everything is tight. I was on here bitching about the cost of donuts, what, a freaking week ago?

Now, obviously America secular progressives are like super pro Islam and on the surface is like, wait, why are the people who are all about women's empowerment on the same team as the religion that beats women who appear in public without burkas in certain regions? Like secular progresses will do Queers for Palestine marches when saying Queers for Palestine is kind of like saying chickens for KFC guys, they're doing Queers for Palestine marches when queers in Palestine are getting tortured, hanged in shot. So it's like, doesn't make sense, right? Wrong. Makes total sense because hidden under the surface, secularism in Islam are the same thing. As others have pointed out before me, the foundation of secularism is a repudiation of Christianity, and the foundation of Islam is a reputation of Christianity. The secret common thread that puts them on the same team is not Christianity and not Christ. Two different lies. They come from the same father of lies, so they stay on the same family."

You know, when I was in school and learning about the Nazis, I just sit and watching horror thinking how could anyone let something like that happen? I assumed in a world like now, with the internet and everything, propaganda would be harder to believe. There are countless families trying to flee Gaza right now and fear for their own lives, all because of Israel's indiscriminate killing of Palestinian citizens. I've left a link in my bio with the master list of Operation Olive Branch. It's essentially a spreadsheet with a huge collection of families who are trying to raise money to leave Gaza for help. I know it's a difficult time financially for a lot of people, so I completely get if people can't help financially. But do me a favor and share this. Share the link if you are able to, please. I urge you, send some money over to some families. How many more innocent lives are gonna have to be lost before people actually start giving a shit?

You've already killed up to 40,000 people, and a large number are innocent civilians, women and children. Out of that Hamas number that you just gave, more than 14,000 are terrorists that we took out. So how many civilians do you believe you've killed? We. We don't have exact figures, as you know.

Up until very recently, I was one of those ignorant creators who was thinking, why do I need an audience to do the right thing if integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching? Why do I need brownie points from the internet to be a good person? And that way of thinking is not okay when you have 6 million followers and you have a platform and a tool that so many people wish that they had. In times like this, I would see videos pop up on my FYP of people saying, if you have a platform, you should use it to speak out. And I guess those words never sunken. I had a conversation with one of my good friends the other day, and she told me, it's. It's not about needing brownie points and validation from the internet that you're a good person. It's about utilizing the tool that so many people wish that they had. That conversation. Head home. I'm here to step up and use the one resource that I haven't yet, which is my platform. I have submitted the form for pass the hat, which is a system created by a beautiful soul on this app by the name of Aaron Hatterman. Another one of my very good friends, Angelique, or glam by Angelique here on TikTok, has also submitted the form, and we are still awaiting a response. This project partners creators with families in Gaza to help raise money so that they can escape. This is such an amazing resource, and Aaron has inspired myself and so many other creators to want to be a part of this. Aaron has stated that there are so many families and so many creators to get through, but she's trying to get through them all. Both Angelique and myself are very eager to participate, but we understand that this could take time. So with that being said, I would love to share with you guys some other creators who have already been paired with families and have gofundmes, LinkedIn, their B I os. I saw under the desk news do this, and I thought it was a great idea. While still awaiting a response, the first creator is Ali Rose, and Ali is raising money for the italadini family. I hope I'm saying that right. And the next is Adam Wright fitness. And Adam is raising money for the Oberos family, which once again, I hope I'm saying correctly. Both of these families still have yet to meet their goal and make it out of Gaza. And both of those creators are people that I have followed for a very long time and that I think are amazing people. But most importantly, I think that Aaron is the type of person that we should all be aspiring to be right now. I look up to and admire her so unbelievably much right now, and she deserves every Ounce of credit for what she's doing. And I'm so grateful to have people in my life that love and support me enough to tell me when I'm not doing the right thing. For something to bother me and eat away at my heart for so long and for me to still not say anything online was not okay at all. There has been no justifiable excuse for our silence, and we as creators need to do better.",

    "voice_to_text": "Massive breaking news right now. In a major shift on US policy towards Israel, President Biden has announced that if Israel were to invade Rafa, the United States would stop sending all offensive weapons to Israel. These offensive weapons include ammunition, bombs, fighter jets, and more. The president also confirmed that American made weaponry was used by Israel and Gaza thus far. Now, this does not include defensive weapons, for example, missiles for the Iron Dome. The United States will always provide those. Israel has yet to invade Rafa, and in the past several days it has conducted limited operations to take the Rafa border crossing, for example. That has not crossed President Biden's red line. This is still yet a major policy shift when it comes to Israel, and it's really the first time the president has publicly acknowledged that his red line means the stopping of shipment of offensive weapons. As soon as we have more information on this, I will provide it to you. So be sure to stay tuned for all the news you need to know about.",

    "voice_to_text": "alright so about 300,000 of you guys will remember this lady here now what did she do she accused me of getting paid by Israel to make content so she's saying the reason I'm making all this Israeli content is because Israel's paying me to do so and the reason I'm making this video is because I think it's a learning opportunity for many people especially her so stick with me till the end so let's see how it started and he has all these Zionists all love and everything he puts out preach brother preach it's the truth it's the truth and supporting him the whole way but what I really wanna know is how much are they paying him how much are they paying you because I just can't even believe what comes out of your mouth anymore notice she didn't give me the respect enough to ask me if they're paying me she skipped right past that and said how much are they paying you meaning they are paying you but just a matter of how much so that in and of itself is an accusation slight interruption while I'm making this video the squirrel is literally right outside the window anyway back to business so anyway I said to her where's the proof she's accusing Israel of going at here and paying a bunch of creators to defend them and she's accusing me of taking money from Israel and as a result of that defending them so again where's the proof fair question if you're gonna accuse someone of something you should have proof to back it up otherwise it's just a baseless accusation now I can't find the video but she made a video asking for her TikTok family to help her find the proof some of you guys probably saw that video if you went to her page but like I said I can't find it I think she took it down so you make an accusation and then when you're asked to show the proof you go asking people to get the proof for you interesting to say the least so then she later responds with this video next question you asked me on mine was can I prove to you that uh people are paid by Israel uh influence um political parties and all that kind of thing well I've actually gone and had a look for all that information and you said not TikTok related I've pulled up a couple of news articles on it but I can't actually prove it to you because this information is not done out in the open and it's not done for all the world to see so let me get this straight you just told me that you can't prove it but yet you accuse me of doing something that you absolutely have no proof of and I didn't say not TikTok related it just can't be influencer he said she said or some random email it doesn't show any organisations or anything like your favourite guy did like there needs to be some legitimate proof guys you said yourself you have none so you accuse me of doing something with absolutely no proof at all but we're gonna play that game okay you work in childcare you're a editor Jeff what's your proof I don't know some people said some weird stuff about her she looks a little suspicious to me so yep she's a editor now imagine if that was actually the rumour in your life because someone made a baseless accusation about you that could seriously damage your reputation could it not so if you're gonna accuse somebody of something you should actually get some facts and gather some evidence before you formulate your opinion rather than just admit you were wrong and you made a mistake right you tried to find a way to be right the world to see so I can't prove that part but what I can prove is you're definitely getting paid by TikTok because your growth on your account even in the last few days has grown by nearly half a million people first off where's your source that my account has grown by over half or around half a million people in the past few days please show me that source I know how much my account has been growing in the past few days and it's not even close to half a million I wish it was but it's not these here are my analytics you can see in the past 28 days if you look down below I've gained 21,000 followers my growth has been slow that's in a month 20,000 followers you've just accused me of getting almost half a million in a couple days again with absolutely no proof no evidence at all now me having a lot of growth is not an indicator of whether I'm getting paid or not by TikTok someone could have a lot of growth and not even be in the creative rewards program and make any money so you saying I know you're getting paid because you're having a lot of growth is wrong you don't know you took a guess and of all your guesses this one's actually correct I do get paid based off of how well the videos do if they're over a minute long like I said again absolutely having no proof just making accusations now keep in mind how many of your pro Palestinian creators are getting paid for videos that are over a minute long also keep in mind the difference in the amount of support on TikTok for Israel compared to Palestine so look at the top Israel 3.2 million post free Palestine with no heart 4.7 million post free Palestine with a flag and a heart another 4.2 million post Palestine itself 5.6 million post there's four more support on this app for Palestine than there is for Israel so ask yourself who's really making the money on this app so what you did is you accuse me of something and then after you figured out you had no proof of the accusation you just made which is embarrassing you tried to pivot to something else well speaking of embarrassing she said this somebody commented on her video saying you really embarrassed yourself maybe take a note for future videos right she said I don't feel embarrassed as telling about her and in my opinion many people that think like her they are perfectly fine to go out in the world and make accusations about people with no proof and then when they've been shown or they've realised they have no proof they're not embarrassed about making those damaging accusations that they made against people it's not embarrassing to them to talk about things and they have absolutely no facts no evidence no nothing not embarrassing to them that's fine if it was embarrassing to them having facts and details and accurate understandings of what's going on would be important to them but she's showing us that it's not important to her and I want you to think about that I think that's a big part in why she supports what she supports because again like I said she's not really getting the details before she formulates her opinion she's fine having opinions that are ill informed I mean speaking on those ill informed opinions and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of other people like her in the same vote",

    "voice_to_text": "On Tuesday, TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit against the US government in which they are trying to take aim at that legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law by the president a few weeks ago that says ByteDance would have nine months to divest the company or else it's banned. So in this filing, they argue that that legislation is unconstitutional. They say that it violates free speech rights and it unfairly targets the company. Moreover, they also argue that, well, you know, this is letting the other social media companies that are based in the US play by a different set of rules. So from the lawsuit, quote, Congress has never before crafted a two tiered speech regime with one set of rules for one name platform and another set of rules for everyone else. All which is to say, this could be going through the court system, which could take some time.",

Biden just did that with Israel. See, the whole basis behind the impeachment of Trump was that the president is not allowed to attach strings to money the Congress already passed. But Biden just did that. See, Congress passed an aid package for Israel, and Biden is delaying that aid, trying to pressure Israel to do what he wants them to do. He is doing exactly what they accuse Trump of doing. Except he's being far more blatant. Like when they said Trump was doing it, there was at least a question of whether or not that's what he was saying. But there's no question this time. Biden is being very open about the fact that he is delaying the aid until Israel does what he says. Until Israel acts the way he wants them to act. That's an impeachable offense.

Israel had earlier called for Palestinians in several neighbourhoods in eastern Rafah to evacuate before a ground excursion, triggering an exodus of thousands of people. The Israeli operation is taking place before a fresh round of indirect negotiations on a ceasefire in Cairo, and after Hamas announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal.

They're indiscriminately bombing this area, dropping leaflets from the sky, telling them it is no longer safe to be there. They have to leave. Where are they supposed to go?

What's happened here? You have a social media ecosystem environment in which context, history, facts get lost, and the emotion, the impact of images, um, dominates. Some wonder why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down potentially TikTok or other entities of that nature. If you look at the, uh, postings on TikTok and the number of mentions of Palestinians relative to other social media sites, it's overwhelmingly so among, uh, TikTok, um, uh, broadcast. So I know that's a real interest, and the president will get the chance to make action in that regard."

It's not Israel that is in control of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party or the Labour Party or the Conservative Party. It's a system. They happen to be the lynchpins of the system in which a lot of people make a lot of money maintaining the state of Israel in its geographical location and as an apartheid state that has a testing ground for all of the developments that they are doing in terms of weaponry and in terms of surveillance. It's also part of a massive money laundering operation from the part, for instance, of the United States government, because part of the money that they send in aid to Israel gets recycled into donations that end up in the coffers of the very politicians that vote for it. By it, I mean aid to be given. This is not a situation of Israel controlling anything. It's the circumstances of this country having a privileged position in a geopolitical game in which they are involved in and them flexing the leverage that is given to them by the people who profit from it. And of course, there are people who support Israel for ideological reasons and for belief. There are more Christian Zionists that there are Jewish people in the world. Right, but from a geopolitical perspectives, the stakeholders that want to Israel to continue without reform are equal parties in this Just got unlucky with these nutters that they have in charge that just went a step beyond of what they usually do. Because a Gaza is a genocide and it's extreme, but this has been going on for 75 years. And the governments that considered themselves socialists, the people who benefit from Israel's existence as it is, all want to scramble back to the normality of not being scrutinized on their day to day actions of continual pressure of Palestinians. And we mustn't let them off the hook by saying stuff like this.",

I also don\u2019t believe that there is a singular creator. I have various thoughts of what could be from us all just being the same \u201cstuff\u201d that always was experiencing itself  to reincarnation to multidimensional theories. I also took the time to learn about different religions and spiritualities and practices, and I realize that we were all talking about the same stuff, we just give it different names and have different traditions based off of our ancestors and geographically where we are in the world. In sense that depending on where you exist in the world depends on what resources you have access to so that determines what components are used in your spiritual practices. I went through a process of excepting that death is as much a part of life as being born is, so I do not fear death. I have no issues with not being remembered but more that while I am existing that I am safe space and a positive influence on those around me and who I come into contact with. I do understand the importance of religion and of the idea of God for a lot of people because it does give people a sense of comfort and hope. And I remember a few years ago someone said that it is spiritually irresponsible to be a guide if you\u2019re going to take away somebody\u2019s belief system and then not provide them with something else. So, I\u2019ve settled on the idea of one of the following \u2014 1. God does not exist. 2. God does not love us all equally. 3. God is not all powerful. 4. God does not see good and bad the way we do. 5. God is not all good  I rack my brain around this for years trying to figure out which I believed and which made the most sense. And I realize that the honest answer is, I know anyone else will know until I\u2019m no longer here and have chosen to simply live a life where I treat people the way I want to be treated, do my best to assist those when I can, and continue to heal and evolve to be the best possible version of myself and being that I can be. #B#BlackAtheist#A#AtheistR#ReligionS#Spiritualityf#fypt#traumah#healinge#empathy",

They banned our website, including anything that has the option of entering or accessing the website, even passwords that are needed, um, whether they're paid or not, and whether it's stored on Israeli servers or outside of Israel. The website is now inaccessible. Uh, they're also banning any device used for providing content. That includes my mobile phone. If I use that, uh, to do any kind of news gathering, then the Israelis can simply confiscate it. Our internet access provider, the guy that simply hosts, uh, Al jazeera.net, uh, is also in danger of being find if they host the website. The Al Jazeera TV channel completely banned. Transmission by any kind of content provider is also banned and holding offices or operating them in the territory of Israel by the channel. Also, once again, any devices used to provide content for the channel can be taken away by the Israelis. It's a wide ranging ban.

Hate crimes against Muslims is increasing while Modi is using his support for Israel to openly demonize Muslims in India. And this isn't something new, by the way. You guys might remember the whole thing that happened with Bianca Chopra and like hate against Muslims and this is an ongoing thing. I would question a lot of your favorite Bollywood actors and Indian influencers. They support Modi, then they probably support Israel.",

    "voice_to_text": "Are you ready for a very radical statement? Well, here it goes. I support the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and this is what it says. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peacefully to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. End of quote. Let us be clear. Protests and demonstrations have played an enormously important and positive role in modern American history. Without protest, LED by Doctor King and others, we would not have made progress in eliminating segregation in America and combating racism. Without protest, women in America would still be second class citizens, unable to control their own bodies or have equal opportunities in the workforce. Without protests, many of our gay brothers and sisters would still be hiding their sexual identity. Today, on college campuses all over this country, students are exercising their constitutional right to protest. They are standing in opposition to American policy which is providing billions of dollars for Netanyahu's right wing, extremist Israeli government's war against the Palestinian people. A war which has already killed 33,000 Palestinians and injured 77,000 more, two thirds of whom are women and children. A war which has destroyed or damaged more than half of the housing in Gaza. A war which has essentially annihilated the healthcare system in Gaza. A war which has done incredible Damage to the civilian infrastructure in Gaza, electricity, clean water and sewage. A war which has bombed everyone of the 13 universities in Gaza and left hundreds of thousands of children without schooling. In my view, demonstrations must be non violent. Not only is that the right thing to do, it is the most effective thing to do. The focus must be on the suffering of the people in Gaza, not bricks flying through windows. And absolutely, we must all work together to make certain that we free our country from all forms of bigotry, anti semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia and every other form of hatred.",

For those who I'm listening that don't know, the concept creep is basically this idea, that kind of harm based definition start to slowly expand to encapsulate more and more things. And so for me personally, I take the stance that if we're going to speak of anxiety, we should speak on a fixated preoccupation with something terrible that might happen. If what you're feeling is nervous or anticipatory or vigilant, there are many words in the English language and other languages that can still fit that experience. When I think about using depressed to me, and I'm feeling, like, tired or low mood or using anxious to me, I feel nervous. There seems to me to be less of a risk of some cultural applications of that, because when we speak about trauma, we start speaking about our past, our stories, our relationships, and we're not necessarily trying to communicate a mood in this moment. And so I would say I still do feel that way about those terms. I mean, listen, let's all just say it's difficult. It's not like when I'm out with friends, I don't ever say hyperbolicly something about trauma or it's like, that was super depressing. Like, I do that as well. And we weren't using these words and talking about these things so openly even five years ago. It's a very, very new cultural shift. Yeah. Yeah, I think those are meaningful distinctions",

That's where I come in. Police officers in Canton, Ohio were dispatched and referenced to a vehicle that crashed into a telephone pole, and police officers arrived on scene. They made contact with witnesses who inform them that the offender, later identified as Frank Tyson, fled the scene on foot and ran into a bar. He's in the BMW. He ran in there. He ran in where, right now? Yeah. And there's cars right there. All right? Yeah. He's in the BMW right now.

HR 6 0 9:00 0 known as the Anti Semitism Awareness Act will redefine anti Semitism as set forth by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance for the enforcement of federal anti discrimination laws. What does that mean? Well, if you say that Israel is a racist state, that's anti Semitism. If you draw comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, that's also anti Semitism in practice. If this Bill also passes in the Senate, it would be illegal for Americans to voice opinions such as how Israel cannot be by definition both a Jewish state and a Liberal democracy. As this op ed in the Jerusalem Post points out, this would be anti Semitic and illegal to say. Or how it's racist for there to be segregated roads that separate Palestinian and Jewish settlers in Jerusalem. Criticism like these would also be considered anti Semitic and therefore would be legal to say. Even though this is in harats. Or if you wanna criticize the IDF, their shoot first, ask later policy, that is also anti Semitic and therefore you would not be allowed to say it. It's funny, you could bash America all day long, but if you dare voice criticism of Israel, then that would not only make you an anti Semite, but in the future that could also mean that You could be sued, persecuted or sanctioned by the federal government",

    "voice_to_text": "Fuck Palestine. Okay. Fuck Palestine. Story time on why I was faced with six charges and may not graduate from Rock Ridge University. So first two charges actually happened in the same night. I was detained in Manhattan and booked in Brooklyn with disorderly conduct and refusal of an ostrich's command during a mass arrest. Like 200 of us got arrested for peacefully protesting for the ceasefire in Gaza. Then third charge, if you'll believe it, was me trying to make it to my court date in in Brooklyn again. And I was running late. I jumped the trail. Guard in New York City. Cop caught me and wrote, gave me another charge in another court date. I don't even know what for, but he was just pissed off about me wearing the cafe. And then the next one was in Rutgers University itself. We were talking about Palestine in class and I spoke about my experience getting arrested by Jewish organization, bailed out by a Jewish support group, arrested by a Jewish cop. That was for Palestine. And this beep, beep, beep, beep sometime, I don't even know what. Disorderly conduct on me for harassment, intimidation and bullying. I don't go through a whole ass investigation series to say that I wasn't a threat for being anti Semitic. And she got somebody else involved, the professor for defending me for having free speech cause I said fuck Israel. And I'll say it again, I'll say it again during that entire Series. I was on academic probation, on the verge of being expelled, and when they finally found that case dismissed, like, she didn't do anything wrong, then she filed a restraining order against me. A girl, Wallah, Wallah! I've never even spoken to. I have no idea what Shawty Bay looks like, but if I ever walk into the same room as her, I. I can get expelled. Had been at a protest in DC. A journalist was being mad, and I said something to her, and she ran. Ran to the cops. Where are you? Officer, I. I'm an American, and I deserve to feel safe in my own country. So you agree? So you agree? Shorty started lying, spewing all of this John, Bro, talking about. Oh, she hit me! She hit me! I was like, babe, you're the journalist. You were documenting everything. Pull it up. Pull it up, Shorty. Babe, pull it up. Cops asked to see it. She refused to give it to them. Cops let me go without taking my information, so that when I was let off the hook. So overall, I got a couple of my charges dismissed, A few I had to pay off, and the rest never even made it through the first, like, investigation process. Currently, what is happening at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, where our president, Jonathan Holloway, is free, free, free Palestine! This bigot! Bigot! The absolute tea at Ruckus, New Brunswick, between the raging Zionists, And those with morals have been so high lately. Like, the Islamic Center got vandalized. Shawty Bae, I got. I almost got slapped last week for protesting. We've had people coming and cussing, calling us slurs, it. And this has been our form of protesting. We were calling on Rutgers University to divest from funding.",

and\u00a0you\u00a0already\u00a0know\u00a0he's\u00a0funded\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC\u00a0$180,000\u00a0this\u00a0year\u00a0alone the\u00a0reason\u00a0this\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0being\u00a0pushed\u00a0right\u00a0now is so they can use it to shut down college protests and\u00a0say\u00a0that\u00a0they're\u00a0in\u00a0violation\u00a0of\u00a0Title\u00a0VI and\u00a0let\u00a0them\u00a0pull\u00a0federal\u00a0funding\u00a0from\u00a0schools who allow these protests to continue on their campuses when I was doing my research I came across something that was really interesting this\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0Jerusalem\u00a0Declaration\u00a0on\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0 which\u00a0was\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0response\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0IHRA\u2019s\u00a0definition their goal was to fix the issues with the other definition which\u00a0conflated\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0with\u00a0antisemitism the two are not the same and\u00a0fix\u00a0the\u00a0clear\u00a0bias\u00a0towards\u00a0the\u00a0state\u00a0of\u00a0Israel that the other definition is being used for so a group of 200 scholars got together and wrote this definition that makes a clear distinction about what is and\u00a0what\u00a0isn't\u00a0anti-Zionism\u00a0and\u00a0antisemitism my\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0politicians\u00a0are\u00a0\u2018why\u00a0not\u00a0use\u00a0this\u00a0definition??\u2019 clearly protects free speech in a way that the other one does not the\u00a0answer\u00a0is\u00a0-they\u00a0don't\u00a0wanna\u00a0use\u00a0it they want to shut down criticism of the state of Israel that's why they use this one we have to all speak out against this act it's an evil act it's an act meant to shut down free speech it's an act meant to protect Israel this is not an American Bill it's an Israeli Bill pushed\u00a0by\u00a0AIPAC using\u00a0a\u00a0problematic\u00a0and\u00a0biased\u00a0definition they\u00a0had\u00a0the\u00a0audacity\u00a0to\u00a0name\u00a0it\u00a0the\u00a0Antisemitism\u00a0Awareness\u00a0Act

Smashing windows with hammers and taking over university buildings is not free speech. And those who commit such acts are doing nothing to convince others that their cause is just.

    "voice_to_text": "so originally I wasn't gonna talk about this but I'm going to because oh man like how do you not how do you not discuss this let's dive in right now we're just gonna cut to the meat and potatoes of this I had made a post discussing the TikTok ban now my primary point of contention with the TikTok ban is that the American government pull together quicker than they ever have in the history of law making to make a law banning a social media app while completely ignoring all of the issues that are actually affecting the American quality of life there's not even a discussion about giving us livable wages about giving us affordable housing about forcing the hedge funds to release single family homes back into the market they'll give TikTok nine months to sell but American hedge fund or foreign hedge fund 10 years to release our single family homes back into the market we're not talking about health care we're not talking about free health care we're not talking about the poisonous food we're currently being fed that's illegal everywhere else in the world we're not discussing any of this and simultaneously while they're completely ignoring all of our needs we are being over taxed when it's all set and done Americans are paying about 50% of their income to taxes they have completely eliminated the middle class so the average lower class citizen in America is paying about 50% you don't believe me your income tax your Medicare your Social Security all automatically debited and given to the government then you have to pay for your own private health care your own private retirement and if that's not bad enough you still have to pay sales tax and property tax so yeah roughly about 50% of your income goes to taxes in America I post this on all social media apps Instagram Facebook TikTok YouTube within an hour or two of me posting it to Instagram I wake up and I'm banned I'm completely banned they've disabled my account I had 133 *THOUSAND *followers my analytics would show on a monthly basis I would touch anywhere from 1 to 10 million individual accounts with my content I've had it for over 10 years this particular account and I met a verified but because I posted my opinion on American politics I'm banned from Instagram for life now this just makes the point that this is a gross infringement upon my constitutional right to freedom of speech and the ban on TikTok was never actually because they're worried about a foreign entity controlling an algorithm that reaches Americans it's because they want to control the narrative and they want to censor Americans because an American owned social media app oddly enough has all these community guidelines where you're not allowed to discuss race gender sexual orientation disabilities immigration political affiliation socio economic class etcetera like these are literally the community standards on the Instagram website and before you guys sit here and tell me that Mark Zuckerberg is sitting around dreaming up censorship for Americans get out of here who do you think makes the community standards who do you think runs and controls the metaverse at present Mark Zuckerberg only cares about selling our data for money and advertisement to guess what make more money the American government has been all through social media for some time TikTok is designed off of algorithms the algorithms are going to promote whatever gains the most interactions it's not the fault of a foreign entity that Americans like being rage baited or intentionally inflammatory content actually it's the fault of American media constantly polarizing us and pinning us against each other to believe that our neighbor is the enemy so we never pull together to actually address the injustices our government is committing and let me be abundantly clear here I have never been able to monetize Instagram because they always give me some type of infraction for violating community standard I'm not rude I'm not aggressive I'm not spreading misinformation I'm not posting intentionally inflammatory content I'm not inciting an insurrection or even like advocating for any type of violent behavior I am merely just disgusting my opinion on what my government is doing and that alone got me banned for Fucking Life and does nobody else see this as a gross infringement upon our constitutional right to freedom of speech how can any corporation or private entity tell me that I am not allowed to discuss my opinion even if I do give out any type of statistics I make sure that it comes from a verifiable credible source which more often than not is the American government it's a dot gov it's a um CDC or the National Crime Database like I don't give out incorrect information from unverified sources I don't speak factually I merely say I find it odd I'm displeased with etcetera etcetera all of these are feelings and opinions that I am now not allowed to voice in my country on a social media platform under the guise of community standards how how and I don't don't give me that well they can do it be I don't care about the why do none of you find this fucking off and seriously guys in the comments spare me the logistics and the legal well they can do it because judge had an example of shit and blah blah blah blah blah just just tell me you're a sheep without telling me you're a fucking sheep like I'm so for real the fact that more people are not up in arms about this is absolutely insane to me it's like the American government is like we know we're doing you guys wrong because this opinion is resonating with Americans everywhere they all feel the same it's gaining traction and rather than actually addressing it let's put a muzzle on her let's ban her let's take away her platform and the platform of other people who are like her because we're never gonna address these issues instead we're gonna use the media we do control to polarize and propagate you guys and then ban any other form of social media where you might not be polarized or propagated or where you have the ability to speak freely on your opinion like is this is this is this really where we're this is really where we're at guys wow",

Anything that, um, is people against the oppressors is my jam, okay? 100%. And I'm sure many of you seen the video now of the one kid, um, I say kid, a full grown adult, bonking the police officer on the head with the giant water jug. And have us become the symbol of these, um, student, our revolutions here. And a lot of people are saying, oh, because you know, um, water is giving to the people, blah, blah, blah, this and that. But no one's ever mentioned the fact that I've seen that using a water jug against police are just bonking them on the head with it is without a doubt, unequivocally the most non aggressive, non lethal way to fight back against the police. Because, you know, if they fought back with any other way, whether their fists, whether be like anything else, the police would justifiably use severe force against them because their, their life is in danger, you know what I mean? They can't justify that with a fucking water jug. It's become the symbol of these revolutions because it is the only way you guys can fight back without being killed, without being aggressively named, without being rubber bulleted or like tear gassed. Um, and like, they can't argue against that. You can't bump them in the head with a water bottle. And they'll be like, you wanna kill me? That's not how it works. That's. That's. That's not gonna happen. So using that as sort of a symbol of being like, hey, you guys are fighting us, but what the fuck you gonna do? I think that's solid. Use more water bottles. Bonk more police officers. What are they gonna do? What are they. You're not hurting them. You're not attacking them. You gonna Bonk"

    "voice_to_text": "a question for my American followers real quick are any of you familiar with taxation without representation if you failed history you're just not as American as you pretend to be don't worry I got you right taxation without representation is the entire basis of the American Revolution you know that war we started so that we could break free from Britain and be our own country like the entire premise of the United States Constitution so essentially American colonists were so fed up with being over taxed and under represented by British Parliament that they incited an entire revolution and what was the catalyst to the American Revolution that little thing we call the Boston Tea Party they revolted against their government over a 3% tax on tea why am I bringing this up you didn't ask don't worry I'm gonna answer anyways how do you think the founding fathers of America would feel if they knew that the average American was paying roughly 50% of their income to various taxes 50% of our income so $920 billion can go to the military in 2023 alone that is a real number reported on the collected tax revenue from the United States of America 50% of our income in taxes so 920 billion can go to the military now I know what you're thinking 50% where is she getting that number from even socialist and communist don't pay 50% Americans definitely don't yes you do and we're gonna fall down the rabbit hole of real numbers using my income which is verifiable to prove to you that you guys are being taxed at a 50% rate of the money that you make now in the sake of being transparent I am going to use real numbers here last year as a mother of two children meaning I have two dependents I made $103,000 working a regular 8 to 5 job on top of the fact I monetize my content creation and I get paid royalties off of the music I make so I have multiple streams of income and I work while I'm not working to make $103,000 as a head of household mother of two which at present given current inflation puts me as a lower class American citizen even with me being head a household mother of two lower class American citizen I still don't qualify for any subsidized assistance um no healthcare Temporary Assistance for Needy Families food stamps etcetera so everything I'm paying is out of my own pocket everything cool fine now buckle up for the fun part cause we're gonna go ahead and talk about how we got to pay in roughly 50% of our income to some variation of taxes now out of my regular check I pay 29% in payroll deductions the payroll deduction start with my income tax Medicare Social Security then I also have to pay for my own private retirement because they're threatening to take away Social Security and my own private healthcare because I don't qualify for any type of subsidized assistance so 29% of my check is immediately gone to income tax healthcare and retirement now as if 29% wasn't blatantly disrespectful enough I have to allocate an additional hundred dollars bi weekly to pay additional income taxes because I'm 1099 for my content creation and my royalties then on top of that I still ended up owing income taxes somehow even with two dependents only making $103,000 and paying an extra 200 a month but when you owe taxes to the American government if you can't pay them in a lump sum they charge you for setting up a payment plan so now I'm paying $300 additional a month so that's an additional $500 a month of my disposable income after I've already been taxed 29% going to the IRS for income taxes which guess what that boils down to $6,000 so roughly 5% of my income now we're at a staggering 34% just for income taxes retirement and healthcare well 34% still isn't 50 cool cool story let's go ahead and talk property taxes now I live in Cook County and property tax on average is 2.19% of the assessed market value of the home that you live in and well ever since hedge fund started buying up all of the single family homes this has increased the market value of homes driving the average home in America up to $300,000 for the assessed market value what's that break down to on a yearly basis about six to seven thousand dollars let's just go ahead and add another 5% of my income allocated to property taxes bringing us to a staggering 39% but wait there's more so on top of income tax government healthcare government retirement private healthcare private retirement and property taxes I also have to pay sales tax sales tax in Cook County is paid on every single thing you buy which guess what 10.25% bringing me to a whopping 49.25% roughly speaking of everything I make going to some version of taxes so now that we're all on the same page that over taxation is absolutely a thing that all Americans are experiencing can we talk about the lack of representation now because you would think after paying 50% of my hard earned American dollars I would have something to show for it but I don't I don't have free health care I don't even have affordable health care for that matter or options for affordable medicine I don't have access to nutritional food they won't give our public school children free lunches which is honestly absurd if they did they're not healthy you don't have some amazing quality of infrastructure you don't even have access to media that isn't polarized and heavily propagated you don't make a livable wage you don't have affordable housing you don't even have paid maternity leave and they refuse to regulate the cost of college tuition little alone the cost of daycare for working parents so what do we have what do we have I'll tell you what we have we have poison we have propaganda we have school shootings and we got a fucking TikTok ban that's what we get as Americans for our tax dollars we get to watch other countries that do have free health care use our tax dollars to fund their wars over taxation without representation",

They suck. Genetic sucks because they do. I'm sensing a common string of hostility here. Is it possible they hate us cause they can't be us?",

    "voice_to_text": "Why does it seem like so much of the fight for a free Palestine in the diaspora removes the idea of collective liberation? It's about the destruction of Israel, not changing policies, people seeing a solution as sending all the Jews back to Poland, not finding a way to live on the land peacefully together. It's only listening to extremists, not the Palestinians and Israelis who are working together, who are sitting outside Bebe's house because they can and are on the ground in the US. We can't sit outside Bebe's house. We can't fight for policy change in Israel. We are not there. But they are. And we should be taking point from the people who are fighting for it. These protests on college campuses could be inclusive, could be about collective liberation, could welcome in those who are working with organizations like Standing Together and peace now, but they're not. A person or an organization can be progressive, Zionist, and they're automatically thought of as evil, and their opinion doesn't matter. There's a distinction between a good Jew and a bad Jew. There's calls for the complete destruction of Israel and telling Jews to go back to Poland. There are people on the ground who are fighting for those things, and many of them went into Israel on October 7th. But there are also a huge group of people of Israelis and Palestinians fighting for collective freedom, collective liberation, who have been doing so for decades and generations. Why Aren't they the ones you're taking point from? We are in the diaspora. We should be taking point from those who want better for their own people. Not trying to be the loudest activist in the room, saying the most polarizing things, announcing bad actors matters. Listening to people who might not use the same language as you matters. Who on the ground are you fighting for? Just think about it. Taking point from the Palestinians and Israelis who are fighting together would be so powerful. Helping them do their work and spreading their message would be so powerful. To fight for a collective liberation, you have to take point from the people on the ground who are doing the same, not the people who are fighting for destruction before they mad do. All of us in need of healing. And may the memories of those who have been lost and those who will be lost be a blessing and a revolution for peace, freedom and safety for all.",

The US military is not dropping 2,000 pound bombs on civilian apartment buildings. The US military is not doing that, but we are supplying those bombs. United States of America is not blocking the borders and preventing food, water and medical supplies from getting to desperate people. We are not doing that. But we have supplied billions of dollars to the Netanyahu government, which is doing just that. So this is not just an Israeli war, this is an American war as well. And yet, despite the massive financial and military support the United States has provided to Israel for many years, Natanya House! Natanya House! Extremist government has ignored urgent calls from the president and others to alter their military approach and to end this humanitarian disaster. In my view, the United States is unconditional financial and military support for Israel must end. And that is why I offered an amendment to this Bill to do, in fact, what a majority of the American people want us to do, and that is no longer to provide military aid to the destructive Netanyahu government. I would have welcomed the chance to vote for the humanitarian aid provision in this Bill. Terribly important that we stop feeding people not only in Gaza, but in Sudan and all over the world. It's an important provision. I wanna support. It. I believe very strongly that we should support Ukraine and help them in defeat the imperialist ventures of Putin and the Russian army. But I'm not gonna be able to do that because I'm gonna stand with the American people today who oppose more money for Netanyahu. What we are doing today is very bad policy. We are eating and abetting the destruction of the Palestinian people. What we are doing today is not what the American people want. And I say to my democratic friends, it is absolutely not what Democrats. A lot of Republicans don't want us to continue that as well. But a strong majority of Democrats are saying, enough with Netanyahu's war. You just can't give him another $10 billion for unfetted military aid. But I suppose in a little while, as things happen here in the Congress, we will ignore the needs of the American people. We will not pay attention to what they want. And then we are shocked, just shocked, that we have a 14% approval rating.",

    "voice_to_text": "Where's the apartheid? This right here is Route 4 3 7 0, nicknamed Apartheid Road because one side is for Israelis and the other for Palestinians. It allows for illegal Israeli settlers to quickly and easily go between their illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, while Palestinians require a permit and need to go through checkpoints. This is a chadat road in the Palestinian city of elkharil. Also nicknamed Apartheid Road because Palestinians are quite literally not allowed to use it, while Israeli cars, illegal settlers and tourists can. Also, the Israeli military randomly imposes curfews and restricts Palestinians movement around their own homes and neighborhoods. Here are a plethora of checkpoints that Palestinians are subjected to for their most mundane daily tasks and routines, like for work, medical care, education, or religious purposes. And of course, Israelis don't have to go through these. This is a swimming pool in an illegal settlement in the West Bank, with water supply roughly four times greater than that provided to Palestinian communities, 180 of which don't have access to running water. And what does this lead to? Drying up of the wells, the collapse of farming villages, disappearing crops and their basic daily needs are not being met. So while illegal settlers are sometimes just a few hundred meters away enjoying swimming pools, Palestinians become forced to work for these settlers who control all of the agriculture, or Palestinians are forced to move. So just another form of ethnic cleansing, so on. Top of living under a brutal occupation and harsh military rule, Palestinians are in a vicious cycle of poverty and unemployment. Not to mention they live under constant threat of house demolitions because they don't have the proper permits. And when they do apply for the proper permits, Israel denies 98% of those applications. Just another thing illegal Israeli settlers don't have to endure. So, yeah, there's a little bit of apartheid for you.",

The first one, then an interval during which aid workers got out of their vehicles, removed the wounded, tried to move to another vehicle, which was struck. And then a third strike. What? As they tried to move and escape in a third vehicle, at which point all of them were dead. How would the second and third strikes of these marked vehicles be a mistake? And why would the US not more forcefully set conditions on the use of US made weaponry when it is being used to target aid workers? If the first one was a mistake, the second two, we're targeted with the intent of killing everyone in that convoy. So how do you respond to that? First of all, there's an investigation going on, so why don't we let it get done and why don't we see what they find in terms of the decision making process that LED to this terrible outcome? Prime Minister and the IDF have noted that it was their error. If you don't like the word mistake. Their error. They're investigating it. Let them do that work and let them see what they come up with, and then we'll go from there. Two years ago, the IDF killed an Al Jazeera journalist. They said that that was a mistake, uh, that she was wearing a Mark Press vest. She was shot anyway. Investigated it, and they, uh, released the findings. Their investigation, which found that they were at fault. Go on. But my. My question, sir, is in that case, uh, these. The Israelis did not initiate any criminal, uh, proceeding in this case. If it's found that the marked convoy was deliberately targeted, if not with the first shot, but the second two shots with the US support, criminal penalties. As I said, we would expect that should there be a need for accountability, that accountability be properly put in place for whoever may be responsible for this. But again, that's gonna allow. That's gonna depend on the investigation.",

That over here is Jared Kushner. He's married to Ivankatron. Yes, that Ivanka Trump. Love the dynamic, by the way, but that's besides the point. Recently on some podcast or interview, and he was asked what he thinks should happen to Gaza, and this man had the audacity to say the quiet part out loud. Take a look. Listen to what he says. Once Gaza's leave Gaza, and then I was never gonna let them back in. Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. And Gaza's waterfront property, it could be very valuable. It's a little bit of unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out, and then there's not much left of Gaza anyway. Move the gazons out and then clean it up. This is why it is so important to continue to talk and for everyone to use their platform to spread news like this. Because their plans are far from over. They said it initially, they wanted to turn Gaza into a parking lot. And now they're already wanting to develop said parking lot with absolutely no remorse for literal human life.",

    "voice_to_text": "Are you for real? Georgia's first waterside coaster to open at Lake Lanier this spring. Y'all, this is not for us. This ain't for us. So you decide to give Lake Lanier an accessory? You want to give Lake Lanier an accessory? Georgia's Lake Lanier has claimed over 200 lives. Why do people believe it's hunted? Because it is. So if you don't know the history of Lake Lanier, let me give you a little synopsis. Before Lake Lanier, there was a town called Oscarville. Filled with African American ranchers, blacksmith farmers. They specialized in poultry. They were thriving until 1912, when May Crow, a nineteen year old, was found unalived and great near the woods of Oscarville. Well, you already know there wasn't a trial. You already know it would only take one reason, one thing, for these people to gather in a group, create a mob, get their pointy hats, and go down and burn some shit up. This is George Rucker. He's a direct descendant of Oscarville. And he is alive to tell the story of his great grandfather, Bird Oliver. So the day that May Crow was found on alive, a mob got together and decided that they were going to burn down the whole town. And that's what they did. They burned, they pillaged, they great, they UN alive. They did everything they possibly could to black people to get them ran off this land. Well, while trying to take coverage, a lot of Oscarville People ran into their church, which they set on fire. So they had to get out the church. So they headed towards Chattahoochee River with the mob on the acid. Once they got to Chattahoochee River, you only had two options. Either you face the mob, or you jump into the river and you pray that you make it. And half of those people could not swim. And according to Bird Oliver, he lost a lot of his family. His brothers, his sisters. His father had to give up 100 acres of his land. They had to run all the way to Gainesville. Yes. So let me set the record straight. 200 people is not what Lake Lanier has claimed. It's over 700 people. 500+ was Oscarville. So after claim, the town, they decided they were gonna divide it up and take the properties. The properties they didn't want, they gave to the government. The government decided they were going to flood the city. Would body still down there, not buried, not anything. Flood the city for hydroelectric power, baby. No. And this why we, as black people, should never get on this slide. Because Leclinier is going to claim. They are going to claim their bodies, and I don't want none of us to go down with it. Y'all can take as many of them as y'all want, but not us. So, black people, let's stay away from this. This spring, this summer, this is not for us, okay? It's an accessory for Lake Lanier for Oscarville residents. Enjoy.",

Let me make it clear. Let me make it clear. Israel is our ally, will always be our ally. Even if they commit war crime and they are not guilty of. And I will support Israel forever. Israel will stay your ally even though they commit. Israel. Even though. That's your term. Even when they kill 30,000 kids. That is a statistic, let me tell you a statistic. Uh huh. Yeah. Israel will exist. The Jewish state will exist. That's not a statistic. That's not over. And that is for god. Absolutely nothing to do with what we're saying. And I will always support those genocides. I will always support Israel. And you can tell the Palestinians I will never support them. I am a Palestinian myself. Then I will tell you I will never support you. I will tell you to your. And you want my. You want. You want my cousin to die? Goodbye to Palestine. Goodbye to Palestine! Goodbye to Palestine! We will support Israel forever. No. So you are comfortable with this? FYI, this guy just said goodbye to Palestine. You. So you just said goodbye to Palestine? So you are saying you are comfortable with the murder of thousands of children? The Jewish people will never suffer again under. Under Palestinian terrorism, under Hamas, Under Hezbollah, Israel will be secure forever. God bless Israel forever. Thank you for taking white Palestine off the earth. Yeah. God bless Israel forever."
