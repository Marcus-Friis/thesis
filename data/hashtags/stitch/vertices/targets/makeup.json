Why you guys always so upset? Where's the video? And I saved it because I knew that it was gonna be missing by this morning. I think the part that really behaved me was in her comments. She was like, oh, my god. Guys, I totally get it. I. No, trust me, I get. No, you don't. You don't get it. It's the fact that you walk past hundreds. Hundreds, just like y'all did in the hair store with the Maya oil. Hundreds, just like y'all did with the Juvia's place eyeshadows and the blushes and everything. Hundreds. Y'all walk past all of those brands. You were like, hmm, yeah, no, this isn't gonna work, because I need every single brand in this store to cater to me. Y'all tell us to get over it, but then we try and tell y'all to get over it. It's, no, we can't do that, so we're gonna cause an uproar. Everybody know I am Fenty down when it come to my skin, okay? 50 down. And I'm gonna ride, and I'm gonna ride this very tone. Deaf. Very. Mmm. And if it wasn't that, why is the video gone? Where did the video go? Why was the video deleted? I don't. I don't. I'm tired. I'm tired. And then you say in the video. Oh, you. That you use Rihanna, that you use Fenty skin. And this time the third. So why not use it? Why go find something that you. You. And then it. Hold on. This part right here. Um, that's clearly not. She's not white. She's albino. What about. Never mind, never mind. You go get in there. Am I tripping? Like, I don't. I don't get it. It's like, as soon as y'all are not involved, it's like, we need to write. We need to write there's no way that anything on this earth is not gonna include me. Euphoria, make sure that we never came back. Okay? My L changed their hair oil. I got both bottles, old and new. Why are we rinsing out oil after we use it? What? Because of y'all. So once again, go use all those other hundreds of brands that you have to use. Can we have one thing? Do y'all not realize that Rihanna is black now? You have these other brands? Oh, we wanted to try it on our fair skin, um, our fair skin demographic first, before we made any darker shades. So what if Rihanna was doing the same thing, except opposite? What if she wanted to try out on Us first. Before she went into detail. And make it, if y'all. Yeah, I know she black. Forget it. I quit. Maybe. Maybe the color eyes is throwing y'all off. I don't know. I don't",

You can go into Target, Walmart, Sephora, Ulta. You can even go into five fucking below, bitch, and find your shade. As in us, we have to go on a hunt, on a deep search to find shades that match her skin tone. And it's almost if what you experience for that two point 75 seconds is what we black women have been experiencing forever in the makeup community and the beauty community. We've been experiencing that forever. Now, I'm not a big makeup girly, but I do wear makeup, and it is a process trying to go to stores to find my shade. So you sitting there mad because one little brand don't have what you looking for, but 75 other brands do? Be fucking for real.",

Essentially, she's complaining that Rihanna's new foundation does not have any light enough shades for her. The black community and people with darker skin tones in general have been begging for foundations dark enough for them for years. And of course, the second Rihanna makes a foundation line that's geared towards people with darker complexions, y'all are mad. And as a person who is pale, I know I can walk in and find my foundation shade at any line in Sephora. So the fact that y'all are making a big deal out of this is so ignorant and tone deaf."

The Exorcist trilogy that David Gordon Green was making has been canceled and Mike Flanagan is swooping in, baby! I had zero faith in David Gordon Green after the absolute travesty that was Halloween ends. Then after watching Exorcist Believer, that just like, solidified that for me because it was not good. Our Lord and Savior Mike Flanagan is going to save the day. It has been officially announced that Mike Flanning it is going to write, direct, and produce the new Exorcist movie and it is just going to take place in the Exorcist universe but not be a sequel to Exorcist Believer. If you didn't know, the original plan was that David Gordon Green was going to make a trilogy, but plans changed after believer came out and got pretty negative reviews. Well, Mike Flanagan said the Exorcist is one of the reasons I became a filmmaker. You know, he is just going to put so much, like, respect and love and care into this. I always say Mike Flanagan is a horror nerd just like all of us. I don't think he does things for money or to appeal to the masses. I think he does things because he loves the genre. I personally think that Mike Flanagan is the greatest director and just one of the greatest creative minds in the horror genre right now. After seeing believer, I literally did Not give a fuck about this trilogy. I could not care less. And that's sad to me because the Exorcist is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. But this just, like, resparked my excitement. Like, I can't fucking wait.",

This is a very light peachy nude. I love this color by MAC. It's called cream the nude and I do mostly on my bottom and then just kind of blend it. I like to leave the outside a little bit more darker and then it ombre in. This is such a baddie baddie lip combo, but I was about to say baddie baddie shot of clock.

    "voice_to_text": "Please remember that plenty of people get on this app and rage bait and post outrage content simply for engagement. And that is a big way that misinformation gets spread on this app. This news story about a Douglas Barnes, four years after a white police officer murders his son pulling out an AK whatever at that police office. There's daughter's prom and riddling the daughter with bullets. And there's no other news towards other than the real Dax dot news. These AI photos. There's nobody from either side of the community. No local news, no community news, nobody sharing this story. This is fake. It's very obviously fake. You click on the con, the account, and all they do is post AI pictures with outlandish rage baiting stories. And I've seen several people, several accounts re share this story. But a simple Google search, there's no court documents, there's no news stories, there's no social media post outside of people reposting this story from the real Dax Dot news. Outrage baiting. And honestly, we have to be very cautious of this in United States. It is a election year. Stuff like this might seem like, oh, just rage baiting, just for engagement, just for revenue. But watch, these stories have more of a political change the closer we get to November. They're meant to do damage to a community. Be wary and please invest in a little bit of media literacy.",

Cause every clip I've seen of her hitting on a guy, they've always been white. Like Zach Liberty. She's always flirting with him. Um, and then I saw another post where her and some other white boy, where they're, like, doing a little TikTok. I'm starting to think, like, I'm. I'm not one.

Next, this video, this base right here. Immaculate. I remember waking up at like 4:00am to do this video to do my makeup before I went to this race. Long story. It was all going good until that yellow. Like, I don't know why that yellow was so patchy. There's many reasons a look wouldn't get posted. Maybe, you know, I got to the ends, I didn't like the look, or I got to the end and I forgot to record the last moment. Or I got to the end and something was a mess. This was a mess from the start. This is a look I did for my 75 hard YouTube video, and it hit for that, you know, I was trying to go a little bit fresher, a little bit more no makeup. Makeup. But it wasn't getting posted on its own. No makeup. Makeup is so hard, cause I'd be like, putting it on. This is my look for the Renaissance tour. And honestly, there is nothing wrong with the look. I just hated how my hair looked at the ends. Like, That's literally it. It gets real meticulous around here. And I can keep going. Look at all those dress",

Like, men are trying to see how you look. They ain't on none of that stuff that we be doing. They don't want you to get no wax. They don't want you to wear no makeup. They don't want you to wear no lashes. And at this point, man, I owe the man an apology. Men are really out here. Just really want to appreciate just how you look. You get what I'm saying? You feel me? But i'mma have to defend the women on this one, because we thought that y'all liked all it. Then I had to realize it. Dudes don't really be stepping to me. Not that they don't think I'm cute when I be fixed up, but it's like when I don't have nothing on, when I be, like, bald, nothing, maybe right there. And I'll be like, man, this dude lie. Like, he got to be. He capping. Then girls be trying to talk to me when I have on makeup. So I'm like, women, when we be putting on all that stuff, we Must be doing it for women. we must be doing it to meet the beauty standards of another woman. Women try to talk about women who don't have on makeup, but dudes really looking for women who don't have on makeup. And when I say makeup, I'm talking, like, the BBL audit. Dudes really don't be on it. For real. They really just don't. You get what I'm saying? So, ladies, I'm just letting you know, man. Hey, big dog, it ain't gonna be none. You listen.",

    "voice_to_text": "So I had a bridal trial today, and one of the questions that I always ask during a consultation is if you ever had your makeup done before, have you ever been in a wedding, etc. And she was telling me that she was recently in a wedding where a makeup artist here in Saint Louis made her feel like she was so ugly and horrible. She said that this artist in particular was, like, making her and all the bridesmaids feel really dumb for, like, spray tan their face, which I know that does make a foundation match harder, but if you're a makeup artist and you understand color theory, you should be able to work with anyone regardless. And then on top of that, she was telling my client that her eyelash extensions were ugly, and she hated them. Um, which sometimes eyelash extensions are hard to work with. But again, you're the professional. You should be able to handle that. Um, and then she told another bridesmaid that her lips were weird and another one that the makeup just didn't look good because she had too many wrinkles. We work in the beauty industry. If someone gets out of your chair and they feel worse about themselves than when they sat down, you should quit. And when these instances do happen, I like to know, you know, who it is, you know, especially if it's someone local. Because we're so busy, we send recommendations all the time. To other artists whose work that we love. And I just want to know, like, we see their work, we don't see the way that they interact with clients. So it's good to know these things about people so that we can feel comfortable recommending them. Um, in the icing on the cake was that she said this person was talking negatively about our team. Um, which. I mean, we're in the beauty industry. I think sometimes, you know, people just wanna talk. But, you know, we've had artists on our list that we recommend when we're booked that we've had to take off for that same thing. Like, you know, we heard from other clients that they were in a bridal party, and they were speaking negatively about us, and we're like, okay, well. And we're not sending you any business, you know, so I just feel like it's. It's a weird energy to be mean to your clients. It's also a weird energy to talk badly about other makeup artists in front of your clients. So stop that."

Could it be print or would it be online only? #makeup #fashion #fashionhistory #beauty #blackfashion #fashiontiktok #magazine #fashioncommentary #beautytok  ",
    "voice_to_text": "What if I told you that the best black fashion magazine ever created was a publication that hardly anyone got to see? Suede magazine was a joint venture between essence magazine and Time, Inc. And it launched in 2004 with a focus on luxurious fashion for women of color. However, it did not last very long. The first cover, which came out in September 2,004, featured Alicia Keys, the second cover saw Eve, the third was Zoe Saldana, and the fourth and final cover featured Tyra Banks. As well as these glamorous, well known names on the covers, the brands throughout were luxurious Chanel, YSL, Valentino, Elie, Saab, and throughout the magazine there were these beautiful illustrations and detailed editorials crafted by creative director Richard Christensen. The rest of the team included Suzanne Boyd as editor, Ying Chu as beauty director, Ian Hilton as editor at large, and Agnes Kamak as fashion, market, news and trends director. I was recently reminded of suede magazine's existence when I chatted to Andrea Lewis, the creator of the Netflix documentary series The Black Beauty Effect. It was supposed to be Essence's Millennial Girl magazine. It was four girl millennial millennial girls that were young at the time. The black millennial girl deserves see herself on this really luxe level, deserves to see herself on this really creative level. So we're gonna create this magazine. At the time, suede magazine was described as a multicultural woman's fashion glossy, and others described it as a Black take on Harper's Bazaar. Even Time, Inc's editor in chief at the time, Norman Perlstein, said that suede was, quote, one of the freshest, most exciting magazines to come out in years. So what happened? At the time, there were rumors that essence was intimidated by the sheer sales that suede was making. But I think a far more likely explanation would be that the sales were low. It's really hard to launch a new title, and advertisers were promised a guaranteed circulation of 250,000. However, essence never revealed the actual new stand sales, given the fact they already had 40 people on the team. I just think money ran out, and it is a huge shame. Before I go, let me read you the manifesto that went out in the very first issue of Suede. Style is in our DNA, and we, the multi culti urbanistas, stand at a new intersection of street and chic. Our dial is tuned to the catwalk and the corner. We are fashion crazy. We come from the culture on the come up and use fashion to amplify who we are. We revel in the entire spectrum of black beauty and love the skin we're in. Feel it. Let me know. Do you know suede?",

I'm not cheap, but I'm also not delusional. $18 for a bronzer? That's not affordable. Twenty something dollars for a foundation? That ain't affordable. I say all this to say remember the days of foundation in the drugstore was like, $10. A bronzer would be five, pencil would be two. So I don't know if those days have just shipped and sailed and sunk, but I have hope. Any recommendations? Brand products? Let me know, because I'm not giving up on this tutorial. $18 for a bronzer?

How you do that is you post a minute long video. Sorry, there's traffic. The viewer has to watch the video for at least 5 seconds, which by now you have already done. Thank you for your contribution. I do have lots of debt, but basically, by engaging, the TikTok Creator Fund is paying you per view. No wonder the government wants to shut down TikTok. They want to keep us down. Keep us slaves to this economy. Well, not anymore. We got 10 seconds left. What would you like to see me do? Maybe I'll just show you around. Thank you for joining. Thank you for watching. I hope you engage and engage in other creators as well. And let's get rid of our debt. Love you guys.",

Will start showing you among different skin tones. Will start showing you, you know, lip oils with glitter, sparkles in there and You know, reflex and do you like them? Should we develop them? What flavoured are they screaming to? Will start showing you the mold process and, like, really documenting what goes into owning a business, especially cosmetics business that's growing so fast. And you guys were part of product development. You're my product development team. Welcome on board. It's a fun part of what I do. And I think you guys will be really interested in, like, compliance, because, like, neon is banned. And just knowing that type of insight as to why we can't develop. And then lastly, a part of being on my product development team, I will send out, like, 100 of that product that we then begin to create. From the original video. Who commented and interacted. So 100 people get what we created together for free, which I just think is so much fun. I hope you enjoy the concepts and the idea. Like, TikTok made me buy it. TikTok made me make it. I don't know any other cosmetic company that is. Yes, they might take feedback on board, and they might take comments on board and take that into product development meetings, but they're not exactly taking you on the journey on how it's made. And they're not allowing you to have import, IE, add more glitter. Okay, but can it contain this ingredient? Okay, I love it, but can we add this into it? Yeah, let's do it. I'm down. Let me Know, if you down and you want to be a part of this product development, TikTok made me buy it.",

    "voice_to_text": "You need to throw these away immediately. If you are using makeup wipes to take off your makeup, you need to stop, and let me tell you why. Disclaimer I am a licensed esthetician, so I know what I'm talking about. So not only do these not remove your makeup completely, it also disrupts your acid mantle, which is the protective layer of your skin, which keeps all the good things in and the bad things out. When you're wiping the skin over and over and over, that is considered tugging, and when you tug at the skin, it causes premature aging. Also disrupt your pH balance of your skin, and they can also cause micro tears in your skin. And the naked eye can't spot micro tears, but if you look under a microscope, you can see tiny tears in your skin. A majority of makeup wipes do contain alcohol, which is very stripping to the skin's barrier, and you will not be able to maintain a healthy barrier if you're gonna continue to put alcohol on your face. Especially if you're using this on your eyes to remove eye makeup, that is one of the worst places that you can use this on. The skin around the eye area is the most delicate and thinnest. When you're tugging and wiping and irritating, it most definitely will be causing premature wrinkles. Instead of this, use something like this. Micellar water is one of the best ways to remove makeup. It is very gentle and it's not gonna irritate the skin. My favorite right now is this Fenty Skin Jelly Oil Makeup Melting Cleanser. This works so well at removing the makeup and it's very, very gentle. As you can see, I used half the bottle already. One of my most favourite makeup cleansing balms to ever exist is this one by versed. You can get this at target. So bye bye to this, hello to this.",

How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school. What converts to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Homemaker.",

I work with teenage girls, and unfortunately, a lot of them have odors, have, you know, don't have the best smell, and I think having that conversation is very uncomfortable. Number one and number two, knowing that a lot of information is like, oh, my god, I never knew that. Like, they were never taught that or never talking about this stuff. And what I realize, especially in a black community, amongst black mothers and daughters, a lot of black mothers either don't know how to had a conversation, are too afraid to have the conversation, um, don't know enough information to have the conversation with. They were not taught themselves. So it becomes this thing where, like, when, when young girls are growing up, just thinking about just feminine hygiene, like, not having anything to do with sex. In a black community, for some reason, I believe black mothers believing we talk about that stuff is gonna lead to sex. And that's not the case. There are girls out here who are, have odors, who are not wiping themselves properly, wash themselves properly, just taking care of their bodies, and then they're out here being sexually active at the same time, and that combination is not good at all. So I think it's so important that we have to be comfortable with our children to have these conversations even before they hit puberty, to let them know about their Bodies don't be afraid to talk to your daughters. Like, find out the information if you don't know. But we. We had to do better for our girls",

    "voice_to_text": "Lazy Girl's Guide to Boyfriend Blush  only takes five products in five minutes let's do it together  for this easy lazy girl boyfriend blush look it's gonna be five products that's all you need five products two of them are blushes so really can't even really count that I'm gonna start with some concealer because just gonna even out a little bit of my skin tone it's gonna make me look a little bit more awake but you don't have to do anything crazy okay I'm going to conceal my under eyes because my darkest part is here in the hollow even that out and then I have a little bit of discoloration on my top lip now I did start with a moisturizer because I don't want my blush to stick to any little textured or dry parts of my skin I want it to look nice and seamless so just do this like I said you can do it with your finger for extra blendability and extra laziness so don't worry don't have to be precise this is a lived in gorgeous natural look you're gonna look natural we call this bus makeup because everyone takes the bus or the train to get into work so this is bus or train makeup you can just throw it on while you're on the bus alright so we're gonna take a cream blush whatever cream blush you want I'm taking the Bobby Brown Bobby Brown Pot rouge for lips and cheeks in the colour Rose Supernatural I'm gonna apply in a boyfriend style for me and my Oblong face you can also do this for oval face as well I'm going to apply it towards the back of my ear like going towards my ear and then just filling up this area I'm not gonna go any closer than this because my face is already long so I don't wanna pull my face down I don't want my face to be drooping down here okay so I'm gonna leave it like this I'm also gonna take some here because I'm not wearing bronzer I'm not wearing anything else so I wanna add some flush to the rest of my skin natural come over to the other side still using rose but I just wanna even myself out a little bit right going towards the back these blushes any cream blushes most of them pretty pigmented so you don't need too too much but you know you can build it if you want so you can place a little bit more in there and start to blend up you can absolutely blend these any cream blushes with your fingertips but I always use a brush just because it's just easier for me it gives me more of an even finish I feel like my fingers sometimes make them look a little bit blotchy and you don't wanna look blotchy you just wanna look sun kissed and flushed okay this makeup is actually perfect for school if you're going to class um work if you don't normally wear a lot of makeup to work this is great it's easy 5 minutes in the morning and it's also just great for you know weekends you're just running errands you're just going on a picnic or you're just doing some chillaxing throw this on throw this on it takes one minute I hope this lighting isn't too bad for you guys because I can't really see much to be honest with you can't really see much in this light but that's okay this is mid day light this is what I get okay so I'm just pulling it down and out not going any further alright so I'm keeping this area blank and still nice and bright too because I did put that concealer here I didn't put anything on my nose so my nose is still a natural color my face is still a natural color look at that let me make sure it's just even for you folks stunning stunning alright now we're gonna take powder blush I'm gonna use or a pink it's a very natural flush very easy to use product No. 3 now I chose these specific colours because I wanna wear more of a pinky lip like a lip balm so I don't wanna look red on the cheeks Pinky Mavi on the lips I don't know I did that the other day and it just fell off to me but whatever anyways you don't have to put a powder blush on top you really don't but I'm using this for two things I'm gonna put this on my eyes as well so you can just throw it on like this also I just feel like it just keeps the cream blush on much longer so if you just pop a little bit on do you see still look super natural but it just clings to that flush of the cream blush thank you you can put some on your forehead as well you just look nice and still luminous but you don't look tacky like wet tacky you know what I mean alright then I don't have any clean eyeshadow brushes one second one second these colours are subjective use whatever colours are best for you alright I'm using this blush on my eyes because I always do that anyways when I'm just blending in my eyeshadow always put blush on my eyes whatever blush I'm wearing on my face it's going on my eyes as well also I'm not doing anything to my eyebrows because this is a lazy girl day this is a I'm not looking too uh put together type of makeup okay this is just you throw it on and this is what you get and everyone's like oh my God you look so nice today oh my God you look so natural thank you alright let's take a lip this is the 4th product right alright lip balm tinted Lip Balm Easy could have even used this as your cream blush but I didn't it's okay now mascara lip balm is on excuse the lighting this is what happens when you have deep set eyes and you get some light here makes your eyes look super dark and sunken anyways doesn't matter doesn't matter cause we're nearly done take some mascara pop it on you can do just top lashes or you can do top and bottom some people they just like to do top anyways regardless because you guys say that on the bottom it just smudges too much which I totally get and especially if you're just doing a nice natural look boom top lashes easy easy peasy nothing crazy here no precision no stress no fussing around just throw it on and don't worry about it you're gonna look amazing it's a natural flush it's a natural colour on your skin it looks natural feels natural you're not feeling like you're somebody else you look like yourself but enhanced that was it that's it that's all you need five products so we had two blushes maybe unnecessary one lip balm one concealer and one mascara that was it to get a flawless beautiful boyfriend blush but also just a flawless face in general just to enhance your natural beauty you don't need something that's too much you don't even have to wear foundation if you don't want to that's a myth and I wasn't even wearing bronzer if you wanna wear bronzer if you wanna swap out one of the blushes for a bronzer because you just like wearing bronzer I also love wearing bronzer but that's a great way to give yourself a little bit more of a bronze look instead of just being so flushed maybe you don't like looking so pink amazing alternative anyways oh there we go it's a little bit better okay so I really hope that you enjoyed this look if you try it please let me know tell me what you're using tell me what I should be using just yeah let me know hope you enjoy bye",

I've been perfecting this routine for years now. First, you're gonna curl your lashes at the base. You're gonna curl them longer than you think you need to. move the curling wand up a little bit to the mids of the lashes and do the same thing. Move it up again and just curl the tips a little. Okay, lashes are curled. Now, this is very important. You want a mascara that isn't too wet. I'm using one from Charlotte Tilbury, but also Covergirl Clump Crusher. The green bottle is really good. Waterproof mascaras are also good. Now, you wanna start applying mascara on the tips of the lashes, and you're going from behind. This isn't gonna weigh your lashes down, and it'll help preserve the curl. And then I'll apply it normally, but just the tiniest amount. And that's it. I promise this curl is gonna last all day.

This is Queen Silver Glitter spray by a brand called Eva NYC and it's incredible! On the day of MET, I applied Liquid Highlight on Sydney's Declatage, gave the bottle a good shake, and sprayed an even layer all over her arms and chest. It's buildable, super easy to use, and the sparkle is magical on the face. I made a custom glitter mix and lightly spritz it onto Sydney's face, making sure to be mindful of the eye area. I followed with a quick Passover of Queen Silver glitter spray just to lock everything in place and voila! Can you even believe the sparkle? It looks like floating diamonds on the skin! I hope you found this helpful! Thanks for watching! If you decide to recreate the look, please tag me. I wanna see your looks!",

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

    "voice_to_text": "Jackie Anna said to use your chest to shade batch, so that's what I'm gonna do. I have been searching for the perfect foundation shade, and everyone said to match it to my neck, but then I saw this video. Your neck may be significantly darker than your face, so I don't think it's productive to shade match. Here I go for the center of the chest, I get the best match, so I decided I'm going to do the same. I started with my current foundation, which is the makeup by Mario, and to me, this was a really good match. Next up was my favorite tinted moisturizer by color pop, and I didn't expect this to be so red. I don't remember it being the shade, so makeup by Mario was still in the lead. Next was the Fenty eavesdrops, and this is another one that I did not expect to look dark against my chest. I feel like it doesn't look that stark when I wear it. But anyway, this is my most recent foundation purchase. It's by Maybelline, and once again, I thought this one looked really good on my face. Obviously, my chest is a little lighter, and then, of course, I have the Basma Beauty Foundations. I feel like I've seen that so many people be able to find their perfect match with this foundation, so I got a couple shades to try. That one wasn't it? This next one was shade 0 0 9, and I swear this was one of the best ones. And I decided to do a face wash with this one. And look at the material. You can hardly see it. And I have a beauty Mark on my other cheek, so I wanted to see if it would cover it, and it definitely did. It's giving eraser. Then I wanted to try the other shade, which was a bit darker. I also feel like this one looked good, too. It's definitely deeper and warmer, but I feel like if I mix them, it would be my perfect shape. Do you match to your chest, your neck, or your face? Let me know.",

    "voice_to_text": "The oil and gas industry is profiting by setting off explosions in one of the world's biological hotspots. This is called seismic airgun surveying, and it's used to search the ocean for oil. A single ship can blast every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for months on end. The air guns are like mini cannons and the blast can exceed 235 decibels, which is hundreds of times more intense than a jet engine. A marine mammal in the vicinity would be deafened. Most of this is happening in the Gulf of Mexico, home to some of the world's most endangered species. The blasts can inflict permanent, even fatal, hearing damage on whales, dolphins, even affect the plankton that's the foundation of the ocean food web. The sound waves can be heard across the entire Gulf. This near constant level of noise can mask vital calls that marine mammals depend on to survive. The Biden administration has a chance to reign in this harmful activity. Unfortunately, it issued a new rule that would still allow extensive seismic testing in the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental law organization Earthjustice is asking the administration to change course and correct the rule, so that it protects Gulf wildlife from seismic air gun surveys.

This is the way to do it. So I did my full makeup, full beat, everything the way I would normally do it. But I didn't put anything on my eyes. So I am just gonna finish this off with a little gloss. Because it's complexion no eyes. It's not complexion, no eyes and no lips. I'm just gonna go ahead and put a lighter color of lip liner than I normally would wear. I like to go with those rich brown. Then I'm gonna go with a little fulfilling gloss. I'm just gonna use this honey color. It's so pretty. It's like for your nude lovers. And I just go ahead a little on the middle. This is the final look, complexion no eyes. I literally love this. It's so glamorous, it's so clean, but it's really, really soft. It still gives you, like, a nice, natural look, which I love.

Yeah, she's outside, and her kids are finding out how traumatizing a foster home can be. This was her second post. So this is exhibit B. Um, I just wanna clock in and get some money. She did mention that she was dropping the kids off because she had no help and she's in college, but she didn't mention the then go shake some ass part. She then made a post to make sure that we all knew that she really don't give a f. In case anyone of you were wondering if she cared, it's Definitely giving manic episode. So obviously she's posting a lot and frequently on her Facebook page, so I'll keep you guys updated. This is another video that I found on her page, and it's basically just her telling the dads of the kids that they're at CPS and if they want them to come and get them because she's about to give them to CPS. So that's. This video was at the firehouse for two hours, but we're here at Children's Services now. If there's any family out there on my case, dad's side. I don't have nobody's contact information.

    "voice_to_text": "yes you can see the listing for my new Beauty Blender you guys are ridiculous okay reading through the comments on that are just absolutely nuts this is obviously a freaking beauty blender people wanna take it somewhere that it's not it's just like nuts like this is a safe space sure it looks a little bit like a freaking squid or something but jeez you guys are nuts here is the top part where talks about the tongue shaped applicator flames how the shape of this is because it gives a wider distribution and like see how that can fit into the corners of your face like it just fits a larger surface area and the texture is for blending so it actually blends and smooths things out a lot better um it's very flexible it's very durable but it's also very hygienic because you can wash this each and every time so it's not getting a build up of bacteria and all of that so you're less likely to get breakouts is your money in the long run cause you don't have to buy 50 million of them they are in fact a beauty blender that is legitimately what they are so I just think some of you need to get your head out of the gutter",

It seems like guys can just put the bare minimum and not even really put an effort anymore. They don't really care to, but they're like, why don't girls just go and make the first move and make the effort? Couple of things. In 2024, last thing any guy wants to get called is a creep. Men ain't approaching no more. And I understand them. I'm married. I don't have to deal with that bullshit. Jesus Christ. Secondly, social media has done you guys in. We keeping it above women own dating in the sexual marketplace, but y'all let social media trick y'all into handing that shit over to men. A very specific type of man. Mr. Tall, dark, handsome, rich, all that. Now all y'all think y'all deserve that man because you see so many of them on social media. I know how much money I make. I'm 30 now. I got it. And I know how much money the average man makes. I know how much money I made when I was 21. It was nothing compared to now. So, like, the average 21 year old is competing with guys who have money like me. He'll never, ever win. As a matter of fact, the guys who have money, the guys who are tall, the guys who are attractive, guys who Women want to be around. It's probably like 5% of men. That's who y'all are chasing. The regular guys will chase you. You just don't like the regular guys because you feel as if you're an extraordinary woman, which you probably are. Okay, okay. But realistically, y'all disqualify so many men who would break their necks to take a sip of your bath water because your standards are up here, which is fine. Have your standards, but don't get on TikTok asking dumbass questions like that. It's not that men don't chase, right? Especially once there's mutual exchange, like, hey, I like you, you like me. Let's do this thing. Regular guys will still trade. Chase you. The guys who have women flowing into their inbox. Why would he chase you? There are 50 of you in his inbox. Why would he chase you?"

    "voice_to_text": "There needs to be a study on why Serena Williams always looks a goddamn mess. I ain't gonna give her too much cause we know Serena Williams has experienced a lot of colorism and anti blackness throughout her career. But me saying that she looks a goddamn mess is not rooted in colorism and misogyny. While it may not be constructive, it is a valid critique. It's really the wigs that do it for me. The wigs are always dry. They never really compliment her skin tone. Her makeup always looks too damn light for her face. Plastic surgery is unrecognizable. She got these damn fillers in her face, got her looking like phaser parks. Her wardrobe is always ill fitted. She never wears anything that compliments her body. I'm tired of it. Almost positive that she has non black people styling her. The people who are styling her do not know how to style dark skin black women. It's a fact. And then it's like, you're rich, Serena, you got way too much fucking money to be out here looking like this. You gotta represent. You gotta represent for the dark skinned girlies. You've been looking a mess for the last 20 years and I'm fucking tired of it. I want her to take that goddamn blonde hair out of her head. You're not. Beyonce is not giving. Want her to go back to her roots and start wearing natural hairstyles, start wearing braids. Not meant you ain't got To wear the beaded braids, but start wearing more braided and more like natural hairstyles. I think that will compliment you a lot more. Choose to get a black stylist, preferably a black gay male stylist. And stop trying to look like a white woman. It just. I'm sorry."

I can't do the whole put the dots on and then blend in one go. No, I need my time blending out the. Okay, she's gonna be a clown today. Two dots of the orange. Oh. Um, I'm worrying. Yep. Definitely recommend doing this before concealer so that it's, like, nicely blended in. Once you're done, hopefully then the liquid. Hello. Okay. I don't know how she did this all in one go. I need my time to blend out, like, step by step. Um, she needs a little work. I'm gonna apply a bit more concealer and then finish the way. I really did not trust the process and almost gave up, but this is. This is a vibe. It's so 80s, but modern. And then the gold highlighter really tops it off. Like, are you kidding me?

There's just a couple requirements, but first my brand is gonna be called Secret Scoops because my name on TikTok is Emma. Secrets and figure scoops. It's cute. My color schemes can be very bright and happy. Kind of like preppy if you wanna call it that. None of the stuff in the secret scoops are gonna be ugly. It's all cute. It's gonna offer things like claw clips, bracelets, stickers, pop. Its like just little things like that. Basically the only requirement for receiving PR is to make a video about it. Essentially. I'm not trying to make my brand blow up cause I would like to kind of keep it in the smaller side which is like not what most people want, but it's kind of what I want. I would hate being overwhelmed with a stress of like all the package that would have to ship out. It's just too stressful. But the money! Just kidding, I don't care much about the money. I'm gonna make my products pretty cheap. Like a five dollar mystery scoop will consist of three items and a five dollar mystery scoop will be like maybe seven or eight dollars. It'll vary. I still have to figure out the logistics of it, but let me know if you're interested.",

We're moisturized, and I'm also going to use some primer this time. We also have a damp beauty blender now and a properly colored, matched foundation from Sephora. I don't think I can do worse. But, yeah, I had a very lovely experience at Sephora, and the experience kind of just made me question all of human existence. You know, it's fairly big topic, so I probably won't get to all of it today. Because it really made me think about, like, if I go into a store like Best Buy, I'll go in and I generally know exactly what I'm looking for, but it's not uncommon for an employee to come up to me and just assume that I don't know anything and just start explaining stuff that I don't care about or that I already know. But at Sephora, I walked in, probably looked terrified. The employees still ask me if I'm looking for a Dewey or Matt finish or something with my foundation, and I. I don't know what that means, but there's something refreshing about starting off by assuming that other people have some level of competence. And means the difference between, like, I want to get out of here as soon as possible and I feel comfortable asking questions and, like, I can actually learn something here. And it goes the other Way in customer service, too. Like, the customer is always right. No, no, they're definitely not. Blend, blend it, blend it. I feel like as I was reading all these tips, I was getting, like, very confident. Like, oh, yeah, this is gonna be. It's gonna be so easy now that I know all these tips. But now that I'm trying it again, I'm like, I don't remember anything. I actually watched a tutorial on this, so I have high hopes. My hopes are already a little broken. Hold on, I'm gonna go check in the mirror. Look, do I feel like I aced it? No, no. And then she used a smudge brush. I don't know what that means, but I have a brush. And do be smudging. Haha. Look, baby steps. I'm just the little guy. Okay, cool. Another tip that I remember is that I can somehow put this under my eyelashes and then blink. See, the problem is, I blink and then I can no longer see what I'm doing. I got it. This time we want to not cross the bridge of the nose, and now we hopefully pull it all together again. How does the wig do it? I'm gonna go listen to some Shania Twain and get ready to fight the patriarchy.",

I am so savvy and business smart, and I see products on here and I'll buy them, and then I'll think that they're not great, and then I'll see somebody talking about them and I blame myself, oh, I was wrong, like, they are great, because I just saw that video. This is patchy. And then I'll buy it again, and then someone will say, oh, you have to do it like this or you have to do it like that. We're not stupid. I mean, I'm not a makeup artist, but basically we want things to be user friendly and just good. And there is a difference between good and bad. And I can't tell you how much lying I'm seeing on here, by the way. It's okay to get paid, it's okay to do commercials, it's okay to partner. What's not okay is like the full scam of just bullshitting people. And I think people are really getting sick of it. I don't know. I know that I am, because I don't trust anything I see anymore. I don't trust what to buy, cause I've spent so much money, like thousands of dollars, buying things that I had no business buying just because it looked so good on here. And that's really, really irritating. So you gotta be more savvy, because unlike television, you know, you. You probably are on here longer than TV. And on TV, you're not always being Advertised anymore. Because you're not my DVR or something else here. It's just like a full fledged commercial network and you've no idea the difference. And I would say air on the side of your being bullshit. God, I'm so annoyed. I'm thinking very specific examples of, like, shit that I just believed and then bought. And I'm like, so annoyed because I know you're doing it too, and you're spending money you don't have and so much lying. So a correction is coming. I can just tell that type of stuff I do now.

    "voice_to_text": "Very serious question for the audience. Do you guys think that I'm genuinely wearing pink mascara and blue eyeliner for a man? Because I had a dream that I had a cotton candy eye look on, so I woke up and recreated that makeup look. But every day, I feel like I'm fighting both within myself and then also with others to try and convince them that this is my artistic outlet. It's really discouraging, especially when a lot of the feminist accounts that I follow for really against makeup for very obvious reasons, but, like, why can't we view makeup more as, like, actual art instead of necessary for one's appearance? Probably gonna get comments disagreeing, as always, but I know makeup was created by men for men, for women to use. If women can never reclaim that back from men, use it and wear it, and state that they're wearing it for themselves. If they're not allowed to even do that, what's the entire point? I think people view activities as more of things that you're doing that aren't actually directly related to you. So, like, playing tennis or playing chess or reading a book. Doing makeup is seen as inherently vain, not only because it has to do with someone's appearance, but also because it is for women. But the industry, the actual makeup itself, has all been developed by men.",

to share with you but after Liana filmed this video she actually suffered a brain hemorrhage basically we had been working on this video together to shout out her business and give promo codes to my followers because she was going to get this really intense brain surgery and she wasn't gonna be able to work for a while last July she was experiencing some weird hearing problems and it turned out to be a large tumor and this was supposed to be you know a pretty serious procedure but it ended up going not very well and she had this brain hemorrhage and it's fucking horrible cause they had to remove such a large tumor there was a lot of swelling and blood luckily they were able to save her life but she's in pretty rough shape right now she's currently on a breathing tube and has blood in her brain that has not been able to be absorbed so she's on a ton of medications I'm you know blessed with this amazing audience of people that wanna help people and like this is the opportunity to do that so I'm gonna play the rest of her update video so you can see just how much of an amazing person she is I've known her since 6th grade the link to donate to Liana's medical expenses are in my bio and if you don't have money to donate which is totally understandable commenting on this video sharing it with somebody liking the video all that engagement will ramp up the video and algorithm and it will find more people who can donate and it will also pay me for the video so any money I make from this video will be directly donated to Liana including a contribution of my own she's a really good and kind person as you'll see in the video so I just really hope that she gets the support she needs and she pulls through this thank you so much as always and yeah I love you guys yeah makeup art about two years after high school after working as a full time system manager at a retail establishment I was kind of had enough of it and I was like I save up enough money to go to makeup artistry school and get a certification so I said you know what let me just do that now so I did that and then I was looking for jobs in the field and I was already assistant manager of a major establishment so I was making really good money especially compared to what the minimum wage was then so I'd really didn't feel comfortable going and hitting minimum wage and then just making commission because the other only other businesses that were willing to hire like a fresh makeup artist weren't fully established places so I have to work on like a counter at least that's what I was able to find at the time and that's like kind of like the deal to work at a counter make minimum wage you get commission and I just don't like pushing products on people and things like that especially makeup I think it's beautiful but I just don't think everyone you need to have makeup you need to have it so I was like you know what I'll just keep working as assistant manager and see how things go fast forward 2020 I quit that job after I found another job managing a flower shop so I've been enjoying that for a long time but something just was never right I was like you know what this is still not it so in 2023 I went to aesthetic school and I became a licensed institution in the state of Connecticut I graduated in December 2023 I've been professionally doing skin and brows and waxing tinting stains all that kind of fun modalities like microdermabrasion I do hydrodermabrasion soon things like that for the last about five months so I've been really enjoying it I rent a suite out of Orange Connecticut within Ria Aesthetic Lounge unfortunately I will have to close down for a short amount of time maybe two to three months I have to have a major medical procedure um and recovery times different for everybody but I'm just gonna take a you know short break get that done recover and then I'm come back with some new services um and more hours I'm gonna be opening for more hours once I come back I'm just really looking forward to it so but feel free to take that and check out my page see what I've got going on message me with any questions I have a really good professional skincare line here that I really trust uh it's called Hale and Hush you'll see me post about it on my page um other than that I've been doing pretty good I'm really enjoying this I think this is more of my passion I loved makeup but it just didn't feel right I was like I know people are making them happy by making them feel pretty but it didn't feel like enough and I've always been into skincare myself I never like to wear a lot of makeup I love to do it on myself but I didn't like to wear it all the time like I don't wanna wear skin makeup until my skin looked good because I wanted the makeup to sit nicely on it and that's one of the common misconceptions I don't think I need a primer primer primer for makeup to look good on their skin but we really need is good skin care and good skin prep so that's a really important thing that a lot of people don't know and they're wondering why the makeup doesn't look good let's go to your skincare is the most important part if not you don't need to waste money on expensive primer just get some nice skin care products and you'll be good to go well thank you so much for being interested in what I'm doing now and that's all I have for you if you have any other questions feel free to message me thank you so much nice seeing you all"

We're gonna conceal with the Too Faced born this way concealer. Okay, now my nose is big. Not contour my nose. Girl, that ship has sailed. Yes! Say the shit with your chest. Now we're going to use my real techniques deluxe crease brush. I just poke be I don't drag, and. Oh, my gosh, yes. Now I'm gonna go in with my Huda Beauty Cinnamon bun under my eye.

Like, my under eyes is not as bright as I would like it to. I'm gonna go back with my foundation brush. I'm gonna get a brush like this can have some. I'm gonna take my cream contour palette, the darkest. For wondering. I got this brush set from the TikTok Shop. My favorite part as a girl is blush. You guys are always asking what blush I use. I use this Juvia's placed Festival palette. Just go in between these three colors, and right at the highest point of my face. The my lips, I actually like to use an angled brush with this Milani Gilded Mini Palette. Purple Eyeshadow. That's, like, really deep lip liner to deepen the side. The next butter gloss on my lips, I'm creme brulee finishing touches. The next setting spray. Smells so good. And, you guys, this is it. This is the finished look. The my everyday makeup look.

    "voice_to_text": "Should be a crime, this is what we get when we ask to be included in the beauty Industry. 1 marque de maquillage aux \u00c9tats-Unis cr\u00e9e la pol\u00e9mique apr\u00e8s avoir mis en vente 1 fond de teint de couleur noir. On vous explique, wesh \u00e7a, de ma face is the black face paint or The Euphoria foundation tee. You can't tell you know why tar in a bottle. Cette vid\u00e9o a \u00e9t\u00e9 vue plus de 11,6000000 de fois en moins de 24h. On y voit 1 influenceuse beaut\u00e9 tester 1 nouvelle couleur de fond de teint d'une marque de cosm\u00e9tique et celle-ci s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre aussi noire que de la peinture noire, c'est-\u00e0-dire pas du tout adapt\u00e9 aux peaux, m\u00eame les plus fonc\u00e9s. When we say that we want you, guys, to make Shades pour Us, we don't mean to go to the Lab and ask for menstruel Black. J'ai trop r\u00e9alis\u00e9 that some people think dark skin people like really Deep dark skin people are Black. C'est pas la 1\u00e8re fois que cette marque est \u00e9pingl\u00e9 par les utilisateurs pour ne pas \u00eatre assez inclusive. En octobre, elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sorti 1 gamme de fond de teint dont la couleur la plus fonc\u00e9e \u00e9tait loin d'\u00eatre adapt\u00e9e au pot r\u00e9ellement fonc\u00e9. Alors pour rattraper le coup, la marque a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de sortir 10 nouvelles teintes, dont celle qui fait pol\u00e9mique aujourd'hui. Jusqu'ici, la marque n'a pas r\u00e9agi officiellement, mais la cr\u00e9atrice a post\u00e9 1 vid\u00e9o la semaine avant le lancement. Affirment qu'elle avait du mal \u00e0 trouver des mod\u00e8les qui correspondaient \u00e0 la teinte la plus fonc\u00e9e de la marque. Loin d'\u00eatre anecdotique, cette pol\u00e9mique rappelle le manque d'inclusivit\u00e9 de certaines marques de produits de beaut\u00e9. En deux-mille-dix-sept, la chanteuse Rihanna avec sa marque, a bouscul\u00e9 l'industrie du maquillage en faisant la promotion de 50 nouvelles teintes de fond de teintes diff\u00e9rentes. Depuis, d'autres entreprises se sont align\u00e9s, mais il reste difficile pour les personnes noires de trouver du maquillage adapt\u00e9 dans toutes les marques de cosm\u00e9tiques. Toutes les marques de cosm\u00e9tiques."

Urban Decay  Pocket Rocket  lip glosses these were launched  in 2009 they were lip glosses with  lenticular images of men that when you moved  the lip gloss their clothes vanished they were also all  named men's names the packaging was flat  so you could fit them  in your pocket hence the name and I just really liked  the packaging I thought the flat packaging  was so fun and unique and apparently the  packaging had  pheromones on them? in them? I- to \u201cenhance mood  and attraction\u201d whatever-  whatever  that really means I think they were only  around for a year or so and do you remember  when Urban Decay  single shadows  looked like this and they had a different  design on every color so fun!  Mac Tendertones  were wildly popular these were launched  first in May of 2007 they were a mix of a  lip balm and a gloss  with a sheer wash of color they had SPF 12 and  a strawberry kiwi flavor it came in a bunch of  different colours but these are the  specific color names I remember hearing a lot  in the beauty community  that were super popular soft note  hush hush tender baby  take a hint  and pucker they brought these  back a few times  throughout the years and people  always loved them I remember getting  a yellow one it didn't look  yellow on the lips at a cosmetic company  outlet store and I loved it and I loved the sound  of the packaging cause it was a plastic lid  on a little like glass base so it made the most  amazing sound when  you opened and closed it it looks like the last we  saw of these was 2012 and the Smashbox O-Gloss this intuitive lip gloss  came out in 2008 it adjusted to your  pH balance for  your perfect pink a lot of brands  made products  like this like color  adjusting lip products but I remember seeing  this one and thinking  that is so freaking cool it's magic I want it I believe this was  around for several years I feel like I  saw it for years and I think it was  discontinued  around like the mid 2010\u2019s some of these products  are so hard to find  information on but I totally remember them",

If you are a white person saying it'll probably match someone, that is not a valid opinion nor criticism cause it's not actually talking about anything real in reality. You're just assuming it's going to match someone. You don't know anyone that that foundation is going to match because that foundation is not modeled after a human skin tone. I don't know why people that are my skin tone feel as if their opinions on the Euphoria Foundation are of any importance. Because unless you are agreeing with black creators and calling out the problematic behavior of euphoria, why does your opinion have anything to do with this? Like that wouldn't have been your shade anyway. So why are you commenting on it saying oh it's probably like made as a mixing pigment? Like oh like there's probably someone that's going to match? Are you sure? Are you sure about that? You don't have to have an opinion. You don't have to be sharing that opinion, okay? It's not productive. It's taking away from actual important conversations. I just have so many people calling me crazy going back and forth with me because I posted a video saying that that foundation is such a problematic shade. You are not going to convince me that it's not problematic because it is. But also Your opinion on the foundation being problematic when the foundation wasn't even made for you. Why do you feel as if your voice has any weight in this conversation?"

    "voice_to_text": "Every foundation in the world, from the lightest to the deepest, is made with at least these five pigments or a combination of white, yellow, red, black, and even green. With these five pigments, you can make almost any skin colour and undertone that exists. I have a lot of experience creating foundation. I started over 35 years ago with my first foundation palette at MAC Cosmetics up until today with Mauve Beauty Blurring Ceramide Cream Foundation with over 36 shades and four undertones. I even helped Crayola develop their colors of the world crayons so every child could find their shade in a crayon box. Here is one of the charts we use to help develop the undertones at MOB. You can see how the undertones go from pink to neutral to gold and then olive. Depending on the depth and the undertone, it will determine which combination of the five pigments we use. I would call myself a medium neutral to golden undertone. And I'll show you how we use the five pigments to get to eye shape. So we've got the white in the middle, and I'm gonna add some yellow. I'm gonna need some red as well, but you can see that that's a little bit too pink, so I'm gonna have to dull it down a little bit. And that's what the black is used for. The black kind of dulls the color down a little bit, but because I have a little bit of Olive undertone. I'm just gonna add a touch of green. Just a touch. And that's how you need the five pigments to get to my depth and my undertone. In conclusion, foundation shades are nuanced. Everyone has a unique undertone from the lightest shade to the deepest shade. Which is why using a combination of the five pigments are essential in order to create the unique undertones needed.",

So this is Gloria, um, she was one of the main people who called out Youth Foria for their lack of deeper skin tone shades, um, for their date night foundation. But what they just had the nerve to do is send her the darkest shade, and it is literally black. Like, just black pigment. Like, it is just black. First of all, I would be offended that they sent that to me thinking that, like, there's no other shades in between, and they're like, oh, here, this is gonna match you, so we're gonna send it. Like, I. I would personally be offended by that because it's like, are you kidding me? Like, I thought you Learned your lesson. And the second thing I'm so. I would be so offended by is that they don't even respect black people enough to put different color pigments into their formulas. There are so many undertones when it comes to black people, and I don't understand how they think that you can just put black pigment in that skin color. And I personally have never met anyone who is this dark. I'm not saying there's not people there could be, um, but I still just. I'm so. I would be so offended that, like, they don't even respect people enough to put enough colors to make actual skin. Like, they don't even think black people have as complex skin as white People, which is so absurd and that it just. It really irks me so much. Addition. The fact that they did not even test this color on actual people who this shade would match is absurd. Like, if you cannot find anyone who matches this, maybe you can release it, but, like, no, just. You need to find someone, and you need to make sure this will work for your consumers. I'm not mad they made this black shade. You know what? Be innovative. Do it. People can use it for whatever they want. I'm more mad that they jump from their darkest shade, which was way too light for Gloria, to this. That is what I'm kind of pissed about, because they did not fix the undertones. They did not make complex colors. They did not make colors that would match actual black people. They just said, we're gonna make a black foundation, and you know what? That's great, but we need the colors in between. I don't have any youth for your products, but I am most certainly not going to be using them, because this is just so disrespectful.",

I'm super stressed because I need to find a model for our darkest shade of Euphoria Foundation, and it was really hard to find models for our four darkest shade. Hmm. So a month ago, we held a casting call to just look for real people, real skin. I'm applying now. The 600 Foundation. The foundation is just too dark. That matches for most of our shades. Except. Except for our dark references. Is Euphoria's darker shade versus Venti's darker. You guys need to stop pretending that it's someone's shade when it's literally not. It's just the color black. Hmm. The brand could not find a shade match in real life. They could not find a person who matches shade. This is black face paint. This is the darkest shade of the euphoria foundation. It's like you guys can't differentiate these colors, and you're thinking that a black. A dark skinned person is going to fit black face paint, that it's gonna be a shade match. No. After launching my fair share of flop, is always my intention to launch this as a proof of concept, see if people even liked the base formula. If the entire project is such a flop that we have to start over, and everything that we've ordered just goes into landfill, not only in 2024 is this so disgusting and disrespectful, but this needs to be Pulled off the shelves"

If you look here at the bottom of the ingredient list you'll notice three different colors. stay with me now. The CI stands for color index and it basically represents titanium dioxide (at the top) *red, yellow, and black iron oxides pretty much the only colors you need to make a lighter shade of foundation, but then if we look at their darkest shade the ingredient list tells a different story. here there's only one pigment CI 77499 which is just black iron oxide. No other colorants. this foundation literally only has pure black pigment. Here\u2019s a close up if you missed it the first time. and before folks say, \u201coh maybe it\u2019s meant as a mixing pigment\u201d That makes no sense. anyone who has ever taken an art class will tell you  that black is a terrible pigment to mix with because it just makes things gray and muddy and skin tones typically have some combination of eumelanin and pheomelanin. The pheomelanin is where we get the red and yellow undertones. And this problem is so avoidable. She literally could have used NARS or Fenty foundation shades as a benchmark.

I find that whatever I have underneath any skin care pills up. Whenever I use this, I have to prep with literally nothing in order for this not to pill up. Like, I can't not prep my skin. This product is just a little finicky. It's nice when you apply it with fingers, but if I have the wrong product underneath or if I use a tool, this pills. The wear time on this is not great, but it's so thin, it travels into all of the fine lines. I see all the ads of this being super shimmery. Am I missing something? I see everybody using these blushes. Packaging, super cute, but the formula, it's fine. I feel like there's so many better powder blush formulas on the market. Your girl likes a thick lip oil, and this is so thin. It doesn't fill in any lines of my lips. Two new powders. If you have dry skin, this one can be pretty drying, but this is also $54 for it not to blur away all of my problems. And I love Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, but this powder is even drier than the hourglass. Also went through phase of seeing everybody using these. They are so creamy to the point where I don't have control applying this, and I feel like I can't get a defined line with this. It always looks a little blurred. Not saying that these are bad, but they definitely don't deserve the hype that I'm seeing. Let me know what you think in the comments.",

And just the amount of people that came up to me and were asking about what these were, and because they look so cute, I just met so many people while I was out. It was the best conversation starter. Apply it by putting it over your nose like this and then dabbing it with a wet towel, and you do it for, like, I don't know, 30 seconds to a minute, and then you peel to reveal. Look how freaking cute this is! Oh, my god, I'm obsessed. So I have glitter freckles."

    "voice_to_text": "The viral inkey list lip balm comes in three tinted shades now, and we have them early. The inkey list sent them to me early, so obviously, we're gonna try them together. The shades are pink tint, mocha tint, and Berry tint. Was wax on my hands, will put them on my lips, all that fun stuff. The first tint will do is the pink one. This is what the tint looks like when it's coming out of the tube. And that's what the swatch looks like on my hand. It's a nice sheer pink. Let's put it on my lips. This is really pretty. And that's what the pink tint looks like on the lips. Also, if you're wondering, it's the same formula in the tints as the clear one. So it's that same tripe peptide plumping lip balm. And that tripe peptide complex is, like, the main plumping ingredient. This is really pretty. And for, like, spring and summer, it's a nice, just, like, kiss of pink. Next we'll do mocha. Also, I feel like some of you are gonna ask. The colors are labeled on the cap, and that's what mocha looks like. I think that's gonna be really pretty. And this is what the mocha lip tint looks like on me. Also, in terms of scent, these are technically fragrance free. There is, like, a natural scent to the formula, and they smell exactly like the clear one to me. And then the last one is Berry. And that's what Berry looks like. This is a really unique, almost like orange Berry shade. This is really pretty too. And the last one, this is Berry. This might be my favorite. So those are the new Tinted Tripe Peptide plumping lip balms from the inkey List? Like I said, I did get these early. They launch May 2nd on the Inkey List's website. So May 2nd if you wanna try them. May 2nd.",

We sat on the couch, we need to go do the dishes. This is what we do. Right everybody? That's what every single person in the UK does. I don't care who you are. If you ask any British person or British family where they are going on holiday this year, I'm telling you now it will either be Tenerife, Gran Canary or Lanserati. If you've never had a Sunday roast dinner, just don't say that to a Brit, okay? It's offensive. And yes, yes you may have grown up in China, that doesn't register with us. It's an it's offensive. We are extremely sarcastic individuals 90% of sub don't take to heart because it's a joke. Not everybody loves the royal family, especially in Scotland. Most Scottish people hate the royals so would avoid bringing it up if you're going out there. The Scottish hate the English. I'm not including myself with that, but generally the Scottish hate the English. English don't hate the Scottish, but the Scottish hate the English. British chocolate is better than you will get chocolate anywhere else in the whole globe. It does not get better than cabbries. Get yourself cabbry Dairy Milk buttons. That's all I'm gonna say. The UK has a huge vaping problem. Don't be stunned if you see a Group of 8 year olds vaping. Unfortunately, that's the world we're living in. When we greet you and say hello and say, are you alright? No, you're. You don't look ill. You're fine. We're just asking, how are you? If you're going to London and you're walking about London, pick pockets everywhere. Be careful. Like for part 2. Love you.

And then it be so lighter and it throws off you guys undertone. It makes you guys look gray. And when you actually do use foundation, you look, oh my god, what changed? Do you use foundation, you dumb bitch? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. You're not dumb bitch. You're not dumb bitch. But all I'm trying to say is the reasoning that you guys use for no foundation makeup makes no sense. Why are you putting concealer all over your face? Concealer is a more concentrated version of foundation. Just use a lighter foundation if you don't like the cakey feel. Because I promise you, putting concealer all over your face is gonna make it even more cakey. Cause it does look cakey in real life. I don't know.

One of the nicest people in this industry. So talented, a massive inspiration of mine. But, like, you can't look at these two things and say they're a copy of each other, can you? Like, just because they're both at a rectangular component and have a cream and powder formula inside, just like Tom Ford, just like one size, just like dubious plate, just like Charlotte Tilbury, just like every other brand, huh? I'm trying my best here, people, okay? There are only so many different ways you can put two formulas into the same package, and respectfully, I feel like we're doing a pretty decent job in that department so far. But I do apologize if anybody feels like we're copying anybody else. That does bring me to the point of this video today, though. Okay? If y'all are such little sticklers and packaging designers, you be the CEO painted for a day, cause I have a question for you. I've been working on lip balm for the past couple of months for painted because they've been highly requested, and I got these samples in yesterday. Unfortunately, after about four months of work, um, we've decided to completely start over because the formula of this sucks, and I want you guys to have the best. I'm trying to design the Packaging. And I am struggling a little bit because I really want ours to be unique and on branded painted. Uh, but speaking of brands copying each other, I don't know if you guys have shopped for a lip balm recently, but they all look exactly the same, which is also no shade. This is how the beauty industry works. When one component is really great at applying a product, other brands are actually going to use the same component. And I guarantee none of these brands were the first one to invent this packaging, either. So I could design ours with a similar looking tube, but if I do, I know that I'll get comments saying that I read this as well. So I've been trying to brainstorm something a little bit more creative and unique for our packaging. I really am open to anything, as long as it's on brand with painted and the rest of our packaging designs. And also can't be too crazy as well, because I wanna keep these super affordable for you guys. If y'all the packaging police, then you design the next painted product, and if it's good, I'll pay you, maybe even bring you onto the team. Good luck.",

Okay, so yesterday, I was on TikTok Live, and I was battling one of my favorite creators and Auntie Prue. Well, then Michaela Nagrara. There goes right there. Popped in to anti proves live stream and threw 100,000 points against me. You can see the. You can see it at the top. Sneaky snake. If this was the. If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have my team ready to snipe against Michaela's pity. 100 K. But this shows that Mikayla Nagrara is revengeful. She is spiteful. She can't take the gigs, can't take the jokes, and she sniped against me. Girl, look, I have it right here. It's an honor. Look, I. Can you imagine? I'm literally entering this battle with Angie Pru, and then Michaela's like, wait. Oh, hell nah. And I lost the battle. It took my win streak away. So here's the thing. If Michaela wants to do this petty stuff back and forth, just battle me. Michaela, set up a time. In a day, we'll Go on TikTok live. You have your team, I'll have my team, and then we can battle it out. I mean, I don't know what team she has. Last I checked, you got that many? Her and Cody. But we can battle it out. So. Anyways, I challenge Michaela to a TikTok live battle, and I'm pretty sure the odds will forever be in my favor. Let me know what you think about this drama, guys.

Um, I'm referencing the increased risk of lethal angioedema in African American patients that are prescribed licinoproral. Quite frankly, if the rates of angioedema were the same for Caucasians, this drug would have never hit the market. But because the rates of that lethal side effect are only high in black patients, the FDA overlooked it and passed the medication through to the market. While the cough is annoying, the cough happens due to the Renan angiotensin aldosterone system, which basically, it's a function of the lungs. Um, that occurs in the lungs to lower your blood pressure. And it happens in every ethnic group. It's just a side effect of the medication. Um, but it's not lethal. Angioedema is lethal. And on top of all of this, even though the rates of this lethal side effect are so high in African American patients, it is still so commonly prescribed to that population with no warning from medical providers. That is medical racism."

And I'd be like, what? And he'd be like, I'd be like, we're home. And he's like, oh, no, you don't live here anymore. If you, if you paint your nails, you don't have a home here. And that's, oh, that's just what a dude from the 1950s is gonna say. And I couldn't get my nails painted now because think of my mom, dude. My mom raised two boys, me and my brother. How would she feel if I just wasted 18 years of her life where she could have been taking me and my brother to get her nails painted, doing the whole pedicure thing, doing the whole play dates with the nails painted, the whole before bad thing.

And when I say alternative baddies, I swear to god there's always a hair. Anyways, as I was saying, when I say alternative baddie, I do not mean black hair was a nose ring. Not that there's anything wrong with that look either, because I follow plenty of baddies with black hair and a nose ring. But where are my heavily modified influencers? Where are my influencers that just listen to nasty music? And like, don't get me wrong, I know there are like alternative influencers out there, but I don't see any of the girlies with these zero cage septums unboxing 50 PR packages. And I honestly think that needs to change. As soon as TikTok got big, so did the alternative community. But in my honest opinion, I feel like most of the alternative content creators are just being fetishized. And I feel like there is a very small percentage of alternative content creators that are being given the same opportunities as the regular, for lack of a better term, content creators. Like fuck I wanna go to Bora Bora with tart. And this video by no means is me saying like wagon give me free stuff. This is just me simply saying just to be a little more inclusive, give us weird girlies a chance and To the brands that have. Thank you. And this video is by no means me saying I don't like regular influencers, because I actually follow a lot of them, but this is me talking to the big brands. Um, I think you're missing out on a whole demographic here. But what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna tag all my favorite alternative influencers in the caption, as well as people I think deserve a little more recognition, and I want you guys to do the same in the comments. And one last thing before I go, I just wanted to say that everyone has their own preference on the type of media they wanna consume, whether that is alternative people or, quote unquote, normal people. This is just my preference. Okay, bye.",

Do we love it? Do we hate it? Alright, let's do the lipstick actually on the lips. Okay. Okay. For on the go, really quick, minimal makeup. This is absolutely beautiful.

Recipe below  Pre-Ferment 2 \u00bd cups bread flour   \u00bd tsp instant yeast  1 \u00bd cups warm water (110 \u00b0F)  Dough 2 cups  bread flour  \u00bd tsp instant yeast  1 \u00bd tsp coarse salt  1 tsp light honey  2 tsp apple cider vinegar  Water bath 10 cups of water \u00bd cup Dark Beer 1 tsp *Baked* baking soda  3 tbsp dark brown sugar   Instructions - Pre-ferment.  To a medium bowl, add bread flour and yeast.  Mix until combined then add your water. Let that sit at room temp for 2 hours. Right on top of that add your \u00bd tsp yeast, salt, honey and vinegar. Stir until combined then add in half of your bread flour. (only 1 cup) Add flour until you have a kneadable dough ball. Knead that until you have a smooth, supple dough. Divide your dough into 6 equal balls, shape each one then cover with damp towels for 1 hour. Grab a heavy baking sheet that will fit in your fridge, put a piece of parchment paper on top then add a light layer of coarse cornmeal. To shape your bagels, gently flour the tops of them.  Flour your thumb then make a hole straight through the middle. Twist them around your fingers til you get a 1 inch hole. Re-Dampen your towels, cover then refrigerate your bagels for 1 hour. To bake, heat your oven to 425\u00b0F. In the meantime add 10 cups of water to a pot then add *baked baking soda, your favorite dark beer and brown sugar. *Simply bake \u00bd a cup of baking soda 30 mins at 350F then let it cool. Bring to a boil then add as many bagels as you can fit without them overlapping.  Boil them for 1 minute per side. (longer for chewier bagels, shorter for less chewy) Remove them with a slotted spoon to a baking tray. Immediately brush with egg wash (1 egg white + 1 tsp water) then sprinkle with whatever toppings you like. Transfer into your preheated oven for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, rotate the tray then bake for 16 more minutes (flip halfway through) Take them out and let them cool on a wire rack. You can wait a few mins and eat them fresh or wait a couple hours until they are cooled. Make this recipe and let me know what ya think\u2026 Appreciate the support!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udd25 #bagels #bageltok #easyrecipe ",

And you know all the ingredients in the description, and the directions will be in the description box. And then you wanna just need that until you have a nice supple dough divided into six portions. And then you wanna divide those six portions into nice top balls. Parchment paper. Go ahead and cover with damp paper towels. Let that sit for an hour, then go ahead and make your bagel shapes. You know, finger straight through. I love shaping them. That's my favorite part, redamping those paper towels. Put them right over, let rest for another hour. Then, you know, you wanna grab your favorite dark beer, go right into that water, go in with your dark brown sugar. Once that's boiling, you wanna go in with your bagels. Boil them for only one minute per side. The longer you boil them, the more chewy they will be. You wanna go right on with a bunch of egg wash. Um, you can add any toppings you like at this point.

You know what spring means? Bringing. You're gonna be dealing with an excessive amount of flowery looks for the next three to four months. Also means I'm gonna be forcing your ass to do some flowery looks with me for the next three to four months because they're so easy and fast. Why would you not want a flower on your eye when you could have one in five fucking seconds? I wanna brush with like, a thin handle. Doesn't matter what the hairy part looks like cause we're using the back. Start with the main color of your. And I'm just loading up the butt of my brush. We're gonna start by making five circles in this kind of looking shape. Like to start with the top one, just to give me an idea of what the fuck is going on. Maybe lift your eyebrow for a second if you need to, like, fill in a gap. But keep in mind you're not gonna be walking around like this all day. So relax. You're vibing with your paddle shape. You can take the very same brush and your middle color. Who needs a fucking smokey eye? Who needs wing liner? I've had farts that take me a longer time to accomplish than that. To Add a couple little leaves because I felt kind of naked. And these are also super easy. Gonna, like, start with a tip and then stamp down. It makes a little way, but you get these flower basics down, you can be a pro. With this type of flower, I look in no time. Favorite part of this eye that I think really pulled everything together is this green inner corner. Was a little scared it might give conjunctivitis at first, but no, I think it's very cute. Ring sleigh. Guess I can maybe see how normal people might think that face painting an entire flower on your eyes a bit much for everywhere, but, like, at least get with the inner corner. Like, it's fine. You have one life. Be fucking fun. I still have a million earrings that I haven't done yet, but I also have the urge to purchase more earrings.

So I met someone from the music world, and I said, hey, I need some extra money. You believe in this vision? And I told them the plan, and they said, absofuckinlutely. And they had nothing to do with makeup. They're a trademark lawyer for 30 years. Um, and they were your first investor or one? Yeah, first investors. My only. Oh, wow. We launched.

Changes color from black to gray. Hopefully I still have eyelashes on one side of my face. Oh, my gosh, I could feel how warm it is. Oh, you're only supposed to hold it for, like 10 seconds. Seven, 8, 9, 10. I do anything for my shape. It's not really fitting. Ouch. Went too close to my lashes, honestly. Can you guys tell the difference? Cause to me, the old school one actually did a way better job. 4 out of ten."

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, you. Yeah? Stop washing your face in the morning. Why would you wash or cleanse your face in the morning? After last night? You just loaded your face with a whole bunch of supplemental products to help your skin health. To me, that just kind of seems like a little bit of a waste of money. I haven't done a crazy amount of digging or looking into it, but from what I understand, when you wake up in the morning, this is all good stuff and healthy bacteria that's sitting on your face and also protecting your face. And skin barrier. Skin barrier? I kind of feel like skin barrier is an overplayed word. Like, it's not that deep. You have your skin cells, the bacteria that's on your skin, and then see them in other oils that your skin naturally produces. Skin barrier. So when you use a cleanser in the morning, you're stripping your skin of all those oils and bacteria that sitting on your skin that should be staying on your skin in the morning. People that have oily skin, this is why you have oily skin. Your skin is overcompensating and overproducing those oils because you just dried it out. I mean, it could also be because you're eating like shit, but so really quick before in the video, this is what you can do. Instead of clinching your face in the morning, grab yourself a rose water spray. Or lately I've been using LA Roche Posay Thermal Water. Spray it all over your face. You're done. Or you can ice your face for 30 seconds to a minute first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up. And then resupply your face with a moisturizer. I always recommend people to use a beef towel moisturizer. And then, like I said, you're done. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you collect vintage makeup, the Volupte Golden Gesture Compact is one of the most coveted compacts to collect. Hand shape compact launched in the 19 forties, and it's rumored to have around 12 different versions. Now, I know a lot of you out there are starting to collect vintage makeup, which I absolutely love. So if you're looking for this compact, I have about 7 of them. I'm trying to complete the collection. But let's start with this one. Is the engagement ring. All you have is the ring, no bracelet. And what you want to look for is absolutely no dings. You want the mirror intact, although it does sometimes get this sort of corrosion that happens to a lot of vintage compacts. And then inside, you want to have the puff. And most importantly, with any compact, if you can find it in its original sheath and its original box, this also came completely clean with no ring, no bracelet, and no nail polish. And this one has the nail polish, but you can actually see it's a little bit tainted. So this is not mint condition. But I just find it really difficult to find these, so sometimes I'll grab them even if they're not perfect. The card playing hand is extremely rare. But speaking of not perfect, I've never been able to find it in mint condition all of these years. So you can see it up close. It is a little bit scuffed, but I had to have it. This one's very special because it's actually on the cover of the holy grail of compact collectors. This is Roslin gerson's Ladies compact's book. Definitely need this. All collectors. In 1948, they launched the gay 90s Mitt. Now, this refers to the Victorian era, the 18 90s, when women would wear the fingerless gloves. This one's a little easier to find. It's the white mitt. There's no ring. And of course, this gorgeous bracelet. And I have one that's even more rare. Now, this one comes with the glove and the ring and the bracelet, and I do have the box for it. This back then would have sold for $7 and \u00a250. And recently, one on eBay went for over 2000 dollars. Now, this one might be the rarest of all. This is the Zodiac compact. And this one came out closer to the 19 50s. A lot of Zodiac compacts were becoming a thing. And this one is intensely rare. It's in perfect mint condition. I have the box, I have the sheath. And this one also would go for over 2000 dollars. If you find these and you don't want them, let me know. Or get them for yourself if you can get them at a good price. Because as you can see, worth it.",
