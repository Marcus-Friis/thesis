    "voice_to_text": "Hey, TikTok. So I have ringworm on my face. Chris Olsen recently just mentioned that he got ringworm on his face as well, and unfortunately, this happened to me, too. So I go to the gym occasionally and I always wipe down my seats, but I have noticed a habit of people not wiping down the machines, so I, you know, we'll have to wipe it down myself and. Yeah. So point of the story is that what touched my neck was an app machine that I used for my core. And so I was using the handles to do the. The workout, and so the handle touched my neck, and I don't think it was clean, and it left me with this ringworm on the side of my neck, which developed under my neck and then onto the other side of my cheek, and now it's on my nose. I ended up going to the ER Wednesday night cause I couldn't handle the burning and itching that is going on my face right now. And the doctor did confirm that it was ringworm of the face, and he just prescribed me this medication right here. So it says that it's gonna take about, you know, I have to apply it for twice a day for 14 days, and I'm just hoping that this ends soon.",

    "voice_to_text": "The bro science and why it's so fun and why we're all so attracted to it. So why do people like the bro science? It's because that's where most people will probably get the most results. And that sounds so stupid to say, but most of the biggest guys you will ever meet, bro science kind of stuff. And I'm not saying they do not do optimal kind of stuff or whatever, but you have to simply just break it down for what it actually is. Most of the people that you see who are doing the very optimal kind of training, and yes, most of the bro style stuff is very optimal kind of stuff, maybe not to the exact percentage of the optimal stuff, but still you. They get great stimulus, great fatigue. The thing is, they push heavier with more intensity. Most of the time they will be the people who are like, alright, you know what, I'm gonna do another set, I don't care, we're gonna up the weight. Form might not be perfect, but I don't care, I'm going to push it further. It's also just fun and that's it. It makes the gym so much more enjoyable. And I think that's something a lot of people who push for a lot of the optimal being 100% perfect kind of lifting really don't understand, is that it is fun to throw weights around, it is fun to get these crazy pumps and it makes the Gym. So much more enjoyable. And fuck it, you really do get a lot of extra results that way. And I'm gonna get people who disagree with me, but I don't really care. Talk to the biggest guys, you know, and there's got, you know, and they do the. They do the optimal stuff, but you just. You just gotta lift heavy shit.",

    "voice_to_text": "Let's be honest about weight loss. Most people who are overweight are not happy with being overweight. They just content. And this is coming from somebody who lost weight before. Right. And when I gained my weight, it was because of poor living habits. It was me eating badly and not working out. If you wanna gain weight, that's the easiest way to do it. Eat bad and not work out, and you'll gain weight. Right. And so it wasn't necessarily that I was happy when I was big. I just was content. I knew I had no intention on doing anything about it at that time. Therefore, I made peace with being big. But again, being content don't equal happy. Right. It's hard to be happy when you in a body that you gotta make so many accommodations and you gotta always be thinking two steps ahead with. Right. As simple as, you know, you can't go to the mall and find regular clothes. You know, you can't go to amusement parks and fit on rise. You know, when you go on planes, you may possibly have to get a seat, seatbelt extend or possibly two seats. Right. Nothing's comfortable about that. Right. So a lot of people, though, a lot of they self and tell they self that they okay with it because they ain't got no intentions on changing it. And that's fine, because it takes a lot to change it. It is not easy. It is Not easy to change up bad habits that you've been doing forever. And then taking the steps to go to the gym or whatever it is that you do to lose the weight. It's not easy by any means necessary. I'm not discounting that. But it still don't change the fact that most people who sell you these lies about them being so happy and being so body positive. Yeah, I'm sure you are, because you don't have any intentions on changing where you currently at. But it's funny that every time somebody big lose weight, that's when you finally hear the truth about how they felt when they was big. The truth never comes out until that weight is gone. And then that's when the big people are willing to admit how they truly felt when they was in that bigger body. There's a lot of people who lie to they self, right? And lie to they self helps them cope with them not truly being happy with where they currently at. But the truth of the matter is it's hard to be happy and be big. You know why? Cause it's just too much that you have to deal with when you in that bigger body. When it comes down to how society treat you. When it comes down to your health and things that can happen from being overweight. When it comes to all of the accommodations. Like I said in the beginning of the video that You have to make for yourself by being big. Nothing about that is easy. Right. So again, is one thing if you not at a point in your life where you ready to do nothing about it. But the people who glamorize and make it seem like it's something that they don't have a problem with and they just love it, that's a rare set of people. Most people who are big are not happy in that body. They just content.",

I'm not talking about having only two sets of cables and then getting pissed off by a man being on the cable set next to me. I'm not talking about that. There was literally an entire room open, open space, room for warm up and ABS. It was just me on the floor in the back fucking corner and a dude on an AB machine across the room. He wasn't bothering me cause he wasn't in my personal space. And if he needed to use the machine next to me, I know who that guy was. He would have been like, hey, is it cool if I use this machine right next to you? I don't wanna scare you, bother you, cause it's called being a decent fucking human being. But no, this guy literally saw me where I was in the corner area, kind of off to myself and chose to set up while I was in a vulnerable stretching position. That was so you could see things. And you know, let him have it then. Let him. Let him at me then. I don't know what I said that was so fucking wrong other than, you know, y'all don't Like it when people come up to you next in the urinals. Urinals? That was in my comments too.

He turns out he's 64, and he's sweating heavy and he's panting heavy, and you can see he's doing a real good workout, like what we call a military commander workout. So I looked to the guy to the right of me and I said, yeah, that's what we wanna be like when we're his age. I didn't know 64. Anyway, I got in the pool, and he's in the pool and he's like, he's a. He does, um, triathlons at 64. And he's powering up and down the lane so fast. So I think, you know what? I'm gonna stay with him. Who told me to speak that? Anyway, I stayed with him for a period of time. Then I kind of was in front, he slowed down, then he just carried on, and I ended up behind. Reason why I'm telling you this is when you think you're doing well in life, there's always someone around the corner who shows you you can be doing better, whether it's academic health, in this cane, in this case, whatever. But don't stay dim. Motivated. Let that be a motivational point for you. And try and improve. Even if you don't match them straight away, just try.

Yeah, if everyone's not seen it, this was pictured in London after the FA Cup final. A man walking through London wearing a Man United shirt with her mass 7 on the back. Like, honestly, what possesses somebody to actually do that and then think it's a good idea to walk around the street like that? It just reminds me of the FA Cup final last year with this absolute weapon of a human being. And is this absolute weapon as well, walking around Wembley last year at the cup final with a shirt saying not enough 97 in reference to the Hillsman disaster? He was subsequently arrested and charged, and when he appeared in court he had a grin on his face. Honestly. Right, I know it's not all Man United fans, and the vast majority of Man United fans can damn it. But the question has to be said, wire is a small pocket of their fans. Absolute scumbags. I hope that guy who wearing a her masher is actually found and is actually brought before the court, because. Sorry, mate. There's acceptability. Absolutely. There is a level of acceptability today and that's not it. Things like that have absolutely no place in football. Right, right, I get it. Yeah, yeah. Many United fans hate Liverpool and vice versa, but to wear a shirt mocking probably the Worst thing that's ever happened to their club is a step too far. Walking around London wearing a Man United shirt with her mask 7 on the back. Again, it's unacceptable and it's not cool for. I hope that Man United fan is cool and cool pretty soon because yeah, the vast majority of actual football fans are disgusted by it. He probably dismisses it as banter but it's not, it's not, it's offensive and it's just. And it's not cool for. Absolute scummy fan base."

I don't see the same kind of complications with the sleeve. The fact that the sleeve is so much less invasive. See, it seems like with the R and Y and the switch, uh, you could be doing everything right, and because of what that procedure did to your body, you might have complications regardless. You know what I mean? And it seems like I'm not seeing that with people who have the sleeve.

    "voice_to_text": "My Roman Empire is curvy girls with skinny arms look curvier but when it comes to the arms now it's like taking it too far I'm not exactly sure why that's the case I think that fitness is also about aesthetics this was the strategy I did when I got to a point where I was like really uncomfortable with how my arms were getting so bulky if you also wanna shrink your arms this strategy will work for you so the first thing I did was I actually stopped doing upper body altogether for almost three months so of course I lost muscle in that process which was the goal lot of girls don't understand that what bulkiness is is it literally is just like a layer of fat over muscle so unless you have like no body fat you might not need to do this but for me I wanted to lose some muscle in my arms so that immediately made them look slimmer second thing I did was I actually only do upper body one time a week now I used to do two days consistently I will sometimes throw in some back in my full body days but for the most part 1 upper body days all I do the third thing that I switched up that really made a difference was I only use very lightweight for my arms my back I use heavier weights I love growing my back but for my arms like my triceps my shoulders I don't really do biceps I only use like 5 7 sometimes 10 pounds and I just do a lot more reps there is a strategy to this I really just want to keep up with the muscle that I built there and kind of maintain my arms are looking so slim this summer so happy with the changes and all of the slimming that's happened with this routine definitely try it out if you guys want to slim your arms as well",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm probably gonna ruffle some feathers, but. Oh, well, um. When you go to the gym, and I'm a person, I go to the gym, so I can speak on this. When I go to the gym, my focus is to sweat, burn fat, get in shape. I'm not going there have dressed with shorts on to the point where you can see everything that I got to offer. That's not what I go to the gym for. Like, what happened to going to the gym to, you know, I understand, you know, you were hit goals and you know, I'm gonna show my body, but you could do that outside of jail. Why do y'all got to come in a gym half naked? Y'all do unnecessary stuff in the gym for to seek attention when you can just literally walk outside to do that. Like, don't nobody wanna see that? Like, and before y'all women get to get on here talking about, oh, you hate cause your body. No, I. My body bodies on the natural side. You would never catch me in the gym half naked. You will always catch me in the gym with my leggings on, my sweat band, doing my sweat band, and you can tell, yeah, I'm snatched. So we not gonna even get the talking. All of that, all you just mad cause you ain't nobody mad. I get frustrated and irritated seeing you women damn near naked in a gym to seek Attention. What, you hot? Go work on outside. Go do all that outside. Don't nobody want to see that shit. And then, you know, before y'all get to talk about, oh, me, I wanna see it, they be talking about y'all. Nobody care to see that shit. Like, nobody care to see y'all going up and down and y'all be doing workouts on the Stairmaster and on the treadmill that aren't even considered a workout. Is this BS? You can literally do that outside, you know, right along with the shorts pulled all the way up, bottom of the ass out, titties out. You're not there to work out, ma'am. You're there to try to get a man. You're there to seek attention. You could go to the club to go do that. Is, I could name numerous places that y'all could go do that. Like, what happened to the gym just being the gym? Don't nobody care to see that. No one cares to see your half naked ass at the gym. We see enough of it on social media. Like, spare us, please and thank you. And it's coming from somebody who goes to the gym. You would never catch that. I will forever have my leggings. I don't care. I don't care if it's 90 degrees outside. I got a hoodie on, cause I'm there to sweat. I'm there to lose weight and progress. I'm there to build. I'm there to be fit, not to get attention."

Cause what? High risk comes high reward. You never know if she's gonna become a skinny babe. 5 bitch until the end. Pre order this babe. Pep guajola. Scouting ability. I wanna know what pain he wants you to acquire that type of sharingan and rinnegan, to see the future has to be a new man. Get your ability every time. Bro said, oh, I have a girlfriend. And the guy said, oh, let me see her. He's going to. As long as you're happy. If that's what makes you happy, bro. All the ridicules are laughing behind his back. But he had a plan. He just needed a platform. Now look, she's probably a good woman. Mileage low, cooks, cleans, listens to him and supports his dreams and aspirations. Unlike these baby Albanis, these slots of today, these sexy red wannabes of today. Your favorite slot. I'm begging you to please stop so she can unlock her true potential. Because the only thing holding these babies back is their weight. They might just have a beautiful face underneath all that fat. And all they need is that extra push to go to the gym and lose that weight. And that's not fat, bitch. And you have no stress. Guys are always blinded by The shorty with the Ruby Rose build from early. If you're not maintaining that Ruby Rose build. She's cooked, she's cool. She's gonna eventually acquire the Lizzo Bill. The meat hanging out the dress, the belly hanging out all over the place. Trying to tuck it under the leggings that we can't see it. Get yourself a humble BBB and you'll be happy. Sure, it might be an investment that you might never care return on, but choose your BBB wisely.",

    "voice_to_text": "Why did Arnold do pulldowns like this? A lot of people will now claim that this is poor technique. He's actually doing it for a very good reason. A normal lat pulldown is lighter at the top and much heavier at the bottom. But your lat muscles are much stronger when they're stretched and much weaker when they're shortened. So this may present the problem, which is that your muscles are stronger where the resistance is lighter, and your muscles are weaker where the resistance is heavier. You can circumment this using the technique that Arnold's using. What he's doing is he's actually allowing the way to accelerate upward toward the stretch position, which makes these tissues, proportionately have to work much harder on the top. Then what he's doing is he's yanking out of the top portion of the range so that the momentum of the bar actually makes a little bit lighter in the bottom proportionately. Arnold is making the motion heavier at the top, where the muscles are stronger, and proportionately lighter at the bottom, where the muscles are weaker. Keep in mind that I wouldn't advise that everyone use the strategy. It's a relatively more advanced technique that you need to be able to utilize still with some degree of control.",

    "video_description": "The takeaway: cable pulling motions are generally most challenging toward the \u201csqueezed\u201d position. But, you\u2019re much stronger toward the stretch, so it can make sense to initiate with a little bit of a \u201cyank\u201d to make the motion harder where you\u2019re stronger. Many jacked people use this technique, which I think leaves a clue about its potential usefulness. This technique is NOT for everyone all the time. It\u2019s a more advanced technique to perform well, and I wouldn\u2019t advise anyone who couldn\u2019t execute a controlled pull-down to learn them this way. But the notion that this is a \u201cpoor technique\u201d with no reference to a goal is short-sighted (in my opinion!) and we shouldn\u2019t write off these strategies solely as \u201cego lifting\u201d. Can people take this to an extreme where little of the motion is controlled? Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done in a more balanced and intentional way.  From a practical recommendation standpoint: I do about half of my cable pulling motions with more of an intent to \u201cyank\u201d to challenge the stretched position and half of my pulling motions with a slower and controlled tempo to challenge the \u201csqueeze\u201d. Using both strategies seems reasonable to me to challenge both kinds of qualities."

So if you're starting out in your teenager and or you're in your early 20s and you wanna really start stepping up your game, you can't go too heavy.",

Si sac\u00e1is el petr\u00f3leo es desarrollo, dice, pero para m\u00ed no es desarrollo. Est\u00e1n vulnerando nuestro derecho, est\u00e1n violando todo lo que hay dentro. Es no solo impactos ambientales. Da\u00f1a eh culturalmente, desconecta nuestros ra\u00edces",

    "voice_to_text": "Weight is not food. It doesn't matter how you cut it. If you wanna drink it, that's entirely up to you. I'm telling you, weight is not food. Whey protein comes from the liquid leftover after making cheese from cow's milk. Whey protein is a dairy product. Unless you're getting it from some shitty brand like Optimum Nutrition. Whey protein is a whole food. Whey was an industrial waste product farmers used to throw away until the 90s when somebody decided they're gonna be turning to food for us. And that was an extremely smart decision. That person literally discovered a revolution that would help people build muscle and lose weight for years to come. It would do better with animal protein. Whey protein is animal protein. Think about by availability. It's how much your body can break down and use. Wait, it's not? Protein is literally the most bioavailable source of protein. You're using whey predominantly. Just stop drinking whey for about two weeks, switch to animal protein, and see how good you feel. Whey protein is animal protein. Eat your whey protein.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you're somebody who lifts weights, how long should you be resting in between your sets? It depends on if your goal is more cardio and endurance, build muscle and get stronger, or to lose fat. For cardio and endurance training, you're usually going to have shorter rest times, somewhere around 30 to 60 seconds. Now, if your goal is to build muscle and get stronger, the current research that we have shows us is gonna be somewhere around that two to five minute Mark. This is because if you rest for too short in between your sets, you're gonna go into your next set too fatigue, which means you won't be able to lift as heavy, push yourself as close to failure, and your results are going to suffer. And by the way, if you don't need at least two minutes of rest, then that is your sign that you need to lift heavier weight. And finally, if your goal is to lose fat, you actually want your workouts focused on getting stronger in building muscle. Because combined with eating in a calorie deficit, building more muscle will help in your fat loss journey."

They come in little shots like this, like I said, from prozis. Code Dvorak. To save money, all you do, you pop the top, alright? Pop the top and just drink it. It's like just a shot worth.

I'm keeping my muscle mass. I've just lost fat. Um, in the past, like, I don't know, six weeks, four weeks I've been using this. I pop one right after I work out. Every single day or before.

    "voice_to_text": "All the things I don't do as a gym girly and competitive bodybuilder. Let's go! No. 1 is fasted workouts. If you know anything about weight training, you should not be weight training on an empty stomach or have zero food or fuel in your system. You need fuel to lift the weights and to get the most out of your weight training session. So no, I don't lift fasted. I eat 40 to 50 grams of carbs, if not more prior to my lifts. No. 2 is cardio. Now you guys are like, your body building don't do cardio currently, no, I don't. I'm in an improvement season growing phase, and I do zero cardio. And I've been doing zero cardio for the past five, six months. Number three. I don't squat or bench. I don't squat just because that's in my programming. I haven't squat in a really long time. Um, there's other things to build my glutes that are much better, and I don't need to build up my quads as much because I'm a bikini girl, and you don't need large quads in that class. Same with bench press. You don't need chest to be in bikini. That's not a muscle group that's really in the criteria. So I don't bench either. No. 4 eat protein snacks. I don't eat protein bars. I don't eat protein cookies. I don't eat any of that stuff unless I make it. I personally make it cause I'm huge on Ingredients. And if there is a million ingredients in something, ingredients that I cannot pronounce, I'm not gonna eat it. And most of the time, they cause bloating, stomach issues, and they just don't make me feel good. I get my protein from whole sources, basically, so I stay away from those protein snacks. For five. Is lifting and running shoes. Now, if I'm training upper body, I will have some sort of sneakers on. Not necessarily running shoes, but if I'm lifting lower body, my shoes are flat. If not, I'm lifting in my socks, because it's like lifting on a marshmallow. You feel very unstable, and it's not great for lower body lifts. Last but not least, and I get the craziest looks for, I do not drink alcohol. Even in off season, I do not drink alcohol. I haven't drank alcohol in over a year, and I'm gonna keep it that way. That is an even longer story, but, yeah, I don't drink alcohol.",

    "voice_to_text": "Why don't I recommend you run for fat loss? This is a great question, especially considering I am a runner. I've done a Marathon and an ultra Marathon, and I run three or four times a week, but I don't run for fat loss or for additional steps. The reason I don't recommend running solely for the purpose of getting more steps or losing more body fat is its effect on our appetite. Running is very glycolitic, meaning it will empty out our glycogen stores, or our stored carbohydrate. This is going to ramp up your body's appetite in the attempt to replenish those carbohydrates. While walking has a neutral impact on appetite, it does not require nearly as much energy or glycogen, so it's not gonna give you that ravenous hunger feeling. I and many others can attest to the fact that if you run a lot, you are simply hungrier. So sure, you can use running to get 10,000 steps more quickly, or even get more steps in a given day because you're covering more ground more quickly, but you need to account for the fact that you will be hungrier there by making your calorie deficit harder to stick to. All steps count. It doesn't matter if you get them running, crawling, on all fours, walking, or sprinting. Just be aware of the methods and modalities that you can get those steps and how they're gonna impact your ability to adhere to your calorie goals and needs. It isn't easy, but it is simple. Don't ever complicate it.",

    "voice_to_text": "So my name is Jordan and I'm a bit of a fat fuck at the moment. I mean, just look at the belly on that. Well, I'm fed up of being the second coming of the Michelin man. So I'm making this TikTok to hold me accountable to what I'm gonna set. As you can see, I'm 97 kg at the moment. I want to get down to about 86, but not just lose weight cause that's boring. I wanna get the gains in. And as you can see, they're the worst arms in the world at the moment. So. So four weeks ago I couldn't even do 10 press UPS, and at the moment I'm doing between 20 and 30 a day. I also know that's not gonna do anything for the old belly gut that I've got on me at the moment. So when I add sit UPS to that and any other core exercises, you let me know in the comments. As you can tell, I'm not very good at this fitness shit. As you can also see, I'm not the most active guy in the world. That needs to change if I wanna do this challenge. So the plan is to start walking on my lunch times at work, which I know isn't gonna do much, but it gets the step count up, cry and go for a run at least three times a week, which in my head is actually gonna kill me. I used To like running a lot. And since I got fat, just not. I'm not keen on it. But hopefully once I get back in the groove of running it'll be good. And hopefully I'll be doing 10,000 steps easy every single day. But yeah, make sure that follow button. If I can do this, you can do it as well. Just an everyday fat guy trying to lose some weight and gain some muscle.",

I'm not gonna lie, I was confident this club would get viewed continue it like that. That's really the second. The second reason is, you may not know this about me, but I'm a pretty shy guy and over the past few months, I've been going to loads of events and doing a lot of collabs to step out my comfort zone. This collab with Ed was just another one of those that got escalated. I've spoken with Jones, I've spoken with. I've spoken with James personally and I've apologised for what I said about him. And I just want to apologise to you guys. Maybe I've not been myself and I just want to get back to my roots at the gym and, you know, keep the gym content coming. And obviously I still want to do clubs now and again, but the gym is gonna be my main focus. Thank you to everyone for supporting me and I'll see you guys back in the gym.",

I mean, we don't even have drinking water in the UK right now. This is hard to believe, what's going on? So Southwest Water is now urging everyone in the affected areas to boil their tap water, including when they're drinking it, or even just cooking or. Or brushing your teeth. And they're saying that this, uh, water crisis could last for 10 days. The school has been forced to shut down. People in our panic buying water from supermarkets. Bottled water stations are being set up to provide clean, safe water for people to take home. Oh, and just to make matters worse, this illness, which a bunch of people now have called cryptosporidium, the NHS say that. Oh, don't worry about it, you'll recover in about a month. I don't have a month to be out dying in my bed. So, yeah, here, that's what's going on in the UK right now. And if I do disappear for a month, at least you'll know why.",

    "voice_to_text": "for building muscle for\u00a0seeing\u00a0more\u00a0definition\u00a0 the reality is it honestly doesn't really matter but in my opinion in my professional opinion as a personal trainer for five plus years I always recommend people to not work out on an empty stomach a lot of people a lot of trainers have really advocated for fasted cardio to burn more fat and the reality is like like yeah you can burn fat doing that but then as you eat calories throughout the day you're building that back up so in reality like working out fasted is not giving you really any huge benefit I mean if you're doing cardio that's one thing but if you're lifting weights doing that fasted is probably one of the worst ideas you could do because if you are working out fasted if you're lifting weights you're gonna have substantially less energy than if you were to work out lift weights after eating and like I'm not saying like eat right before you go to the gym like you should eat like a half hour to an hour before your workout and another thing you could also do is add a you know a carb source so you know a piece of fruit you see powerlifters with candy I don't really recommend that unless you're a very avid powerlifter but having like a piece of fruit a banana and apple and orange something that has fast acting carbs in it to give you that burst of energy for your workout but also making sure you're having a protein source before you work out as well to give you that long lasting energy because protein is gonna take longer to break down and give you energy longer so I always recommend to not work out fasted because especially if you're lifting weights it's really just gonna give you really no benefit because you're not gonna be able to output as much energy because you don't have as much energy so you can't lift as heavy you can't lift as intense you're gonna burn out faster you're gonna have less energy so your workout isn't gonna last as long so all in all you should eat before you work out but you wanna make sure you don't eat right before you work out because that might give you a stomachache that might make you feel sick so half hour to an hour before you work out is a perfect time frame to have a meal nothing too huge you know something 200 to 500 calories I think is plenty of you know a carb source and a protein source that's really all you need before your workout to give you the energy you need for that workout to get the best workout possible",

They're actually people who care about your entire fitness journey because you inspire them. You're a skinny guy who's wanting to get bigger and you have that confidence to post about yourself, and that's absolutely amazing. But you just shoving it right back in the face. People follow you for you, Jack. You've progress. They wanna see the change. They wanna see your personality. They don't wanna see this fake facade that you put up of yourself, which isn't you. Hey, Jess, get on my level. And even worse, taking deals with of managers for a bit more bread is dumb. These people aren't your friends. They're using you for money so they can promote the L F, okay? They do not care about you. People like George or Josh.

I have a whole folder on my phone, probably upwards of 60 to 70 items of just horrible protocols and just horrible diet glands. So I'll show you a couple of the ones I've seen. So first off, we got breakfast, 25 protein, 25 carbs, 10 fats. Lunch, dinner, total 11 and 15 calories. I feel like we're missing the other $499 worth of this plan, but hey, what do I know? So we got the women's bikini plan here. So we got six meals at 20 grams of protein per meal. That's a hundred and twenty protein. Now, of course, there is gonna be some fast in the protein, but either way, zero grams of added carbs. That sucks. That's not gonna be a fun time. And then we have the five grams of added fats. So that's not very much. And we got 25 grams of added fats for the whole week. To give you guys a reference, I typically give women like, at least 25 to 30 grams of fat per day. Like extra on top of the regular meat. But either way, for the day, we got 705 calories. But I'm sure if you round it up as probably a boards of like 800, 8 50. I've showed this plan numerous times, but it never stops being funny. Meal number one, we got the rice Cakes, peanut butter, honey, raw honey, whatever. Low fat milk. Getting into 10:00 and 12 o'clock. We got the one rice cake, we got the peanut butter, we got the one tablespoon of mixed vegetables, what not. But here it is, my favorite part. One small carrot at three PM. Nothing else. One small carrot and you look at the rest of the day. It doesn't really get much better. But hey, three PM, one more small carrot. Nice."

My second match is a little more dangerous for me. My opponent was flexible. I still smashed. This is pretty cool. I did not see this leg lock attempt coming. So if you guys are wondering, Dalton, how do you deal with leg locks? Uh, I always reach for the arm and just yank myself in. His name is AJ, and his jiu jitsu is actually a lot better than mine. Just luckily for me, I'm pretty strong. And I actually ended up giving myself a black eye in this match right here when I landed on him looking like Prince Zuko. Then I did the expert absolute. This is why I'm pretty sure size matters, guys. There's an 80 pound difference here, and, like, six inches of height, you know, wins a win. But I don't feel like it's great about this one as I did some of the others. One more thing I wanna add. I do not have the gas tank for jiu jitsu tournaments. I didn't realize, like, your fourth match can be somebody's very first match. So I ended up losing the expert absolute. But from here on out, I think I'm just gonna do expert absolutes. You guys can see it. I just have nothing left in the tank. This is what working in a Cubicle gets it. My shoulders are just fried right here."

And if it was the case that it did, we would just sit and eat bagels and butter all day to make up for our fats, carbs and protein. The reason we don't do that is because meats like beef and chicken and fish and things like that, they are hiring. Bioavailability of amino acids. We get the full spectrum of amino acids which do make up the proteins that we intake. And the carbs and things like that that do carry trace protein, they do not have the same amino acid profile as the meats do. And in order to repair the muscle, we need to have the full amino spectrum to make that up. That's why my intra workout drink, between my pre workout meal and my post workout meal, where there's quite a big window where I might not have an intake of protein, I have amino acids in that shake to make sure that I'm getting a hit of protein there. And it's a full range of protein, not just some random high in protein bagels which are just. They're just rubbish."

I was 25 minutes into my lift, you know, I was doing, like, little baby curls, and I was even going for, like, the lateral lunge, which I'm not that confident in. Three men walk in, like, kind of like 25, and I'm like, don't we know that the apartment gyms are for the girls? Yep, you heard that correctly. Apartment gyms are only for the girls. That is the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard. I'm sorry. Do you own that building? Do you pay everyone's rent, including the fee for amenities that includes that gym? And why do people use an apartment gym? For a lot of people, it's time. It's just really convenient to use that gym. Others don't have the money to pay for a gym membership at a commercial gym. And some people have anxiety about going to busy commercial gyms in fear of running into somebody ignorant like yourself, so they use the apartment gym at home to feel safe. Regardless, you have no right to tell anyone that lives in that building who can or can't use that gym. You need to do better. Mind your own business."

We change all available sources. So going once a week. I'm like, no, that's not right. And then I came across Doctor Anthony Chafee with his book plans are trying to kill you. I read the book, I'm like, fuck. So I said to this woman, take all the vegetables out. The next fucking day, she says to me, oh, my God, I spent all my life eating a shitload of vegetables because I was told that's what's gonna make me go. I'm telling you that most of what you know about nutrition is bullshit. If you're struggling to go to the toilet, if you got constipation, you're dieting, oh, I need fibre. Investigate what worked for this lady and what's worked for most of my other clients who are struggling to go to the toilet. I took all their vegetables out. And made them do the carnival diet.

    "voice_to_text": "It's official. Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and Malta will be recognizing the state of Palestine on Tuesday, May 21st. This comes today after the UN General Assembly passed the resolution to upgrade Palestine's rights and privileges as a non member observer state. This past, the Israeli ambassador literally shredded the UN Charter on stage. So many of you are you hating? You don't really care that the Palestinians are not peace loving. Ignoring the charter and granting the Palestinians the privileges of a member state. You are proving that morality is just a slogan for you while politics and interest prevail. You are shredding the UN Charter with your own hands. Yes, yes, that's what you're doing. Shredding the UN chartered. Regardless, it passed and EU member states will soon be recognizing the state of Palestine. Joseph Burrell, EU foreign policy chief, stated this is a symbolic act of political nature. More than its state, it recognizes the will for that state to exist, adding that Belgium and other countries would probably follow. Of course, Israel is not happy and its finance Minister Smokedrich stated that a Palestinian state is a looming, tangible danger. He actually had a meeting with the mayors of the legal settlements in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday night and also authorized the construction of more illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Regardless, the world is overwhelmingly supportive of a Palestinian state, and the only country really getting in the way of things is the United States.",

Well, I talked to this gym, Fitness 19, and I'm happy to say they do not tolerate this type of behavior. And this young man's membership has been cancelled immediately. He is no longer allowed to go to any Fitness 19 gym. Thank you, fitness 19. I'm gonna find one of your gyms in my area, buy a membership and support your gym.

    "voice_to_text": "This is a life changing hack for when you're training arms to get huge guns. Muscles work in antagonistic muscle pairs. This is basically just a fancy way of saying they work together and when one is relaxing, the other one is contracting. I'll give you an example when you're training your biceps. When you contract your biceps, your triceps is relaxing, and when you contract your triceps, your bicep is relaxing. The work in sync. They can't be be contracted at the same time as the Kapuli system. How can you leverage this in your training? When you're training arms and you're doing bicep curls, especially alternating bicep curls, what you want to do is you want to really squeeze your triceps when the other arm is working up, and then the opposite as well. So when one arm is up, the rest and arm that is completely straight is being contracted so that you walk in that triceps there, whilst you also walk in the biceps.",

    "voice_to_text": "The reason you out here walking around with a mid ass physique is because you got these narrow ass shoulders. But it's all good, cause you know, papa pump got you. And I'm about to put y'all on. If you wanna build 3D delts, you gotta focus on the 3 D's. Delt front, Delt side, and dealt rear. So I'm gonna show you guys how to hit all three DS, which is the cable machine. Now, for the dealt front, we're just gonna do a cable raise with a rope. Now, a lot of people go tell you, oh, you don't need to do front raises because you work them enough on your compound exercises. If you don't want to maximize results, then follow that advice. So now we're gonna switch out the rope for a D handle. And we're gonna raise the cable to about our hip height. So now we can work on that dealt side. Step out just like this. You can use your hand to brace you. And you're just gonna do a lateral raise just like this. Slow and controlled. Keep attention on that side dealt the entire time. Now, for the third D, dealt rear, we're gonna set the cable up right above our head, use the machine to brace ourselves. Again, we're gonna step out, carry the handle, hold down at a 45 degree angle, squeeze at the peak of the contraction, and carry the weight up nice and slow. I know y'all Are thinking, what about the compound moves? That's why you're gonna Wanna make sure that you do these exercises on your push day, that is primarily focused on your chest. And on your push day, that is primarily focused on your shoulders. That's when you're gonna Wanna do the compound moves. So make sure you guys try this shit out the next time that you train. And we start walking around looking jacked and juicy. Remember, papa pump taught you",

    "voice_to_text": "What is something people don't do in the gym that hurts their growth? Very simple. Track their progress. I'm a guy who brings a pen and a paper to the gym, and it's helped me tremendously. People that go to the gym and don't see any growth. Other people who have very low intensity at the gym and just do not track their workouts. Going to the gym with zero plan at all. I train like a bodybuilder now, but I Learned so much from powerlifting, and the reason why is because power lifters track almost every single lift. Here's a great example. I did 190 pounds with 10 to eight reps, and then the week later, I did 11 and nine reps with 190 pounds. Little things like this, especially tracking your workouts is going to make such a difference. People don't go to the gym, they don't have a program, they don't track their program, they're never gonna make those great gains. And this just ties into a world wind of things, you know, people go to the gym, they say they don't have enough time, and they spend two hours at the gym when they could literally spend only 45 minutes at gym if they just had super a high intensity. I could give you any piece of advice from someone who's been lifting for eight years now is track your workouts. It will make such a difference. If I understood this in my first three to Four years of lifting, I'd be a night and day difference. I promise you, tracking your workouts will make such a difference.",

Um, to certain extent, you have to blame the audience, to be fair, because if you want good content, stop watching shit content and stop engaging with it. Because these people give the people a platform, right? Watch videos about lifting. Like, for example, if I make a video about how to bench press, whatever, like, it won't get any views. But if you make a bullshit video, get a lot of views, the reason is, it's because the audience wants to see fucking brain rot content. I mean, you know what I mean?

    "voice_to_text": "Hello. I see you training chest day, my bro, or just chest? Yeah, and shoulders tomorrow. So how many times do you train a week? Five days. 5 what, bro? There's more efficient ways to train. I'm gonna start petition to stop the hate against pro split. Like push for legs. Up below. Up below is not more efficient than pro split. It's nothing to do the split at all. It is nothing to do that whatsoever. It's to do your total volume. If you don't understand what total volume means, it means this. Your. Your. You wanna train your back, you wanna go your back, right? If you do both of it and you train, you have a back day and you do 10 sets of lats. 10 sets of lats, right? That's fine. If you do push for legs, you have two back days. So you might do five sets, uh, five sets of last Monday, five sets of last Saturday. There's still 10 sets, of course, per week. Now people throw it. Yeah, but by split across the week, I can lift more. The load is relevant. The load is relevant. If you're taking it to failure, it load is it. You're completely. Well, it doesn't matter if you're doing. Working to, um. If you're working to 8 to 12 at range or 15 to 20 at range, it does not matter. So the load is completely relevant. So if you are feeling more fatigued at the Back end of workout and a bro split and you still take it to value? Guess what? You're still taking a fucking muscle to value, you fucking dumpty cunts."

You know, as long as you're hitting every muscle group at the appropriate frequency, you know, you get your like your two lifts per week per muscle group, then you're good. But I think there's something special about hitting arms all the way, and it might just be the fact that I love having an arm pump. Don't disregard that part. I just like it. But having your arms fully fucking pumped both at once tries by as ever. It is pretty cool. And then taking that to a second level is doing your arm day in a superset fashion. One set of triceps, one set of biceps back and forth instead of all triceps and then all biceps. Pump wise, your arms will never be more pumped. Not to say that it's any better, you know, if I totally wreck my triceps all on their own and then move on to biceps and wreck them, it's still a good a good lift. But if you've never really had like a straight up Tris by fully pumped at the same time, then oh my goodness, let's just say you're missing out.

We just choose to ignore that fact and plough ahead drinking Red Bull like it's water. I myself made the mistake of drinking two rain energy drinks and a big ass cup of coffee and sending myself into atrial fib. Why did I do this? Because I had been awake for 30 hours and I had six left to go. The ADA recommends that you consume no more than 400 mg of caffeine a day. Ha! I don't know about y'all, but 400 mg of caffeine to me is one drink. Have you ever heard of Death Wish coffee? I had. I had no idea how much caffeine was in it. So I made a pot of it and I drink a pot of it. That was the most productive I have ever been after having several cups of coffee. I sat down and did the math afterwards because I felt really hot after being really productive for about an hour. Realized I had consumed about 700 mg of caffeine in one sitting. It's not necessarily just the caffeine. It's all of the other god awful stimulants that nobody can pronounce that they cram into all of these cans. Some of them are worse for you than others, but a good rule of thumb is if you can't pronounce what's in the drink, you probably don't Need to put it in your body in the first place.",

When you get up in the morning, eat lots of eggs. Is it lots of eggs? Can have cheese, avocado, olives, nuts. And then don't eat. Wanna keep your insulin level low. Second meal, eat about 300 grams of chicken thighs, 300 grams of beef. Make sure the fat is with it. And then have some veggies with it. And have some more fat as well. The cheese, avocado. Four meals like that. So I'd have the eggs sometimes twice. I love the steak sometimes twice. That was it. And then after that, before you train hard, some carbs before another train. I felt like a fucking racehorse. I was building a lot of muscle. In the fucking supplement company came along. Oh, you gotta drink this fucking powder. How can you fucking sit there? Stop eating animal protein and drink some fat powder. Made some buy some fucking corporation in a fucking lab. What the fuck is wrong with you fuckers? If you wanna build muscle, stop drinking all this fucking protein product bollocks. Eat animal protein and see how quickly build muscle. 4 meals a day, high fat, high protein, carbs before And after training, that's it. See how quickly build muscle? You wouldn't store any body fat at all because your body would have Learned to use fatty acids and carbs to build your muscle. Wake the fuck up!",

    "voice_to_text": "I don't know a lot, but one of the most powerful lessons that I've Learned in my life is that if you want life stresses, struggles, trials, and tribulations to ultimately feel a little bit easier to deal with, you have to do intentionally hard things. Doctor Andrew Heberman, a popular neuroscientist with a great podcast, has one of my favorite quotes of all time, and it's something to the effect of, you need to do deliberately hard things so that when life's non elected challenges arise, and they will, you can say, I don't know how this is gonna turn out, but I know that I can do hard things and this is gonna be okay. Doing hard things is always worthwhile. So if you're wondering, what's the point of cold plunges? What's the point of sauna's? What's the point of going to the gym and eating well when I don't feel like it? It's because it changes your relationship to stress. When you stress the body artificially through cold water, heat, physical training, your brain only understands stress and no stress. The same neurotransmitters and chemicals are released in those periods of extreme, acute stress as they are when life's anxieties and struggles hit you and smack you in the face when you least expect it. The cortisol, the epinephrine, all those things are released in the same type of way. So if we can change our relationship to stress and allow ourselves to sit in it and Comfortably exist with stress in the gym or in ice cold water or in hot saunas, we can ultimately handle life's challenges a little bit better. I'm not gonna spout any studies to prove this. What I'm going to say is myself and many other people have felt similar ways about this matter. So if life just feels like it's bearing down on you and the last thing you wanna do is push yourself physically or do hard things, I implore you to do it anyway because it will change your relationship to stress and make the hard times a little bit more manageable. It isn't easy, but it is simple. Don't overcomplicate it.",

A lot of y'all don't know that he's already made a video. He's made a video about me. So I guess this woman posted a video talking about people walking through a video at the gym. A lot of people tagged me, causing her to post this video and a couple more to defend herself. Of course, there were people making comments saying that I only go after women, that I'm racist, that I only go after black creators, which people defended me for because it's an absolute lie. But there were comments asking her what she did for me to react to a video. She, of course, acted as if she did nothing wrong, that she was just responding to comments. So here's the video I reacted to. You can judge for yourself. Everybody that has so much to say about me filming in the gym yesterday, like, oh, I hope they being cameras. It's none of content creators fault that you're so insecure you just don't wanna be caught in the background of somebody's video. That's something you need to deal with, honey. That's personal. A confident person will be like, shit, let me just move out the way. If you got anything negative to say, you take your insecure ass to the house and do some home workouts until you're Confident enough to work out in front of people and not give a damn what they got going on? Not wanting to be in your video doesn't make someone insecure. Mean they have to kick their ass to the house to do some homework outs. You have no right to treat people that way. So I'll say it again, you need to do better. Mind your own business.",

I can\u2019t make that call for you specifically but MOST people will benefit from lowering how much volume they do and doing heavy loading (i do most sets 5-7 rep range, sometimes even 4 reps). It\u2019s all about the ratio of stimulus to fatigue. At a certain point you\u2019re creating tons of \u201cfatigue\u201d for literally no extra stimulus, if not diminishing returns.

He just looks unreal. Now, I know you're gonna say, oh, yeah, Joe, he's a fake, Nate, but I don't give a fuck. John Skywalker didn't even get me started on him. I used to watch, like, all the aesthetic montages of him just, like, stood there under the lamp post and show. And I just thought it was sick at the time. And the reason why I looked up to these guys so much is because they look sick. And they were still doing stuff, they were having fun, they were going to festivals, and they were just shredded. They look good, they were confident. And, I don't know, it just kind of, like, inspired me to look like that as well. And the way that everyone used to train back then was just go in, hit A weight. Try and hit a bigger weight next week and just get a good pump. And it was sick. But now I feel like everyone in the fitness industry just wants to be depressed. Just wants to wear massive oversized t shirts. Just get as big as possible and just be, like, depressed. I don't really understand why. Now I understand. If your goal is to be the biggest bodybuilder possible, you want to be a bodybuilder, you want to be on the stage, you wanna be posing. That is completely understandable. But if you just want to be a normal gym, go out. Just go into the gym, have fun, look good, and just enjoy your training. You don't need to be the most optimal motherfucker of all time. Just do bench presses, do literally whatever you enjoy, because realistically, the gym is just meant to make your life better. That's all it's meant to do. You're meant to be more confident in the gym, you meant to have fun, go in there, give you absolute all, and then come out and just forget about it. You know what I'm saying? Just. Let's stop making the gym such like, a horrible, depressed place. Just go in there, smash big weights, get good pumps, and just look good. That's what I'm saying.",

U momentu bu\u0111enja se lu\u010de velike koli\u010dine kortizola kako bi se organizam \"trgao\" iz sna i upalila motorika koja je aktivna dok je osoba budna. Sa takvim skokom kortizola dolazi i potreba za energijom kako bi se obezbedlo gorivo za ovakav proces. Jetra u tom momentu pu\u0161ta inekciju glukoze u krvotok, sa skokom se\u0107era ska\u010de insulin. Insulin koji pored obaranja tog \u0161e\u0107era iz krvi ima ulogu da ga trapsortuje u \u0107elije kako bi se svi sistemi aktivirali iz stanja mirovanja u stanje budnosti. (metabolizam nikad ne spava ali odrednjene telesne funkcije se usporavaju) Sa ovim procesom se obezbedjuje bu\u0111enje, enegija i startovanje sistema. Nakon pola sata od ovog procesa, insulin pada na nivo na kom je bio u toku sna. I taj niceo insulina \u0107e ostati nepromenjen sve dok se obrokom ne aktivira. Da li \u0107e to da bude za sat vremena, dva, tri... Sa ne poreme\u0107enim nivoom insulina se sama insulinska rezistencija, smanjuje. Ne samo to ve\u0107 i potreba za hranom, glad i potreba za brzom energijom u vidu slatki\u0161a. Samo zato \u0161to telo dosta lak\u0161e koristi energiju iz zaliha kad nije fokus prisutan na varenju i obradi hrane.

During the day, Cannon Beach is a popular tourist destination. But at night, it is known for having dark energy. After the sun is down, it is close to the public, but that does not mean the beach is empty. This beach is known for having extremely strong, ripped tides and has been ripping children out for hundreds of years, never to be seen again. We are all so young and scared. And since we were taken before we accomplished our purpose, we are all stuck here. At night, when the wind comes down, we all climb Haystack Rock and cry for home. But if you hear us, do not come near. You will have to go through the water to rescue. But it is already too late. And you will put yourself at risk of getting pulled into the ocean just like us.

Myofascial release is one of the best ways to relax the pelvic floor. Myofascial release uses deep pressure massage to help increase flexibility or the muscles and release tension and stress.  The pelvic floor is connected to your inner thighs so massaging them gentle with a foam roller daily can help so much to release tension in the pelvic floor.

And if we don't challenge the way I feel like it's like the last favorite. Five or eight years, like. So walking is exercise? What the hell is that? Activity of daily living. Wait, like, humans. Humans walk? Like, that's not exercise. Like, talk about the lowest possible standard. Like, I don't mean to offend anybody, but, like, I mean, maybe if you haven't worked out in forever, start with a walk, but my gosh, you're not exercise. See, come to a gym with me and you'll see someone exercise. Right? The only thing is that what are. You know, and. And just a side note, I don't think we should be setting, quote, goals. We need to begin to set standards for ourselves. Love it. You know, how are we setting standards? I love it. So here is my recommendation. There is no, um, replacement for resistance training. And this is not to offend. Doing yoga and I. People get very upset about their modality of exercise. God forbid that there is a problem. I need to be able to lift my 40 pound four year old up and throw my other two year old on my shoulder. And if I need to sprint and lift both of those little suckers, I gotta be able to do that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. You have to train for real life. We live in a physical world. Great. We have become domesticated. You must do training. You have to be a functional, capable, viable human.",

Yes, I ate 28 calories for breakfast, and yes, I'll probably have another 15 calories later today. Some of my favorite benefits of being in a calorie deficit is eating as much as I want without ever feeling like trash. Another benefit was losing almost 90 pounds in a very short amount of time. Two of my favorite benefits was having knee pain of over 12 years ago away by the third day of being in a calorie deficit. That's nothing compared to struggling with mental health on my life, but by the third day, feeling like a rock star mentally. Thank you! Calorie deficit. A unique benefit of the calorie deficit is that you never have plaque on your teeth. They always feel clean. You go to bed and wake up and they feel just as clean. You wouldn't believe some of the stories people share with me on their calorie deficit. Type 2 diabetes going away and being able to better manage their type 1 lifelong diseases, ailments, and autoimmune disorders just poof gone. Folks with severe skin issues clearing up within months. If you've had any success in the carnivore diet, please stop acting like it was anything other than a calorie deficit.",

Was probably one of the best decisions I ever made in my life and probably one of the biggest confidence boosters on the planet. Because I feel like, as a guy, your hair is so important and play such a big factor in how you feel about yourself and how you look. By buzzing, you're kind of just forced to focus on yourself and other shit that's way more important. When I buzz my hair, I quite literally stopped giving a fuck completely what people think. Like, I know I didn't look that good, I know it looks kind of stupid, but I got rid of the one thing that makes up for so much of my look. It helps me focus on so much other shit. I feel like as a guy, you don't even realize how much time you spend on your hair. Like, whether you're in a conversation and you're being a little bit self conscious about how it looks, or just in the morning, doing your fucking hair, getting out the shower, drying your hair. Like, buzzing your hair is literally the best fucking decision you can ever make. If you are looking for a sign to do it, this is your fucking sign.",

You know, the source of energy you get from these eggs as well is just fucking incredible, lads. So moving on here, the dirtiest pump in the land. Pasta. You know, it's a skin tearing pump every day with this fucking carbohydrate. It's fucking lethal. Then come back, you know, slap some fucking steaks straight on the sizzler, get them on the plate, down the fucking arch, straight to the bicep peak.

The thing about traffic jams, guys, there are no traffic jams in the last mile of the race. It's just you in the shadow. In the beginning, everybody's there. All the pretenders and the contenders, they're all there. But the last yard of life, last mile of journey, ain't nobody but you and your shadow. Traffic jams don't exist that far cause everyone else started giving up. That's what I like to the mental concept I'm going that far. I love the, the physical high of the burn being released. I love the mental high that I can prove myself. I love the mentality that I'm beating my competitor silently with. They don't even know it, they're all partying. I'm out here getting ahead.

I want y'all to understand the difference between IG TikTok workouts for likes and comments versus actual workouts that are effective for you getting rid of your big ass stomach. Just choose a weight that's challenging for your lateral raises and just do like 8 to 12 reps. You don't have to do all that shit. If the goal is muscle hypertrophy, just do eight to 12 reps on each legs. Just because you put in multiple workouts together, it doesn't mean that's contributing to more fat loss. What would actually be more effective? It's for you to do one workout at a time. That way you can maximize the muscle hypertrophy and the muscle breakdown for that specific workout and then go to the other workout. Now if you just doing that shit just because you enjoy it and you wanna burn calories and you wanna raise your heart rate, by all means, do that shit. But I don't want y'all to think that that type of shit is gonna be more effective for losing your big ass stomach.",

Now before y'all clowns come for me in the comment section, I'm not saying to not do cardio at all. Yes, do cardio. I do cardio, my clients do cardio. But I don't want you to do cardio with the primary focus being fat loss. You have to understand that even the most strenuous amount of cardio is only gonna burn anywhere between 5 to 600 calories during that session. So it'll be much easier for you to remove 5 to 600 calories out of your diet instead of trying to burn it on a treadmill. And that's not a lot of calories considering the fact that the average American assumes 35 calories per day. If you literally eat three Krispy Kreme doughnuts that crush your whole hour cardio session. Now what you wanna do instead is prioritize being in a calorie deficit and also progressive overload. Strength training. The reason why strength training is important because the more muscle you gain, the more that builds your metabolism, the more energy aka calories you expend at rest, which is literally your basal metabolic rate. Clowns and trolls in the comments. I'm not saying to not do cardio, but do cardio for the primary focus being cardiovascular health and also improving your endurance, not for fat Loss because that shit is not efficient. Now, if you really wanna lose body fat and you really wanna change your body composition, then comment the word fat loss below and i'mma reach out to you and see if I can help.",

Even the most strenuous cardio session that can last 45 mins to 1 hour is going to only burn anywhere from 500 to 600 calories. Which is not a lot considering the fact that the average American consumes 3500 calories per day. What would be more efficient & easier to do is to just remove that 500 calories from your diet! No 2, what would be more effective for fat loss is to primarily focus on progressive overload strength training. The more you increase your muscle mass the more calories you burn at rest, you\u2019re basically increasing your basal metabolic rate. This is important because increasing your metabolic rate will allow your body to be able to withstand more food & make it easier for you to adhere to your calorie deficit! Bottom line , I want you to do cardio to improve your cardiovascular health & endurance, not to \u201cBurn Body Fat\u201d. Now if you need help with eating in calorie deficit & progressive overload strength training to finally get rid of the mid-section and love handles\u2026.

The only thing that really M K. 6 7 7 is good for is increasing appetite. Like, that's essentially it. Most people are natural aren't even maxing out their appetite. And most people aren't even maxing out their appetite. Like, unless you kind of have an eating disorder, you struggle eating. I wouldn't even take MK unless you're on gear, and then a lot of people don't even know, especially these kids, about the main side effect of MK is that is gonna raise your blood glucose levels, which is gonna make you into resistant, which means that your weight might still go up if you're pounding food, but it's not gonna be good quality tissue that you're putting on. And a lot of them don't even know how to fix it. You need to monitor your blood glucose levels in the morning, and you need to either know about berbering. If that doesn't work, you need to know about Matt Foreman. Quality of food is also gonna play a big part. These kids are just like. It's just like a trend right now. Like, they're just popping MK, thinking they're gonna fucking Get small and reality there's gonna mess up the insulin sensitivity and probably get fat. But hey, it's a trend, so might as well hop on it.",

Um, I'm referencing the increased risk of lethal angioedema in African American patients that are prescribed licinoproral. Quite frankly, if the rates of angioedema were the same for Caucasians, this drug would have never hit the market. But because the rates of that lethal side effect are only high in black patients, the FDA overlooked it and passed the medication through to the market. While the cough is annoying, the cough happens due to the Renan angiotensin aldosterone system, which basically, it's a function of the lungs. Um, that occurs in the lungs to lower your blood pressure. And it happens in every ethnic group. It's just a side effect of the medication. Um, but it's not lethal. Angioedema is lethal. And on top of all of this, even though the rates of this lethal side effect are so high in African American patients, it is still so commonly prescribed to that population with no warning from medical providers.

    "voice_to_text": "What do you think the limit? What do you think the limit is? Unnecessary weight? Cause like I don't really think I've ever need to do like 200 is. But I do think the mechanical tension is a factor. That's the biggest factor. Just remember I say people in the body have no idea what were you lifting. The only know the position you put into it. When you start to focus more on the numbers, how much you can lift, you lose the attention to your focus on trying to move the weight so much, you lose the actual idea of what you actually trying to do. I dare you to try to do this. You're trying to do the muscle, the muscle doesn't care about the way you just as much as you put it through. When you can track as tight as you can without resistance and release it and contract again, that pushes before and have reached out muscle fibers and it causes growth. When you pound it out, just pension. That's the common of things are so small and you just kind of probably has more cardio, just become out of your weight. But we got to contract and break down those open up. That's what causes growth. So when I'm saying that, not because I don't know you freaking strong enough to live 200, that's an idea. Remember, it's one thing to powerlift, it's another thing to body build. If you find your ideas, I wanna build muscle. You gotta put everything towards that alone. So contracting this and try to make this open. You gotta make sure that every movement, you make the point. You appear to the point. Down here. Nothing but this takes attention. You draw on the fence. When you come delts and the shoulders have finished, you wanna make sure this takes everything. The more you can do that with every movement and don't have no waist movement, the more growth you're gonna consist of. So what I'm saying, bring the way down so you can read. Yeah, this, actually. I'll try it later."

First thing we need to do is get your nutrition sorted out. The best nutrition regimen is one that\u2019s conducive to your goals, sustainable for your lifestyle, schedule & one that you can adhere to long term. That looks different for each person. 2.) Secondly, we need to improve your daily habits outside of exercise that\u2019s going to be conducive to the aesthetic results that you want. That includes your activity level, how much you move your body daily, if your sitting at your desk 8 hours per day it\u2019s minimal activity it\u2019s pretty obvious why it\u2019s hard to tighten up your mid-section. We have to improve your rest, recovery , regeneration and tweak your overall routine to make sure that it aligns with you goals. This shit is about much more than just the \u201cworkout of the day\u201d. If you need serious help to lose the gut & love handles sustainably comment or dm me the word \u201cTrain\u201d & I\u2019ll reach out to see if I can help.

That shit is not gonna get rid of your big ass stomach. And if you don't believe me, all you gotta do is look down at your stomach and see if it's still there. The workouts alone is not going to change you. And I know I sound like a broken fucking record because I really want y'all to get this through your thick ass skull. What's gonna change you? Understanding nutrition, educating yourself on which you need to consume on a consistent basis to see the results that you wanna see. And also developing the habits outside of exercise that's gonna allow you to expand more energy so you can burn more calories, so you can be in a calorie deficit. Now listen, I'm not saying to not try to work out from your favorite fitness person. Do them. But I don't want you to think that that is gonna be a long term solution to get rid of your big ass stomach and keep the fat off of your body. If you want a long term solution on how you can lose body fat and really develop the education around nutrition and the lifestyle habits that you need to see long term success, then I want you to comment below the word train or DM me the word train and i'mma reach out to you and See if you and I will be a good fit to work together"

I'm gonna show you how to tighten up the rear roller, but I'm gonna show you the first thing to check first. First, first, first. First. Open up your motor hood like this and look at your drive belt. This goes from the motor to the front roller, which makes it go. Twist this with your thumb with the treadmill not running, otherwise you're gonna lose a finger. Make sure you can only pinch this up to about 45 degrees. It's got to bend a little bit, but you got to make sure this is tight first. Next, running your treadmill at about three miles an hour, get yourself the proper Allen wrench that fits in the rear roller. Give yourself a full spin here. Give yourself a full spin here. And then get back on the treadmill and repeat. After you tighten each side of the roller, hop on the treadmill and see if it's still jerking you off. If it isn't, problem fixed. If it's not, tighten it up some more. All better be super duper",

Um, it was thirty, 30 by 300 meters, and we had like 50 seconds recovery, which was just enough time to finish the 300 and jog kind of quickly, you know, for recovery, back to the start line for the 300 and immediately start again. Um, it took forever. It was really long. Um, there was no, like, sets. It was just 33 hundreds with 50 seconds recovery. That's it. Um, they weren't, like, super fast, but it was 30, so they weren't supposed to be fast, and they had a short recovery. And we live altitude. Um, I've never been that, like, drained after a workout. If there was ever a workout that I needed, like, a goo or a little snack in between, it was that one. Because I finished and I was like, I feel just, like, empty. My soul felt empty, my stomach felt empty, my brain felt empty from doing blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 300, 300, 300, 300. Um, crazy. Craziest, longest work I've ever done.

You don't need to dirty book like I do. I just do it because I prefer to do it this way. This year, I kinda went overboard and got to 230 pounds. As you can see, I have a lot of fat on my body, but it's okay. I do it on purpose to show you what you can achieve naturally. No enhancements, all natural. I've been cutting for about two months, and today I weighed in at 210 pounds. This is almost 20 pounds down from my original weight. And this is how I was looking today. I could already see a major difference in my body, especially my face. I've lost a lot of fat. And I'm explaining this entire process for you guys. First things first, I keep my strength training the same. When you're cutting, the goal is to keep as much strength and mass as possible. So you wanna keep your strength training up to par as if you were bulking. As you keep strength training, you wanna throw in some cardio. In my opinion, the best way to shred fat is an incline walk on a treadmill. So I implement that after every single workout. As weeks pass by, you increase your cardio weekly, maybe by every two weeks. If You don't know how to track your macros? You can go to Calorie Calculator on Google, type in your information and it'll provide you a chart of how many calories you should be eating to maintain or lose weight, depending on your goals, and you will start to see your fat shred off your body. I'm looking to make this a series and take you guys along on my journey. So if you wanna follow along, learn any tips and tricks on how to get shredded for the summer, hit that follow button. And until then.",

My first tear creates a monohydrate, which we've known about the performance benefits for years. We've known about the strength benefits, the body composition benefits. You take it everyday? Yes, I do. Um, now it's coming out that there's cognitive benefits, and I'm pretty sure they did a study that showed that creatin actually decreased depressive symptoms. So what I will say is if there was one I would recommend for everybody, it would probably be creatin monohydrate, because it's cheap, effective, and people say, wow, we don't know what the long term effects are. It's been around for like 40 years. There was long term effects. We. We'd have seen it by now.",

That's main and last cellulus gum. Stevie Lee super lows. Y'all better stay away from these, boy. Every American almost lactose intolerant. You do not supposed to consume no dairy. Go ask your doctor. And debot doctor, guess what he go say. Oh, the pyramid. You can have lactose. That's why when you get bubble guts, when you have ice cream and milk, you go poopy.

You need to be focusing on some form of hip thrust, meaning thrust in those cheeks together. Whether it is B stance like this, whether it is single leg, you need to be doing thrust. And you need to add some freaking weight on this bar and focus on getting stronger over time. Some form of deadlift. I like Romanians with a large band in the knee because it does target the glutes a lot more with this. Stretch squats. We wanna kick those running shoes off and we wanna do it in our socks or in converse or something flat. So you wanna include some form of squat. Whether it's high bar, low bar, we wanna be doing some form of single leg movement. I love a leaning forward with your torso Bulgarian split squat. But you can do lunges, reverse lunges, deficit lunges. We just don't wanna neglect our single leg movements. Ladies, give these a try. Let me know how it goes if you wanna grow this right here haha."

The difference between eating a banana and blending a banana is it raises your blood sugar at four times the rate. So that's why you always tell me not to add bananas to my shake. Drink the shake, eat the berries, drink the shake, eat the banana. Yeah, but to blend the banana, you skyrocket your sugar in a lot. It's not the sugar itself. It's the rate at which it raises your blood sugar. Mmm. So the Glycena index is kind of a measure of how fast does this have an effect on blood sugar",

These will not build muscle in and of themselves. Instead, here's what your 2 goals should be. First, the best reps. Don't prioritize high rep sets because on any set taken to failure, only the last 5 stimulate growth. These other weren't doing it. Therefore, lift heavier and reach those final 5 musclebuilding reps sooner. Since you're doing fewer reps, your workout will fatigue less while stimulating the same amount of growth. Next, the perfect amount of rest between sets. You must understand you're not just waiting for your muscles to recover, it's your CNS. It's what sends this out to push your muscles hard enough. Inadequate rest, inadequate signals, less than ideal growth stimulus. After you push your hardest, it'll take your CNS about 3 minutes to recover. Here's what I do for each type of exercise multi joint upper body movements 3 to 4 minutes, upper body isolation 2 to 3 minutes, multi joint lower body movement 3 to 5 minutes, and lower body isolation usually 3 minutes. Finally, keep your methods and exercises consistent each week and get stronger at them.",

There are some occasions where I might do slightly higher reps - shorter rest periods - and I may experience a burn/pump because of it. However, it\u2019s not what the vast majority of my workouts consist of. For the most efficient growth stimulus - you should follow this: - Train within a close proximity to failure without doing more reps than necessary - Rest until fully recovered between sets (the CNS takes at least 3 min when it\u2019s exhausted) - Don\u2019t train with the explicit goal of feeling a burn or getting a pump. - Keep things consistent & aim to get stronger Hope this helps you, ~ Davis _ #bodybuilding #bodybuildingtips #armworkout #triceps #biceps #rysesupps #gym #davisdiley",
