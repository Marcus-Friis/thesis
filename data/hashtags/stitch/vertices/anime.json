    "voice_to_text": "so this video reminds me of the Todoroki family and uh my Hero Academia and spoilers for My Hero Academia obviously but right I do wanna say first and foremost I think that Angie Todoroki aka endeavor is such an interesting character I think he's very well written and very well crafted um is he a terrible person yes I do think he's a terrible person his arc for atonement is very interesting to see as throughout the series we understand the effects of his authoritarian parenting style towards his children mainly towards Shoto who is very open about the fact that he does not like his dad at all and he only uses his ice quirk despite the fact that he has like an ice and fire quirk and you know we learn about one thing that we do learn about endeavor is that he wants to surpass all might he wants to be the number one hero he wants to be the top dog and he wanted that desired it so much when he was a younger hero and there was a huge ambition in drive of his and when he did not get that he interested to a quirk marriage essentially an arranged marriage and he marries Ray who has an ice quirk because he wants to have children who have a fire and ice quirk to create the ultimate hero but because of this ambition this leads to a neglect in emotional support and familial love within the family and thus he pushes his children with very harsh and very tough um training methods to try and make them into the ultimate hero now as you what may well know as an m H a watcher okay uh he has Toya his first child who only has the firework and Toya wants so badly and so desperately to gate to keep his father's attention to keep his father's love and he's driven by the desire of his father's approval now he's driven to the desire to the point where he pushes himself to very dangerous limits and I'm reading some notes that I have on my computer screen just let you know and it's really sad to see this because his father is disappointed that he only has a fire quirk despite the fact that he is still talented there is still obviously potential with in Toyota there's obviously something with in Toyota that he can you know mold and mend and like build into a strong hero but because he is not the example child or the golden child as Shoto turns out to be he abandoned him the same way he abandoned for Yumi and Natsu which is very disappointing and it's really tough to watch this um because then Toya pushes himself and pushes his limits to the point where he sets the forest on fire behind the south and also sets himself on fire which is very sad to watch and it's really heartbreaking because for the most part in the show you know there is a bad guy you know there is an abusive dad but there is something underlying there's something there it's like you bad but there's something else there we don't know what it is and when we finally find out how Toya dies and what happens to Toya we'll find out that Toya isn't dead Toya is Dobby and I think that's such an interesting reveal to have the fact that there is a villain a villain that's been terrorizing the city the city that you are meant to protect this villain is your son that you thought died and you pushed him to the limit because you wanna be the boy hero you wanna be a top dog you only had children so that they would carry on your name and your legacy and do what you couldn't do and then when you got what you wanted and you weren't happy about it you decided to you want a redemption and then you find out that your son the son you've been mourning the son you've been trying to the son that you were crying over is been alive this whole time and he became a villain and he hated you so much he was ready to set it off he said a nomu after your ass bro he said a villain after your son the son his brother his own brother that he used to cry to his brother used to play with that's how much he hates you bro the abuse was terrible I shouldn't be laughing it's honestly awful but like to build a story to write a story to create a character like that it's crazy it's also crazy to me cause when I go back and like I reread the manga I can't believe I didn't see it because Toya is like such a powerful villain and just because his flames are blue you don't expect like you don't think anything of it because like they're playing characters in My Hero My Hero Academia that have very similar quirks you know there are only so many quirks that you can have so it's not like the first person to think oh every single kid who has a fire quirk is Endeavor's child that's not likely but he does kinda look like him but you can't really tell because Toya is like you know a little bandaged up you know what I mean I just found I just find Toya's story to be so interesting and then seeing that in comparison with Shoto the Golden Child because Shoto for longest time didn't wanna use his firework he didn't like his dad he didn't care about his dad and it wasn't until the sports festival and Midoriya is like use it it's your quirk like having a therapy session in the middle of battle ha ha that's what I love about me my Hero Academia come on now Midoriya I love him so much and seeing Midoriya push Shoto to use his quirk thus pushing him to grow and develop and become a more powerful hero and to really like hone in on his power understand that it is his own he makes it his own he doesn't worry about what his father thinks or the pressure his father put upon him he needs to become his own person and to see him change due to that is something that's amazing and so impactful and I love it other things I wanna add really quickly there are people who don't like Ray the mother because she entered into the Cork marriage listen if somebody enters into an arranged marriage they don't really have any other options and I understand that Ray neglected his her children and and everything and being a neglectful parent is also a form of abuse however we can acknowledge the fact that she was neglectful towards her children as she was also a victim of endeavors abuse physical and it is implied sexual as well okay so let's not go too hard on my girl right and also I see people who are mad at Fuyumi Fuyumi uh Shoto's older sister because she tries to have family dinners with them and I want you to understand something there is always the kid in the family that tries to build the bridge and build the gap between the children and the parents cause there are gonna be kids that don't talk to their parents for whatever reason for whatever they've dealt with in their childhood and there will be that one kid that does talk to their parents that does build their relationship that doesn't end it and wants everyone else to do it as well because they wanna be one big happy family for you me wanting to do that is does not make her a bad person it doesn't make her an abuse apologist she is also a victim of Endeavor's abuse because endeavor neglected her because she wasn't powerful because she didn't have a strong of a quirk as Toya did or as Shoto did he did not you know train her or hold her skills or probably even pay attention to her really and also for you me is a woman and oftenized women are sidelined in my Hero Academia so like I find it so ridiculous that people don't like her character and on Natsu I think Natsu is a great character I think it makes sense that he doesn't like his dad even though his dad killed the Nomu doesn't mean he has to forgive his daddy be like oh I'm gonna forget the fact that my dad was an abusive asshole and is the reason why my brother is dead cause he thought his dad was the reason his brother died for that long and also endeavour put that on himself as well but he still did the hero work he still went back to work he still did the thing he was doing like it didn't change anything you know you lose your son because of the ambition you put on your children and yet you still continue to do what you're doing so we don't learn is that what it is and I also wanna say in terms of Endeavor's redemption arc there are a lot of people that are so quick to forgive endeavor he's a fictional character I understand that but let's understand endeavor like he's a real person and this is a real life scenario if he never really wants redemption if he really wants to atone I feel like you need to step away from the hero work we need to step away from the agency we need to spend time with our kids okay we need to do some real work possibly talk to the psychologist you know what I mean like actually put in some effort to make this happen because it's gonna be a lot harder than that and I feel like it never thinks it is mine if I'm a great hero from a good hero if I die while working then my family will be happy and he feels like his family will be happy if he's dead if he's not there if he's not around and in my eye I feel like you can have that with you there it just takes work it just takes you not doing the same thing you were doing before because the things you were doing before did not work now so while we continue to do that you know what I mean anyways that is my analysis on the Todoroki family um if you liked it great follow me I'm honestly gonna keep making more videos with my Hero Academia because the show the anime is almost over the manga is wrapping up and I love it so much I think it's one of my favorite shows in anime so yeah hope you enjoyed it",

And we know the islands in one piece are the size of continents. This makes this attack much larger than it actually seems. Now, ace created an average star, and he lost to the black hole. Perfectly written. A star losing to the black hole. Perfectly written. What are stars made up out of? Giant balls of hot gas. Mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. There's actually saying nothing that ace can't create stars. It just supposed to have its own self of gravity, which it was actually shown to have. And on top of everything, Blackbeard actually calls it the sun. The man that ate the yummy yummy no meat. The man that possesses the black hole is acknowledging he's fighting something similar to the sun. You really can't debunk that this is a star. And you really can't debunk that ace's star level because he did create a star. Thanks to all the Naruto fans, we know you scale to your creation feats. So they're gonna stay consistent with their own logic and give this feat to ace from one piece.",

    "voice_to_text": "Do a job that pays the bills and use your hobbies to emotionally fulfill. I've been on TikTok since, like, early 2019. TikTok has always been for fun for me. It was never. I never thought of it as a job. 2019 to this past year. So December of 2023, I made maybe, oh, November of 2023, I maybe made 70 bucks on TikTok. It was a no means reliable for me just to quit my job. And throughout that time, I about had 20 k, 15, 20 k followers. I had a good amount of followers, but I was just like, I gotta work, you know, I gotta help, you know, providing everything. From 20. Too old. To be fair. 2019 to 2022, I was in college, so I didn't really, like, I didn't really need to work, uh, and pay off bills and everything. But from when I graduated, from 2022 to now, I was. I got bills to pay. I never really thought as content creation being my full time job. I know, you know, people hate the TikTok shop, but I've had other opportunities outside of the TikTok shop to actually make money with TikTok. And from December, I paid for my rent. December, January, and February just with being a TikTok content creator. And I never thought I would be able to do that. And with people like King Lion, my dude and d. And just other, you know, Tik Tokers I've seen, or I'm Connected with. I'm like, Yo, I could. I could actually do this, you know, cause I know I'm not built to work for people. I hate working for other people just cause we just don't match up. Don't get me wrong, I'm a hard worker, but um, I've had, you know, bosses, I was like, I'm not giving your vacation time, I'm not giving your PTO. Oh, why? If you don't like, really just. We don't match up. So right now I'm like, yo, if I can get this content creation thing rolling, like, I'm, I'm gonna. I guess I can see myself doing this for a living because it, it's, it's fun and I enjoy, genuinely enjoy it. All this to say, if you wanna become a content creator or if you wanna pursue any other dreams, just do it. Just do it. Don't care who's looking at you. Don't care who's, you know, making fun of you. When I first started TikTok, people were like, why are you making videos about anime? Why you dancing on the screen? Blah blah, blah. I was like, I don't. I just don't give a fuck. Honestly, just don't care. Once you get out of that, that mental block and just start posting videos, bro, you will build a following, you will build a community. You. You like. There's. There's nothing limiting you at all.",

Naruto is the biggest glazer in all of anime. Looking up at the sky, seeing a shooting star, having nothing but happy thoughts, and you start gripping your bed sheets thinking about another man is nuts. The craziest thing about Naruto is that if you go back and watch, the friend that was there for him the most isn't even Sasuke. It is Shikamaru, and it's not even close. While all the other kids in the village were laughing and ridiculing distant themselves from Naruto, Shikamaru was the only character since the beginning that was supporting Naruto all the way. Almost the entirety of Shikamaru's life, this man was groomed to be Naruto's advisor. It is absolutely insane when you think about it. Even since Asuma's death, the only level of TIP writing I think compares to Naruto writing Sasuke is Madara writing Hashirama so much that he merged part of his body with Hashirama's. This just inspired me to make an entirely new video on the biggest meat riders in anime history. Let me know if you guys want that video and comment down below who belongs on that list.",

I did a few different color versions, but I ended up liking the white lace the most. The official death note artwork is so gorgeous. They really missed out on so much opportunity. I get a more basic jumper as well. I just love double way designs with the two sides. The jumper is more like daily wear, too. The Shinigami have beautiful designs too. And wings on the back is a classic. Is very loosely, obviously death note merch, which I get is a problem, but it's inspired by Misa's outfits more directly. Blue jeans.

So we actually already know how Boruto is gonna sound during the time skip and he sounds fine. I can't believe you went this far, Kawaki. Now don't get it twisted. I will call a spade a spade, and I will admit that his voice is high pitched for 16 year old male. But for reference, here's how I sounded at 16. He had to combine jutsu with the toads, which he did try to teach Naruto. He also had chakra ninja jutsu, and Naruto only had wind type chakra, so you wouldn't be able to learn the shit in the first place. The fact of the matter is, some dudes, including yours truly, are just simply born with a higher pitch voice. Is the way god made us man. I don't think there's anything wrong with Boruto having a higher pitch voice because it's something that can genuinely happen in real life. And I can't really speak for Naruto because I haven't reached my 30s yet, but you know, that's not unheard of either. We have a couple of famous people who have higher pitch voices as well, like Chris Tucker for example. And I'm about to whoop your old ass, man, cause I'm sick of playing games. You, me, everybody's ass around here. Him, Kaja, kaja! I'mma kick his ass! I'm Taking it, Kaja. Let me have it! Lee, no! Lee, no! Kaja!",

Not only would he not touch him because he's a low yeah, but he's also not touching him cause he massively outscale him in terms of spear. You kidding me? This is a no diff fight. Literally Caesar's clones is all that you need. You need one of Jesus clones to put Minato in the fucking ground bro, he's barely even city level. Fucking father out of here bro!

So I have a couple of questions at the end, but don't worry, it's not gonna be like, oh, was it really that bad? No, I believe you. Because, um, I've been hearing every single year that these big name conventions are fucking ridiculously bad. Personally, I think it's because we live in an age now where parasocial relationships are so prevalent, and I think COVID had something to do with it. I, I am, I'm not particularly sure because I've only been to two cons, and I'm doing, um, another one, um, next month. Um, but I do believe that the reason that connect again is just gone out the window completely is because parasocial relationships is. Is one of them, and people just don't seem to give a fuck anymore. That's what I've seen. I mean, again, I've only been to two cons and they've been kind of small. Um, but I, I think it's just people just don't give a fuck anymore and they just want to get their own selfishness out there. And I feel like some people kind of thrive on a power dynamic as well. Um, it's just my, um, thoughts, but that's just the way I see it. I haven't experienced anything of what you've experienced, but I've, and what others have experienced. But I do feel for those that have went through shit like that. So this is where the questions come in. This one's for you. How, uh, what was your most positive experience at a con? Because it just seems like there's a lot of negative press when it comes around cons over the last few years, and I kinda want people to be a bit more positive about their experiences. So what was your, um, most positive experience, uh, at a con? And the second question is, and this is to everyone that sees this video. Um, what things about connect, again, can you tell me, as someone who's only been a two cons, what about it again, can you tell me, what. Can you advise me on? Um, just shit like that, you know what I mean? Um, and what experiences have. Of other people had like that? Yeah. Just to put it out there, what experiences have you had at these cons? Um, you can tag us in the video, you can, uh, put a comment down, whatever. Um, I just wanna know people's experiences because it seems like cons are getting more negative press and more negative experiences are coming out of them. Um, it. It's just my own research, really, but yeah. I'm sorry that you've had a really bad time.",

Like, I. I can see the case for Makima, I guess, but characters like Kaido, characters like pain, not really any, like, long lasting effects on the main character. Like, instead of Kaido, I think you could replace him with Akainu, since he killed Luffy's brother and that caused him to go into a state of depression. Like, yeah, I think you can make a better case for. I can, you know, when it comes to pain, um, I would say replace him with Obito, because Obito caused was was the reason for Naruto's. Naruto's parents death, so I thought he would be a better picked other than pain for the other choices. Never gotten to my hero, never gonna JoJo's. I believe that guy's from Finland saga. Never gotten to that. Definitely can make a, um, an okay case. You know, she killed or he killed. Uh, one's a master, so that definitely left an impact on gone.

First off, the one piece world is only three times bigger than our world. And our world, mind you, can only reach up to a magnitude of 9.5 in an earthquake. It is stated by professional scientists that it is impossible for the earthquakes to ever reach up to a magnitude of ten. Now, I'm not about to do the estimate for y'all. Y'all could do that yourself. the one piece world would not be able to reach up to a magnitude of 50, nor can Whitebeard ever get it up that high. Cause I want y'all to remember this. Whitebeard's ability is to create earthquakes. There is literally no statements of him being able to reach supernatural magnitudes and earthquakes. Now, like I said before, even if Whitebeard was to spam earthquakes, it would not destabilize the earth. And I'll tell you the little secret of why. Because if the earth was to destabilize, that means earthquakes would not be able to happen. Because earthquakes are basically mechanisms for the earth not to go boom. So all Whitebeard is doing is basically just causing that mechanism to occur rapidly. I also wanna say one more thing. People are gonna probably say, oh, well, the feat that Whitebeard showed is basically impossible in real life, science or physics. It's really Not every day that an earthquake occurs, small islands start to move. Which means earthquakes can cause islands to move. So how much you wanna bet, if someone could create earthquakes while being on said island, that they could pick up the small island, especially if tsunamis were to occur around it? I bet a lot of money that they could. Also, the one piece world is not as large as our son. Our son is 109 times bigger than our earth. Let's please stop saying that.",

    "voice_to_text": "But do P stars and of models just not have a concept of the concept? I've actually known several people who started only friends accounts, and many of them have regretted it severely. Um, several cases include, you know, it was, you know, stay at home mom or you know, single mom or whatever who just needs some extra money just like his father. Um, and so they started the only friends account on a whim and found out it was much more than just posting, you know, sexy bikini pictures or lingerie pictures. Um, they were kind of coerced into doing things they really didn't want to do that were pretty explicit. And, you know, they say, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet. Like I said, most of our moms, right. And kids are cruel. Well, a lot of stuff ended up getting leaked for some of them, and their kids were relentlessly bullied and tormented and their lives were made a living hell because of it. Um, I knew several, um, who. Yeah, their marriage ended, um, they lost their job, tons of other things. So something it was done on whim does have. You have consequences for other people other than yourself. And the worst part is they didn't make a lot of money doing it. They legitimately. Cause only friends takes a massive cut of it. And the sad part is, they thought, you know, it was a massive blow to Their ego, too, because they thought they were hot stuff. And a lot of people just weren't interested, you know?

My ex and I broke up for many reasons. But one of those reasons was because, um, I really love Levi Ackerman. Um, he's not real, but, um, my ex didn't look like Levi Ackerman. And because of that, he thought there was no way that I was attracted to him because he didn't look like Levi Ackerman. He didn't believe me that I was attracted to him. And secondly, my best friend and I both really enjoy anime. We love watching it together. We send edits back and forth. We share fanfictions. You know, the normal things that best friends do. Well, he was so insatiably jealous at us talking about fake characters that he would rather me. He asked me to not speak about my best friend or our conversations or our relationship. Like, he didn't want to see the text messages whenever he was around. He wanted to see nothing about her pop up on my phone because he was so jealous about how we spoke about fake people. It's insane.",

Like, I don't know, too many games where I can run around and Merc my friends as Chucky all at the same time. Being able to hunt them down as a xenomorph. Straight up debone people while playing nemesis. What more do I need? To a certain extent I can understand because with every new killer that comes out, survivors are getting hold left and right as the killers keep growing stronger. A lot of people love Friday the 13th because at least you can do something against Jason, but in DBD all you can do is run, loop, and drop pallets. And even then it seems like the killers have all the advantage. Like if your juke game is not on 10,000 you're gonna hate this shit. I mean shit, they just added a new killer who's basically 4 killers in one. He can even block and pick up pallets. For a killer, this is a dream. For survivors, hell nah. But you see, as a resident killer man, I think that the struggles should give them some character. Cause all I wanna do is just hunt down the people I love with a psychotic teddy bear.

So we're talking about if the straw hats were at Marine for, would things have gone differently? Absolutely not. They would have gone way worse. The question you have to ask here is, how strong were the Straw Hats? And who is the strongest Straw Hat on the crew at this point in time? It's obviously Luffy. It's always gonna be Luffy. And Luffy didn't stand a damn chance against the vast majority of people on the playing field of Marine Fort. So if we included all the rest of the Straw Hats, what would have really happened? First off, we obviously needed Marine Ford for Luffy's development. Everything that happened with ace help push Luffy to become stronger. This entire thing was to let Luffy know that, hey, bro, you are not strong enough for what you're going up against. When you get to the New World, it's a whole new level, man. These emperors are something different. If Luffy didn't stand a chance there, the rest of his team didn't. And honest to god, the same thing would have happened. Ace would have gotten god. But the problem is, all of the Straw Hats would have been caught up in the fight and wouldn't have been able to escape. The fact that Luffy was able to quickly escape on LAW ship was super, super lucky. But again, LAW wouldn't have been Able to get all the Straw Hats out, or they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own ship to get all the way out. There's just no chance they would have done any good work there. It. It would have been dark, so. Yeah. Um. Why weren't the Straw Hats there? Because they didn't need to be there. We needed the story to be able to move forward. If they were there, one piece would be over, and someone else would be king of the Pirates.",

    "voice_to_text": "well if you read the actual chapter he wants you to feel bad no one feels spoilers for 2 6 1 in the JJK manga so I agree with the first part of this now I've watched this creator's entire catalogue of content on JJK so I don't know if they said this in other videos but I got a rebuttal here he is very much correct that we're not meant to be feeling good about this I first read it my stomach dropped and I felt horrible I was like uh what the fuck did I just read my initial reaction was this isn't good this what the what the fuck and a bunch of the story ideas that I thought were gonna happen seem impossible but it does seem like it's possible it's just gonna be done slightly differently and what he said about you know to become stronger they need to get rid of their humanity it is correct but it's not the answer because the ending of the show isn't gonna be ah yes Sukana was right for sake of humanity right that doesn't mean Sukana might not win at the end of the day but it's not gonna be the philosophy that should be driven home and that's why I don't think that ending even if it's dramatic is gonna be the one that Gaga picks Yugi is going to be the one that shows that humanity will be the strongest asset and that it just takes a lot lot lot of work we've had like three or four characters try and teach Sukana about love about empathy about you know uh putting your faith in in others we had Megumi's sister oh she got taken I can't remember her name but she was trying to do it we had Gojo kind of like that kind of that thematic there now you two's doing it and Yuji tried you just gotta be the one to get through and I'm not talking talk no jutsu type shit where he's gonna go Tsukana what about humanity they're gonna somehow get over their differences no you just going to win the fight with the power of humanity somehow I don't know how you just has to lose this fight but it's going to be because he's not a monster enough he's not Sukina you can't beat him at his own game and Gojo is going to be involved I knew always knew Gojo was gonna come back in some shape or form and it was gonna be to me it was exactly like this but I didn't think you there was gonna be like the Ratatouille Frankenstein controlling the fuckin shit type beat I knew he's going to come back to try and finish this arc because uh I'm in a lot of discourse I'm in a lot of community you know communities where we talk J J K and they all say Gojo's Ark was done but it's not because Gojo's Ark needs to finish the question of who is Gojo is he Satoru Gojo because he's the strongest or he's the strongest because he's Sasuke Gojo you to he's going to answer that question I thought that he was going to because in a lot of the dialogue and all the flashback and especially in 2 6 1 and 2 60 showcases that Gojo's mindset was wrong this entire time he hasn't Learned he didn't take Ghetto's words what he was actually saying he was too focused about him going full on with you know what his ideals were and he realises himself that he needs to follow follow through he didn't understand ghetto and he tried to do the opposite for his students or his sons tried to put the idea of living and fighting for humanity but unfortunately he does a very much and I can't remember who said this recently he does uh don't say what I uh don't do what I say do what I say do that whole phrase you know what I mean he says one thing but he does another and then they copy the other so in turn they all become monsters Mark is a monster you just becoming a monster Yuji is on the verge of becoming a monster they're all forsaken the humanity and Marky does try and say hey this shit's not cool so maybe she's not as far as the others but Gojo has to be the one to be here at this moment I think his body is super important to be here for this message the symbolism a lot of it it just works it really does with with his imagery being here and to drive that message home I almost can't see it any other way the unit bit that that's interesting um and we'll see how that goes 2 6 2 comes out next Thursday let's go",

    "voice_to_text": "People say that is Naruto taking those attacks. You guys are probably wondering why I'm making this video. Is because I'm your guys teacher. You guys are my students. He's saying because Naruto, after you got hit with the, you know, the trigames fucking thing, the gentle fist, that because its intent was to disrupt his chakra network, shut it down. That his ability to retaliate and his well being are still intact. With that same logic, and I'm gonna show you guys these death beams. If you get touched by them, their intent was to kill him. He says hit, it hits him and it does nothing. Definition of Goku. And he absorbed the attack with little or no effect on his ability to retaliate or well being. He fits both those fucking criterias. He was still able to retaliate and it did absolutely nothing to his well being. While for Naruto, it hurt his well being so fucking much that after that attack, he literally gets hit 12 or less times at the rest of the fight, and then he's out of fucking commission. And what way, shape or form is he tanking the attack? When he won, he didn't even take a lot of damage. Afterwards he was taking little. While Goku, when he was fighting Frieza was getting hit like 50, 60, 80, 100 times and he was still able to fight. He was getting hit by all these blasts and everything else. Dragon Ball characters Are literally getting hit like hundreds of times and they're like I can still keep going. Their ability to to retaliate and their well being is not really damaged all that much. While in Naruto he gets hit with that gentle fist, then he go gets hit 12 or less times and he's out of the fucking fight. Same with Sasuke. Sasuke actually got out of the fight multiple different times during that momoshiki fight. Sasuke almost died three times during that momoshiki fighting. Was saved and healed every single time. He is a glass cannon. So again, understand what fucking tanking means you dumb fucking morons. Retaliate or well being? If your well being is fucking hurt but you're able to still kind of retaliate. Like gaara versus Rock Lee. That is a prime example. Just cause you're able to retaliate does not mean that your well being was completely just not done. So I don't know why he thinks that. Because it wasn't shut down, that is well being wasn't fucking hurt. If my attack was intended to fucking kill you, and it literally brought you to the brink of death, but it did not kill you, does that mean since the intent did not work, that somehow you still take the attack? No, because you did not absorb little to no effect on your fucking well being. Smooth brain fucking idiots.",

Okay, so without further ado, folks, I'm gonna do my top three favorite. Uh, sorry, saddest anime deaths. Started with number three. That one's gonna have to be Neji Hyuga from Naruto Shippuden. I remember I was literally bragging about how awesome I think that character is the morning before that manga came out, and I was talking about how awesome he is. His methos. His move set everything and open the manga and burst into tears. Right? I realized what I've been talking about, and it was just wrenching for me that. That's why that one so personal. Number two is going to have to be Jiraiya from Naruto Shippuden. Um, reading it. I did read the manga, and reading it, it was hard enough, man. It was. It was wrenching. But then to see it animated, it absolutely ripped my heart out. And number one is going to have to be Maze Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist. Um, if you know. You know, um. It was a gut punch to see an animated character so well done as a family man, and then for them to just murder him in front of us and have his daughter crying and screaming at Mommy, why are they throwing dirt on daddy? Oh my god, if you didn't cry at That scene. You're a monster",

    "voice_to_text": "You gotta stop telling people to start with attack on Titan. Like as a first starter anime. I'm a double down on this because she is absolutely right. She spoke no lies. When you introduce somebody into anime who's never seen anime before, do not start with attack on Titan. Because after they finish attack on Titan they're gonna think the next animes after are gonna be peak or ass peak as attack on Titan. Which is false. Hell, I'll even say this don't even start with the sinister six or aka the new gen animes as your first animes. Black Clover, Demon Slayer, Chainsaw Man, Fire Force, JJK, and My Hero Academia. Some of those animes are interchangeable depending on your opinions, but I know I would not tell somebody to start watching those as their first animes because a lot of it is bad shit. Wild, she mentioned Death Note as a first anime. I approve. I approve of that. This nigga had me weak the entire anime. Buddy was chilling the entire time with all the BS. Was going bro this man had me weak and I love Ryuk and the OG himself l this dude was fucking intelligent the entire anime. I love him so much. One thing she should have mentioned is everybody's taste in anime is like a movie. Movies have different genres, animes have different genres. So I always ask a person when they're coming into anime what genre of movie do you Like and if you can name me the genre movie then I can start. Maybe recommend the types of animes you might like. Another thing to mention is also the big three. Unless they're willing to watch 300+ episodes of an anime, let them do it. But don't recommend Naruto, Dragon Ball, one piece and all them other ones. Don't even mention those because they got a suit through that BS. Like how the OG anime watchers did back then. Another thing you had to realize is that not every newcomer to anime is gonna fuck with shonen. They're not, cause not everybody is for shonen. That's why it is important to ask the new person to anime what type of genre of movies do they prefer? Now, if they like romance movies, okay, you can recommend that. But if they ask something outside of romance movies, okay, well then you can introduce them to other forms of or other genres of anime that they might take a liking to. But that's just, you know. I would say a safe way of them not to abandon anime. Because a lot of new anime comers think that oh, it's all about screaming, fighting, blood and all that, all the crap. Which is not the case.",

And why wouldn't? Because you're talking about an extremely popular show in anime that currently, the manga, has sold over 70 million volumes. And that sequel series, The Hundred Year Quest, the series that you claim that no one is looking forward to. It's currently has 16 volumes and it's still going to this day. Barely. There are people who still give a shit about the series for it still being going all this time. But I digress. Why I find it so ironic is that you claim that no one else cares, that includes you, but yet you decide to make a minute long rant about an extreme popular series that you claim no one else cares. That's genuinely like saying no one cares about their shirt getting wet, but the moment you got your shirt wet you threw a hissy fit over it. Like, see how completely stupid that sounds? Before anyone asks, I legit don't care whether or not he likes fairy tale or not. If he doesn't like fairy tale, that's completely fine. If he doesn't like it, hundred percent. Okay, but genuinely, if you're gonna make a rant about an extremely popular series, don't make some stupid ass claim that no one cares about it. But you immediately contradict yourself by making a Video about a series that you claim that no one cared, including yourself.",

It's not gonna end well for you. It just never does. It never does! You always do shit like this, and it never does. This is. Is this your man's like? What? What are you talking about? The only reason Sasuke beat Itachi. Cause Itachi said he could, bro. Because Itachi let him out of the good graces of his heart. Itachi said, here you go. Beat me so you can have my eyes, bro. Great, right? No, no shit, bro. I love Itachi, don't even get me wrong. But Sasuke. Come on, bro. All Sasuke did was cosplay as the lead singer of my Chemical Romance and get carried the entire show by other people, bro. If it wasn't for his brother letting him fucking win, he would be dead way early on. And this is what Killer Bee did to Sasuke. Imagine what fucking Zoro would do, bro. Oh, my God! Zoro then vowed to never lose again. And guess what? He never did, bro. What? Again? And you know what's gonna happen when these two fight again? Zorro's gonna beat him! And he's gonna beat him fair and square with his fucking swordsmanship! That's it! He's not gonna get no help from fucking Brother Itachi! He's not gonna get help from a random ass character in order to get him Somewhere he's not gonna get bailed out by plot armor. He's just gonna fucking do it, bro. Because he's him. Don't ever compare Naruto and Itachi's son to Fucking Zorro again, bro. Get out of here with that. Don't forget to join the discord link in bio for all things anime! Let's go!",

Wait a damn minute, King Lion, did you just concede two dimensions of pocket dimensions all being universes? Because if that's the case, then Kaguya is universal by your own logic. But you still arguing that Naruto isn't planetary. This woman quite literally creates pocket dimensions like they're fucking candy. And this the same woman that caught the meanest left hook in anime history from Naruto. And I just know this shit cracked her jaw into a million splinter pieces. Bro, I'm exaggerating, but you get what I mean. She got a clean left hook to the fucking face like this. Clearly rocked her shit. So by your logic Naruto is universal cause he put the meanest hands on a goddess that makes pocket dimensions for fun? And according to you, pocket dimensions are universes. So technically by your logic, Kaguya is multiversal because she created several different universes and Naruto was able to beat her, so he's multiversal as well. So you mean to tell me that based on your logic, Naruto is able to put the pause on Goku? I mean, your words, not mine. I'm not the one that said it.",

He's throwing away everything that he is, everything that is made him good, in order to protect the jujutsu society who doesn't give a fuck about him besides his power. He made the plan, but he's talking about the fact that he has to become a monster in order to do so. That's a fucking punishment. And he's pissed when he's making the plan with Gojo. It is so clear that YouTube does not wanna do this, but he has to do it for the sake of the world. His parallels with Gojo in this chapter are absolutely nuts. How they are useless weapons for the jujutsu world and how they need to do what they need to do because of the power that they were given. Even Gojo talks about the fact that Yuta has more potential than Gojo does. More natural potential. And I think that you just gonna come back into his own body. But how is dying not a Fucking punishment bodies in half. He's literally on the surgery table. The only way he can keep himself alive is by transferring his consciousness into his teacher and making him more of a living weapon than he actually was. This is one of the cruelest things that gay gay has done in Jujutsu Kaisen period. You think Yuji was traumatized by watching everybody who he loves dying? Shibuya? Well, you just gonna be more traumatized by having to go into his teacher's body to defend the world against sukuna like he's Fucking Frankenstein. Yes. This shit is a punishment. Like what?

He's bigger one to try to make it seem like Utah does. He was willing to throw the whole plan away just because he didn't wanna see his sensei die. He didn't wanna have to resort to using his own body. Would rather create another plan in itself than try and go through when he has to. It isn't into a Hakari. And Maki and Kusukabe tell him to sit still. And Kashimo. He stays along with the plan. The only person who doesn't care is Yuji. And he doesn't know about the plan. Look at this emotion. Look at his face. He doesn't wanna do this. Maki also knows what he's gonna have to do. She's consoling him. They didn't wanna peep game though. See ya",

The reason that we don't like drinking with y'all is because y'all don't know how to drink. We came from a generation where when you drink, you didn't drink in access. You didn't drink to forget. You drink to have fun. This is a generation of people, my generation, who created fun. We created it out of thin air. You didn't have a ramp. You grabbed a center block and wood. You didn't feel like running, you put two wheels together, and you figured out how to make a bike. Okay? Like, this is what we did. Look, this is what he's talking about right here. Take a look at this. This is what I wore. Okay? This is what I wore. I was inosuke. I wore this all day. My neck is throbbing. Guess what? Alcohol is the medicine for that. You don't need Robitussin. You don't need Tylenol. You need drink. You know how much we paid for drink? Zero. We drink all night outside. Old school. Remember those days of partying in mall and movie parking lots? That was us.

    "voice_to_text": "One of my favorite details about tobirama is the fact that he's a water style. You now, that's not even the funniest part in my opinion. My favorite part about tobirama is not the fact that he was a water style user predominantly and didn't create a overwhelming amount of water style jutsu. It's the fact that a lot of the jutsu that he made, or specifically to counter the Uchiha. He hated them boys so much that he went out of his way to invent moves just so he can counter theirs. I'm not gonna go too far into detail unless y'all want me to, but you know how the Uchiha are predominantly fire style chakra users. Their main element is fire fireball jutsu, all that fun stuff. They are a fire clan predominantly. And he was a water style user and he just decided to make the water dragon jutsu, who's just a big fucking water dragon when it's in the name. I know, shocking, right? Just to counter them and their fire style. And then not only that, but flying rising, right? You know why he created that? So he can counter their Sharingan. You know, the whole precognition thing. He was like, oh, you can't judge my next move if I am behind you instantaneously. There's like, you can't track me if I'm moving instantaneously. I'm just gonna go bop over there. You're gonna go over here, I'm gonna bop over there. You don't even know Where the hell I am anymore? Your Sharingan's useless against that, so just remember that Naruto couple other people got some of the most powerful jutsu, some of the most versatile weapons in their arsenal just because tobirama was a D1 hater. He hated them so much that he spent pretty much his entire life just figuring out new ways to fuck with them. If you want me to go into detail about all the stuff that Toby Rama invented, leave a comment or something. I don't know, I don't do the engagement thing. Just figured I'd try it.",

Like, their personal goal is, um, and also going home and, like, consuming a bunch of anime. And it's really cool to see. Um, it's cool that powerlifting in general has like, skyrocketed over the last, I would say, like, the last, like, 5, 6 years, I've seen it, like, just skyrocket because, um, the people who are kind of at the forefront of, of that and kind of like, the influencer lifestyle, they actually, like, seem cool and relatable.

    "voice_to_text": "Explain to me how Kaguya makes a truth seeker orb again. I got you. King lie! I want to do something that the Naruto fans are unable to do. Exactly! Explain how she's even able to create these things. An expansive Keke Mora. Uh. Truth seeker or that contains each and every nature. Wind, fire, lightning, water, shadow, and light. But we need the full context. How was she able to pull this off? Now this is what is important. It's not just the fact that this is how it's created, but it's how she was able to do it. This rude time space is mother's exclusive domain where she can directly extract Chakra from Shinobi trapped in the infinite Tsukiyomi. The Biju are now stable. Plus mother has even produced a truth seeker or. So the reason why she was able to create this true seeker or was because she took the chakra from all of the people from this infinite tsuki yogi. She was gathering their chakra so that she was able to create this. And before someone says she did not need them cause she already had all the nine Biju. If she had all the nine Biju, why did she have to take from the entire Shinobi alliance to create such a feat? If she's able to do this on her own five times over with all of her other dimensions that she had created. Which would make no sense narratively. If she's able to do It by herself with just ten tails Chakra. Creating five different universes or five different dimensions on her own. But now she needs the people of the Shinobi Alliance to create one. But she's able to create five on her own before. I hope this helps. King Lion. She's not able to do it on her own. She did need the entire Shinobi alliance in their chakra to give the crate such a feat. And not only this, she also needed Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, and Sakura as sacrifices to create this new dimension. That's why they were so afraid and needed to seal her away. Because they were going to become the sacrifice for the new dimension to even happen. Along with everybody else from the Shinobi alliance. So. Yes! King Lion. I got you! I'm a teacher! You're a teacher? We're teaching the students of Naruto. I hope this helps. You can spread this to anybody. Or just not. But. Hey! I got you! I'll do something the Naruto fans couldn't!",

Is the moment in Dragon Ball Super when Master Roshi did his final Kamehameha in the tournament of power? Well, it's not really his final Kamehameha, but. Bro, I swear we were gonna lose Master Roshi forever. Forever. And there's gonna be all these people in the comments, are you really just reviving with the Dragon Ball? He already been revived with the Dragon Balls. How you gonna get him back? You can't. Ninjas reviving with the fucking the Meki and Dragon Ball. We already did that too. This one wasn't really heartbreaking, but it did make me cry. It was Irwin's final speech. Like, that shit hit me hard. Like, I was a good one, Irwin. I'll still die for you, motherfucker!",

    "voice_to_text": "What's a video game that you know will never exist, but you would pay so much money to see happen? Bro, hear me out. A one piece open world MMO, RPG. You choose your race. So fish, man, human, whatever you wanna be. You could be a. A mink. Um, I mean, there's plenty in. Secondly, you choose whether you wanna be a pirate marine, or you just wanna explore the world and do whatever the fuck you want. But the big twist is when you're out there, you can obviously choose to eat a devil fruit if you find one, or just continue as you are. But if you do eat that devil fruit, you're stuck. Whatever power you get completely changes your character, customises your build. It'd be really interesting, um, you know, and nobody would know what the devil fruits were. They wouldn't be labelled or anything. You just have to take a chance. Obviously, the goal of the end game. Find the one piece.",

Give me, give me. Anybody else? Sasuke is a great character. I think any other good character is better than him, so I'll take Naruto one piece. Um. You got law. I'm not mad at that. Law is a pretty awesome, amazing character. So putting law. I'm. I'm not mad at that. I'm not mad at that. Aizen and bleach. I think there are other characters that are, uh. Better characters than Aizen. You can make a. Uh. Ichigo. I would make a case for Ichigo. You can make a case for Rukia. You can make a case for Yuha. I think Yuha is a better villain than Aizen, so yeah. Disagree with that. Never really gotten a hunter x hunter. Skip that. Jujutsu Kaisen. They got maki. Um. I'm anime only, so right now I would disagree with that. I hear in the manga Mike Mikey get some pretty good character moment. So this probably a whole truth in the future, but as of right now. Uh. Uh. But Jujutsu Kaisen. Who would I pick? I'd probably pick. Um. Ghetto I guess. Or. Or Gojo. Yeah, or Gojo. Never got no attack on Titan Black Clover. Yummy. Hmm. Yeah, I'm not mad at that. Um. You can make a case for yummy. Or Marilyn Monroe like. So I think either One is fine. Next we got Dragon Ball Z with Vegeta. I definitely agree with there. I think Vegeta is one of the best written characters in Dragon Ball Z. Him or Piccolo. Like, I think that's a pretty easy case to make. And with my hero. Never really got into my hero. I think that's my hero. I don't know. Um, I. I really can't tell if that's my hero or not. Never got into my hero, so. Yeah. You guys tell me your thoughts in the comments.",

This is a game changer. Guess what? Oh, he ain't catch it. He did not catch it. No. Looking like a big ass centipede with a claw clip on his back. Cause that would have been intimidating.

like going on a rant and Instagram stories being like this is my ideal con bag and I am so happy that I feel just justified um but mine has a few differences you can already see that I don't have that extra pouch on the front I don't have the like water bottle pouches but the main difference is mine is a backpack and as you can see uh I don't need the water bottle pouches on the side because I opted to have like a water bladder so I wanted to do that specifically cause I have a lot of dietary restrictions so the top of my bag just similar to Steff's if you haven't seen her video yet go back and watch it um but I'll be treating my top pouch is kind of like a lunch bag essentially cause I have to bring food with me to events and the water bladder will act as like an ice pack cause I'll have ice water in it but I also hate having to take off my bag to access my water bottle or carry my water bottle around cause I'm someone who's like constantly taking small sips um so I literally just on the backpack I put the hose I used one of those like badge reels like this is like a multi pack from the Dollar Tree um but yeah so that way I can just take a sip whether I'm holding my bag however I need to I can take a sip and I can let go and it go right back to where it is um so that's like one of the biggest differences in ours um but yeah is the fact that mine's a backpack but I use mine very similar really I have I think on one side see I'm very forgetful so I always keep a notebook with me so I can write things down because if I feel like I'm forgetting something I will usually just check the notebook because normally it's in there um I don't like the taste of water so um in normal water bottles I have like little flavor adder things pens um eyeglass wipe let's see what's inside I have like my hand sanitizer hanging off see I have Band Aids tide pen more flavor water things can you tell I'm getting ready for an event because I have so much to flavor my water with um but yeah my top pouch very similar I have a mesh bag my strap and like the little like divider I just have in here because the water bottle takes up pretty much the entire top but even with it being completely full there's still plenty of room um I don't have any food in here cause I don't need to yet I have like my meds um and I think there's just more flavor different flavor things in there so that's what's in my top pouch um I haven't fully stocked this for Phoenix Fan Fusion just yet but I still wanna show what this bag looks like and what's capable of and the fact that it does come in different colors like I wanted pink so I got mine in pink uh I have the like clear zipper pouch which seems like very good for like wet things so I do a lot of mermaiding so that is perfect um my top pouch is personal item so external batteries I've got sunscreen meds Chapstick things like that in my top pouch and then I also have like a cosplay maintenance my sewing kit is currently on the table cause I'm currently sewing um but I also have a few fun things in here um I have my like makeup wipes I don't tend to use makeup wipes but sometimes I get overstimulated and makeup needs to come off um I also have downy wrinkle release I wear a lot of natural fibers and that is a wonderful thing to have um I keep a couple different glues like fabric glues uh the Eileens okay to wash is probably my favorite another tide pen I'm very I'm prone to like getting small stains on me um I do a lot of I end up doing a lot of wig work at cons I will help people with their wigs so I have an entire little like roll for wig stuff I believe I have a video already up that shows this in detail if you're interested um I have I always keep like little doggy trash bags as like little extra small trash bags cause I have a tendency to accumulate just small pieces of trash so I'll just have that and I'll just fill it up throughout the day and then throw out one bag cause I'd rather not litter um these little personal fans are amazing I got this one for free um but I love that it's a carabiner cause then I can clip this to like my other backpack strap and I just have it readily accessible to me if it's hot so that'll probably be out and about the entire time at Phoenix Fan Fusion um but if I but let's I think that's pretty much everything that I have in here um I'm so glad I feel just justified in this being an ideal con bag um it is at like kind of like a fifty dollar price point on Amazon um but in my opinion it was worth it for me Steff found it worth it everyone's gonna be a little different so I understand if it doesn't work for you but if it does work for you let me know this is just oh so yeah just nail [tech] organizer bag on Amazon is kind of like the wording you wanna look up to find this kind of bag these did have like a nail polish insert in them but it's just a bit of foam you just pull it out but yeah thanks for watching",

And I would like to ask if you ever watched it and liked it, please donate $1 to the Palestinian family that I am fundraising for. I have always shared my art for free online, and I have enjoyed participating in the fandoms that I am a part of. However, if my art can be used for good, I would like it to be okay. If you've ever enjoyed anything I've made, please donate $1 to this Palestinian family. The link is in my bio and it will be down in the comments. I know you might think giving one dollar will not do anything in the long run, but it will get them one dollar closer to their 15,000 dollar goal. Okay, they are at 3,000. We can get them to 15,000. Please, I am begging you. The algorithm does not treat these videos with any sort of respect. So please, if you have it, give it. Okay? And thank you so much for anyone that's donated or given anything. Okay, thank you.",

Sasuke, through the entirety of Naruto, had no idea what he wanted. First, he wanted revenge on his brother, which is totally understandable, but it wasn't even a satisfying kill. Itachi didn't wanna kill Sasuke anyway. And plus on that, Itachi was sick, so Itachi would have died regardless if he fought Sasuke or not. Then after learning why Itachi did what he did, he was like, you know what? I'm gonna destroy the whole hidden leaf. Which is dumb, cause I would have had specific targets in mind. But shout out to that man, cause he did get his leg back on Danzo and he smoked Orochimaru. So shout out to that man. Didn't smack in the middle of the war, he shows up and was like, you know what? After this war, i'mma become hokage. When they won the war, he was like, you know what? I want everyone to hate me. I'mma take on the world's hatred. So i'mma kill Naruto. To start that. Gets his arm blown off. He was like, who am I?",

Moi personnellement je trouve One Piece le plus grand d\u00e9faut de Oda, c'est la narration. Waouh ! Et c'est 1 avis hein, mais je suis tellement pas d'accord ha ha. Donc pour remettre dans le contexte, Dono ici parle de la lenteur de One Piece et de certains chapitres, mais je trouve quand-m\u00eame que l\u00e0 tu fais des tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s grosses g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s hein. Parce que certes, bon, pour le chapitre 1000, entre mille-cent-treize et mille-cent-quatorze, certes c'est 1 peu lent pour rien, mais faire de tr\u00e8s grandes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9s bas\u00e9 sur \u00e7a surtout One Piece, ah, je trouve \u00e7a tellement faux. Alors oui, One Piece c'est extr\u00eamement long. Par contre, c'est pas parce que c'est long que c'est long, je dirais m\u00eame que dans sa grande globalit\u00e9, mise \u00e0 part certaines exceptions, One Piece c'est pas lent, c'est pas lent, certes, \u00e7a prend son temps pour mettre en place certaines choses, expliquer des contextes, expliquer des enjeux, expliquer des personnages, des du pass\u00e9 de certains personnages. Mais c'est \u00e7a qui fait la force de One Piece. Donc \u00e7a, \u00e7a en fait quelque chose de long, mais pas quelque chose de long. Et heureusement que One Piece fait \u00e7a parce que c'est sa plus grande force. C'est pour \u00e7a que One Piece a le Lord le plus incroyable selon moi. En tout cas des mangas que moi j'ai lu et hum, et ceux de tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s Tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin. Gr\u00e2ce au fait que les arcs, ils commencent doucement, parce qu'on fait de la mise en place, parce qu'on explique le contexte, parce qu'on explique ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 avant les enjeux et cetera. Bah \u00e7a rend le monde de de One Piece organique en fait. Et t'as l'impression que quand tu fermes ton chapitre ou ton \u00e9pisode, bah le monde de One Piece, il continue \u00e0 vivre, m\u00eame si toi tu regardes pas. Et \u00e7a, pour le coup, y a pas beaucoup d'\u0153uvres au global hein, que ce soit manga, fiction, film ou ce que tu veux, qui peuvent se targuer de \u00e7a. Voil\u00e0, c'est que mon avis, je vous laisse me dire ce que vous en pensez en commentaire, moi j'suis out !",

If that's the case, then all ninja tools in the Naruto universe are broken as ever. Living fuck. Like, their durability is extreme because, like, the same ninja tools that are barely stabbing into the ground or into trees. The same ones that are piercing through motherfuckers who supposedly have this durability that's like fucking astronomically high. That don't even fucking add up. Like, if your durability is actually that fucking high, then that sword should break when it tries to stab into you, shouldn't it?

    "voice_to_text": "The straw Hats were never faster than light pre time skip. Yeah, bro was right! Okay, let's debunk this one real quick too. So the first point that I brought was that the first FTL feat we ever got from the straw Hats was in Akid, and that was Sanji's feet. Are we forgetting by a snake man, Luffy reacting to FTL? Keys up! And here's the next pan. What about Luffy blitzing Kizaru's clones? Or Luffy blitzing Kizaru's attack? Or kizaru himself? This all happened before Sanji's feet, by the way. Then he brought up this one and tried to downplay the speed feet. But as you can see, Zoro doesn't even move until the laser is fired. As you can see here, the laser is already in his face, and Zoro still dodges the laser. And by the way, this is a heavily fatigued Zoro. Now to his next point. He brought up this feed and said that Luffy was using observation arc to dodge Kuma's attack. As you can see, he dodges the initial attack while being off guarded. He wasn't paying any attention to come, and Luffy still dodges that. Now to his next claim. He brought up Santomaru's statement that says, oh, he used hockey! Okay, let me clear the misconception. Everybody thought that Luffy was using observation hockey here, but that's not it. As you can see, Santomaru makes the claim after he sees Luffy punching the Pacific star. Even the people are shocked. On how he won't show a Pacific. So he more than likely was using arm and my hockey instead of observation. And here's a question for you. How do you tell whether someone is using observation of your. How did Santa Monica come to that conclusion? How do you prove that? Is there a way to tell whether is someone using observation of your not? Has it ever been stated in the story or am I missing some? Um. Brother, you think that Whole Cake Island Snake Man is as fast as Rooftop Snake Man? I hate to burst your bubble, but that's not true. You see this Luffy right here? Base Luffy right here! He slams Whole Cake Island Snake Man! Luffy",

And the reason I say this is because something colliding into something else to break it isn't the same as earth exploding. So the moon colliding to destroy, colliding with earth to destroy earth isn't the same as exploding earth. In order to withstand the collision, essentially all the planet would need would be moon level chakra. And the reason I say that it would only need moon level chakra is because in this case, earth isn't exploding. If anything, kinda like the picture that you showed, the moon hitting earth would crack it and break it to a degree where the rest of the earth would fall apart. We have to take that into context. It's not like he's throwing the moon through the earth and it's gonna blow it up. Nothing like that. He just going to collide the two, and then, because of how gravity works and so on, um, the rest of the earth would end up falling apart. So there's a difference with that statement. I don't agree, because it wouldn't make sense for, let's say, toneri to cover his castle within planetary chakra, meaning he can exert that, but then not be able to just exert that force and blow up the planet itself. Because again, you know, you see, there's difference there. Right. Um, just wanted to point that I don't see this feet working, but Obviously, Naruto is planetary due to, like, Kaguya scaling and such like that. Um, yeah, I'll even put it simply like this. Toneri split the moon in half. So if he was able to, let's say, destroy a planet, he would have just split the planet in half and then, like, everything else within the last just, like, wouldn't have happened. Cause if toneri just wanted to do that, he would have just, like, snuck everybody and just slice the planet.",

    "voice_to_text": "Bro, I'm not gonna lie, I love this new AP scale. And from the whole Naruto community. Power scales, bro. I haven't debated officially in like, 2, 3 years, but this has been the normalized scaling for a long time now. This is nothing new. People have been saying this for a very long time. And I don't know why people are now coming to light about that. This is how it's been working and now complaining about it. I don't know. Um, everything that you said in there is completely fine. Um, I guess, like, the only reference that I'll mention is when you said that means Captain America should be planetary universal. That's fine with an AP, because everything that we're talking about is AP, not DC. Destructive capability. So this doesn't mean that, like, you know, Captain America can destroy universe, can destroy a planet. No, but this means that he's able to affect and hurt people that can do that. Therefore, that AP, he's able to. That force, he's able to go toe to toe with that person. So let's say Thor punched Captain America, and Thor is capable of destroying a planet, and he survived that punch. Right, because Captain America is able to hurt Thor, meaning that he can also take hits from Thor, which would scale him to that AP level, but not DC. There's a difference between those two factors, and you have to know that, or things get complicated as it Seems like you're making it. A lot of other people are just randomly making this on TikTok. It's funny.",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay. I'm a little lost on where everything derived from. Essentially, I saw six and Troy kind of talk about this on X, but I never really paid mind to it because, I don't know, I thought Naruto being planetary just kind of, like, agreed upon by multiple people, but a lot of people don't understand power scaling, um, it seems like. So the people who are in confusion, nobody's saying Naruto can blow the planet. Planetary is in regards to AP, which is attack. Point C in DC is destructive capability. And in order to have, let's say, Kaguya, for example, right, how we get Naruto to planetary if Kaguya creating that truth seeking or. I say she was going to overwrite the dimension that they're already in, which is the size of a planet. And she's been stated multiple times to create different dimensions. So because she has that ability to overwrite, destroy, or create this new dimension that is size of planetary, that means that her AP has to match that, right? Her AP, which is, um, essentially being able to withstand that amount of energy. So if you're able to output that, that means you're able to withstand it being within you, unless you would just kind of, like, collapsing on yourself and you would die, essentially. Right. So your AP, bare minimum, always has to match your DC. But your DC or. No. Did I say that wrong? No. So your AP, if you have Planetary DC. You have to have planetary AP. You can have a higher AP but a lower DC. Right, so I wanted to clarify that. So because of the fact when we say Naruto is planetary, not referring to DC mean he can destroy a planet is that he's able to withstand and hurt people that can. So let's say if he was against Luffy. Right. I don't believe Luffy's planetary at all. That means that Luffy would have to be able to have at least damaged somebody planetary in order to inflict harm upon Naruto. Because if not, he'll just punch Naruto and they will have no damage. Right, because Naruto is able to withstand forces of that strength of that caliber, but he may not be able to destroy a planet himself. Um, just hopefully that clarifies it of why we say Naruto is planetary. Um, I don't know why this is going around, cause I thought like planetary was agreed upon term. Because first he was like universal, which is multiplanetary maybe.",

And Hulk has no hacks and no abilities that would allow him to get past commonwee. Like, normal physical attacks are completely useless. And that's all the Hulk is, is physical attacks. Blunt force, anger, and rage. That's not gonna do anything to Obito. He's gonna keep hitting Obito, and his attacks are gonna phase right through. And if you're asking how would Obito hurt the Hulk, he can just simply suck Hulk into the common dimension and leave him there. That's battlefield removal when con GG's. So yeah, I don't need the Naruto verse to beat Hulk. Obito by himself beats the Hulk.",

And all the surrounding areas, like you see on that land, like right there, is the Serote. All the other parts is the entirety of the Soul Society. Plus, the Soul Society is a mirror image of the world of a living, which is the plant. So how is that small area covering the entire planet of the world of the living? Doesn't make sense. This is just the serote. Just the serote, not the entirety of the Soul Society. The entirety of the Soul Society is that area and all the land and the stars and everything in that area, which most people have said. Yeah, the serote is like continental country, country plus wherever you want to scale it to be based off of where you think the four gates are and how far that is, you know? And unlike ace, there's actual validity to what Yamamoto says when he says, I have the power of the sun. We actually see after effects, unlike age, which just says, yeah, I have the power of the sun. Oh, okay. Why? When you see any destruction, destruction beats. Where's the proof? There? There's No proof. Like we see effects of how Yamamoto is actually proving why he has the power of the sun, why he is star level. I mean, if he's able to withstand the sun, Yamamoto for a good period of time. He's able to hold that power back for a good period of time. I would say, yeah, of course. He star level. That power is enough to destroy the entirety of the Soul Society. Oh, absolutely. He star level. Absolutely. Let's try that. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are we doing right now? Aren't we. Aren't we trying to. Aren't we trying to take care of the Naruto fans? What's going on here? Maybe that was my fault. We got sidetracked for just a second. Let's. Let's. Let's stay on the Naruto fans right now. Let's just stay on the Naruto fans. I'm with you.

For people that say y'all say is not a samurai, bro, samurai provide military service. Hmm. Like bro, you don't even play the game. You don't even make any sense about it. Because me, I play all the Satin Creek game. I was up there. And for people to use historical logic in this game, a satin crete never been historical logic. It's just a game. Y'all need to stop complaining and have fun. Because the real people that will complain about the game, who are fans of the game, will only complain about the price of the game or the gameplay. That's it. Us Asatin keep friends. Us Asatin Creep fans will only complain about The price or the gameplay. That's it. We do not care if they have a black guy or a ninja girl. We welcome that.

over narrative reasonings like maybe like the merger or why certain things are happening why we haven't gotten no borrow to come back why certain things have just happened the way they are if those are the questions I would understand cause a lot of them haven't been answered yet and a lot of it's probably just not going to be and potentially when the series ends we could lay criticism to some of these things how it's been like 30+ chapters in Kanjaku is just still out of the picture and it looks like that character very much has been concluded there is no more that to me that kinda sucks but the base idea of what a character's technique is and how that plays into everything I don't know what part of that's confusing that's what me caught me condescending I'm just I'm a little confused actually okay so you have someone like Sukuna right who has his curse technique which is shrine an epic sukuna who's probably the hardest to explain because he is strongest character in JJK a shrine has its domain which is malevolent shrine even has cleave and dismantle one of those is a short range attack that one's a long range attack that's kind of the simplest form to explain it so I was gonna read this ready default slash is dismantle allowing Sukuna to instantly slash apart his target into countless small cubes the other is cleave can be adjusted with cursed energy to cut down tougher opponents in one powerful slash someone like Sukuna has the most use usability of his kid he can do everything it's to the max he can do things like simple domains which act as a counter to when someone opens their domain you do a simple domain to just negate the effects of the short hit effect you might be asking what are domains what are like you know this is domain expansion what is that each person who is a you know wields curse energy and has a technique inside their soul they have an innate domain now if you remember from Season 1 when Yuji died we would go inside of Yuji and like going in his mind and then you would see Sukuna and it was going actually to Sukuna's in a domain which was the manifestation of shrine and that's where they were talking and the recent chapters that's kinda what happened with Megumi as well when Sukuna was getting pummeled and then Yuji goes spiritually inside of Sukuna uh he's able to talk to Megumi then you got things like uh binding vows and heavenly restrictions and the naming sounds confusing but upon birth if you know you have a heavenly restriction there's some sort of pet traitor off so for Toji he has zero cursed energy right meant he can't see or do anything with the sorcerer but instead he basically gets superhuman abilities and uses that skill set to then fight mikamaru can do cursed technique so it's like over long distances and he has a large pull of it and it was something like that that was like the ability but he couldn't basically go outside and his legs were broken and he was disfigured and couldn't do anything had to be in a bathtub and was in constant pain binding vows another thing all of binding bow is is if you've seen Fullmetal alchemist is the laws of equivalent exchange people are complaining that suk uh sukuna has like plot you know powers and everything cause of all these binding bows no when you are that powerful you can go you know what I'll trade that off to so I can do this like doing the world cutting slash right he made a binding vow but to so he could do it this one time without any I think was um hand components so you can just do it semantic like do with his voice and he could do it but the trade off was he now has to point and and use like three hands to do it just do the hand sign and then point which means if he loses an arm or he did he can't do it and this whole thing about black flashes black flash is one of the most simple concepts of all of JKK it's like when a sports person is operating at maximum maximum maximum efficiency it enter a state of the zone and you can't control that it's just yeah I'm in the zone cool the only exception is Yuji and at the moment it hasn't been fully explained and we're gonna get more information about it overall I'm still not sure like some of the details you might not understand but it's still you're most likely gonna have enough info to understand who's gonna win a fight and when or someone then loses or something happens you go I get caught because this ability went off or this person had that that count as this and that's not to say that JJK is the perfect example of how to explain something for me season 1 or just the first few chapters of the manga a lot of it comes across really heavy handed to explain such simple concepts something as simple as a grading system it's like oh you know if you do this and you're this in grade 4 and then grade 3 it's like cool the stronger you get the higher grade you have and the cursed levels are slightly lower which means a grade 1 should always be the grade 1 curse that's all it is but it made it out this like this whole thing like oh it seems confusing it's not think once the anime covers some of it and we get a much more clearer visual representation of what some things are I think the easiest way to think about everybody is treat it like a hero shooter treat it like Overwatch or or ballerin or something right but each character has a few more abilities and defensive stuff for that kid so you've got your your shooting gun right you shoot your gun pew pew pew pew pew like bastion right shoot his gun and then as you're alt you can turn into like a tank and artillery and do big damage right but you can only do it once per like 3 minutes in Overwatch or 4 minutes like whoa you got a left bumper ability which could self heal you which could be RCT but only some characters can do that your right bumper ability could be um I know another thing like a shigigami or whatever different characters are different things now imagine that you know some characters like Miwa or Kusakabe or Gojo they can do something to counter that person's ult so let's say Reaper goes into the middle of zone and goes to do his ult you just pop your simple domain and the short hit effect doesn't instantly kill you now let's say he does some damage you can still die but it's not an instant kill hope that helps it's been six minutes what do you happen",

No one can tell me that I didn't enjoy it. Nobody can tell me that I'm not a fan of Gintama. That's your opinion. You might think that it's better, you might think that I missed out, and that's fine. But you don't have to watch anything that you don't want. Wanna Watch is giving. Gatekeeper. It's giving. What is this, 2,002? Geez, why can't we just be happy that there are so many people watching and enjoying anime? And however you wanna watch it, watch it. You wanna watch one episode 100 times? If you wanna watch only the fights of an anime, that's fine. However you want to enjoy anime, that's fine. Because it's not about what other people think, it's not about this big group, is not about what any of us have to say. It's about what you like. And if you like it, I love it.",

Bro, I swear I've said this so many times and I've used that exact phrase glass cannon. And this is why I say that power scalers or power scalers who think like this have no idea what they're talking about, because they'll say like the old ways of figuring out which character is stronger are archaic and inaccurate, but they've made up all these rules that make it way more complicated than what it is. In my personal opinion, Naruto characters as a whole have very trash durability. And if you really wanna desect each fight that happened in Naruto that people wanna say that scale into universal, solar system, planetary, anything like that, then we can. And I guarantee you Naruto fans are gonna be wrong every time because all you guys do is ignore context, use statements over feats even though feats are clearly better than statements. But when you guys don't have statements, you run to the databook.",

Or conventions every year, right? I work throughout the year, throughout con season. Like big cons I can call Mama Con, things like that. I need to be way. What I'm finding is that the fangirl is a fangirl. I have never fangirled in a long time. I'm talking like Tumblr 2006 level fangirling. I'm talking about girls that had a fangirl phase that left it, then coming back to the fangirl phase. I'm seeing woman that have never been in the fangirl fandoms or fandoms or anything. Finding them, finding what they. What works for them and going into those fandoms. And you wanna know why? With this new age of dating and what not, especially in my generation, a lot of men are not likeable. A lot of men have figured out that in order to them be relationships, they need to be likeable. Women do not need men to survive in society anymore. We can have our own money on jobs, on lives, on cars, blah, blah, blah, bank accounts. You know what I'm saying? In order to keep relationship, men has to be likable. A lot of them are, but you know who is? Nanami",

It's not quite on the level of Baki, but I just enjoy it mostly for the action. I think Gojo is a good character and I've enjoyed the fights, but with my hero, even though I've kind of lost a little bit of love for it, I still really enjoyed that series. I was still really invested into that series. And on that note, what do y'all think about the ending? Because if I can be honest, I'm not loving it.",

I am genuinely believing at this point that anybody who is denying Naruto is planetary is being intellectually dishonest. So I am going to explain it very slowly and very concisely. This guy admits that the ten tails is planetary. Madara becomes the jinchuriki of the ten tails. And then he gets killed, and Kaguya emerges. When Kaguya emerges, Naruto and Sasuke immediately become petrified because they can see that Kaguya is stronger than what Madara was doing. Then everybody, Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi and Sakura go and fight Kaguya. Then Naruto damages Kaguya on multiple occasions, which would put him at a relative level of AP. Let me explain why. When we talk about AP, you need to be able to withstand the energy take to it takes to do the feats that you have that you do. So when Kaguya creates or is willing to destroy or is able to destroy dimensions with stars or other planets, basically a solar system level dimension, that means that she needs the energy or be able to withstand the energy it takes to then destroy that sad thing. And so when Naruto damages her, there is a relative level of energy being put into that punch that damages Kaguya. That would make Naruto's AP, or his attack potency. The energy put into that attack at The same relative level that Kaguya has. I'm sick and tired of people saying, oh, well, if I go up to this like, 200 pound, like, fucking bodybuilder guy and I shoot him, does that mean that I. That is not the same thing. Now, if you were to go up and punch and damage a 300 pound bodybuilder guy, you would have a relative level of AP that that guy has. So I don't understand what is going on here. There. And don't even get me started. Naruto. Then in Boruto, which he says that he doesn't think that they could be either of them right now, which is intellectual, dishonest, yet its finest. Naruto goes in the manga and hand to hand combat, beats the ever loving shit out of momoshiki, who is stated to be stronger than Kaguya. And then in baryon mode, goes in hand to hand combat, beats the shit out of Ishiki, who is stated to be the strongest old Sutsuki. So that means that Jigen is above Momoshiki, Kaguya, Madara and Obito, all of them. And Naruto in baryon mode beats the shit out of Ishiki. somebody please explain to me what you guys aren't understanding here. I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to restate this. Am I gonna have to pull up a fucking diagram and like, show it to you second grade style? I don't get it. You guys are. Hmm. It's pissing me off. Oh, please. Explain to me what you guys are on.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you have Planetary AP, you automatically have Planetary Derb. So. So go watch the rest of the video to, um. To see what this content creator was talking about. But he was saying that if you have planetary AP, you automatically have planetary durability. And that's because of Newton's third Law, which is if every action there is equal or opposite reaction or equal or opposite force. Right, and. And this is my problem with people who. This is why I don't necessarily get involved with the power scaling debates, but I just have to throw my two cents in on this, folks. Really? Like, first off, AP does not equal durability. And the reason why is because physics does not apply. It's not a one for one. The way it works in the real world and the way it works in fictional works. If physics worked the way it worked in real life, in these fictional works, right, characters moving at light speed, the minute they throw a punch at light speed, it would be completely vaporizing planets. Or if they decided to to move, you know, faster than the speed of sound, they will be creating shock waves that would literally be like blowing up everything. But that doesn't happen. Yet we claim these characters are light speed, etc, etc. So if we're gonna go with the logic that AP equals durability because Newton stir law, then we have to concede on the fact that some of These characters can't be faster than light and can't be faster than the speed of sound, because according to physics, if they were, certain things would be happening in these fictional works. And then this go, this content creator goes to say, unless proven otherwise, you know, it's an automatic thing. That's. That's false. The proof is that because physics isn't. Is because things aren't happening the way physics dictates that they would always happen. That's proof in another itself. So to sit here and, like, a nitpick on what we apply the, the physics logic to and what we don't apply the physics logic to, it to me, is just. Is too inconsistent. It's much more logical and much more reasonable to just say, you know what? Real world physics does not apply the same way that it applies in these fictional bodies of work. And with that being the case, there is no other option than then the fact that AP does not equal durability. And I highly challenge anybody who is, is on this. AP equals durability rent. I highly challenge them to apply that. Apply that logic because of Newton sir law. If that's your main defense, apply that logic to literally every other feet or every other way you measure a character's tear. And if you're. If that's how you feel, then you have to make concessions on literally every other aspect of these characters that you guys love. You would have to admit that Naruto isn't faster than speed of light or Luffy isn't the fastest speed of light, because according to physics, they're just not doing what the fuck they're supposed to be doing. And that's my two cents. Unless somebody wants to, you know, go back and forth. I don't really wanna go too. Too deep in it on it. Uh, but I could. I really could.",

What this means is that whenever Naruto is able to match Kaguya or simply injure Kaguya fatally, Naruto is exerting the same amount of force that Kaguya is. And how much force is she able to exert? Well, Kaguya is able to make dimensions with potential planets and stars within them. This is where the term attack potency versus destructive capacity comes in, with attack potency being how much energy you're capable of using versus destructive capacity being how much energy you're capable of exerting in a single burst. But I do partially agree with his video. Let me explain. In his video he talks about how in Naruto the biggest thing they're destroying is mountain rages or small islands. And that compares nothing to the likes of planetary size spaces or anything that would promote the fact that they're on this level of power. But I do agree because unlike one piece or Bleach, Naruto doesn't have a lot of showings of destructive capacity feats. A lot of the things come from statements. Which is kind of ironic because the Naruto fan base will criticize one piece fans for using statements for characters like Whitebeard. Let me dumb it down For you. Even more so, they'll believe that Naruto is star level, despite the biggest feat being shown to us in series being Naruto destroying mountain rages or splitting the moon. But they can't believe that Whitebeard is planetary, even though it's stated multiple times when Whitebeard is shifting tectonic plates. And before I get called a one piece Glazer, I'm gonna go ahead and rep bleach. And if you follow my page you would know that I never do that. Because Naruto fans are just as biased with the bleach community as they are with the one piece one. And bleach are several statements about characters being able to destroy the Soul Society or the Donga or destroy the universe. And a lot of the times people look at those statements as hyperbolic or things that are just being over exaggerated. But when it comes to Naruto, they're never over exaggerated and they're just true. This is why I say when it comes to the Naruto community they're incredibly biased. Because if we just use showcases then one piece clears. And even in statements one piece clears.",

Oh, they're going to milk it and they're gonna milk it dry. Just like attack on Titan. Probably not for the same length of time, but oh, they're going to milk it dry. Now don't get me wrong, Demon Slayer still has his fan base. I'm definitely a fan of this very short story. Because Demon Slayer at his core, manga wise, is a very short story.

I genuinely need to know, and this is a question for everybody, not just the people I'm stitching. Like, do people not like Robin? I don't think I've met a single person who's gotten into one piece and says that Robin is a bad character or a character they don't like. And this take right here, bro, this hurt me, man. Like, Robin, like, after hearing her backstory in like, water 7 and his lobby, and then you say that you wish that they would have just let her go. Like, that's a wild, wild take. And really, I'm just coming in here to see if other people really agree with that. Like, I went through the comments and I didn't see too much of it, but I gotta ask my community and some other people. Like, is there anyone out there who genuinely hates Robin? I'm not opening up this discussion to throw hate your way. There is no shade to be thrown. These people, these are opinions. It's just anime. We ain't actually getting mad about it. But this is a wild, wild take, so Please let me know in the comments. Do you not fuck with Robin for some reason? Or like, is it generally accepted that she is just the best girl? Like what?",

Go back and watch original video cause he makes some really good talking points about how the overpowered MC trope isn't really as well written anymore. Or well really ever. It has some situations, but it's just. It's a loss. It's a lot in anime to write overpowered MC trope. Well I wanna make my own points about this cause I feel like there are some characters who have their overpowered MC trope written with y'all. I have an example of this as well Sid. Now while you may disagree, Sid in eminence and shadow is an overpowered character done really well. Because the whole goal of the anime is that there are people who are not able to compete with him on a power level. But there are people who are sort of tarnishing his own name or the name of the name of his group. And they like, they don't tackle him head on, they find ways around him. They see, they show him as kind of a strategy. A really overpowered main character, don't get me wrong, but like, they don't. They show him as no power main character, but they also show that there's stuff he can't do with as well as quickly. Like if a group is tarnishing his name, he has to go out of his way to find them, and that might take a couple episodes. Also, another thing with him is that he isn't. He doesn't want to be the main character in his own show. He wants to be the side character, at least for Season 1. And that's something that he struggles with, is that he's kind of being pushed into the light while he wants to remain in the shadow. Pun intended. But that's just one example. I could.

    "voice_to_text": "hi I was one of the people at Philadelphia Fan Expo that weekend that this video uh debuted and I just wanna talk about it real quick you don't know me and I don't know you but my name is Crow and I've been cosplaying and going to conventions for about a decade now so uh you know it's kind of kind of have a knowledge of this stuff at this point for those who don't know the context of the clip at the beginning it basically was a fan stepping up to the mic when Justin Briner the dub voice actor for Deku of My Hero Academia was taking questions out his panel and they basically uh asked something that wasn't particularly cool typically new and young fans like to ask these types of questions where it's like oh acknowledging the weird part of the crazy parts or the odd or uncomfortable parts of fandom culture and shipping culture and trying to get a reaction or see how other people take it especially those who are heavily uh involved in production but also don't realize that those people may or may not necessarily be involved in the fandom as much as they think now from what you see in the video Justin responds as as pleasantly as he can he tries to that redirect the question um with with an nonchalant answer or be like oh how did we get here and and just be like he doesn't have an opinion he he doesn't try to be involved and then they they follow it up with mentioning a ship between a teenager and a child which is really gross and uncomfortable and you hear by the reaction of the audience and him it is just it's not it's not a good reaction it's not great Justin then follows this up after the con day is over on his Twitter says basically he doesn't want these questions anymore he doesn't want the involvement and he doesn't try to spotlight the my hero fandom either uh he tries to do this as an overall thing because it doesn't just happen in one place every fandom every show has that uncomfortable culture that people try to say ruins things or makes people just just they don't they don't claim it they avoid it this then leads to some discourse and discussion from those unaware of the context and overall makes it seem out of nowhere and of course the internet being the internet people start pointing fingers and overall it's just a bad time for everybody now Justin and the audience are completely in the right to be uncomfortable as they were and I'm not negating that in any sense of the word however what we need to understand is that these voice actors the showrunners these creators not everybody as involved as we think they are not everybody uh knows about the fandom or what what's going on in the fandom or what what people are talking about some people don't even know about the show that they're working on some people are just there to do their job and that's it obviously there are a few exceptions to this uh those that are active and involved and that's great we love to see it however we cannot continue to make the Assumption that this is okay or the norm to ask these sorts of things to people because it's not everybody and it's not basic Con etiquette on the other side the Congoer is facing a lot of backlash and criticism and while it's understandable we also have to remember this is a person and also somebody who is young not everybody that goes to cons especially those that are fresh to them are going to know basic Con etiquette especially something like this that is normalized when it shouldn't be quite honestly it is our responsibility for those who know better to teach them that this isn't the norm we have got to stop normalizing this type of behavior we shouldn't be yelling at them we shouldn't be ridiculing them we shouldn't be bullying them what we should be doing is tell them nicely that hey this isn't okay that maybe this wasn't the smartest thing to do don't do it again simple as that obviously they're young they don't know any better it was a mistake we are human we make mistakes especially especially as kids it's it's a learning curve even the VA states that he doesn't condone harassment or bullying of the Congoer it is not that hard to tell somebody that they did something wrong or made a mistake in a non aggressive manner and Justin although uncomfortable handled the situation as best and as calmly as he could and that's fantastic we as a community should be acting accordingly and we should also be continuing to acknowledge that hey let's not do this let's not put these people in these situations and continue to make them uncomfortable but also I know some conventions do this not all conventions unfortunately but some do we should have somebody that is a member of the convention staff monitoring and filtering these questions that pop up at these panels please con staff con runners like put somebody that knows the context of what is being talked about in these panels whether it's being run by a celebrity a voice actor a show runner a creator put somebody there for the panel if they have a Q&A portion to filter the questions because if we don't have somebody doing that questions like this will continue to get through and then we'll be here personally I think that's just gonna be more beneficial for everyone in the long run it'll be better for guests it'll be better for congoers it'll be better for events themselves that's just my two sons",

Someone tagged me in this one today and I definitely had to talk about it because I have one from my childhood that was one of my favorite entrances to this day. Now you can't tell me that you don't remember how goaded the opening scene to X2 was. Because this was how most Marvel fans to this day were introduced to Nightcrawler. This man's debut scene was him attacking the White House. Seeing this man jumping around and absolutely styling on the security was one of the coolest things you can see back in 2,003. Cause when you finally saw his face as a kid, this was one of the most haunting things that I could ever see. Bro, for real. Look creepy here. Him. Bro was out here breakdance fighting while teleporting. He was here, he was there. They couldn't keep up. And all these guys are behind this door trying to protect the president. All they hear is people getting their asses kicked. How nerve racking it must have been to hear this man crawling in the ceiling, then back to the door. And after gets mad quiet. The door swings open and there's nothing but black smoke. He just drops in and no diffs. The entire group. Honestly believe that this was the day I started liking monster character. Because Nightcrawler on this day stood on nothing but business. This was definitely one of the best.",

That's basically the club. Um, listen, let me first say I like Danny as a content creator. He's really entertaining. He's great. This is no disrespect to him, but maybe he shouldn't talk on my hero. Okay, but here's the thing. I don't blame him because this is something I've seen so many people shit on. People hate Hawks because he killed twice and like, treat it say he's like a villain. Okay, two things. Let's first establish he is a government sanctioned hero. He is not like someone like endeavor someone like freaking stars and sort. He's not like those people. He is a government agent that was trained from birth to basically be for the gut work for the government. So he 100% had the right to kill Hawks according to the government. You could say the government is corrupt, whatever, but by no, but the fact that the world accepts him is not surprising when that he is just doing his job. But the bigger, the bigger, the bigger issue. Twice was a villain. He was a terrorist who was genuinely the most dangerous person in the entire series. Had he made like, because he was no longer scared of making like a billion clones. He could literally make an infinite number of sugar Rockies. An infinite Number of togas. Infinite. Infinite number of dobbies. Like, do you know how did he was genuinely more dangerous than sugar Rocky? Use the single most dangerous character in the league of villains at the time. That Hawks killed him. Now, I know people say, oh, just incapacitate him. Yeah, sure, he could incapacitate him, but he tried to, like, just get him to stand down, and he wouldn't. He knew there was no way twice was going to stand down. And so say he tries incapacitate him, then Dobby comes in and attacks him. What if he. And that's, like, scuffle. He loses twice, and now he's back to square one. What if he gets, you know, by killing twice? He was. That was the only way for him to guarantee twice would not be a threat to the world in the future. It sucks. It's sad. And there's a reason he tried to give twice a chance. He truly liked twice and considered him a friend. But he had no other choice. And I get it. It's sad that twice died, but it's not Hawks's fault. At the end of the day, twice was a criminal and made his own decisions.",

    "voice_to_text": "Is Demon Slayer carried by its animation? I mean, the simple answer is no. In my opinion, Demon Slayer just can't be carried by animation. Don't get me wrong, the animation is very good, but I don't think is what makes the show enjoyable. You could have the worst storyline and the worst characters, the worst voice acting. And just because the animation is good, it doesn't mean people are gonna watch it. So first of all, is the voice acting the voice acting? Demon slayer sub all dub is fucking brilliant. And the people who think you know it is carried by animation, you gotta give it credit for that. The only reason why they don't like it is because at the end of every story, the end of every demon, there's some long fucking monologue about how he's actually a good guy or how he's redeemed himself or something. So it feels same after like 4 demons. The other thing to do is about the music design. The sound effect designs every sort of fight or battle leaving conversation. The sound is perfect. Whoever's a sound engineer on that is doing a wicked job. It's like a broad in Japan said. He said sound design is one of the most important things when creating a video. So when you create a TV show, anime or whatever, sound design can actually carry the scene. Freer nailed it as well. But I can understand what people are saying about Demon Slayer getting carried by animation. Also we gotta think of is the horny weebs who literally sit there and every time a Hashira comes up, they're like, oh, my God, she's so pretty. And if you seen the Soul Smith arc, then we all know, you know, the Hashira. And that just had the boobs out all the time. That was it. She was kinda cool, kinda useful, but that's all she did, right? Every sort of joke or gag was anything to do with that. So that's probably where most of the audience for Demon Slayer lies. So, yeah, I don't think it's carried by animation. I think it's like an amalgamation of things. Of why people think it's carried. But mainly it's got good voice acting, great sound design, the stories are great. But it does feel the same with the monologue bits. After every demon, there's a bunch of nerds who are sitting there bloody touching their ding dong over fake Hashira characters. And yeah, I mean, it just creates hype because of the budget it has.",

You gotta be new on this app. Now I've debated Goku versus Superman a billion times and I'm. You already know I'm Superman. Never in a decade, in a day have I ever said Goku wasn't planetary. Like that's wild. We seen Piccolo destroy a whole fucking moon like. And we've seen Goku actually beat people who are planetary. Reason why you haven't seen Goku destroy a planet is cause he's a good guy. He doesn't need to unless there was a planet full of evil people. When you have statements from people like if Beerus and Goku keep fighting, they're going to destroy the universe and leave it in void. Bro, you're right, he's not planetary. He's fucking way past that. Also, Goku breathing in space has nothing to do with him being planetary at all.",

    "voice_to_text": "good evening um why do people hate Blackbeard first of all I agree with a lot of the points you're making I think he is a really interesting character I genuinely really like him as a character and I think a lot of the hate just has to do with what he represents as the dark mirror to Luffy because as you pointed out you know when he first meets Luffy he is a really enigmatic character and we see how much alike while also not alike these two characters are these are both characters who will do anything for their dreams they will chase their dreams but their way that they go about building towards their dreams are completely different we see Luffy building a family he doesn't recruit people based on their strength he recruits them based on mutual love and mutual desires to chase a dream Blackbeard recruits based on strength you know he has the Titanic captains he has recruited the most deadly people from Impell down he is stealing devil fruits and giving them to his crew who was there before that to make them expressly stronger and I do think it's unfair to lay Ace's death at Blackbeard's feet although Blackbeard murdering one of his Nakama right a member of Whitebeard's crew where Blackbeard was is ultimately what LED ace to be chasing Blackbeard in the first place without that inciting incident ace never would have been in this position and so while it isn't expressly his fault it is Akanu who kills ace as you point out um the whole reason this war arc was kicked off was because of Blackbeard and I also think a lot of people really got attached to Whitebeard very quickly because Whitebeard represents this ultimate father figure in one piece which traditionally is an anime and a manga that doesn't show a lot of positive parental role models and that's all Whitebeard ever wanted to do was be a father and so you have this whole son killing his father kind of thing because everyone on Blackbeard's crew or sorry on Whitebeard's crew was one of Whitebeard sons that's what he referred to them as and that's ultimately what Blackbeard was when he murdered one of his brothers and then later went on to murder his dad and you serve his power by taking the devil fruit as for do Flamingo I think a lot of people do agree that do Flamingo is one of the worst villains in one piece and I mean that as a person he is awful legitimately a enslaving drug peddling tyrant who is caused for a lot of the strife on the grand line he has his hands in everyone's pockets he is you know promoting all of this horrible things but as a character he's so witty and he is so charismatic it's hard to not love him as a villain um kind of like what you're saying about Blackbeard I think a lot of people feel for Doflamingo while they might not harbor the same feelings for Blackbeard because we don't see nearly as much of him being this you know machination driven villain those can be just so fun to watch um to understand Doffy's backstory and how tragic it is and to see what made such an evil person we don't really have Blackbeard story there's a lot of missing pieces there and I think when we get it it's gonna be absolutely fascinating so I I might not have answered your question like you wanted um I don't hate Blackbeard um I do see him as a really strong insider within this narrative however he has incited a whole lot of what has gone on to be some of the most significant things in the entire narrative without Blackbeard killing a crew member and going on the run we wouldn't have had Sabayote through the Marine Ford uh the the summit war arc all of that would not have happened without blackbeards murder of a crewmate so I hope that that helps somewhat um like I said I do like Blackbeard and uh you know I appreciate your content",

Defending this point is really easy.   it   seems   Defending   this   point   is   really   easy How you would defend this point is   you   would   defend   this   point   is you would just simply tell somebody like King Lion   would   just   simply   tell   somebody   like   King   Lion or the other DC   the   other   DC Marvel fans that are a little confused at how Naruto's planetary.   fans   that   are   a   little   confused   at   how   Naruto's   planetary You obviously tell them your scales.   obviously   tell   them   your   scales And then if you tell them your scales and they're like, well,   then   if   you   tell   them   your   scales   and   they're   like   well where's the feat of Naruto destroying a planet?   the   feat   of   Naruto   destroying   a   planet Why would Naruto destroy the planet earth?   would   Naruto   destroy   the   planet   earth Why would Naruto, the one who's defending earth,   would   Naruto   the   one   who's   defending   earth destroy earth? What reason would he have to do that?   earth   What   reason   would   he   have   to   do   that Because of Naruto trying to defend the leaf village,   of   Naruto   trying   to   defend   the   leaf   village which is on earth. Why would he destroy the planet?   is   on   earth   Why   would   he   destroy   the   planet The village he's trying to defend is on like,   village   he's   trying   to   defend   is   on   like like, you feel me?   you   feel   me Does that make any sense? That's why   that   make   any   sense   That's   why going off of something like statements is very important   off   of   something   like   statements   is   very   important for shows like this   shows   like   this where people that are the heroes actually defend stuff.   people   that   are   the   heroes   actually   defend   stuff But of course, in Marvel and DC,   of   course   in   Marvel   and   DC where they have like 56,000 variations of the same earth,   they   have   like   56,000   variations   of   the   same   earth and then they have people just destroying earth   then   they   have   people   just   destroying   earth because the heroes there suck at doing their job   the   heroes   there   suck   at   doing   their   job and they need people to help them in every single fight.   they   need   people   to   help   them   in   every   single   fight You know, what's always convenient for me   know   what's   always   convenient   for   me is how everyone always sits here and jumps on every anime character   how   everyone   always   sits   here   and   jumps   on   every   anime   character for needing to jump a Villain   needing   to   jump   a   Villain and they have like one or two or three people with them   they   have   like   one   or   two   or   three   people   with   them but we have literally the Justice League jumping one dude   we   have   literally   the   Justice   League   jumping   one   dude and we're just like   we're   just   like Superman's actually relative   actually   relative Batman's actually relative   actually   relative Green Lantern's actually relative uh,   Lantern's   actually   relative   uh Martian Manhunter's actually relative like how,   Manhunter's   actually   relative   like   how how are you going to sit here and have that argument   are   you   going   to   sit   here   and   have   that   argument then go against the Naruto community with the same like   go   against   the   Naruto   community   with   the   same   like you feel me?

This is really a black weaves dream. But nah, this is dead ass a scam. Also serious shit cause it really gotta think about it. Here in America, we're not gonna act like East Asian parents are the biggest gatekeepers when it comes to black man dating their daughters. Bro, them niggas do not like us and y'all know that. Like their fathers really be yelling in the paint, blocking our shit. Their moms be Jeremy Lynn, crossing us up, still in our shit, shitting on us, defensive players of the years, hall of Fame gatekeepers. So you really expect Japanese niggas to want black man to come and impregnate their woman? Like, nah, that's dead ass breeding. Like come on now. The Japanese have a plan. Like Eisen. They about to do some unit 7 3 1 shit on us. Bro, do not fall for the trap. They really don't have all those blasian babies in Japan with no fathers, they're gonna be growing up like gon trying to become a hunter to find their dad. And they're gonna be ostracized like Naruto in the village in Japan. If I was a Japanese man, I'll dead ass be tobirama to all the blasian babies, bro. Imagine you plotting on your Asian baddie, your Asian chick that you like, just to find out that she got BBC and impregnated by a black man and that nigga left. Like, I'm treating all the blasians terribly bad. And what's going on in Japan and Korea? Like, y'all niggas can't pull y'all girls, bro. I have a population shortages, bro. Just risk up, bro. Y'all need to get trained by do Dennis, bro, cause this is getting ridiculous. And it's not like y'all women are ugly, y'all girls are bad, y'all got the K pop hotties that J pop idols. Like, y'all got bad women. Like, what's going on with y'all, bro? Y'all niggas need to get to risk training, bro. First I got the Oxford study shit where mid white niggas are taking y'all fine girls, and now you got this. Like, this is crazy disrespect, bro. Y'all gotta train.

You're telling me that Shanks pulled up on Kaido, beat him so convincingly he could show up to Marineford with no damage and still have energy to box Admirals? Nah, not because I don't think Shanks couldn't defeat Kaido, I just don't think Kaido would go down that easily. We're talking about king of the Beast Kaido, some of like top 3 durability in the verse. He would not go down that quickly. Because the other time we hear of Yonko fighting in this universe was Big Mom versus Kaido, a fight that lasted 3 days. What's more likely is Shanks pulled up to Kaido and said you wanna go to Marineford, you gotta get through me, and Kaido decided it wasn't worth it. If Shanks is on the same level as Big Mom and Kaido, which the Yonko title implies, that fight would have lasted ages. So much so that by the time Kaido defeated Shanks, everyone's gone home, Marineford is over, the situation's done. What Kaido would have gained from the situation was not worth the time and effort would have taken to fight another Yonko.",

But then they'll watch Jiraiya, they'll watch meliodas, they'll watch, um, Master Roshi, and is fine. And is whatever. They watch game of Thrones, and is fine is whatever. They watch Star Wars, they watch whatever. They watch Quentin Tarantino. They can come up with an excuse. I'm not saying that you can't find Rudy is, uh, offensive or problematic or even triggering. You have every right to do that, and there is, uh. It's definitely understandable. Like, for example, I don't like to read the book of mice of men because of the language used. That's my right, and that's me. But I'm not trying to go out and say that anybody that enjoys the book of mice and men has a problem or.

Here is the tattoo to wanna break up with someone because they got a fake man, A cartoon man. Even if it was a real man, even if it was like Harry Styles, it's not like she got her coworker Bob tattooed on. This man said that he just tolerates her anime hobby and he thinks cartoons are for children, and yet he goes and throws a tantrum cause she got a little two dimensional man tattooed on her. If she got SpongeBob tattooed on her, would she be like, not on my. Now the daddy's home is a little cringy, but I mean, so are my tattoos. I have Onyx and a bubble tea. Who am I to speak? Um, unless someone came home with like a racism or like something maybe very sexually explicit or something. Like. Aside from that,",

    "voice_to_text": "I just wanted to make a quick follow-up video to say I officially graduated today as valedictorian of my college class! Now that I've officially graduated, I wanted to share my Persona 5 inspired valedictorian speech. Here it goes: I'm honoured to have been chosen as a valedictorian of this year's graduating class. My name is Raven and I am a Secondary Education and English major with double minors in Art and Writing. In true English major fashion, on my graduation cap I've written a quote from one of my favourite characters of all time, \u201cI will carve my own path for myself.\u201d We've all likely encountered individuals who entrust others with their destinies to such an extent that they unconsciously relinquish some of their freedoms in the process. Perhaps, we've been in that position ourselves, seeking external guidance to fulfill others\u2019 ideas of happiness in the hope that that happiness will become our own. However, genuine growth and happiness emerge from following our inner compass and forging paths aligned with our deepest aspirations. I am the eldest daughter of immigrants. I am a first generation college student. I am an English major, even though English is not my first language. Despite encountering skepticism about my potential for success, I have remained steadfast in my self-belief and identity. Of course, there are times when relying on and trusting others is essential. I could not have overcome the numerous linguistic and societal barriers I faced because of my background alone. However, the pivotal decisions, born of my free will, forged a path I proudly tread alongside you all as fellow graduates. Trust is a precious gift\u2014to ourselves as much as others. Embracing challenges fosters growth, yet surrendering crucial decisions to external forces only hinders true happiness and self-pride. \u201cWhat's a life worth in a reality that was cooked up just to satisfy someone else?\u201d \u201cI say \u2018none.\u2019\u201d Your happiness and development rest solely in your hands. Carve your own path for yourself, drawing upon the skills and knowledge that have been infused in our education by our founders to shape a narrative you can be proud of. To anyone graduating this season, congratulations class of 2024!",

Daily by weekly, maybe every other day. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. There are so many options. I feel like we just did daily because it worked well for the format of network television. But now that we are kind of out of the era of network television, let's be honest. Is there a benefit to doing weekly as opposed to anything else? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Not gonna lie, a lot of people don't know this and how much I talk about anime on here and amongst my friends etc. You will never guess this but I went like 4 5 years without watching anime at all and I'm not gonna hold y'all. What this man saying is facts. Like once you stop just like watching anime, you just find other ways to spend your time. Like for entertainment, gaming, watching other shows movies. Yeah, it. It. It is a bit. You know, it. It is a bit crazy to say, but it's hard to get back into anime. And honestly the biggest reason is because a lot of animes, truth be told, just aren't good. I mean think about it. How many variety of shows do we really see people talking about that are already being mentioned by someone else? You rarely see a gym that's hidden these days cause it's just not that many good anime out.",

In that half season, he kidnapped two girls, tied them up and left them to starve for. For a broken statue of a girl he liked. Like, we. We're not gonna forget that. We're not gonna forget that. That happened just last season. He. He did that for a. A broken statue. Like, that's what Rudy's did. He is still a scumbag, just like he was in the first season. Like, nothing has changed between that. Nothing has changed. Now, if you bring up the novel. The novel, I hear Rudy's is even an even bigger scumbag than he is in the anime. Like, that's what I'm hearing, but I don't know. Now, keep in mind, still, the story in which I could sense a is still pretty interesting. I like that. I like the world there are even. Even putting the fact without Rudy is. I still find some weird moments with the characters in Michelle contents a. Or some of the stuff they be doing. Like. Like. Like other stuff that. That I won't get into. But as of today, as of this. As currently right now, In the anime, Rudess is still a scumbag. Rudess was out here ready to kill some random, random, random teen that might have bullied his little sister or that might have freaking. That might have been associated with that, not said anything, and he was ready to kill ill, a person for that. Like, and we're saying, like, he. He's changed a lot. He. He's changed a little. Little. The dude is still a scumbag. Okay, that. That has not changed. But yeah, those are my thoughts.

Why do so some of y'all care so much how we watch or consume these shows? Yeah, it does sound heliest and and is annoying. So leave them alone. It's that simple. Also, the all people, the all out there who have dyslexia, they can weed. Is just that how they process the win language is different from how you, you or I boss. That's it. So it takes them longer. So? So. So it would be in their best interest to watch the dub also. You know, for me, especially if it is a series I will watch multiple Summer Times, I'm gonna watch the dub so I can multitask.

And listen, no hate to this creator right here, just there's a lot of Gojo fans in this comment section. Gojo didn't know about the Flame Arrow. The first time it's used is after Gojo gets sealed. Second time it's used is against Maharaga, and Gojo is still sealed away. So let me ask you this. When Gojo says that sakuna was not going all out, why would he be talking about the Flame Arrow, something he knows nothing about? Same way how Jogo didn't know about the Flame Arrows, but sakuna just kind of pulled it out. Why would Gojo not be talking about Sakuna's Hainei reform body that he had access to the entirety of that fight? Multiple times. In that fight versus Gojo, if Sakuna pulled out that form, he could have won with amplification alone because Gojo was severely weakened.",

Everything's too smooth, everything's too round. I've said that from day 1. In the anime it's just too. Uh. But in the manga is it's perfect. So this is the one time where I actually will agree with the manga being better than the anime. It is just. And don't get me wrong, I've watched the anime, I'm loving it cause it's one of the animes that makes me laugh. But the actual star style. Just don't like sticks and sticks. A manga just so much better.",

The villains, they. They was kind of cool. Like, they was interesting. But Naruto fans don't even get the Akatsuki tattoo. And Akatsuki actually had a purpose, unlike the Phantom Troop, they were just thieves. And on top of that, the Phantom Troupe was like, the stronger the strong. And a lot of the people who got these tattoos that I'm seeing, they don't look like they ever heard a fly a day in day life look like they ever done nothing to nobody. And I'm not trying to attack the person, I just. This. But I'm just being real. Like, when you look up the Phantom Troop, when you really look up the Phantom Troop and think back, if you haven't watched anime in a long time, the most memorable person is Hisoka. Why do you want to be associated with somebody like Hisoka? And if you don't know who he is, look up Hisoka and going, clips, bro. Look up Hisoka. Clips, bro. I'm telling you.",

I do rate, like, Tizzy a lot, but this one is way for me because, again, Black Clover became a jump. Gee, guy. They release every four months, I believe. So is it four months or every three months? Well, I think quarterly, so yeah, every three months. So, I mean, it go to say they've gone down in popularity. Sure, they'll reduce a bit. And. Okay, yes, not everyone's talking about Black Clover because JK releases weekly. You can't exactly compete with something that completely. That releases every week when you release every three months. So it's always gone down popularity. Where it fell off because the story is bad. Like, I feel like the way he was, like, talking about it was almost as if, like, oh, it just fell off because the manga. Manga. Shit. The manga still gas. It's just that JK releases weekly. My hero releases weekly. Um, Sakamoto Days is going crazy, and Blue Lock is coming back, so we just got Kaiser's backstory. So, I mean, it's tough and the. It's tough, but, like, they release every three months. Boruto releases monthly, and people still read that. So, I mean, I wouldn't say it's falling off. I would say, like, maybe a bit of the hype has gone down. Because, again, most people are just. Most people just go week to week to Week. Most people on TikTok scroll. Most people that read the manga, like, read the manga of TikTok, which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. But I mean to say that it's fell off is. That's harsh.",

But I really wanna talk about this as a big, big art nerd, so I don't necessarily disagree with storytelling can be greater than art, but I do believe art can enhance the storytelling in a way. Stick with me on. So I'm gonna use an example of maybe a couple. But like, let's look at, like, say, berserk. Berserk is like, such a dark and gritty series. Great. Well, the artwork matches that dark and grittiness alongside its story that is trying to tell makes it so much more gripping and why people really love that series. Or we can hop over to another series. Or let's take, say, like one piece. One piece has a like, more cartoony looking style, but then has like, others that look more serious looking and stuff. And the storytelling is super serious. But Luffy himself is like the character to bring the joy back into the world. Right, right. Like, ah. Like, this is why I'm such a fan of finding new art styles in manga and stuff. Cause I then have the question in my head pop up, what story are they trying to tell? What am I going to get through this art stuff? So yeah, that's kind of how my thought processes. This Is why I love finding new shows or manga that has a different art style and is not trying to copy somebody else or like, try and get like the same type of feeling. Like, you know how Shojo Manga or Shonen Manga have like, similar kind of looking stuff? This is why, like, finding new art styles, I'm just like, well, what story is going to happen here? Cause, like, because they like, incentuate like some scenes. Like, you know how there's some series that have like, more facial expressions and they're trying to really, like, talk more with the character faces or some of them are more with the body language on how they do it. This is why I like, I think art and storytelling have like, such a cohesion that it's important to understand, like, what the story is and how the art can tell it. That's what I love about it. But yeah, sometimes art style, not everything. Buddies thing and what not, or like, even the story, what not. So yeah, you do you and have a nice day. Thanks for stopping by.",

He made it very clear throughout the series he does not want to be forgiven or redeemed for what he did. Cause he knows what he did was fucked up. He just wants to do better and show he's no longer that guy. And I think that's fantastic. The comments under this was saying he doesn't get a redemption or he gets an atonement arc. And I wish more characters got an atonement arc instead of just being redeemed. He also briefly gets compared to Ozai in this clip. And yeah, obviously some comments didn't agree with that part. Yes. He. How? Yeah, he's. He's Ozai. He's just a reflection of Ozai. The entire Todoroki family is just inspired by the royal family and Avatar. How we not connected these dots? Anyway, give us more atonement talks cause it's much more realistic.",

Um, the thought was there was this moment in Innie's lobby where, after chopper was. I turned to this monster and then turned back. He was incapable to fight. He could not move. And he said that he envies Luffy sometimes, because it always seems like Luffy knows exactly who he has to fight right from the beginning. And obviously, we know that Luffy just went in, he solo run that shit and went straight for Rob Lucci. He knew right from the beginning that is the person he has to fight. And I think that is very. Hmm. It's. It's very telling of who Luffy is. And I know a lot of people like to see him as an idiot, but he's not. He's a. He might be an idiot in a lot of things, but he is emotionally incredibly intelligent. And in this case, he knows exactly what he has to do. And what he has to do in that moment that he knew right from the beginning is that he's not the hero that saves Robin. He's the support. Which, yes, he is the MC of the series, but he doesn't act on it every time and. And or Oda doesn't make him act on it every time. Like, yes, he's still the MC, but for the majority of. In his Lobby, we see mainly the other characters fighting their single fights, and Luffy is literally until we see him at the end then fight Rob Luci. He's the support. He's the one that's going to on a solo run to try and keep Rob Luci a baby. Cause he knows if Rob Luci goes against the others, that's not good. That's a no no. So he knows he has to be the one to go after it. And he doesn't have to be the hero that saves Robin in the moment. The others will do that. And he needs to keep Rob Lucia Bay to let the others do the saving while he's supporting them by sticking with the plan of solo running it and sticking with his plan, not with the plan of the others and. And going for Rob Lucci right off the bat. And he truly. He truly knows where his place is and when. And that is incredibly. I think that that moment where chopper was like, he always knows exactly who to fight and what to do is very true. And it also, um, really reminded me of this moment in Jujutsu Kaisen, which obviously I have watched Jujutsu Kaisen before I have watched one piece, but we're during the Shibuya, Auguji realizes that he doesn't have to be the hero that saves Gojo. He just needs to be a supporting factor in helping the others and letting the others do the saving. And it's Even though he's, like, the MC of the series, that's, I like, very telling for the MC to realize that. That's not my point. And Luffy already has this emotional maturity to understand that. And Yuji, in that moment, developed that emotional immaturity to understand he doesn't need to be the hero. And I really like that. I really, really like that. And I think this little moment where chopper said he always knows what to do and when really, really showed that.",

Cause again, it is acknowledged within the series that he can't be forgiven. He is beyond forgiveness. But the point of his character is to show atonement. To show that someone who has done something terrible can continue to live on. And even if they're not forgiven, they can seek to be better and do better. Not to get forgiveness, but to make up for the past. To try to atone for their sins. And even if they're not forgiven, at least they're doing something to be better.

There's literal consequences for how strong remember he is. You wanna watch anime with somebody just blowing up shit 24 7? Go watch wise man screen. Go watch Dragon Ball Z. It's called world building. You literally got like two or three seasons plus a movie and a Ovas, a Rimmer moving company pretty much kicking everybody else's shit. And you can't deal with like five or six episodes of them doing world building for the climax of this season? Again, this is not your typical use of card. There's literal consequences for how strong memory is. The country he's trying to make and the people around that country you can't handle world building?

Personally, I haven't watched NAR or one piece past like episode like 100 I think, and it is just personally too boring for me. I couldn't do it. Um, so I can't really say for sure, but the pain arc, the training exams, Sasuke retrieval arc, um, the war arc, um. Gaara versus Rock Lee, Obito versus Kakashi, Naruto versus Sasuke Part 1 and 2. So I'd like to pose a question to you guys. What point in one piece beats Naruto? Like, is there anything. Is there any reason for me to watch past like episode hundred? Like what?",

Excuse me, Justin Briner, I think the voice actor for Deku has been asking people hey, stop asking me about my ships! I don't want to ask! I don't want to answer these questions if they get inappropriate, it's gone too far. He's also has acts that those in the fandom or outside of fandom stop blaming the fandom for weird shit like this when I think he fails to realize that sadly 80, i'mma say 6 i'mma say 75% of my hero fandom are weirdos. Um, I don't know how Horikoshi can got the fandom to be how it is, but they're weirdos. But then again, Horikoshi Loki is a weirdo himself. Just a smidge. Um. You know. But I do think people should respect his wishes and not asking these questions anymore. I don't think none of the my hero fandom should ask this question to their VAs. You know, if the different fandom, sure, so be it. But stop asking the my hero cast what they think about ships. Stop doing it, stop doing it! Stop doing it! Like cuz you get shit like this and it's embarrassing. Like as a whole do you not feel embarrassed? Like I haven't been part of my hero fandom since I think season 3 of the anime and I don't claim them as part Of my fandom base. But it's like I feel embarrassed just thinking that this was once a fandom that I adore. It's just. It just went so downhill so quickly. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta do better cause this man is stressed.

    "voice_to_text": "Krillin was on earth. Would he have stopped Omni Man? Oh my goodness. How are people? Actually, you should well go watch the full video. He's on point. I don't know why people are arguing this or even putting up a fight about, but Krillin would smite Omni Man. That's just the truth. He is married to Android 18, and Android 18 does not fuck around. And I'm pretty sure she does not let Krillin be a bitch anymore. That's guaranteed. Now if you wanna make the argument that yam show would get beat by Omni man, go for it. No one gives a fuck about yam show. We all know yam just gonna lose. But you need to put respect on our boy's name, Krillin, because Krillin has shown his growth, his strength, and how powerful he actually is. Now. I don't know, I made an argument that, you know, Mike Tyson would decimate Jake Paul. I don't think it's gonna be to that extent, but Krillin definitely gonna put up a fucking fight and destroy Omni Man. I think Omni Man might get a good hit in or two, but nothing that's really gonna off balance Krillin. Honestly, it's like you got to take into consideration how much growth Krillin actually has. If you want to start off and say base level Krillin versus Omni Man, yeah, Omni Man's gonna win. There was no growth there. He's still young, he's still a coward, he's still not fully to His potential. But if you wanna say Super Krillin, then you're wrong. Super Krillins a whole new beast and a whole new person. He is grown. He showed his potential. So, I mean, yeah, if you wanna make the argument, the getting Krillin would get smited. Yeah, I mean, he would. You would ultimately die. I think you'd get a hit in there too. But Super Krillin. Super Krillin's not going down without a fight, and he's gonna win that battle. That's just how it is. Just because of his growth with all the characters that he's been with, it just shows and speaks for itself. Omni Man doesn't have that type of growth. He doesn't have that. He's just one thing. This power is just one thing. There is no growth from this man. It's just an alien dominating species. That I don't see them growing or exceeding a power level like they do in Dragon Ball Z. The biggest difference here is that you actually see the growth in Dragon Ball Z, where invincible, they're just there and they have a power level they need. There's no increase or decrease. It doesn't really show that to me as much as it does in Dragon Ball Z, where you can ultimately see a powers, a person's power growth. And they're. They're just. Their growth in general, it's. That's the big thing here is like, krilling grew to be something awesome, and Omni Man is just Omni Man.",

What's your opinion on your ships? Oh, my god. How do we get here again, brother? Uh, it's the fact that this person was so confident to not only ask this question once, but twice at a different con with the same voice actor. And here's my thing. It makes it incredibly hard for me, as somebody who actually likes watching MHA, to proudly announce that I am an MHA fan, because some of you MHA fans in that fandom have totally ruined that anime and that fandom. Okay, I gonna keep it real. And yeah, every fandom has weirdo ship people, okay? Those weirdos. I ship weird things, all right? But to go to a con and actually ask the VA actor that question when all he does is he's there for a check, okay? He does the voice. He does the voice acting for a check, okay? He doesn't give a shit about the ships. Are you insane? Listen, as an anime fan, I also have ships too. Like, we live in our own delusion and fantasy, but some of y'all are little too delusional and living in a complete, like, fantasy. And Justin unfortunately, has to make public statements that he does not feel comfortable talking about ships. And it's getting out of hand with these Questions? Because that's all you guys ask when he's invited to these cons. Why can't y'all just be normal and ask him what it's like being a voice actor in the industry? Or, like, how much does he like something that's not about ships, okay? Something that. Please. Unfortunately, some of y'all like to teeter totter on the P E D O. Line, cause those are kids in that anime. I don't. I don't know why we try to schmexualize them, but it's getting a little bit out of hand, all right? And I need y'all to just take a chill pill. This is embarrassing. I. If I was that person, I would never show up to a con again. Don't ask those questions, because now you look weird. You look weird.",

I've been making how many videos about season 5? You know, praying for season 5. When is it coming? And people ask me every day. I would get like 5. I'll get like 20 comments a day of people asking me where season 5? And I can never really give them the answer. Right? But now I can genuinely give you guys an answer. It's not a lie. This is real. Season 5 is in the works. They are making. They're still making DXD animes. So season 5 isn't the works for y'all boys. Is not. It's not a joke. This is real. So I can finally give your boys that, you know? I'm saying we've been. We've been waiting for a long time, man. I'm gonna bring a two tomorrow. Thanks for the support for all these years man.

Drake, if you wanna pay somebody, pay me. Because I will be a better friend to you and let you know to stop whatever you got planned in your head at any point. It seems like this man already thought about it. He's like 10 moves ahead of you. He's a mastermind. Leave it alone. But if you want to do this fight, I can tell you what you gonna need to win. Right? And please, everybody, tag Drake in this. Try to get this to his for you page. He's gonna need all the dragon balls. He's gonna need to recruit every single Avenger, including Thanos and the infinity rings. In order to change reality. He's gonna have to go back to the 90s, recruit the Thundercats, captain planet. And he has. He's gonna have to hit up the Magic School Bus just so he could get away at the end of the fight and even it. And maybe hard for you. Trust me when we say we understand. If you just lay your guns down, Drake. If you just stay down on the floor. You got beat bad enough, and we all. You're at the point where we feel so bad that we won't even judge you for losing the fight because he smacked you so hard. But if You decide to get up after this and still try to come, trust me when I say you're going to get extremely embarrassed. You're going to get hurt. It's. It's gonna be a bloodbath. And we, at this point, folks feel bad for you. And whoever's in your camp don't like you. If you haven't. You haven't picked it up already, the call is coming from in the house. I'm telling you, they don't like you. They selling your shit. I'm telling you, whoever's in your camp, they selling you up the river.

And before you're like no, you need a like, rebirth. No you don't. Isekai literally means just going to another world. It means being transferred to another world. So it would have to be like Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland. As a matter of fact, a lot of isekai series and a lot of anime series in general take reference to Alice in Wonderland, so it would be arguable to say, you know, one of those is actually. I'm gonna look it up. Which came first? Alice in Wonderland or? I looked it up. The godmother of anime is Alice in Wonderland. It's was written back in the 1800s. And of course there's probably other stories that you could talk about, like, you know, um, some Greek stories that could probably be considered Isaka. You know, like people going to the underworld to find a gal and, you know, walk forward and make sure not to look back or else she'll be stuck there forever. You know, stuff like that. But like, there have been so many series before the anime about the pedophile that gets reborn in another world after he gets hit by a truck. Because that's all that is, by the way. It's a pedophile that gets hit by a truck. I can't. I get the Like, they. They opened with that. I'm sorry. Yeah, but. Yeah. The true godfather of isekai is Alice in Wonderland, which was also written by a pedophile, so. Yeah, but. Yeah. Anyhow, argue about in the comments. I don't care.",

    "voice_to_text": "Kind of overwhelm the audience. You can burn people out, and that's not always the best approach. This creator is talking about one piece currently having an ongoing manga, anime, and live action series. It getting a anime remake might be a little bit too much and might burn out the audience for one piece. I disagree with this take because of one very specific reason. All of these sources for one piece are targeting a relatively different demographic. You've got people who are die hard anime fans. They've been watching the one piece anime since 1999, and they are watching it every single week. You also have people who are manga fans who prefer to consume this kind of content in a manga format. And on top of that, the live action just brought in a massive demographic that has been very averse to starting the anime or the manga because of how long they are. All of these formats do a fantastic job of telling this amazing story that we love to an audience that wouldn't normally consume it otherwise. I would say the number one barrier to get anybody into the one piece anime or manga is because it's too long and the pacing is rough. And for current anime and manga readers, it's way off the base for what they're used to consuming. So I think getting a remake gives one piece another amazing chance to get deep into the hearts of the newer anime and Manga fan base so do I think this is gonna cause burnout? No, another side of this is one piece fans or one piece fans. They're gonna consume it in all possible facets. Once I catch up on the one piece anime, I'm sure I'm gonna be jumping over the manga to consume more content. And I'm gonna watch season 2 of the live action the moment it drops cause I'm super excited about that too because again, I love one piece. And finally when they do remake the anime, I'm gonna be watching that as well. I'm hyped for it. I do not think this is gonna cause fatigue because I think the people who like one piece in their certain forms will continue consuming it that way. And this is just gonna grow the fan base even bigger.",

I really hope that this next chapter he has an awakening or whatever, but I still think he's sorry. Bro. The Kaiser Agenda will not be pushed while I'm here. We all know how it goes on. A character gets a flashback in anime. They either die or get a crazy power awaken. That niggas about to get a dual leg Kaiser Impact Bros about to go shot for shot with a soggy out of everybody in blue locker. I wanna see get power of the dude. I'm just waiting for Nagi. Bro. Nagi has been sorry for so long. Nagi used to be my favorite character too. Bro, I'm be honest. Bro. But he just got washed that last game. We're probably gonna see a Kaiser Awakening for sure do, but I'm here hoping for a Nagi awakening. If that next game that he plays he doesn't score something I'm gonna lose it. This chapter did not make me like Kaiser anymore. I still hate you.",

    "voice_to_text": "Naruto and the show would have ended well, and it actually would have been higher than a 7 out of 10. Oh brother, this guy stinks. Listen bro, I have no idea why Naruto fans get so pressed when you say that the show is not a 10 out of 10. It is my opinion. My fucking opinion that the ending took the show from a 9 out of 10 to a 7 out of 10. And I will be explaining more of it right fucking now. Let's get into it. Remember, if any of y'all wanna fucking debate me on a take, join my discord. I will literally school every single one of y'all. Link is in bio. My main problem is that Kaguya's existence changed the entire history and lore of Naruto and changed all of it from cool parallels to a an asshole reincarnation. Without Kaguya there is no OSHA and Indra looking to seal her. And without those two there is no reincarnation leading to Naruto and Sasuke having the power to seal Kaguya. It took literally insanely written parallels between them, like these two on top of their fucking statues in the final valley to them all being reincarnated from aliens. Dog, you took the coolest power system known to fucking man with ninjutsu and turned it into a derivative of aliens. Everything is now a derivative of aliens. Which means that yes, the reincarnation was an asshole because it would not have existed if Kaguya didn't exist. Kishimoto wrote himself into a corner with Madara, and that's where Kaguya came in. She wasn't fucking foreshadowed. She's a derivative of an asshole because he wrote moderate so well. Again, without Kaguya, the reincarnation trope doesn't fucking exist. It's like spoon feeding you the parallels between them and calling you stupid. Parallels between them two and Hashirama and Madara were some of the most amazing parallels ever. But because they added Kaguya, now it makes it all about aliens and now it's spoonfini you calling you too stupid to fucking understand what was happening? And my gripe isn't really with the side characters. Yes, I would have liked to see Rock Lee have more screen time, but they also have some amazingly written side characters like Itachi and like Nagato. Without this garbage ending, the show is a 9 out of 10, at least for me. Brings it down to a 7 out of 10. And it's my fucking opinion. Literally cope about it bro. Aliens weren't foreshadowed. There was never any mention of aliens. Reincarnation wasn't foreshadowed. There was never any mention of reincarnation. The only thing that was there was the parallels between all of them. But then again, it was taken to a different level and made them reincarnations of fucking aliens. And connected through that thorough line. Which is dumb as fuck in my opinion. And again, if you have a problem with my takes or so you can debate me, join The discord. And I will school you in a debate straight up.",

But I just want to further add to this argument again. we know that Infinity works by slowing anything that approaches Gojo down to the point that it never actually reaches him. And we know that Gojo was able to train his infinity to work based off of purely reflex. So the second his mind senses something as dangerous, infinity activates to protect him from it. But wait a minute. Who else had a technique like that? Oh shit, right? It's almost like Gaara's sand did the same exact thing. Protected him the second his mind sensed danger, because it basically had a mind of its own. And rock Lee was able to outmaneuver his reflexes to the point that his sand couldn't even have enough time to sense the danger and react to it. So this reflex that senses danger and automatically protects the user can be out maneuvered. Okay, and if infinity also works based off of sensory and sensing danger, then if it's not already activated, it can be out maneuvered before it activates. On top of that, we know Gojo doesn't have unlimited energy, so he can't keep infinity on forever. And have already proven that you can break through Gojo's infinity with a high output attack that overwhelms his energy output. In other words, if you're hitting Gojo's infinity. With more energy than he's putting into the infinity, you can break through it. He has to amplify or put more cursed energy into his infinity to keep attacks out when they're stronger or bigger. For example, a normal punch is going to take a lot less energy from Gojo to block with infinity than the earth exploding or something. Obviously, you know, there's different scales. So not only can Infinity be broken through, but if it's not already activated, Gojo can be blitzed before he can even activate it, as we've seen before with characters like Gaara, who was blatantly able to out maneuver sand that could sense danger and protect Gaara automatically without his conscious will. So anyone as fast as Rock Lee or faster can just speed blitz before Infinity even gets activated, because Gaara, Sand, and Gojo's Infinity basically work the same way, they just do different things. So in the end, infinity is not infinite. Let's stop it.",

    "voice_to_text": "What's a video game that you know will never exist, but you would pay so much money to see happen? Let me cook a fairy tale game in the vein of Monster Hunter. So basically, instead of having the 14 different weapons, you'll have various different, like, magic attributes. You know, ice, fire, light, um, wherever the fuck Lucy had, the door one, um, you know, lightning, shadow or all that nonsense. And rather than fighting, like, monsters throughout the game, you'll be fighting the, um. Or you can still fight monsters, you know, like random monsters, just, um, NPC style things that you can program into the game, but also like, main, like, story point fights. They will be, um, villains, maybe even some heroes from the show. And as you beat the villains, you know, all the heroes, you unlock more types of magic or you unlock more powerful forms of the magic that you already have. And the reason I said in the style of Monster Hunter specifically is because that is a game that puts an emphasis on, like, team oriented gameplay. Like, there are certain missions where, I mean, you could solo them, but it's better and easier if you do as a team. And you're obviously one of the themes of fairy tales, friendship and, you know, teamwork and that sort of stuff. So just implement that into the game. And you could even implement, like, low accurate details of the show into the Game like, for example, if you have an ice maid who's maxed out, and he's unlocked Iced Shell, that can do serious damage to a strong enemy, and if it's a weak enemy, it one shots them. But it does come at a cost. Where, like, if you're implementing the. The cart system of one time, so where, you know, 3 carts in your teams. Basically like mission failed. Well, let's see, for balance, it takes 2 cards, you know, so basically you. You have one life left at the end of the um. At after using that move successfully. And of course, the more character you beat, the better drip you unlock as well.",

The four most popular new Genama can. Because you never even seen boo leaks. You wouldn't even recognize what is what. What exactly is police inspired in these series?

    "voice_to_text": "If Krillin was on earth, would he have stopped Omni Man? Oh my goodness, let's. Let's. No exaggeration, you would likely need at most Namics Saga Krillin if an absolute most android to sell Saga Krillin to defeat the likes of Omni Man. And the only reason I'm pushing that far into the series is for the speed, because we know that Omni Man's like best feats are his speed feats. Because strength wise, him and two other viltrumites were needed to destroy a destabilized planet, which puts him comfortably around like continental to multi continental in terms of power. But even if we highballed him and said that he could have destroyed a planet viltrum by himself and put him at planetary, that would still put him at like Raditz level. And that's crazy because by the Namek saga Krillin's power level was already like 50 times higher than Raditz. So me pushing to Namek Saga or further isn't to deal strength wise with Omni Man, it's more so to deal with his speed. Because speed is gonna be the only thing in Omni Man's favor up until a certain point in the Dragon Ball series. Because strength wise and durability wise he doesn't stand up to even Namik Saga or Android Saga Krillin in terms of power, let alone if we are using current Krillin like tournament of power or even Moral Arc or later Krillin. Ironically, Krillin flicks Omni Man's head off. Especially if this is like A bloodlusted thing where Krillin is for some reason going for the kill. Even Omni Man speed would be nothing compared to current Krillin. Even when he was sparring against base Goku and we knew base Goku was more than likely holding back. It doesn't matter how much he's holding back, that is still Goku. The fact that Krillin could even make a suppressed Goku fight back properly is a feat in itself. And let's just say for the sake of argument, we made their stats equal. I'd still bet on Krillin because he is a better fighter. So even an equal stats match up where everything is equalized. I'd still say Krillin because he just has the ability to fight properly, whereas Omni Man isn't as skilled of a fighter. But yeah, at any normal circumstance, anything past the Namek Saga's overkill.",

    "voice_to_text": "You also say Dragon Ball Z is not repetitive. Do you still believe this? It's not to reason or reasoning. The action of thinking about something. The action of thinking about something logical or in a sensible way. He explained the reasoning behind his decision at a media conference. He explained the reasoning behind this decision with his story. He explained this. He explained that to say the reasoning does not matter is Nolan void. Reasoning is basically explaining why it matters. Like, do you hear yourself? No, you don't. You're just a Dragon Ball hitter. I know, and that's why at the end of the day, they'll still be the go Goku, will still be the face of anime. The main MC, the best MC. It'll still be the number one anime in Japan and America. This is its history, which was created by this man. He created a legacy. This is gonna go on for generations. People are finna talk about his creation for generations. Whether you don't like Dragon Ball or not, it's still in your conversation, which is giving it attention. Thank you. All of this. Everything anime stems from this. Let's get that straight. Doesn't matter if they were repetitive or not. I don't think they're repetitive. And if it can be explained with a reasoning, you can't say the reasoning doesn't matter. The reasoning is what makes the matter. It's what makes it matter. What are you talking about? I got no respect for Dragon Ball haters? None whatsoever. You don't like the anime, don't watch it. Move on. Don't let it come out your mouth. Don't let it come into your thoughts. Just move on. Keep moving. Cause this shit ain't going anywhere anytime soon. Y'all know every time they come out with a new series, a new season or new game, they're breaking the internet. It's not Naruto with their copy and paste. It's not MHA with their cash grab greedy ass mentalities. It's dragon. All mother Fucking Z, Super. Doesn't matter. Dragon Ball as a franchise, they're the best. The GOAT. Father of anime, father of the Big Three. It's just me. Hell you talking about? Are tournaments not a viable way to test strength? Thank you. And if we want to say it's repetitive? Anyone who actually watches the show knows that the Cyberman and Cell Junior could not both detonate. Yeah, cyber man can attach themselves to anyone already. You're wrong. One is completely green and a whole different race. And the other is blue black with some gold and some dark blue. Again, whole different race. So, y'all ready? Down more than two points, by the way, but i'mma keep going. These things, we're actually strong. These things were actually scrapping. And it took Gohan raging to take these things out. These things. New commandment, y'all. Hmm? Would you look at that? These things came straight out of the cell like the dude said. And cyber man just Came from space. So, yeah, you're wrong. Keep sipping that hater, right? I'mma drink my water with you. And do what you do. There still be number one. There still be remaining. No matter how hard you hit. So see you later.",

I don't wanna be Naruto, I don't wanna be Ichigo, I don't wanna be Miles Morales. I don't be none of them. Because, yeah, you get the powers, yeah, you the MC. Diverse. But guess what you get with that? You get the sinister six, you get the Espada, you get the Akatsuki. And that shit sucks. Oh, you think. You think that's just in the comics? Naughty. Gonna get him in real life too. They call him Miles Morales NPC. They damn near calling Miles Morales at this point. So if somebody sees him on the street, they can go, oh, damn, that's Spider Man. Let's get him. No, I'm good. Say, keep that, I'm civilian. And listen, this is not to make light of him getting robbed. That shit sucks. However, you was making all that money getting all them galaxies on that sidewalk, and you thought DOC OC wasn't gonna pull up? You thought electro wasn't gonna come out the cut from a different timeline to give you a canon event? I don't know. That's all I'm saying. Just make me a side. Make me a cool ass side character that everybody fucks with that doesn't die, and I'm good.",

    "voice_to_text": "Tr\u00e8s bonne vid\u00e9o de levarant qui nous montre 1 case de marie-joie dans laquelle on voit 1 phare. Il rappelle aussi que marie-joie s'est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 10.000m d'altitude, donc sur headline, et il se questionne sur la pertinence qu'il y a 1 phare aussi haut dans le ciel. Il nous donne sa th\u00e9orie selon laquelle les dragons c\u00e9lestes auraient plac\u00e9 1 phare \u00e0 cette altitude en pr\u00e9vision de la mont\u00e9e des eaux. Car oui, dans le dernier chapitre, et attention au spoil, Vega punk nous dit que le monde va sombrer sous les eaux, laissant penser que l'eau va continuer \u00e0 monter et peut-\u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 10.000m d'altitude, c'est-\u00e0-dire jusqu'\u00e0 redline. En vrai c'est 1 bonne th\u00e9orie, j'aime beaucoup. Par contre, moi en voyant \u00e7a, j'ai pens\u00e9 \u00e0 autre chose. Suite au dernier chapitre, je vous ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 de la th\u00e9orie selon laquelle peut-\u00eatre que 1 fois que l'eau sera mont\u00e9e, les dragons c\u00e9lestes partiront tout simplement vers la lune. Et moi je me pose la question, est-ce que ce phare, il serait pas l\u00e0 justement pour \u00e7a ? Qui nous dit que les dragons c\u00e9lestes ils ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 construit des bateaux volants pour faire des tests pour essayer d'aller jusqu'\u00e0 la lune ? Et donc du coup, bah ce phare qui est plac\u00e9 tout en haut de Red Line, il serait l\u00e0 pour guider les bateaux volants des dragons c\u00e9lestes ? C'est dingue, pour pas qu'ils se perdent au milieu des nuages et cetera. Ce serait pas fou les gars parce Que oui, 1 phare de base c'est l\u00e0 pour guider les bateaux pour pas qu'il se prenne des montagnes et cetera. Donc ce phare, s'il est plac\u00e9 l\u00e0, peut-\u00eatre que c'est pour aider les bateaux volants tout simplement.

    "voice_to_text": "What's an anime rule you'll break? I have a couple that I know for a fact I would absolutely break. First off, if I get even the slightest hint that an ally, or hell, even someone I met just once even has a hint of evil or a hint of becoming evil, I'm gonna do one of two things. Both involve my fist in their face. I'm either going to knock some sense into them or knock them six feet under. Whichever happens first. I am not dealing with a possible major threat, especially if they are like a lead supporting character, because that means their power would actually be a threat if they were allowed to actually go far. So either punch them repeatedly until they've just get those thoughts out of their head, or keep going until there's no possible chance they could become a threat because they're going to be buried and the next thing. I am not respecting one V ones. I don't care if you're even slightly stronger than me, or hell, even if we're equal in power, I am bringing every ally I have. Hell, I'll bring the damn sensei character and we're jumping you if you pose any sort of threat to the world. especially if you're a threat to multiple people or the world at large. We are not respecting one v ones. I am not pulling some modern JJK where they are just fighting 1 v 1 when most of The series, they jumped people. If you are a genuine threat, don't expect to be 1 v 1. And lastly, I'm gonna do kind of a. I guess you could say this is a disrespectful thing. I will say the name of one attack just to hit you with a different one. One, it catches you off guard. 2 it makes me less predictable. And 3, it's just gonna be something that most characters don't do. Oh, and on top of that, I'm not gonna just declare what attack I'm directly gonna be throwing. I'm not gonna be charging like a Kamehameha or a Rasengan. Because then they hear what is gonna be coming at them. I'm gonna leave them on their toes, not knowing what they're gonna get hit by. Or if I really wanna throw them off, say the name of the attack that they think they're gonna get hit by and try to prepare for that. When in reality, I have something entirely different being cooked up to throw right at them.",

I was waiting for so long, but I finally got to say because I didn't wanna like jump the gun but still I knew was hitting on the trajectory to get there. My hero is officially the best new gen out and it's not close. JJK just simply does not have the depth in the layers of my hero. And if you think it does, you only read JJK. You don't read my hero. JJK is simply cooler and more mature. But there is no tone presented in JJK that's not presented in my hero. Along with other tones that Horikoshi does perfectly, yes, it's passing. Demon Slayer 2 Demon Slayer will always hold a high spot in new gen because it brought most of you to anime in the first place. Demon Slayer started the whole anime boom when people was bored during lockdown. This got a lot of people either back into anime or into anime. Demon Slayer definitely has the entertainment value of my hero, but it doesn't really have the complexity of my hero. Boruto I can't say much on cause I'm not caught up, but from what I read of Boruto so far, my hero is clearing. Yes, even chainsaw man? Of all popular new gens, my hero has to be the best. Even Fire Force? Let's be honest, Shinra and Benimaru carry. They don't have characters like all might Shigaraki twice Toga, Midoriya, Todoroki, Mirio, Bakugo. I can go on. Fire Force has characters, but if we keep listing, they can't go bar for bar with my hero. It's just not gonna happen. So shout out to my hero for officially becoming the best new gen, at least in terms of super popular manga. It's a well deserved spot, and I hope these final chapters wrap up the story beautifully.",

He got his, he reactivated his account, and my boy ND he was talking about him. So I sent the live to him. Unfortunately, he respond. He responded very quickly, went in the live and have us talk about the fact that he did have evidence. Cause the entire time, Draco was talking about, um, no one has evidence. Um, you know, like these burner accounts. I would never make something like that, even though. But you could say all the shit that you've been saying. Andy comes up and it's like, let me in the live, let me up, let me show the evidence. And then Draco, funny enough, says, I will only let you up on the condition that you don't swear. Even though he was swearing the entire time before. Andy says, I will be civil. But then Draco goes, um, let me think, actually. And then goes on this whole rant about how everyone's out to get him, that those accounts aren't his, kind of backs down and says that he's going to sue and d. Take him to court or that they'll box, which, uh, yeah, let's be real that that wouldn't happen. Draco, I knew from day one that you could never stand on business, because the way you talk in your videos just completely projects the fact that you cannot do Anything to defend yourself. The fact that you had the nerve to go after my mutual ex saying, the fact that, oh, you're in the military and I refuse to go live with you, and you honestly tried using what's happening in Palestine, you had the nerve to use that as a reason why you can't defend yourself. X has nothing to do with what's happening over there. Him serving in the military, which, by the way, I wasn't even aware. So, X, when you see this, no, thank you for your service, but I just find it revolting that you not only use that, you're trying to out be out here defending yourself against the shit that's publicly out of everything that you've been saying, all the aces you are talking so big about someone, but the moment I send this to them, they come up, say, let me in the live, and they agree to your terms, only for you to back down and start being scared and start going after him, saying that you'll either take him to court or boxing, which, let's be real, you're not gonna do either. I just find that revolting. I find it just even more revolting that there's people defending this, which. Come on, dude. Anyways, I just thought I'd make that update. I just found it atrocious and TikTok in no way. This is not harassment. This is me simply documenting what is going on.",

Because outside of the fact that this would be a subversion of expectations, what good would the writing do if sukuna won? What it would mean for the story is that sukuna was right the entire time. Throwing everything away for the sake of power is the correct way to do things in the world of jujutsu society. That being alone is better than being surrounded by those you love. And I'm not saying that you can't have a different ideological perspective, but why would that be the perspective that you guys would want to win in the end? There's a reason that the power of friendship is such a trope, not just in shonen, but just in media in general. Because in real life, there's no part of oh yeah, let me just be alone always and forever. That sounds like an actually legitimately good idea, and even logically from any kind of media. Whenever you're battling somebody, there's literally strength in numbers. That's a saying for a reason. So despite everything, I don't think Tsuka is gonna win in the end. Utes being inside of Gojo's body is definitely going to lead them to a victory eventually. And thank you anonymous for the sponsored video. But yeah, I don't think that Suka is going to team wipe, and I certainly don't want him to team wipe.",

Bro, you sure? Barto has some bad episodes and bad animation. Sure, but you know the story is actually getting better. One piece bro, is taking like 1,000 episodes and almost like 30 years and we're not even like close. I'm so tired of hearing this thousand episode thing, bro. Y'all.

Now I personally, regardless of how you feel, I personally did not like Tokyo Revengers and another. I didn't like it. I just could not get into the story. I couldn't get into the story. There was, I don't know what it was. It was one of those whining or the situation going back in time for this girl, I. It just didn't resonate with me. It didn't bring me in. So I was like, uh, uh. Now the opener for Took Revengers Gas. So I was. I was a little hesitant into watching Winterbreaker, but I loved the perspective of the MC Sakura, so I watched it. And when I tell you cold heartedly this shit on Tokyo revenge windbreaker, when I tell you the fights, the hand to hand brought out fights are incredible. Behind that all, there is a true story about each character and the characters we presented thus far. I'm just like, wow. And I'm only anime only, only I don't read the manga. There's a manga for this? Or you know, whatever, this. I don't read it. But what we've gotten thus far from the characters that have been presented is Incredible. And the last episode. The last episode was was honestly probably the best anime episode of the of the week. That shit was incredible. That shit was incredible. Anime has has heart. This anime has rawness. This anime has kick ass fight choreograph. This anime is good. I'm looking. I'm so happy to see where this anime goes and it caught me off guard. But you tell me TikTok, what's an anime that caught you off guard that you did not expect to be as good as it is? Like for me with windbreaker. I wanna know. And are you watching windbreaker?

Like, I just saw an article that was talking about how light is one of the smartest people in all of anime, but like, even in his own show, he's kind of a dumbass. Like, on one hand, I kind of get it. We're watching the story from his perspective, and we constantly hear his internal monologue as he talks about how he is the most brilliant person to have ever lived, how no one can hold up to his rigorous intellectual might. But, like, objectively, if you look at his actions throughout the story, he's an idiot. He is given a perfect, untraceable weapon that can kill anyone, anywhere in the world any way he wants, and he has wiretaps in his room. Within seven episodes, light does nothing but make blunder after blunder, mistake after mistake, all while monologging about how smart he is. Light Yagami isn't a genius, he's just a narcissist. He's a high schooler with a god complex, and the only reason he ever had the upper hand on anyone is because he was the only one who knew the rules to the game that they were all playing.",

Let me show you what it is and let me see if you've seen it before. So it's called A regular at Magic High School, and I've only watched the first two episodes of it and it's not looking really great for me. So I thought this anime was gonna be more like how classroom delete is, but it feels more towards like the mad guys grandson, which that was a terrible anime by itself, but I'm not sure. I've only watched the first two episodes so. So if you've seen this anime before, let me know. Let me know if it's worth watching. But if you guys really want me to like, kind of watch it just to see how it is so you guys don't have to watch it, I'll do so.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so I got tagged in this post showing all the characters that Saitama could beat in a fight, so let's talk about it. First slide we have Gojo, Naruto, and Luffy. I'm not sure how Saitama is gonna bypass Gojo's Infinity, but if the battle lasts long enough then I can see Saitama growing strong enough to defeat Gojo. As for Naruto and Luffy, Saitama absolutely washes the both of them. Next slide we have Meliodas, Ryuk, and Adam. Even though Saitama scales above Meliodas, Meliodas is immortal and in his strongest form he has all the commandments, which is just an insane set of hacks. So Saitama loses with Ryuk? The battle can honestly go either way because Saitama can definitely defeat Ryuk. But Saitama is a human, so Ryuk can just write his name in the death note then. As for Adam, Saitama just destroys him. In the next slide Saitama destroys Deku and Boruto, but then loses to Krillin. I don't even know why this is a debate anymore. Like massively outscale Saitama. Next up it's absolutely ridiculous to think that Saitama could even touch Anos or Saber. Both of these characters would toy with Saitama. I haven't watched Mashle yet, so I'm not sure if mash would lose to Saitama or not. Then in the next slide Saitama will lose to Geronimo and Yuhubak. Their hacks are just too much for Saitama to overcome. However, he will beat Asta because anti magic is just useless. Against someone who is just pure physical force. Next up, Saitama defeats mob. I already said that. He loses to Geronimo. And then Saitama versus Alucard. Honestly, this battle would end in a stalemate. Or alucard will pull it off because Saitama has no way of defeating this immortal. Being the next slide, we have Zarif, Gilgamesh, and Goku, and all three of them would absolutely destroy Saitama. Moving on. I have no idea who this first guy is, but if he's anything close to featherine or Hajime, then Saitama is getting one tapped. And then the last and final slide. I mean, it's gotta be satire, because no way is Saitama defeating all of the anime verse, all of the Marvel verse, or all of fiction for that matter.",

They had a Saturday morning cartoon block, and that's where I got to see, like, Demon City, Shinjuku, Neon Genesis, Genesis Evangelion, Ghost in a shell. So many of them. Tenchimulu. That was, like, the best channel. What do you miss most about that era? The fact that you could be nerds in secret. Like, nerd culture is, like, too open now, and, like, everybody can watch. Watch. I found a YouTube channel with every anime I've ever watched, and it's just. You should have access. You should go to a VHS store and have to look for it yourself. Like, you shouldn't be allowed to just have access to all the anime. Do you feel like anime has become too mainstream at this point? I do. I think it's made dorks mainstream, and that's, like, hurting the culture, you know, keep. Keep dorks private.",

Now y'all know I love Demon Slayer, and I'm not one to downplay the Demon Slayer verse, but kokoshibo is getting cooked. Now. The Demon Slayer verse in terms of speed is not too far off from Jujutsu Kaisen. In terms of speed? Because Jujutsu Kaisen characters aren't really known for their speed besides my glorious King Kashimo. With that being said, speed alone is not going to be enough for kokoshibo to win this matchup, especially since he's still slower than sukuna. Not only is Coco Shibo just straight up slower, but sukuna is just overall stronger. He has better strength beats, he has better abilities, better hacks. All around he's just better. The only thing Kokoshima really has going for him is his regeneration factor. But his regeneration factor is not gonna matter when he gets hit with a malevolent shrine and gets obliterated into dust. So yeah, high and air Sukana absolutely takes this.",

Everybody else is regrouping while Naruto is getting his ass. While they're out here regrouping, getting their shit together. And then she decides to go after, but luckily a tailed beast inside him pushes his shit to the map, helps him get out of a tough spot. And then she goes back to whooping his ass. Continues to whoop his ass. Continues to whoop his ass. Finally they get to the dimension. I mean, are you really just gonna leave out the fact that Naruto can just overpower blatantly here with boy release and literally send her flying into a fucking cliff? Uh, what about Naruto literally chopping her arm off? I mean, this is literally illustrating to you that, yeah, Naruto is indeed relative to Kaguya the fucking delusional. You're getting your ass whooped, but because you got too good lick. Oh, oh, you're. You're relative? No. Not to mention, I think we're. I think we're missing apart. Naruto was not only amped in that fight. What part of he had help did you not understand? This is crazy. Y'all take him being amp you're like, oh, well, he was relative, so he. No, he's not, because he doesn't have all this anymore. Even when he did, it didn't help him. The only reason why bro got out. Of that is because again, one of the jinchuriki pushed his shit to the limit and gave him immense physical strength. Which is said, oh, got one good lick, and that was it. And she went right back to tool in his shit. Y'all is lame! Y'all are a bunch of lame! That bad enough with Naruto Sasuke I sent to that gravity dimension. They were going to die. If it wasn't for Kakashi and oh boy, Naruto and Sasuke wouldn't be here no more. They would be gone! That's how trash y'all are as a fanbase. You take him cutting off one arm and getting one good lick, and you're like, oh, he's right. No, he's not. If it wasn't for everybody pitching in to help Naruto, he be dead. He wouldn't even be here no more. There is no world or a dimension where he could have fought her by himself. He had all the tail beast. He had all his friends. He had Kakashi, he had Sasuke, he had Sakura, he had everybody. And if everybody didn't help, he would be gone. Matter of fact, he didn't even beat her by himself. If it wasn't for Sakura, they never would have sealed her. Because even with all that power, he can't kill an immortal. Hey, bro. Punched her one time and all she did was flying to a mountain. It didn't even destroy the mountain, just put a little hole in it. That's your physical strength, you Punched her into a mountain and there was a hole. Y'all are trash.",

But nobody really picked up on this thread about this right here. So I talk to a lot of people, and whenever I ask them why they wanna be a content creator or an influencer, they almost always say something like that, right? Obviously not that harsh, but, like, they want the money, they want the status, they want the notoriety, they want free products. There's gonna be a time where your dreams come true. You get the money that you wanted, you get your body done. You buy the presents, you buy all the, you know, the house, the car, then you do the nice travelling. And then just like anything else you buy, that loses its shock value. And all of a sudden, the fancy car you bought just becomes a regular car, right? Everything loses its shock value. So then what. What I'm doing for y'all right now is teaching you a life fucking lesson. You don't get to bully no fucking body and then be mad. When the rabbit got the gun. It ain't no fun. When the rabbit got the gun. And I'm Bugs Bunny, bitch. And what happens is some influences get lost on the core of business, which is to provide a solution to a problem. She could have totally Flip this around, right? Like, turn it into a series like on the road to pretty privilege, exposing how society treats fat people or whatever. Bigger people, like second class citizens. And she could have created a whole community around that. And brands would love to get behind that. That's a real message that brands would love to empower. And she would get the brand deals that she's complaining about. Right? And even if the brands didn't come, she can create her own community. It's not too late. But this is not the right angle. All the money that we want is in other people's pockets. If you wanna make more money, put people first. I know it sounds so cheesy, but do not let this world turn you hard. Do not let bullies win. Do not become the bully. Do not become anything that you hate. Transfer that energy into helping people.",

    "voice_to_text": "Fannita is spiraling right now because for the first time in her life she's realizing that she's a black woman and she's not okay with it Fenia thought that her issues stemmed from her fatness and not from her blackness so she thought that weight loss was going to remedy the disparities that she's been receiving over these last four years that she's been doing content creation now she's realizing that she lost weight and the things that she's now hungry for and the things that she wants are not coming to her and she's realizing that it's not because of her fatness that was the issue it was her blackness then she got on her videos misusing the study of intersectionality and misusing code-switching in order to make it seem like this was all purposeful and she didn't say certain things because she was fat and although portions of that might be true the reason why you're talking now is not because you want to bring attention to the wealth disparities and the pay disparities amongst black women and white women in content creation that's not why you're doing it you're doing it because you thought that these white people loved you for who you are and they and because you wear this token black girl you thought that your tokenness was going to get you a seat at the table when really it just got you a seat in the room but you they over there having a conversation and they not letting you know what they talking about you got on this app misusing intersectionality and misusing code-switching to manipulate people to make people think that this was all purposeful when really you're just angry at these people that you have wasted your entire life trying to appease now you realising that they don't like you now you're realising your tokenness your tokenness is only gonna get you so far period so what we're witnessing right now is Fannita lashing out she's lashing out and the reason why she's doing it over social media is because that's where she's gonna have the most casualties you're lashing when you do when you are not in therapy and you do not have the proper coping mechanisms to deal with the anger that's inside of you due to the injustice that you feel like were brought upon you you're going to lash out and because she has 2.3 million followers she's going to lash out in front of these people because that's where the most of her attention is gonna come from that's where she's gonna feel like she's getting all of this relief off of her chest Is if she lash out in front of all these people because that's what mass majority of her people are and during that lashing out you are attacking other black women first of all leave Mecca out of your mess because Mecca didn't do nothing to you second of all you're going a Decadent Dayne for something that maybe her delivery was poor but what she said was absolutely true and you're mad at it and then you started to make fun of her accent and it's just so problematic is so problematic and instead of you looking on the inside putting your phone down and saying maybe it's not these people's fault maybe it's my own fault you're lashing out because you're mad because you're not white you thought that you was gonna call out Alix you thought that you were gonna lose weight and that was gonna put you right next to Alix Earle because you thought that your only issues were that because you were fat and that was it you're not understanding that your blackness you you are black before you are anything so please don't get on this app trying to make it seem like \u201cI'm talking up now because I just I I'm tired I couldn't say things before cause I was fat\u201d you didn't say anything before because you thought that your issues were stemming from your fatness that's what your you didn't care about the blackness you don't give a fuck about no paid disparities amongst black women that's why you sitting on these videos talking about people in the projects and with roaches and eating noodles or whatever you were talking chicken nuggets spinning them far away whatever you were talking about you don't care about black women you don't care about the pay disparities you don't care about economic justice your issue is because these white folk are looking at you like um yeah we liked you when you were fat because we could poke fun of you being fat but now you're just black and a woman and we can't out loud poke fun and things like that so um your services may no longer be needed that that that's why you're upset it's insane then you get on this app talking about \u201coh my best friends are white\u201d we know Fannita  we know we know your your best friends are white we know okay at the end of the day you thought you were gonna lose weight put on that Versace robe and sit next to Alix Earle because your whole life you have been evading the fact that your blackness is the number one contributor to the way you get treated and now you are angry now you are mad you did that to yourself whatever schools you went to whatever your whatever you who put you on what that's on you and like Decadent Dayne said you were okay with getting the scraps and now you mad take your anger to somebody else cause honestly Fannita we do not care we don't care I'm sorry I'm not sorry we don't care",

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, so I already have a lot of responses on that video, so let's address some of the most common one. For starters, it has been a long time since I watched Gordon Lagan, and I didn't remember that he could apparently use his powers without the mech. In my memory it was him in a mech the whole time, so I was like, yeah, that's just a dude. But if he can indeed do all that stuff without a mech, like throwing galaxies and shit, then yeah, absolutely Simone. But that even further solidifies what I was saying in that video, that the people who make these lists have no fucking clue what they're doing. $2 for a guy who throws galaxies? You put the galaxy man next to a boy with swords and some ziplines. Then up next, a lot of people were saying that picking light is ridiculous. You're ridiculous. Light doesn't know my name. If he doesn't know my name, he can't kill me. But I can kill him. I don't even need one of these people to kill him. I'll kill light myself. And then finally, the character that I think is a wild card in the scenario, Ichigo. Ichigo is either a very dangerous threat or not really a threat at all, depending on how his powers interact with different verses. Cause like if you're doing any sort of like verse equalization or shit like that, Ichigo gets nerfed pretty hard. But if he Has his canon ability of instantly killing anyone who doesn't have the same powers as him. Yeah, that's a bit of a threat. All in all I stand by what I said in that video though. The people who make these lists have no fucking clue what they're talking about. And apparently sometimes I don't either.",

Gojo made him get rid of world cutting slash and he made him not use a domain expansion keep game. In order to activate the world cutting slash, the same hand sign used from a leveling shrine in Mitten was required. However, with only one hour remaining prior to their transformation, sukuna was forced to impose a binding valve to the activation conditions for all preceding uses of the move in order to cut Gojo. And now that I look at the damage sukuna took from hollow purple, the only thing he is missing is his fucking arm. So you're telling me if it wasn't for that little bit of damage on his arm, if that damage would have went somewhere else to like his leg, he would have been able to perform the world cutting slash whenever he wanted, even after he transform? Mind you, this is after a black flashed amp Gojo using purple because he was missing a little bit of his arm. Not even the whole thing, just a part he needed to fucking do the slash. That was enough for him to use a binding vow. Gojo is extremely lucky that that hollow purple did the damage where it was supposed to. If it hadn't, this battle would have been for no reason.",

    "voice_to_text": "If there's one thing I'm really good at, it's pissing off different fan bases. And in this case, it's the fairy tale fan base. 53 mentions. 53. All stitches. Every single one. I've watched them. I have. You all aren't safe. I mean, first off, you like fairy tale. Alright, like that. That already tells me enough about you. But like, you have to ask yourself, of all the ones you could watch, why fairy tale? Why? There are so many out there that are just infinitely better. So why? You got AOT, Dragon Ball, JoJo, one piece, JJK, Fire Force, Tokyo Ghoul, my hero. Just to name a few. So I just can't understand why anyone would willingly, willingly watch Fairy Tail. Yeah, I get it. I'm only five episodes in. But that's all you really need to realize. It ain't that good. No amount of explaining is going to convince me to watch that show. None. Oh, but the first episode is getting to know. I don't care. I don't. Should have made getting another characters better. Should have built the story up better within those five episodes. You should have. The characters just weren't interesting. They really weren't. Once Natsu used the same attack like 20 times in those five episodes, it kind of just became repetitive. And I just knew that was gonna be the case for quite some time. And really, I don't wanna sit through all that. I didn't. Now I know you guys Are thinking out loud right now. If you even made it this far into the video or typing in the comments. You said one piece. One piece is longer than fairy tale, so make that make sense. Here's the difference. One piece is actually good. Unlike Fairy Tale, one piece has everything it doesn't. A consistent story that's actually good, characters that you can actually vibe with, pacing that isn't life draining to watch, and a main character that I actually like. So doesn't really matter what you say. I hate Fairy Tale. It's not good, and you're never gonna convince me to watch it.",

Joey starts the series as someone who doesn't even fully understand the game of dual masters. He goes from just barely knowing how to play the game to topping in the Duelist Kingdom tournament and go into Battle City. And not only is he in a new tournament with higher level players, but he's also got to learn a new rule set alongside those other players. He's holding his own, he's working his way up through the ranks. He gets possessed by Merrick and forced to fight against his friends, but makes it out because of the love that they share. Gets into the top four of the Battle City Tournament and goes against Merrick where he is winning the game. If things continue as they are, Joey will play his last card, his gearfree, the Iron Knight, and he will finish off Merrick. Just like the other three people in the top 4, he has something special that he's gonna use to cheat. And in his case, it's using the wing dragon of raw to burn away Joey's soul. Joey deserves that win. How is that legal? Not to mention, before Joey finally collapses, he plays Gearfree, the Iron Knight and he gives the command to attack. So not only did Merrick cheat, Not only did he physically and spiritually assault his opponent, but even after that attack, before it finally took Joey out, he did what he needed to do to win. He played the card he needed to play, and he gave the command he needed to give. And because of the fact that he passed out, they said, oh, sorry, disqualification because he can't move. That is ridiculous.",

I'm gonna have 4 and still keep going. I am, of course, talking about the legend herself, Rumiko Takahashi. Urusei Yatsura, mice, Nikoku Rama 1/2, Inuyasha. Any of these four works alone would be a career highlight for the average manga artist, but Rumiko Takahashi was able to replicate that magic four times. In fact, I would be pressed to find an anime fan that hasn't at least heard of one of these works.

    "voice_to_text": "If Mushoku Tensei isn't supposed to be a redemption story, then what's the point in making Rudius so awful? You know, the kind of guy who constantly harasses women, and when two girls are bullying a friend of his, his solution to the bullying is to kidnap them and tie them up in his bedroom. If you're going to give a character flaws that glaring, or indeed any personality traits, they need to serve a purpose in the narrative. That's why I had assumed that Mushoku Tensei was supposed to be a redemption story. You know, a tale of someone overcoming those flaws and then atoning for the damage they caused. Because if it isn't, then what is it? Because I'll tell you what Mushoku Tensei is not. It's not a tragedy, the kind of story where the heroes own serious flaws end up leading to his destruction. Or even a comedy like South Park or it's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where you're supposed to laugh at the protagonist for being a terrible person. No, Mushoku Tensei maintains the tone of a fantasy adventure. It's just one where the protagonist touches children. And if that's not meant to be a crime that he needs to face justice for, then either this story sees that only as a flaw on the same level as being unemployed, or it's just included as pandering to the edgy kids who enjoy subversive content for its own sake.",

    "voice_to_text": "Who's the strongest anime fight user here? Let's go straight into it. This is a semi repeat from the last one that I did. People weren't happy with what I said, so let's go again. And the weakest is Roma Stank. He's just a regular human that can shoot fire out of his hand. That isn't like literally. I think I could beat this guy in a fight. I am the honored one for the next start of the Roma stank. Give me Sukuna! Are we really counting Sukuna as a fire user these days? Although these hand signs are low key cool as you go, low key it's cold. I'll be honest, people love to deride ace because 1. He's from one piece and 2. He's from one piece. But ace was not all that strong, at least from what he showed, and I refused him to put him any higher. And now to No. 4. Gimme Dabi! The only thing that gets in between him and ace is the fact that ace is a low gear. But in outright strength Dobby is strong with the top tier of my hero academia. They would be able to deal with ace outside of the fact that he's a Logan. And then out at No. 5. Give me Mary Leona Vermillion of her just being a Btech Yamamoto now. Apparently her reincarnating the dead with hell flames. Not bad. With her speed and, I don't know, raw strength and ferocity. I Would love to hit. I would love to hit if you look like Marilyn Monroe. Come here baby. Come here baby. But anyway, then out of No. 4, give me escanor. He's more durable than Mariano, physically stronger, his flames are just more likely hotter since he uses the sun. Honestly convinced Escanor could. I can't say that on TikTok. But anyway, top 3 Benimaru, Natsu and Yamamoto. And this is where people weren't happy in the last video. So I'm going to say No. 3 Yamamoto, seeing as his Bankai release was going to destroy the whole of the soul society. That's fair then in No.. 2 and 1, Natsu or Benimaru? Benimaru easily one shot at someone that was going to destroy the whole planet, so he's well above planetary. Not so. I don't know these feats for fairy tale bro, but the fact that Natsu can eat flame, there isn't much that Yamamoto can do. You guys tell me who you would put to No. 1. I'm going to guess and say Benimari. No. 1 No.. 2 Natsu. No.. 3 Yamamoto. Goodbye. Mwah!",

I'm gonna show you how wrong they are. But we need the full context. How was she able to pull this off? Now, this is what is important. It's not just the fact that this is how it's created, but it's how she was able to do it. This route. Time space is mother's exclusive domain where she can directly extract Chakra from Shinobi trapped in the Infinite Tsukiyomi. The Biju are now stable. Plus, mother has even produced a truth seeker orb. So the reason why she was able to create this true secret or was because she took the chakra from all of the people from the infinite tsukiyomi. She was gathering their chakra so that she was able to create this. If you've seen Naruto, you would know that Kaguya absorbed the chakra into herself before creating the truth Seeker orb. Now, why is this important? Kaguya was only replenishing the chakra she had already lost. How do we know this? Kaguya used the amino Minako total of four times during her fight, swapping two universes, each time, moving a total of eight universes. This, of course, got her fatigued. Now, if you've seen Naruto, you would know that if Kaguya didn't scale to the amount of chakra she absorbed, she'd have exploded. Which is exactly What happened to Madara when Kaguya's chakra went inside of him? I will say again. You cannot absorb more chakra than you scale to. You will explode. So for those who don't know anything about Naruto, Kaguya totally scales the trucycle. Does anybody have rebuttal to that? Anybody? I've delivered my rebel, and I'm curious to what you would say to it, actually. Will you even respond? Or will you block me? Or maybe you'll say in my Ra. So perhaps I was wrong. Regardless of what it is, I await your response.",

Like, when you really think about it, Marco has been pulling out insane feats from the moment he was introduced to current. Like, not only is this man trading blows with all three admirals at Marine Fort, not only was he holding off big mom briefly, my man's can even stall Kaido while running on E after everybody is pretty much defeated at the end of Wana. And people might try to bring up but he got beat by Kizara at Marine Fort. Listen, was fighting Kizaru perfectly fine until he saw his father have a heart attack in the middle of the back. Look at Marco's face right here. He's the doctor of the crew. This is where he got caught off guard. And it's understandable. And even then, that encounter was a 2 v 1 for Marco cause he was fighting Vice Admiral Onigumo and Kizar. If onigumo didn't put the cuffs on him, Kizar wasn't doing this to him. And once the cuffs are off, he's back at it again fighting the kind. So put some respect on Marco's name.",

When you say that, I can only assume considering it's fairy Tale, it gets good around season 5. I'm not even sure if Fairy Tale has five seasons, but I'll tell you this much, I'm not willing to find out. And the fact that this whole thing is trending on Twitter right now is crazy. And the glaze for this show itself is astronomical. People are already claiming it's going to be the anime of the year, as if it's ever been the anime of the year and it's entire existence. There is no hope for this. I don't care who's working on it. Fairy tale is about as predictable as wondering if the Sun's gonna come up in the morning. We already know it's going to. And in this case, we know it's terrible. There was quite literally no substance, any of this at all. I couldn't care less that there was a new season coming out. Nothing about this will change. Nothing. It's still as bad as it was In the first episode, as it is in the last episode of whatever this is.",

    "voice_to_text": "Miles does not scale to Blackheart. He left out miles needing to use Captain America shield. Let's stay consistent with that line of logic. Naruto needed Sakura. This downscale's Naruto significantly because he was never gonna seal her without her help. You could argue that Naruto failed where Sakura succeeded. So it was more or less Sakura that be Kage, not even Naruto. He just had the sealing technique that was given to him by the sage of six Paths. So without that, he's not relative to Kaguya whatsoever. Like current Naruto and Boruto where he doesn't possess the nine tails Chakra. He lost his state nowhere near Kaguya. Doesn't scale to her whatsoever. He also needed Obito and Kakashi just to bring this individual down again. Tripling quadruplet down. Naruto is not relative to Kage in any shape, way or form. Especially when he himself stated this chakra is even stronger than the 10 tail. This dark chakra that was coming from the ground was from all the people stuck in infinite tsukiyomi. All this chakra that she obtained in the rebirth. Who stated that the Ten tails has almost infinite chakra. And this is how we know every statement in power scaling in Naruto is hyperbolic. This is why there's only statements in Naruto. Because they're supposed to build up these character. But you're never gonna see any feat because all these statements are hyperbolic. Ten tails possesses infinite chakra. The 10 tail. First they plant the 10 Tails in the ground, it grows into a divine tree, consumes the planet, and eventually bears a chakra fruit. Kaguya eating that chakra. First off, the 10 tail is not just a divine tree. It's mother herself as well. This is saying Kaguya scales to the 10 tails supposedly because she ate the chakra fruit that was beared by the divine tree. But one thing does does not say Kagi is gonna have the same durability as the 10 tail. If you assume that just because she ate the fruit, you're a man. Unlike when Obito became the 10 tail, Kagi has always been the one more dominant, more in control because she ate the chakra fruit. But this is how we know just because you ate the chakra fruit means absolutely nothing. Here's a sage of six pads saying he's out of chalk. The man that defeated the 10 tails the first time around, saying, I don't have infinite chakra. I don't scale to the 10 tailed. Kagi needed to extract chakra from the Shinobi align, proving she doesn't scale to the ten tailed or the ten tails. Infinite chakra. Because if she had Infinite chakra, because she's one with the ten tail, she wouldn't need to extract any chakra. And no, I'm not missing any contact. Yes, I'm talking to you. It's Brian. Now, if there are any power scalers that have a rebuttal to that, I would love to hear it. Even another don't pick and choose What parts you want? I want. I want you to let me. I wanna hear every part like I'm being serious. Any power scaler or any Naruto fan, I would love to hear a debunk for everything that was said. Besides that, you guys have a great day. And as always, we'll be waiting. Well, we'll wait right here.",

Best believe if Ichigo knew about his powers and was training since he was 5 years old, his kid would look differently. Come on now, that's a no brainer. So he may only use gets a good 10 show or some version of gets a good 10 show. That's all he knows. He hasn't had time to develop new powers to explore his genes.

I'm not saying Goku because Frieza is. This definitely Frieza. Or you could say bears too, cause bears, the one told him to blow up the planet.

The JJK fandom is actually becoming, like, the worst that it's ever been, and it's just because of spoilers. Like, I. I understand you guys are happy, you guys are excited. Let me be excited too. I wanted to read the chapter and see that shit happen and just be like, oh, my gosh, but now all I gotta do is go on TikTok. All I gotta go is do on Twitter, scroll for like 1 2 seconds.

    "voice_to_text": "I have issues with this chapter. I'm not saying that the chapter is unreduable. I'm not even saying it's bad. I'm going to go over the issues that I have and let me know what you guys think. To start off using taking over gorgeous bodies a little bit weird narratively, because what is it telling us? There is a heavy emphasis placed on us by sorcerers of the past that, you know, discarding your humanity is the best way to fast track your way to power. If this is not something that you subscribe to or this is not something that you do, you will hit a glass ceiling. You will not be able to grow. Passes again according to the old age sorcerers. Now, Gojo is kind of the proof of this, but he's also kind of against this. Gojo's kind of proof of this, but he's also kind of proof against this as well. Gojo lost a little bit of his humanity when he was willing to slaughter civilians who were cheering on Rico's unaliving. Using ghetto as a more compass. He was able to realize that that was the wrong thing to do. And then he kind of goes on not really living like Sugona. Gojo instead uses his power to cultivate the next generation who he has high hopes for, expecting them to surpass him. A lot of Shinjuku showdown was a battle of ideals. Who had Gojo's ideal using his strength for his purpose. And Suguna's ideal. Using his strength for hedonistic tendencies. You did not wanting to leave Gojo alone make sense? But also at the same time, it's not really what Gojo would want for them. Instead of a battle of ideals. Yuta has already subscribed to Sukana's ideals. And now he's fighting him. This is not irredeemable. Yuta has to be punished for this. Okay, if he's not, then I do think it's a little irredeemable. The series should treat Suguna's ideology as wrong. Now, so far, Suguna hasn't received any punishment for it. But if you think as rewarded for this, well, then Suguna has the more victory. Guess what? Suguna? You were right, and this cannot be the case. Another issue that I have with this is that Gojo is expecting the new generation to surpass him. Now, I don't mean literally. I don't think he thinks Yuji, Toto and Yuta will eventually become stronger than him. But I think of the sense that they will be able to achieve something that I wasn't able to. Such as defeating sukuna. Using Gojo's corpse to do this kind of leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm gonna be completely honest with you. Because was the way you were expecting this all along is for them to actually discard their humanity? Cause probably not, right? But like, this is just. What? I don't know. I don't know. It just. It just doesn't really sit right with me.",

I love this chapter because it was just a wake up call. I've been telling these Gojo fans for months! Gojo is dead! He is not coming back! But I told you guys if Gojo didn't come back, people were gonna say it was the the worst chapter of all time. It's almost like throwing away your humanity is part of getting stronger. Let me put y'all on game, cause a lot of you Gojo fans may not know this. The more and more this fight goes on, the more Sukuna's ideals become true. Just like sukuna said, you have to throw away your humanity. It's almost like hanging on to those human emotions makes them weak. I wonder who said that. Hmm. You guys love to dissect everything Gojo related, even if it doesn't make sense and contradicts what's going on in the story and how Gojo actually feels. No one said that was supposed to be a positive thing. But you guys know. Gojo fans.",

But I'm gonna ask this question anyway, even though I already know the answer. Even though I already know the answer, can somebody explain to me how Kaguya makes a truth seeker orb? Again, I already know how she does. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to make a video and explain how she makes one, while also explaining how she created her universe and how she's able to destroy a planet. Also, also, I would like you to explain how she gets the power to do all of this. Again, Naruto community you don't have to answer it, but I just wanna see if someone's going to go out and explain it. Oh, and when you. When you explain it, you have to use only the manga panels, nothing else. Only the manga panels. Okay. And don't worry, guys, I'm gonna wait. Okay, I'll be right here, waiting patiently. Okay, you guys have a great day. Bye!",

I make these Uncle Ruckus videos. It's a haha joke. We all know that. There are people who believe it's true. There are people behind my back calling me a goddamn tar donkey, knuckle dragon, African baboon. That's what's happening. They cannot stand the side of us. They hate the way we talk, the way we walk, they hate the way we dress, they hate the way we talk. They hate everything. And I feel like we downplay what was really going on in during Jim Crow and post Jim Crow. These people could not stand to be around black people. You know why we have private pools? It's because when integration happened, these white people were like, Yo, I would rather die than to swim with a black person. That pool water will be so goddamn dirty. So we're gonna close all these pools down, we're gonna close all these parks down. We are only having private property. These are your grandparents. And it gets taught.

    "voice_to_text": "This is going to blow your mind. A startup company called Brain Bridge announced today that they believe that they will be able to successfully perform a head transplant surgery in the next eight years. The way that this would work is you would take a person with a perfectly healthy and active brain, but their body has cancer or paralysis, and transplant it to a brain dead donor body. What's crazy is that they said that by doing this, a person that's receiving the new body would still be able to maintain their memories, cognitive abilities, and consciousness. They say that the brain could last several hundred years if it had a good working body, and that that might be a potential in the future, but that this would also give people with different ailments a second chance. The procedure is advanced and way over my head, but it uses robotics and AI technology to make sure that the precisions and refusing are exact. It's crazy because you have to wonder if somebody that was 6 4 will end up 5 6 or the other way around. The company's tagline is breathing life into new bodies one head at a time. It almost seems like this wouldn't be real, but you can all go ahead and check it out. And everybody has done an article about it. Is just absolutely insane. So my question to you is, would you get a new body and have your head transplanted if You have the chance. As always, I wanna hear what you think about all of this down below.",

Now, since we've established that the 10 Saigon basically has planetary lows of energy, or large planetary lows of energy, Naruto basically one shot it, like with the base Rasengan. Just one shot it. This would utterly get him to planetary, since he one shot is something that is planetary, you know, in terms of energy. Now, I know the logic that we're going off of. Oh, you show him destroying a planet or affecting a planet, I mean, he basically just essentially one shot at a planetary energy source. So this feed would. And this is why the Naruto community is effectively trash, because y'all are disingenuous. First of all, that wasn't a base where I sing on. Secondly, the clip that you showed showed that he couldn't do it by himself. Now, why could he not do it by himself? Thinking not to explain that, she stated only somebody with her bloodline could even touch it, cause it would have drained them of their chakra. I mean, his verbatim stated. So Naruto said, hey, infuse your chakra with mine. And we know chakra not naturally is blue. And when Naruto's chakra turns red, it means he's using the nine tails chakra. But ultimately, this was a feat that both of them needed to come together to do, while at the same time. That power source is made up of byakugan eyes, and once they disrupt its energy, it pretty much took its Normal shape. It didn't even explode. It just turned back into Bakugan eyes. And then for you to say he did it by himself or that he one shot it with a base Rasengan when it. It. It explained it. It. It literally explained he couldn't do it without. And it took both of them, because if he had did it by himself, it would have drained him. This is. This is sad. This is really sad. Wow. You.

Not fucking one of you! Cause the fucking feet doesn't exist! You know why that bitch don't fucking exist? Y'all remember when Naruto and Sasuke clashed? Do you remember what Sasuke said? He said this right here was his most powerful fucking attack. I'mma say it again. Sasuke himself states on that page that this is his most powerful attack. And when that attack collided with Naruto's attack, not only did it not threaten the planet, crater, the world didn't do any of that, but what it did do is almost kill him. Again, an attack that was not planetary affected a character that y'all said is multiversal or planetary. Again, an attack that didn't threaten the planet was not planetary in the slightest. Not only almost killed both of them, but at no point did it threaten the planet. But I'll tell you what power scale is, since y'all love the power scale so much. If none of you can either provide Naruto killing a planet or threatening a planet and every feat that you wanna use, like trying to say because he hurts character A, then that means he scales to it. Your words, not mine. At the end of the day, power scales ultimately lose. Point Blank simple. What was asked was to show Naruto either Killing a planet or threatening a planet. None of you have yet to do that. And instead of simply saying with those feats do not exist, so we can simply move on, but you're incapable of doing it, which is why the community has basically been turning on y'all like it's crazy. Cause you won't believe the phone call that I got today. This whole debate is ending up on people's dinner tables. Like I said, if you can't show Naruto destroying a planet, or even being able to threaten a planet, he's not planetary. And real quick, we're not saying he has to destroy the. I said threaten the planet or destroy the planet, because honestly, he has no attack that allows him to do that. But I'm pretty sure you all knew that. But other than that, you have a great day.",

    "voice_to_text": "So the results for UTA versus Kashimo may actually be different because of the latest chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen. It used to be that Kashimo would win because he had some of the better speed feats in Jujutsu Kaisen, and even though he only lasted a chapter and a half, he fought the strongest version of sukuna outside of Gojo. And that's what I used to think too. But the latest chapter may have changed a couple things. Whenever UTA first showed up to battle Sukuna, Sukuna still had all four arms, and he stated that these overall amount of cursed energy is about the same as the possessed brats or UTA. And keep in mind this is still after Yuji landed one or two punches. the common thought was that even though it's only one or two punches, it's still enough to drop Sukuna's curse energy, which means he's still not as strong as whenever he was battling Kashima. Except it turns out after Yuji has landed eight different black flashes, Sukuna's efficiency with cursed energy is still so efficient he still has as much as UTA Akatsu. So the current sukuna is weaker, obviously because of his physical state. But UTA may have battled a sukuna that was just as strong as the one that Kashimo battled. So with domain expansion, UTA could take this now. And people will argue that Kashimo's hollow wicker basket, but as we saw, UTA has counters against hollow wicker basket and Unlike Sukuna, Kashima doesn't have forehand, so he can't use two hands to keep up hollow wicker basket and use the other two hands to attack, just like sukuna. So I don't know, but UTA might take this now. Let me know what you guys think. And Peyton Coombs, thank you for the sponsored video. But I think UTA might be able to take this now.",

Like he could spam this shit over and over and over again and if he did, it would no doubt destroy the earth. Like not just the earthquakes that they're gonna be magnitude 50, making big ass chasms in the earth, but you can't forget these big ass tsunamis. And all of this shit can set off underwater volcanoes. Or just regular volcanoes. Which brings me to a kind who could also just set off every volcano, causing a permanent volcanic winter and an uninhabitable surface magma all over the place. So they can't blow up the earth, but they can destroy it? Wait, there is Fujitoro who can just rain down meteors as he pleases. He could definitely destroy the earth that way if he spammed it.",

Cause I'm tell you, me and my friends, we do all those things. Hell, we just spent the weekend going to an anime convention when people who are literally in our 30s, and guess what? The beverages at us feeling great. We was in cosplay. We were enjoying ourselves so much, so we went to the after party. My neck is still sore today. It's Tuesday. That after party was Saturday night from all the dancing shit we were doing. Grandiose old time. Y'all just suck. Y'all know everyone. I've seen stitch. This is like there's no third spaces. And know this and know that. It's because y'all suck. Y'all don't know how to have fucking fun. We grew up. I'm 38. We grew up in a time. Go fucking outside and make up shit to fucking do. I mean, goodness, go grab a tarp, throw some soap on it, and go fucking have, like, your own slip and slide fucking wrestling matches, for heaven's sake. There's so much shit you can do, you just don't do it. You don't wanna live life because you won't put the fucking phones down. You don't Put the iPad down. You don't get off of social media because this is another problem y'all have. Y'all think you have nothing to do because you can't go do the outlandish shit that people online are doing when there's a ton of shit you can go do. Use your imaginations. I mean, we are the smartest we have ever been in the fucking society, and y'all like, I don't have anything to do? The fuck? What the fuck are y'all talking about?

Bankai is a materialization of the highest form that your zanpakuto can achieve. So when someone says your bankai or a bankai, they are talking about the level that they have achieved. It is the final upgrade given to the zampac toe and a name that was given by Ichibay. Bankai evolved zanpakuto. It's not like Super Saiyan. It's not like Sage mode. Can go look it up yourself. It's very easy. The problem is a lot of people have misconceptions and they don't understand what it is. They think, oh, a bankai is a transformation, oh, bankai is a technique, when in truth, it's neither. Hope this helps.",

So if you wanna hit on Kawaki, one thing you cannot deny is that Kawaki is confirmed to be light speed. We know that one of Delta's abilities is to be able to shoot light beams out of her eyes. Here, when Naruto's fighting Delta. Delta tries to pull a fast on a Naruto by attacking Himawari. But the scene starts right here. You can see everybody's position, and you can see Kawaki right there. And in the next page, Delta fires the beam right here. Naruto jumps after the beam has been fired, because, again, the beam was fired on this page. And Naruto says, god dang it! Here. And then jumps on this panel. Then we see a kaboom. And afterwards, we see that northwest caught Himawari. But what nobody mentions is the fact that Kawaki is the one who tanked that attack. So Kawaki, who was standing right here after the beam was fired, after Naruto jumps, see the beam sailing through the air as Naruto jumps to catch Himawari. Then we see the kaboom. Then we see the Kawaki tank the blast. As you can see, he's not in this frame. After the beam was already fired. He hadn't even jumped yet. He was still over here. So at the same time that Naruto catches Himawari, wacky tanks the attack. Now, this is a clear As daylight speed feat",

    "voice_to_text": "Something that seems to confuse a lot of people is the idea that dodging a light speed attack does not make you light speed. Let me break down why that is with this diagram right here. Let's say you got Person A and Person B. Person B decides to fire a laser beam at Person A. Person A responds by moving their head out of the way, allowing the laser beam to just pass right by them. This laser beam is moving at light speed. However, that person's head was not moving at light speed. Hopefully this makes it, like, easier to understand. But let's say that the laser beam leaves the person's hand and travels 10 feet to get to their opponent, and the person that moved their head out of the side moved their head 6 inches. It took the same amount of time for this laser beam to move 10 feet as it did for this person's head to move 6 inches. Since this covered less distance in the same amount of time, this movement is not relative, speed wise, to the movement of that laser beam. Now, this is also assuming that they started moving their head when the laser was fired, but that's not really how our brains work. Good analogue for this is pitchers and batters in baseball. On average, it takes less than half a second for a fastball to leave the pitcher's hand and make it to home plate. And yet the Average reaction time in the MLB is point seven, five or three quarters of a second. The way that they're still able to hit these fastballs even though their reaction time isn't fast enough to do so is by predicting where the ball is going to go and starting to swing the bat before the pitcher even throws the ball. In the context of a fight, this would be someone looking at the opponent's weapon and determining where it's aiming and preemptively moving out of the path of that projectile. How would you take a situation like this and make it a light speed feat? Well, let's take the same situation. You have two people 10 feet apart. One of them is charging up a laser beam. Person A is being attacked. Person B is charging laser beam. So Person B fires their laser. Now, in this situation, in the time that it takes that laser to travel the 10 feet to the target, that target is able to move 10 feet out of the way. Because they moved 10 feet in the same amount of time that it took that laser beam to travel 10 feet. That would make this feet light speed, because the person is actually moving at the same speed as that laser beam.",

You deserve whatever happens to you after that. My thing is, that's been known about me. Say it again. The minute you threaten me, threaten my wife, or threaten a kid on this app, baby, it's over for you. And I make sure I keep a record. Information is king, baby.

Fun fact Vic I actually defended Gojo defeating Goku for the first year I was on TikTok and didn't lose a single debate on that topic. All loved my Asian brother Vic. But no, it is surprising to me that is 2024 and people still think that Goku has a Kai. Goku has self admitted that he messed up whenever he tried to copy Beerus's Hakai. If you try to do a backflip and then you failed and landed on your neck, did you do a backflip? No. No you didn't. And narratively this wouldn't make sense either, since the entire point is that Goku is going to train to use the Angels technique, which is massive alter instinct. And Vegeta is going to train to use the destroyers technique which is Hakai and destruction. Which is as we know, why it's actually different energy to use Hakai. It's destruction energy, which Goku does not use to move and talk and avoid where time doesn't exist. And Goku is able to move faster than Granola's clone, who has stayed to be faster than instantaneous travel. And again, just overuse scales that have been debunked for years and yet we're still using them. Goku was faster than instantaneous movement. Then he wouldn't still be using instant transmission. Instant transmission wouldn't still be catching people Off guard! And again, absolutely no hate to my boy Vic whatsoever. And I'm not even trying to convince anyone that Gojo wins or Goku wins. It's just the fact that a lot of these Goku skills are severely outdated.",

Basically, um, as long as you can hurt the character, you scale to the character and your durability scale to their characters. You know, durability and attack codes. I'm fucking loving it. Because let's really keep it 100, right? Like. Like, let's. Let's really think about this for a minute, right? You got a character like Miles Morales, right? Miles Morales. Blackheart. Blackheart is the same character that is fought. Ghost rider is the son of a Festo and pretty much solo, the Avengers, Iron Man, Mrs. Marvel. You know, I'm saying Captain America, you know, Jane Foster, Thor, even fish and Miles Morelli beat Blackheart. He was able to hurt black heart using a power that's generated in his body. You know, just like Chakra was the Venom. The Venom strike. Venom blast is something he generates, right? And then miles was also able to hurt. No. Isn't that crazy? Like, I'm really loving what the Naruto fans have basically shown up, you know, I'm saying this. This AP scaling shit is amazing. I mean, with this we can pretty much get any base level character to uni, multi, etc. Hell, we can get characters to boundless like miles. We can pretty much get him to multi. Probably boundless because the Ghost Rider is considered boundless, and Blackheart is a villain for the Ghost Rider. He's also the Son of manifesto and miles beat, you know, Blackheart, even Captain America. We can probably get him to multi, knowing the fact that, again, Captain America has beaten Thor. You know, I'm saying. And with everything Black Panther has done, all that's a wash. But yeah, I'm really loving this new AP scaling. You know, I'm saying, as long as you can hurt the character, you scale to that character. Or at least, you know, if you're able to fight on part with that character, then you scale. I love this. I absolutely love the man. I love this shit. We gonna use this shit for everything. Matter of fact, I got one that you probably didn't even expect. Armor. When Catwoman beat Wally West, Barry Allen, and Kid Flash at the same time by herself while they were using their super speedy. I remember that. Bro, this AP shit is amazing. If she could beat Wally West, Barry Allen, and Kid flash by herself at the same time, then, bro, she solos the verse. Hell, it says she can hurt them using Newton's 3rd law. That means her AP equals her, you know, Durabel as crazy. I love this. I love this. Yeah, we finna use this shit for everything. I am not kidding. We're using this for everything. I love it. I'm telling y'all, we gonna scale Batman next. This shit is amazing. I love it. By the way, any power skill that tries to argue any of This shit? Yeah. You would just be dooming your entire fandom. Just letting you know, at this point, we're only following your rules. No, but you. You knew that, sweetie. No, you knew that.",

    "voice_to_text": "Can someone tell me why jobless reincarnation fans are still trying to gaslight us into believing this anime doesn't encourage Drake tendencies? You guys know what I mean by Drake tendencies. You know exactly what I mean by Drake tendencies. I made this comment saying jobless reincarnation would be perfect if it didn't do that, and this person tried gaslighting me and being like well, maybe it's a you problem. Maybe there's something wrong with you. No, this show actively encourages that type of behavior, and I have bona 5 proof of that. Remember how in episode one Rudy is got kicked out of his apartment for unexplained reasons? This gunner planted secret edging cameras in his underage niece's room and then was caught mocking to those videos he secretly recorded of his underage niece, which is why he was kicked out. Now here's an actual screenshot from the anime. As you can see, it's a camera clearly out of sight and it's recording someone that don't really look of age, do they? Now I know why they didn't include that in the anime. Because it would confirm everything we've been saying about the show. There are three bona five things in the show that proves it's encouraging Drake tendencies. Outside of the fact that half of the first season was just Rudy as being a sex offender, let's discuss the fact that Rudy is consistently lusted after and sexually assaulted all the underage girls in the show, especially Ares Who he slept with at the end of the season. I bet you he was imagining his niece. Even his mentor, who supposed to be 40 years old, looks like a child. Who he also sexually harasses. Or how about the 7,000 year old demon god who I can never show a full image of cause she spends the entire show dressed in half naked BDSM gear. Reason number two rudious is mentally an adult. The entire first season makes it painfully clear that this is an adult in a child's body. Throughout the entire first season they are highlighting how mature Rudy is is for his age. Cause he's actually an adult. It would maybe barely be one thing if Rudy is actually had the maturity of his age, but he doesn't. In fact, he scolds his dad because he's more mature than his own father. So they established that Rudy is consistently sexually harasses minors. The show also litters their characters with underage looking girls. On top of the fact that they established in the first season that Rudy is has the maturity and AIDS of a grown man. And number three Rudy is talks to the man god. This is how he sees himself. He doesn't see himself as a child, he still sees himself as this grown ass man edging to his niece. So yes, Rudy is Drake and the show encourages it. How is Rudy is rewarded for his blatant sexual harassment of this character? He gets to sleep with her. How does this show not encourage that",

    "voice_to_text": "Do you guys know why I love the Naruto and one piece fandoms? Is because you guys are one the same. You don't realize it. Two sides of the same coin. So now people are saying that Naruto and Luffy are the speed of light, or many times faster than the speed of light. Out to my mutuals. You know, I love y'all, but y'all be saying anything in this app, just know if you can go light speed, you can circle the globe seven times in one second. So that's the type of speed you guys are just casually throwing out. So on a Naruto side, people are saying that the first light speed feat is Haku in his crystal ice mirrors. And the reason why they're saying is because there's a databook out there that states that Haku is moving at the speed of light in this crystal ice mirrors technique. But do you guys know how impossible that is? So, yes, Naruto and his nine tail transformations able to catch Haku. But we don't have to go that far. I want to talk about when Sasuke was adapted to Haku Speed. This is right before he hits hand Sharingan. So, yes, he was trying to memorize Haku's movements. But Haku says something that's very interesting here. Baku says he's gradually gaining speed, beginning to catch up to his own technique. And this is before the Sharingan. This is the same Sasuke who has a better grabs of Sharingan that's getting whooped by Rock Lee. Are you guys really saying that carries like Rock Lee edgy tinted? All these people are light speed, bro. It takes them days to travel from village to village, bro. They. They really aren't light speed, man. And that's okay. I don't believe there's any light speed feats in the word of Naruto. But we have to stop using anything in part one. Like, you have to go to the very last battle Naruto to make any type of argument. And for the one piece community, please stop using Kuma as an example of light speed attacks. Just like with the Haku thing, it is definitely exaggeration. I want you guys to really just think about this. Like, go in your room and turn on the light. Like, just. Just turn on the light switch in your room, bro. Light is so fast it can engulf your entire room without you even seeing like, what happened. Like in this fight we never find a pacifist. The entire crew is able to perceive what was happening from when the pacifist is standing to where Luffy and Zorro and Sanji are. Light would be instant, but it took them a few seconds to get to him. And what I mean get to him. What I'm saying is it took a few seconds for the monster trio to get to the pacifist. I have to say this every time, but in no means am I saying That Naruto or Luffy or one piece in general and Naruto in general are slow. These characters are speedsters. But are they the speed of light? No, bro, that's. That's actually ridiculous.",

Mais en tout cas, garder en t\u00eate que \u00e7a, parce que le chapitre est long, qu'il est nul, c'est \u00e7a qu'il fallait, qu'il faut vraiment que vous arrivez \u00e0 comprendre. Pour le coup, je suis pas du tout d'accord car je pense pas qu'un auteur choisisse volontairement d'\u00eatre lent. Et d\u00e9j\u00e0, je pr\u00e9cise pour \u00e9viter tout amalgame, mais lent et poser, c'est pas du tout la m\u00eame chose. 1 \u0153uvre pos\u00e9e, 1 chapitre pos\u00e9 emp\u00eache pas du tout le d\u00e9veloppement de quoi que ce soit et on est ok. Quelque chose qu'on consid\u00e8re comme lent, c'est quand il y a pas du tout de d\u00e9veloppement, ou alors qu'il est et bah bah tr\u00e8s long pour le coup. Et bah \u00e7a c'est-ce qu'on reproche \u00e0 One Piece. Y a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de chapitres dans One Piece, et m\u00eame parmi les r\u00e9cents qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9s en beaucoup moins de pages, car le reste malheureusement, euh. \u00c7a raconte rien \u00e0 part du contexte qu'on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 et que Oda nous redonne en boucle. Le plus grand d\u00e9faut de Oda, avant m\u00eame le d\u00e9coupage, c'est la narration. Moi personnellement je trouve One Piece long et je pense pas \u00e7a. C'est 1 volont\u00e9 d'Auda, car pour moi l'an c'est 1 d\u00e9faut. Et je repr\u00e9cise, l'an est pos\u00e9, c'est pas du tout La m\u00eame chose pour exemple, friren c'est pos\u00e9, c'est pas du tout l'an, car pour reprendre ma d\u00e9finition, mais le d\u00e9veloppement d'un friren, il est l\u00e0, il est pr\u00e9sent, mais la narration, soit comment l'auteur le raconte, euh bah c'est fait de mani\u00e8re pos\u00e9e. Alors que One Piece, m\u00eame quand on est dans des moments d'action comme le chapitre mille-cent-treize o\u00f9 on est cens\u00e9 avoir 1 grosse r\u00e9v\u00e9lation, c'est l\u00e0.

    "voice_to_text": "Just because said robot charges up the light speed attack does not mean it's not light speed. And Zorro still clearly dodge the light speed attack. I'm not arguing semantics at all. I'm simply saying that I am not convinced at all that this is a light speed feat. Yes, the beam of energy is light, but again, he's charging up the energy blast. As I annotated right here, Zorro is looking at him charging up the energy blast. Zorro makes the oh shit face, then he goes from looking up to looking down, and he is moving to the right, as we can see in the change in position. So before the blast is even fired, he has already ducked his head, going from looking up to looking down, and has already started moving when the blast is fired, it just barely misses him because he had already ducked and moved before it was fired. So ducking out of the trajectory of the blast before it's fired is not a light speed feat to me. I am not convinced by this. Again, nothing here to me is a light speed feed, because not only does it take time for the Pacifista to charge up the blast, at least a couple of seconds, giving them ample time to move out of the trajectory of the blast, the Pacifista also has horrible aim here. Sanji did not dodge this because the blast wasn't even directed at him. Same here. The blast Is in between Sanji and Zorro, and here we see Luffy jumping before the blast is even in the frame. So nothing here is indicative to me of light speed. Because even just a couple of pages later, these characters who are so called light speed are all of a sudden not light speed anymore. The light speed Luffy can't even outrun sensemaru. So I maintain that none of the Straw Hats are light speed until after the time skip. So I maintain this is the first and only clear as day light speed feeds that we get from a straw hat character. But I will agree here that really intercepting kizaru here make some light speed. That just further proves my point that Rayleigh, who is a proficient hockey user and a character who is leagues above the Straw Hats, is the only one in this scene who is light speed because he's the only one fast enough to react to and keep up with Kizaru. So the idea of the Straw Hats have been light speed since, like Thriller Bark, I remain uncommenced.",

    "voice_to_text": "One thing that truly baffles me is how Christians become Christian nationalists. Like, they want a nation completely run by Christians with leaders, make decisions through their faith, but they don't think about the fact that Christians don't like each other. I grew up deep in the church, okay? Like, we got bust from school to church every Wednesday. We went every single Sunday. If there was a potluck, there we were. It was childcare, it was community, it was everything growing up. But when I was in middle school, we moved from a Methodist church, Missouri Senate Lutheran Church. Do you know how different those are? Totally different belief systems. Like, you think you want a Christian making all the rules until it's a Southern Baptist, and then you can't drink at your wedding. You're not gonna like that very much. You think you want a Christian in charge of the schools until it's a Pentecostal and suddenly the kids are speaking in tongue. You think you want a Lutheran in charge until it's one of the Liberal ones. They're not all Missouri Senate Methodists don't even get along with each other. Go look at the live streams of the most recent meetings. And now the Catholics are involved. When I was growing up, we were told that they weren't even a part of the same faith. And I had a Catholic tell me the same thing. You guys think you can get along well enough to run a Country, you're out of your fucking mind. You can't even sit politely at a dinner table, okay? Much less run a Congress.",

This is basically a social experiment. This is basically a social experiment, man. And dude, I'm not complaining. My entire reason for doing this, other than the fact that I was bored, is because I wanted to see if it was that easy to bait the Naruto community. And they bit into that bait like they were starving. I said in the video and in the comments that those pranks were specifically targeted at the people in the Naruto fandom. Go after people personally just because they said something about the anime that they didn't like? Everything I'm doing is completely satire, and I said that before I started doing this. So everybody getting angry and crying about it is just proving my point more. Which is exactly why I'm gonna keep doing it.",

    "voice_to_text": "Out of these four characters, who do you have winning? And if the character that popped in your mind wasn't gone, then you're wrong. But let me explain. If I give you a good enough argument, make sure to subscribe to the YouTube and follow me on Instagram. So first things first, gon would have an ability from the character named Prince. Camilla has a Nen beast that doesn't allow her to unalive. If she were to unalive, the Nen ability would activate, which is this black cat. And it would basically take the life of the attacker and revive the person that has it, making the user effectively immortal. On top of having an ability that makes him effectively immortal. They wouldn't be able to touch him because gon would receive the ability. Hide and seek. Only the user of this ability can enter an exit at free will. That means if any of the other three characters were to follow him into hide and seek, they would not be able to leave no matter what. Now, a lot of you might be saying in the comments, Deku's just gonna one tap him cause he's so fast. He's gonna speed blitz him. He's not even gonna have the chance to use hide and seek. But let me show you one more ability that's gonna ensure that he's able to use hide and seek. That would be the Nen ability. Perfect plan. Because as long as gon is holding his Breath he is completely undetectable in all senses. You can't smell, hear, see, not even detect his Nen or energy. God holds his breath and goes into hide and seek. They can't do anything to him. On top of being effectively immortal, having a pocket dimension that only he can access and he can use, he could just trap them all in hide and seek and just win the fight like that. Not to mention he would also have Nautica's ability, so he could just wish them all into hide and seek. There are so many hacks in Hunter Hunter that there's no way that gon doesn't win this fight. But if you have another character winning this fight, let me know down in the comments and obviously like and follow for more.",

    "voice_to_text": "You need to pick an anime character to fight alongside you in two 2V ones. Now what do I mean by this? I mean you have to pick someone to fight alongside you in purely hand to hands. So for someone says Goku because he could just punch the planet. No, no, no, no. All of his strength, his speed, everything is brought down to a human. Like the peak human level. Not saying level. So you can't just say, I'll pick this person cause he'll fight bust a hole through universe. No, no, no, no. It is just hands, martial arts, anything like that. You have to pick someone that will fight two battles. One with you against one person, then one with you against another person. I'm gonna give you the two villains now. Or, well, the two people you're going to fight now. And you have to pick someone to file with you against these people. Here's villain No. 1. First one, ghost of the Uchiha, Madara himself. He doesn't have his rinnegan, his sharingan, his any of his chakra based abilities. He doesn't have Susano, he doesn't have anything like that. It is purely hands against this man. So that's gonna be your first opponents in your two viewing. Your second opponent is gabimaru himself from Hell's Paradise. Those are your two opponents. So let me know who you would pick to fight alongside you against these people in 2 v 1 fights. If any of You try saying I'll take this person cause powers. No powers, no like nothing like that. We're not having any spiritual presence. We're not having any key, any chakra, anything like that. You are peek human level in both these fights. You have to try and fuck up these guys though.

    "voice_to_text": "Bro, just say the first light speed feat in one piece was in Egghead Island. Y'all are really bad at this so now I gotta disrespect you. This is the clip that you showed. In the clip that you showed, the pacifista charges up the beam. Luffy sees him charging up the beam, makes preparations, and then jumps before the beam fires. And then he lands after it connects with the ground. That is not a light speed feat. Amfu or frozo as it is. Now let's debunk your nonsense. And that was in the manga too bro. ND you are not beating the allegations you showed this the pacifista charging up the beam. Zoro is looking at the pacifista while he's charging up the beam. He literally sees him charging. The beam is making preparations and already started moving before it's fired. This is where it connects. That is not a light speed feat. This is a light speed feat. As you can see, Sanji is not in the frame. Kizaru charges up the beam, fires the beam. The beam has been fired. That is why there are speed lines here. And Sanji, after the beam has been fired, moves from out of the frame into the frame and kicks the beam away before it connects. So he went from outside of the frame into the frame and kick the beam away faster than an already fired beam could travel from Kizaru's hand to Bonnie. That is a light Speed feat. This is not so. Again, let's do a little thought experiment. If you point a pew pew at me. I see. You point the pew pew at me, and I duck out of the way while you pull the trigger and it just misses me. And a pew pew bullet travels 1,000 miles per hour. Does that mean that I can run at 1,000 miles per hour? Please answer that question. Now, let's do a different one. Let's try a different one. If you point a pew pew at someone, then you pull the trigger and the bullet is travelling through the air. And I run from where I am to the person who the bullet is travelling towards and push them out of the way. Which one is a faster than bullet speed feet. I promise it's not that hard.",

Little, everybody knows good and goddamn well that Goku was not as powerful as Frieza at that point, even with Kyle Kim. What's crazy is the fight that y'all wanna lean into with Goku and Khalifa is one that actually proves my point better than anything. Because we absolutely tells you the same shit that I'm saying. Reese explains very plainly. The reason why Kepler is getting fucked up is because she's not fighting smart. She's not using skill. But the minute she starts using skill, she starts putting hands on Goku again. He loses that fight. He loses the fight, and then he has to transform. When he transforms, eventually kale joins. He loses that fight. Eventually has to go Super Saiyan. God. He doesn't have enough skill to beat people who are stronger than him. Especially if they also have a little bit. A tiny bit of skill. He always loses. He has to transform. He has to be more powerful. He is a trash fighter.",

Yo, no joke, I did not expect Kaiju No. 8 to be this good. Like I heard about it for a long time that the manga was actually very good and people were very excited about the new anime that was coming out and you know, I have very high hopes. I thought that it was actually going to be entertaining, and then I started watching it in. The first couple episodes actually had me wanting more. The committed effect on top of the animation that is actually very good. The action that is happening, the storyline is actually very entertaining as well. So all of it caught me by surprise, but today's episode just was the tip of it for me. After that finished that episode I had to go and continue reading the manga cause I needed to know what happened that bad. Not only did I go and I continue reading the manga, I ended up reading like six chapters within 10 minutes because it was that good. Not gonna lie, I'm probably going to continue reading some more so I'm just letting y'all know right now. Expect to see some Kaiju No. 8 content from me just because I enjoyed it that much, but I love to find out for you guys. Are you also Enjoying Kaiju No. 8 as much as I am? Or is this falling off for you",

It didn't even matter cause Madara was just using the meteors as a distraction. He could activate the Infinite Tsukuyomi and I see this chakra cannon and with like 100 people it could destroy the moon. Naruto has more chakra than 100 people. But I got news for you, he's not a fucking chakra cannon. He cannot do this shit. He has no way to compress these massive amounts of chakra into a beam and then fire it. He just gathers it and then throws it. Even if he could, there's no way for him to withstand compressing all of his chakra into one beam. Again, he's not a cannon.

The easiest case to explain why Yamamoto is star level is Yamamoto's punk eye is. Punk eye reaches the temperature and level of the sun. His whole body is the embodiment of the. The sun. As we all know, just because your body reaches a certain temperature doesn't inherently make you star or star level. It says ace creative star. So that would make a star level. Isn't that like a hyperbole? Like, what proof does it show that young motor is actually star level? Here we see the after effects of young motor releasing his bankai. The after effects that shows why he. Is there some ability to his truth in saying, yes, I have the power of the sun? He evacuates all the moisture inside the Soul Society. And you know how the comments that if you keep it out this long, you will destroy the solar system, which. So society is at least planetary. So at bare minimum, you got your motor planetary. Hold the fuck on. Let me put my cookie down. This is a planet. This is a continent. It's a floating fucking continent. This is a planet. This is a continent. He evaporated all the moisture in the atmosphere. Oh, I guess Yamamoto doesn't scale to ace from one piece. Who arguably performed a greater feat in Base just by showing up to this island, an island that snows all year round, and on that day didn't snow. Snow is moisture. Water isn't wet. But ace outskills Yamamoto for sure. Yamamoto also stated that he kept his bunk eye out. Any longer, that he would destroy himself and the entirety of the Soul Society. Interesting. Very interesting. He would destroy himself. Well, that ends it right there. He doesn't scale to star. He doesn't scale to his ability. He doesn't scale to his bankai because it fucking kills him.",

What kind of stupid shit was that? You literally stitched my video. When did Goku is not a master martial artist come out of my fucking mouth? He's not that good at fighting. That's like. That's like his whole stick is that he likes fight. You and people like you are the only ones worried about Goku Stick. I don't give a fuck if he likes fighting. Is he good at it or not? Does he win fights or does he lose them? Some martial artist and he trains and meditates. Like what the fuck you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about? I don't give a fuck if he's training and meditating. Does he win fucking fights? That's the. That's. That's all there is to it. Fuck some meditation. He trained under Grandpa Gohan. Fuck Grandpa Gohan. He trained under Master Roshi. Fuck Master Roshi. And he also trained under King Kai. Fuck King Kai. Also trained under Beerus and learn like some sort of alien martial arts along with weed. Fuck Beerus and Fuck Wiese. What the fuck do I care about them? Ultra Instinct is a martial art in itself. Is a technique, not a form. Why the fuck are y'all like this? Read the fucking manga. Dragon Ball Super Manga Chapter 71 when Wiese asks Goku what the difference is between Goku and the angels, Goku says some stupid shit because he's a fucking moron. But we just clarifies that the angels are always in the Ultra Instinct state, and Goku says that he has to transform first to use it. Wees further clarifies that it is possible to learn how to use the Ultra Instinct in his normal form, but Goku isn't good enough to do that. Even in the second most current Dragon Ball Super chapter, to use Ultra Instinct easily, he still needs to transform, so what the fuck are you talking about? So you have to be a very skilled martial artist to even use Ultra Instinct, the caliber of which Goku is not, because when he tried to use Ultra Instinct without transform, he was beaten. Which is why he told Vegeta that he could still whip out Ultra Instinct at full power, which he did so here. Which granola acknowledges as a form, and Goku explains that it's one that he can't hold for very long. You clearly do not know what you're talking about, so do not speak, do not stitch my videos, or engage with me. It is ridiculous and a waste of both of our time.",

Nickelodeon! And before anybody says, well, what proof do you have that he was as big as a planet? Like, what proof do you have? King line. It said it. It said it turns him planet size! You. You mean to tell me this child, this little baby, on his first time ever being on TV, because his first time being on cinema was a movie? So you mean to tell me it took one movie to solo your verse? You've been written since I was a kid! It took one VHS. That's not even a DVD, that's VHS! You mean to tell me Jimmy Neutron, Nickelodeon, Jimmy Neutron is stronger than you, you trash! If I wanted to say Jimmy Neutron would become the size of a planet and kill Naruto, you couldn't argue it, because Naruto has not shown any attack that would kill or threaten a planet. But Jimmy Neutron's breath, his lungs. His lungs scale higher than you! You're trash! You got all these chapters! It took him one fucking movie? Like, because Jimmy Neutron can become the size of a planet, he can grab the moon and throw that bitch at Earth, he can. He can grab. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. He could grab other planet. No, no, fuck other planets. He could just grab the moon and increase its size. You're. You're cooked. You're. Y'all got soloed by Nickelodeon! Nickelodeon!

Imagine if we did that and held these companies to a higher standard across the board all the way across this country. We have a lot more power than we think we do. We just changed one whole store in three hours. Now grab your phones and start grabbing this stuff no matter where we are, because here's the thing. These corporations, they just see us as dollar signs. But if we don't hold them to a higher standard, they can get away with this crap. I go to this Lowe's all the time, and they stopped giving out any bags. No paper bags, no plastic bags, no nothing. And that was like, my first annoyance, because I go up there with a big cart full of stuff and no way to carry it to my car. They play that game of like, somehow they're getting an eco friendly and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, it's just saving money, and that's all they care about. So anyway, keep it going. Keep it going. Let's make some changes. Let's call these companies out.",

Like, even, even, even, bro, right here it was. This is your account. You. You were saying it only last for five minutes? You. Do you think the fight with Kaido lasted five minutes? Is that what you think? Cause see, this is what I don't understand at this point when it comes to Gear 5. You don't even have to read the manga to know that that isn't true. Like, if you have Netflix, you can watch 1099 all the way to 11:01 and you would know that that's not true. So this is what's crazy to me. You guys are willing to lie to try to get a win. My bro said you can literally just go watch or read the manga. I'm telling you, you don't even have to read the manga to know that that isn't true. Like if you got Netflix, not only can you watch the episodes when he goes Gear 5 most recent, but after he pretty much demolishes old boy. This is what I don't understand. Even after this fight, even after he puts hands on him, right? Right? Even. Even. Even after he does all of this, Luffy is literally still in Gear 5 with no issue. No problems, no nothing. Looking around, chilling out, You know, say he's good. He's good. So with that, I just wanna know, why would you lie? Really answer the question. Why would you lie? Like I. From both of you. I want both of you to explain to me why would you lie? But for everybody else, gear 5 runs the gauntlet. How far does he go? And don't forget, Naruto no longer has a 9 tail. So his healing factor in super strength is pretty much gone. And his extra chakra reserves are also gone, besides the chakra he already has through genetic. But yeah. Who do you guys think wins?",

People say bunch of out of pocket stuff like random shit all the time. And the things I heard from Draco sounds mild to the things I've heard on discord. It's just how they operate on discord. In my opinion, Draco should just apologize and take accountability for the things they have said and just move on from the past. And I'mma start making content again.

    "voice_to_text": "Ah, so I see I finally have to have the conversation with people now. Naruto community, I want you to listen to me very closely. Let the chakra flow up to your ears so you hear what I'm about to say. There is not a single feet from the beginning of Naruto Boruto to show that Naruto is planetary. Majority of the people that like to argue that Naruto is planetary try to use statements from the data books as if they're accurate. Like, let's be for real here, the data books said the 10 ten could create a universe. They're not reliable. And then you have the people that try to argue that stage of six paths is planetary when it's not even remotely close to that. Then there's the people who say Kurama could destroy the earth when he couldn't even destroy the leaf village. And don't even get me started on baryon mode. In the entire time I've done content creation on here, there hasn't been a single person that could prove Naruto was planetary. The entire time, no one has done it accurately. There's like thousands of scalers who come up with scales that make absolutely no sense because they're trying to be pseudo death battle to get views. Y'all not realize how bad it looks for y'all? The king lion called all of you out, and none of you have proved him wrong. All these random debaters in the Naruto community, please just, like, stop And actually think about what they're saying, cause they're making everybody else in the community look bad. And can y'all stop using Naruto hitting the moon as a planetary feat? It's not a planetary feet. It's barely a moon feet cause the moon was hollow. Unless any of y'all can definitively prove Naruto's planetary, stop saying he's planetary.",

    "voice_to_text": "Which one of these two characters do you think the internet has a problem with? I just want you to take a wild ass guess. The new Assassin's Creed game called Assassin's Creed Shadows is about to come out. And on paper it's giving us exactly what fans have been wanting for after shanking people all over the Nile Delta, becoming a Greek goddess, girly pop, and a literal Viking, we are going straight to Japan. It's supposed to be taking us to the glory days of the original Assassin's Creed mechanics. That's why you get two playable characters. One a Shinobi and the second one a Samudai. These are some of the descriptions that they already gave us. The Ninja Assassin can use Kunai Shurikans and basically use distractions to get everything done. Or you can play as a samurai, full on ghost of Tsushima style. Katana, bows, arrows, and all of that crazy shit. So you wanna guess where the problem lies? Is that they're giving you the chance to play as Yasuke. As in the Yasuke. I don't even need to tell you what people are complaining about in this picture, because you already know. Oh no, they're giving us a black samurai! My childhood is ruined! Let's cut the bullshit, shall we? This is Yasuke, a real life person. The first and only black samurai who was alive during the Sengoku period. Google hair. They're giving you the opportunity to play as the baddest man on the Planet to ever wield a katana and you're complaining? The crazy thing is that they can't even say that it's forced because you can choose to not play as. I mean, just take up, you know, the original Assassin's Creed style. Just shanking people with the hidden blade. That's all good. I just find it funny that the internet is hating on historical accuracy because this already happened. He was turning people into sashimi just as hard as she was. Honestly, the only thing that I'm mad at is the fact that they're locking a mission behind the preorder wall, which is, you know, not great. But i'mma give you the same piece of advice me abuela once gave me. Unless they deserve it. If you have nothing good to say, don't say it at all, homie.",

    "voice_to_text": "I would never hate on another creator. And a big part of that is because obviously I understand the struggle of it, all of the barriers, rather. That's financially in your life, in the creative process. It's very difficult. And the honest truth is I see no benefit in hating on another creator. It doesn't hurt me to show love to somebody else. There was a bit of a negative comment, not this one, obviously, but on the same post, trying to kind of put a wedge between me and another creator. And I had to publicly say I support this person and I would never go against them. One thing about TikTok is TikTok can be a very toxic place, especially in the comic and anime space. But because that video was so positive, the positive side and the great side of TikTok showed up and showed out to show love. Just like this comment. What I've Learned is the positive people usually don't speak. Not for a bad reason. People just have their own lives, their own things going on. They'll give you a follow, they'll give you a like, but they don't always stay in chat. It's usually toxic. Toxic more people that wanna have arguments and stay in your comments and harass you. And all the positivity on this post kind of reminded me to remain grateful, remain humble. You know, I'm doing something that I would do for free. Fortunately, I don't have to do It for free anymore and that's a blessing before the people who have always been following me, always been supporting. Maybe it was your first time speaking on this post. Thank you for speaking up because I needed that reminder for those who've been supporting me or just started supporting me based off that post. I do wanna use this as an opportunity to let you know we do have a lot more content and a great place where you can dive into our universe and I encourage you to go do that. And right now we are doing a massive push on YouTube. We are almost at 20,000 subscribers. So go over to YouTube, search Impound Comics or click the link in my bio and make sure you hit that subscribe button to get us to 20 k. Also we have a mini anime on our page, audiobooks, a podcast and much much more stuff that you'll never see on TikTok. But again, thank you for the support from everyone in that post. And make sure you go over to our YouTube and hit that subscribe button.",

This comment is in response to himori being revealed to be a jinchuriki of kurama, possibly better than that of her father, as Kurama revealed that her chakra has more affinity with his than even Naruto's. But because girl woke. How the fuck is this appealing to the woke demographic? Oh yeah, anime fans historically woke. Kishimoto was well known for possibly putting pen to paper and creating some of the worst female characters known in all of anime and manga. You wanna know the real reason that Himawari ended up with Kurama? Boruto was originally supposed to have Kurama. This is the first graphic we ever got from Kishimoto as it pertains to Boruto as a story. But then Kishimoto realized, oh, I don't just wanna make Boruto a hollow copy of his father, so we took the byakugan and Kurama from Boruto and gave it to Himawari. This is why Naruto is the only person in Boruto with two children. Is your argument here that he should have had two sons? Himawari is the third generation of Kurama Jinchuriki in her direct bloodline. How is it crazy that she's the best one yet? I don't see you making us think about the fact that Boruto, over the course of three years of training, managed to figure out a Rasengan that was stronger than anything Naruto ever created.

They combined their most powerful forms just to damage him. They could not really hurt him or kill him. Best they could hope for was to disrupt his control over all the tailed beasts. So instead of taking this Chidori Rasengan combo like a man, he runs away. That's my point. They're jumping him. If it was a one on one, both of them are losing. Neither of them are as strong as the ten tails jinchuriki at any point in the story. Went up to Boruto. Neither Sasuke nor Naruto has the power that these motherfuckers had access to. Ten tails itself is the only one that could possibly have enough chakra to maybe destroy the planet. The jinchuriki of that thing are the only ones that have ever had access to that big a pool of chakra. Because of the truth seeking orbs and other six path abilities they're granted. They don't just use the chakra to blow shit up again. At no point have Naruto or Sasuke been stronger than the 10 tails. Not here, not back then, not never.",

This is probably one of the worst things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. And this is gonna be a big issue. So if you don't know, the newest Assassin's Creed was released. Well, the trailer was released, and then they were basically saying that it's set in Japan, and then instead of a Japanese protagonist, a Japanese main character, we have a black samurai as the main character now. Cool. I have. I have no issue with that. If you wanna do a black thing, that's fine, whatever. They could have done that as a DLC though, as a extra content, as anything else. But making that the main character of the series, of the. The game is a bad thing. This is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen done in gaming, ever. First of all, it's gonna cause division. There's obviously gonna be people who don't like it because the guy is black or whatever. Cool, whatever. But making him a central character in the first Japanese game is one of the worst decisions ever, and it's gonna backfire badly once again. For those of you who don't understand, the main issue is the fact that he's. That he's a black guy in ancient Japan. That doesn't really make much sense in terms of, like, um, I. I know the story of the Samurai, I know that some people say it's true and all that, but you should have chose. They should have chosen a Japanese guy. Bro, imagine a game set in Africa and the main character's a white guy. It wouldn't work.",

In the scene of Utah packing up Kenjaku, the S effects that was made is the same S effects that is used when Toto switches with his new boogie woogie. Not only that, the narrator directly confirms that Todo helped UTA after fine tuning his technique with Okatsu's help at the late Gosho Colony, Todo proceeded to successfully retrieve his allies who were trapped within malevolent shrine Lake. Gosho Colony aka the colony that Kenjaku was in when he was snuck by UTA. So it is confirmed UTA Akatsu did not speed Blitzkenjaku. Todo switched him. I used to pray for times like this. I stood here, I told you guys Kenjaku wasn't speed blissed. I was called a madman, a Copa. I was put on fraud watch. The UTA agenda is truly dead. He didn't speed Blitz Kenjaku. He was jumping five finger Sukuna in a 3 v 1 inside of his own domain. And it wasn't even a world dismantle that took out this fucking bomb! It was a strong dismantle! Utah stocks have lost all their value. You should have sold them already! All I now need is Kenjaku to return through the merger and Kenjaku stocks to the moon! So unfortunately, I'm gonna need you guys to sign the form. Utah hater apology form. Which one of these were the reason for your behavior? Tell Me. And I need you to take this box and hereby respect all Utah haters. And you will not talk down to us ever again.",

    "voice_to_text": "So this lady right here, Giza Kim, was recently introduced in Lichism Chapter 5:02, and a lot of people are theorizing on who she could be. So from what we know, she's a part of Jin Yong's faction back during his time in the Gabriel Gang. And it looks like she's the current leader of that faction while they're in Chan Yong. And my theory is that she is somehow related to Gabriel and Kim. The reason I say that is because her last name is Kim. And now, you might be saying Kim is a very common Korean last name, like Lee, but look at her first name. Also, look at the context, right? Gabriel has a son named Guite, and now we have her, gija. Oh, they have similar names. That doesn't mean they're related. It's just a coincidence. And I would have said the same thing, too, but that's not the only similarity. Not only do they have similar names, but she's affiliated to Gabrielle through Angie Young Park, two members of his gang, and and Jerry's dad, Big Hoe. Somebody pointed this out last video that she might be the reporter Kim that Jeong was talking about to Jerry, and that she's the one that's a fan of his dad and recorded all of his fights. Not only is she bad, but she also has a strong relationship with both Big Hoe and Jin Young, who are both top members in Gabriel's gang. Now, I don't Know exactly how her and Gabriel are related, but it's most likely Gabriel sister. I don't think PTJ is gonna say that's his daughter, because he already did the secret child storyline with GT, and if he did it again, it'll be a little bit cliche and repetitive. So it's most likely his sister. About 10 to 15 years younger than him, which explains why she spotted a zero generation. And she may have rode around in his crew during his days as the gang leader. Gabriel. And then maybe she eventually fell in love with Jean Young Park, which explains why she's a part of his faction. Or maybe had a love interest. And Big Hill Quan, Jerry's dad. But yeah, I was completely right about Jin Young being Daniel's uncle. I called it, like, a long time ago, but that I said five months ago in my video, because that was only proof I had that I said it. So I was right about that theory, and I'm positive that I'm gonna be right about her again. And also my chante Jin is vengeance half brother theory. So, yeah, let me know down in the comments what you guys think about my theory. Let me know if there's any holes. I could still work on it, but, you know, this is what I'm putting out for now. If you guys wanna see my chapter reactions for lookism, go ahead and click the link in my bio. It'll take You to my YouTube channel where I have all my reaction videos. The newest one is Chapter 5:02, so go ahead and check it out. Thanks for watching. Leave a like and subscribe.",

We all got it though and played for a couple of weeks. That shit's a rap now. I'm the last soldier standing. I'm over here seeing this in my dreams and they're playing Fortnite and shit. There's no reason for me to still be playing GTA Online. I have everything in the game you could possibly get bro. Apartments, businesses, bunkers, cars, planes, a yacht, a submarine. I even got the hanger at the military base. Cause I'm like that. All I can do is get on the game and do the same shit I've been doing for years. But if my friends got on this game, I'd still play it every day. I'm not gonna lie, GTA with friends are still funny as hell and I'm trying to flex all the shit I bought low key. I know I've given this game a lot of hate on this page, but for real, if all my friends were consistently playing this game, I would block them all on everything the. You know, I got to keep y'all on your toes. I'm not playing this shit. What y'all know about Brawlhalla? I wish we could all play this, but my friends are some cowards. If I get into a fighting game though, I get stupid Competitive? You beat me one time and talk enough shit to piss me off. I'm in the lab, bro. I'm looking up YouTube tutorials, everything. You'll ruin the day. You beat me in a fighting game type shit. I got a friend that won't play Fortnite but plays call of duty every day. To each their own, I guess. What about your guys's friends",

The urge to grind video games is back. Like, I could complete the entire Fontaine quest right now, and it's all thanks to my Pookie.",

These power scaling discord rules are all predicated on fake science. None of it makes sense, none of it is logical. The vast majority of it contradicts what the author is even trying to communicate in the story in the first place. And most of the people using it don't even know what they're talking about. Newton's laws are laws of motion. The force applied to set something into motion is also applied equally to the thing setting into motion. What it doesn't mean is that if you can do something, you can withstand it. So you're trying to tell me that if a baseball player can throw a stone at full force, let's say 90 miles per hour, you're trying to suggest that the same baseball player can take a stone being hurled at his face at 90 miles per hour and not die? What are you talking about? Feats, statements, narrative implication, and how strong characters are relative to other characters. That is it. Everything else is nonsense, fake science.",

Because of Newton's Third Law, which is for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction with this means is that whenever Narcissus, able to match Kaguya, simply injured Kaguya fatally, Narcio was exerted the same amount of force that Kaguya is. And how much force is she able to exert? Will Kaguya is able to make dimensions with what she's capable of has nothing to do with him chopping off her arm or damaging her. Let me explain. Newton's third law has nothing to do with this at all. You shoot a gun, it recoils. You push off the ground. When you run, it's like the grounds pushing off you. But this doesn't have any further implications for the subjects in question. I'll be an example. Imagine I'm Naruto and my car is Kaguya. I can damage my car. I can punch and break the window right now. That doesn't make me as strong as this car going full speed and crashing into somebody like you. See the leap in logic? What Kaguya is able to do is completely irrelevant to Naruto being able to damage her. It's not like they're Dragon Ball Z characters that are surrounded in energy Shields. Like these dudes are swimming in lava. Just name dropping Sir Isaac Newton isn't enough to make this shit make sense. Everybody already admitted he doesn't have the destructive capacity to blow up a planet. So let's stop adding on to the laws of Physics to try and make Naruto something he's not. What y'all are saying is for every action between two objects, there is an immediate equalization of power potential. Y'all just making that shit up. This has nothing to do with Newton's third Law of equivocal force. Basically, just receive whatever you're giving out. Like, if I punch you, I can knock you out and break your jaw, but I can also break my hand. The force is coming both way. He being able to exchange equivocal force with your jaw doesn't even make me as strong as you are. If Naruto can damage her and she can destroy planets, all of a sudden he can destroy planets. Like, no, that's not logic.",

This is like all or nothing at this point in the manga. I guess that's that he believes that Jujutsu Kaisen will not go on past 2,024. So like, this is basically confirmed. I'm also pretty mad at gay gay right now because of the most recent chapter. He's just. He's so disrespectful. And if, you know, you know, I just. I don't know what to do without these manga and these shows. They're just been around for so long, and I love them both, and I'm just gonna really be sad to see them gone. I also suspect that berserk will be ending like pretty soon. Like probably by the end of the year. I'm glad we have a few more years before we have to worry about that for one piece, cause I'm gonna be devastated when that ends. I. I can't even imagine. Which series are you most sad to see go?

    "voice_to_text": "I hate to say you guys, but it might not be Gojo now. I had this thought after the hype had died down from the stream, but there were multiple reasons to why this could not be Gojo. And for the record, I hope it is, but I have to be unbiased here. For one, because of where the students are currently, it wouldn't make much sense. One of the entire premises of Gojo coming back prior was the fact that the students weren't going to defeat Sukina, so Gojo would need to come back for someone to stand a chance. With Yuji not only landing another Black Flash directly to Sukina's heart, but with Todo being around and discombobulating him with Boogie woogie, things are looking really good for the heroes right now, so it seems like really weird timing that the heroes are winning and that's when Gojo comes back. Reason 2 it was purposely ambiguous. If Akutami wanted us to know that Gojo would come back, I don't feel like he would be as ambiguous as he was. Ending it on a cliffhanger allows Akutami the option to not have Gojo come back and this actually be a fake up for something else. And as we know right? When someone's about to lose, they have visions all of the time. And Gojo was the strongest opponent Sukan ever faced. I can see people arguing the fact that they weren't in a good spot because Sukan was About to open up his domain expansion. But remember, they can't resist his domain for a small time because both Toto and Yuji have a simple domain. Not only that, but if the Fire Arrow were to come out again, because Toto can swap things so fast with his new instrument, he could easily swap Yuji and Toto out with the crows again to keep them safe from Tsukana's domain expansion, basically making it Nolan void. So again, in a lot of ways, Yuji and the heroes are in a good spot right now. And again I state I want Gojo to come back, but one, I have to always stay unbiased, and two, there's a lot of evidence pointing to the fact that it could not be Gojo. Now in the same vein, I'm going to make videos to all the reasons why I think it could be Gojo, but let me know what you guys think!",

This is like the, what, the fourth or fifth time that y'all have said go just coming back? Oh my god. Go just coming back! Only to double back later to be like, oh no, it was a mistranslation.

He also faced fire for quoting Taylor Swift in the same speech, as he plays for the same team as Travis Kelce, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend.

Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. I'm on the stage today unable to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school.

Story time about when I was in high school and I ended up befriending this kid who had no friends, and he ended up kind of ruining my life. I went to a pretty small high school, and like, it was kind of a weird school, but, like, there was this one kid who had absolutely no friends, and I had a few class with him. We didn't interact till like junior year, when we got seated assigned next to each other in class and we started talking and I was like, oh my god, this kid is actually interesting, actually liked him, whatever. We became friends in class, and then one day I invited him to sit with my group at lunch. And my group of friends were like the cool kids at this weird ass fucking school. And everyone was like, oh, what the fuck, why are you inviting. Let's call him Jason. Why are you inviting Jason to sit at our table? And I was like, just get to know him. Like, he's actually really cool. And they did get to know him, and everyone actually really ended up liking him. And he integrated as hell into my friend group. All the guys were friends with him. I was super happy. I was like, this is great. At first, then a couple months, and he ended up being a complete fucking dick to me. Started bullying me, making these jokes to me that were just like, over the line, just, like, really mean shit. And I would like, call him out on it. He just continued to do it, including making a song about me that, like, Loki went viral and like, are, like, the entire school knew about it. And he played it in music class. And he was like, calling me a hoe and was like, about how he wanted to get with me or something. And like, a teacher came up to me and he was. She was like, you know, like that song, Jason me like, you could have him suspended for that. Like, do you want that? And at the time, you know, I was still trying to, like, we all be friends. I was like, no, no, no. But I slowly distance myself from him. But I couldn't stop him from, like, being in these social gatherings because he was friends now with all of my friends. Everyone liked him. Fast forward to that summer. He asked me to play tennis, cause we both play tennis. And I only said yes because I did wanna like, hit, like, not be off my game. And then afterwards, I was just gonna go home. He basically, like, begged me to come over to his house and, like, hang out. And I did, for A little bit. And then I left and he was super upset about it. And at when I was at his house. This is an important detail. I logged into my IG once on my own phone and I had to type in the password.",

Gojo is not back. Sukuna is just hallucinated. Y'all need to stop with this. You want Gojo to come back so hard you're refusing to see the facts! I am not going back on my word. Gojo is not coming back. This is not him coming back! Are we seriously just gonna start taking Akutami a face value and just saying that this panel means that Gojo is back? Have we forgotten about this panel? Did we forget about this panel right here? And what happened exactly afterwards? I cannot believe that you guys are actually taking that panel and thinking to yourself, oh, my god, he's actually back! There is no way that he's back at all! I was wrong with Kuroma. I am not going to back down with Gojo. This is not Gojo coming back. They're playing some mind tricks with sukuna. Or he is hallucinating because Yuji really is messing him up. But Gojo is not back!

    "voice_to_text": "He might actually be back. Like, I cannot believe that I'm saying this. Gojo might actually be back. Let's go over the chapter. It was insane. The time begins with Toto revealing that his missing left arm is replaced with an instrument called the Viper Slap. I'm probably saying that wrong. The narrative explains that Toto has changed Boogie Woogie's activation from clapping his hands to the collision of the metal piece and the wooden box. Using this, total can now swap people 50 times per second. What? And then the battle commences. Total uses boogie woogie, and he switches places right behind sukuna. Did you guys expect anything else? This is a fight with Boogie woogie! Sukuna, you're getting jumped! Total has imposed a binding vow to limit the number of swaps and proportion to the collisions of the Viper slot. Toto has successfully expanded the curse techniques target to multiple targets and expanded the effective range of his curse technique. The narrator also reveals that Toto successfully evacuated the sorcerer from Sukuna's domain. Let's go! Everybody safe! Sukuna says that out of all the sorcerers, Toto is the most self centered and difficult to sway. He honestly appeared at the timing that I least wanted him to show up. He was trying to break Yuji, but you can't do that. Toto then goes to strike sukuna, but sukuna is easily able to dodge it. He's still sukuna. Todo is reminding us again that tsukina can just jump off Of the air, bro is like Maki for real. Yuji then grabs a gigantic rock and then hurls it towards Tsukina. Toto then obviously changes Yuji's place with the rock, and then Yuji goes to land an attack on tsukina. However, sukuna sees is coming. They both collide with each other, and sukuna grabs Yuji by the face and then just starts tossing him. Toto senses that this is the case, and he switches Yuji's place again. I'm not sure with what, though. Sukuna says that Todo and Yuji are now like in a roulette. Sukuna realizes Todo can change the maximum minimum values for the number of swats per single tap. Sukuna thinks it's practically impossible to get used to boogie woogie since Todo can switch so many times in one second. Yuji then lands a punch, or kind of. He pushes sukuna back into a pillar and sukuna goes flying through it. As this is happening, sukuna goes to clash with Yuji, but before that happens, sukuna notices there's a crow right beside him. And of course, boogie woogie, baby! Todo switches places with Yuji and the Crow, so sukuna ends up hitting the crow, and Yuji lands another black flash right to Sukuna's chest. Yuji, using his claws, begins to gash at sukuna, and he starts to try to, I guess, pull out his heart or something along those lines. Sukuna goes to expand his domain expansion, but he looks to the side and he sees a Ghost. The ghost of the strongest Sorcerer is now before him. The editor's note is those eyes are unmistakable. There's a couple of conclusions that we can draw here, but I'll save that for my next video. This chapter was insane.",

    "voice_to_text": "But that doesn't really make any sense. Just cause you have the power or chakra to destroy a planet doesn't mean you have the durability of one. That is actually wrong. If you have planetary AP, you automatically have planetary durability. Reason for this is Newton's third law for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So in Kagia's case for example, the amount of force she puts out to create a planet is also the same amount of force she can take in due to that third law. Meaning that if she has enough force to be able to create or destroy a planet, she also has enough force to tank an attack of that same caliber. Now he goes on to say that there are plenty of anime characters whose durability does not scale to their attacks. However, a character's AP is always going to scale to the character's durability unless proven otherwise. Example is Deku. His attacks in Season 1 and season 2 were way stronger than his durability was. That's why he was getting hurt by his own attacks. So unless it's a case like that, Kaguya's AP is going to scale up to her durability because that's just how it works. Now another example he brings up, which I knew was gonna come sooner or later, was this example of Himawari knocking Naruto out. Asked does Himawari doing this mean she scale up to Naruto? And the answer is no for multiple reasons. First off, Himawari uses gentle fist, and gentle fist ignores all durability. It operates in a very similar fashion to Ryo from one piece, which also just completely ignores any and all durability. Second, Naruto is completely off guard here. Now he brings this up and then says it's still a speed blitz. But that doesn't make any sense. If Naruto is off guard, then this doesn't even count as a feat for Himawari. So 1. Himawari does not scale to Naruto because Gentle Fist ignores all durability in the question, and 2. She did not speed blitz Naruto because Naruto was not even expecting this to come out of Himawari. So is Naruto still planetary star level whatever? Yes he is.",

The Avatar creators have said in the past that if they continued the series beyond book three, they would wanna give Azula her own redemption arc. Apparently, that's the trajectory that the comic books have been taking. I haven't read them, so I don't really know how well this is being handled. And apparently Kavira was redeemed in the comics as well, although nobody really liked how it was handled. Personally, I love a good redemption arc, I don't think we need to see every single antagonist go through one, especially when it comes to Avatar the last Airbender. Or any redemption arc is gonna inherently be compared to Zuko's. Azula is already incredibly sympathetic and a super complex character. I think seeing her turn into a quote unquote good guy would just feel forced. apparently in the comic, there's this dream sequence that Azula has, and once again, I haven't read the comics. I take this with a grain of salt. In it, there's his dream sequence where Zuko doesn't have his scar. And people interpret that as, like, how Azula sees Zuko. Like, she doesn't see him as being disfigured. And I'm like, that's kind of lame. I kind of like the idea that Azula loves that Zuko has that scar as, like, a visual representation that she is more loved than he is. Like, if she Experiences a redemption arc that's anything other than five years of intense therapy. It's gonna feel cheesy, and it's gonna feel unrealistic to me.",

And a reason I'm asking this question is because it's like a common thing for people to be like, oh, I don't really like this anime over this anime because it doesn't have stakes. I think that argument goes more than splitting hairs. I think it's actually just ridiculous because every anime that has a problem has stakes. Start here, for instance with the sale games. Oh, the Dragon Balls are there, they don't have stakes, unfortunately. Sales plan was to destroy the earth after everyone was killed, meaning that it wouldn't matter because either will be no Dragon Balls. And if there were Dragon Balls, there be nobody to use. Is a common argument made for my Hero Academia. People say that there's no stakes in my hero are fighting a war for the world right now, right? This isn't just Japan, you feel me? Now that the entire world is involved. United States number one hero got killed trying to stop this person in Japan. If all for one wins, he's gonna plunge the world into nothingness. But even then, stakes don't have to be that dire, bro. Like you could be playing a game of rock, paper, Scissors with your homie and the stakes are if you don't beat him, you're gonna lose. Losing is a stake. You sports gamble on your favorite basketball team. One of the stakes was on The line money.

    "voice_to_text": "Alright, TikTok, name an anime MC who is goaded but nobody really talks about or you don't hear nobody talking about. I'll go for me. Yes, it is Yuji from Yu Gi Oh. Listen, Yu Gi Oh as a kid growing up was the anime, it was the show, that theme song, like it was everything. Anybody who is everybody who loves anime who watched Yu Gi Oh had Yu Gi Oh cards like. And you were playing Yu Gi Oh with your friends? We were dueling every day and it was a serious matter. It was serious as hell. I have friends who to this day still duel with Yu Gi Oh. Iconic phrase like, I'll send you to the Dark Realm, dark musician. And I in my turn like come on! Like what? Blue eyes, White Dragon. This anime and this MC here, Yuji is so underrated. He's so iconic, but nobody talks about him, nobody gives a praise. And it could be that it is an older anime. Absolutely. This was out when I was a kid, but still, I think what Yu Gi Oh has done for the anime community, what Yu Gi Oh has done for him as an MC is profound enough to be spoken about, so I'm speaking about it. But there could be other MCs that are not giving this this amount of love. And I wanna know TikTok, who is an anime MC from any anime that you believe was very Prominent and should get more love, more appreciation. But doesn't. Let's talk about it.",

The first episode was really good. Like it gave us a little bit of everything. It started out with the battle between the wind Hashira, Snake Hashira, and a bunch of fighter demons. Then we got a lot of interesting plot development. The Hashira found out about the Infinity Castle, the news of Nezuko being a day walker spread and sending shockwave through the community, and now our favorite characters get to train with all the Hashira. Like I know the Hashira training arc is kind of like upper middle of the pack as far as the other arcs go, but I think it's anime adaptions gonna be really good based on what we saw in the first episode. Not to mention the episode was like 50 damn minutes. I really can't believe it's starting to feel like demon slayers and underdog anime. Like I swear a few years ago when the new season will come out the world will stop. Now it's just like okay, demon slayers back. Since anime fans are so fickle, I have a feeling that it will get back to that by the next art. This must be what Kanye meant when he said they love you, then they hate you, then they love you again. But y'all let me know what y'all Think in the comments.",

The peak call of duty games and X defiant actually have a lot of things in common, one of them being the brains behind the operation, Mark Rubin, who worked for Activision as the executive producer during the Modern Warfare series. But more importantly, he understands better than anyone that skill based matchmaking has played a huge factor in a call of duty struggles. So today the team released a statement confirming there will be no skill based matchmaking in the casual playlist for X Defiance. The statement continues on saying skill based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive, constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and varied, similar to how prime call of duty was. X defiant will find matches in order of these priorities latency avoided, players, party size, region, input device, and then platform. Once in the lobby. Teams will still be balanced though. They also confirmed that ranked will be added in a future season, and those matches will be prioritized based on ranked points.",

I've never bought a single comic book in my entire life. Until now. Now there's a guy I follow on here by the name of king and Queen Lion, and he has his own comic book line. I really enjoy his content. I like his takes. I love how unapologetically himself he is. Let me get my microphone because I want you to hear me clearly when I say what I'm about to say to y'all. I apologize for y'all eardrums for what I'm about to do to him. But did you hear what he said? He said he's never bought a comic before, but he bought mine. He said he spent money on me, he supported me and he said he likes the way I yell. And do you see that shit? Do you see how shiny that shit? Look at it, look at it! Oh, look at it! Oh god, it's even got my logo on the inside. God! Stop bullshit. You not. I went on Instagram and I actually tried to call your ass. I'm not even kidding. It wouldn't let me. It said you had to accept my message. Thank god, cause I would have busted your eardrum. I would have busted them. Please, after you read it, I need to know how you feel. Secondly, Bro. Bro. Second flames. Art got a huge upgrade around book. Well, all the writing has been redone. You got everything upgraded. Please tell me what you think about it. I don't give a fuck if it's bad or good. I wanna hear from you about how you feel about my shit.",

He can even use full counter after the attack has happened or before the attack. I think I need to prove that. Okay, I got you. Here's the first attack. He swings and there you go, countered. Now what about the second attack? Here it goes. The attack has already happened, and boom, full counter. As I said in my video, he can use full counter on physical, non physical, pretty much whatever he wants as long as it's an attack. And it's not just him that he can use that attack, his brothers can also use that attack. And because Meliodas is a demon, they all pretty much share the same abilities. But since he's a high ranking demon, he pretty much has all their attack. So Emilio just wants to take your soul out of your body? He can do that? If he wants to force gravity on your body, he can do that. He wants to counter your attack without even saying full counter or without it even being a magical attack. He can do that, as you just saw him do. He can even counter an attack that's already happened, as you also just saw him do. But don't worry, somebody's gonna argue and somebody's gonna cry about it. But other than that, you Guys, have a great day",

    "voice_to_text": "Best this video is gonna get reposted on my channel. I'mma say it again. The best. This video. Don't ever let a Naruto fan tell you that Naruto's best attacks are a rasengan variation of something. I'm gonna tell you his two most effective attacks that work almost every single time. Number one is jumping. Naruto relies on jumping so much that it dates back to when he was a kid. And it's not his fault. His sensei even taught him this. They both did it to dadara. In fact, most people in his village and other villages love using this technique. In fact, they made a jutsu over it, and it was to help them jump. But it's okay. Sometimes jumping isn't the most effective for Naruto, but that's where his second biggest technique comes in, and that is being bailed out by the nine tailed fox. But again, this dates back to when he was a kid in several of his fights. And you know what? It's not even his fault, because even when Naruto tries the Batman route of using prep time by having prior information fed to him about the enemy he's about to fight, by setting up clones to help him with Sage Mode in that fight, by having a slug give him information and help him during the whole fight, it just doesn't work out for Naruto. So of course he has to go back to Old Reliable and get bailed out by the Nine tailed Fox. I know what you're thinking. The Rasengan Shuriken or something should be his third most effective technique, but it actually isn't. Human Shields are actually his third most effective technique Hinata uses against pain. Neji did it during the Great Ninja War. And this is something that he's been using since he was a kid, whether it was Sasuke or even with a Ruka sensei.",

And the reason why the Almighty has an X over it is because it's too broken. But yeah, have fun with the entire rest of the alphabet. Oh yeah, bleach fans, have fun with this. But if I had to pick the one for real life, I think I'm gonna pick the visionary. Cause if I can imagine anything, I can imagine it on the spot and I'll attain it. But in the verse, I think I'm picking Gerards the miracle, just because if I get killed, I can just resurrect myself and I'll get stronger every time I get offed. There's characters like that where they get stronger, but they're not as good. Like the overkill or mask a masculine's superstar, where those, like, get you stronger.

He is saying that Naruto is planetary or universal because he was able to beat Momo, Shiki, and Kaguya. Or that because baryon mode is stronger than all of them, than his universe. Sweetie, let me help you real quick. He didn't beat momoshiki by his fucking self. When they fought Kaguya, he didn't do it by himself. Um, yeah. If I'm correct, he had the entire village just for Madara. And then when it came to her again, it took everybody. It was an everybody thing to stop her. And they didn't even killed her. They sealed her away. So why are we still using this shit? And when it comes to bury him on a fucking Bluetooth, last longer than that goddamn form. Furthermore, the only reason why he was able to beat Jigen with this form was because of the effect that his punches were having on Jigen. That, plus the speed and strength increase. Other than that, that's pretty much it. By the same time, Naruto doesn't have, uh, the nine tails, so. So it's. It's done. You can't say he outputs XYZ when he doesn't have any of that. So let's go over one more time. This was a team effort! This was a team effort! This shit was trashing! Only reason why you won was because the speed and strength enhancement that he Gave and the effect your punches had on Jigen. Pretty much it. This shit is trash. Your whole fandom is trash. I don't know how many fucking times I gotta say this shit.

I refuse to argue on my fucking live with a goddamn picture. It's not fucking happening. You can catch this ratio all fucking day, but your whole entire fucking verse is trash. Your character is trash, your fucking series is trash. You can't fight nobody one on one, so y'all jump. That's all the fuck y'all do is jump. And even when y'all jump you still get your ass whooped.

If it says George did 20 push UPS, you have nothing to contradict this statement that George did 20 push UPS. So this is a fee for George. It is stated that momoshiki created a universe. Unless you have anything to contradict this statement, momoshiki created a universe and this is a universal level fee. I absolutely love that line of thinking, cause that gets Luffy the boundless. I've been pushing this agenda for a while and I'm glad the Naruto fans are starting to realize. Because you have no feats, the statements are just as valid. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "The best written character from each anime. Follow for more. First of we have Naruto and he has Sasuke. Valid pick. I mean the going Sasuke retouching. I don't think there's anyone else to pick from. Sasuke's representation of revenge being the second best in any manga. It touches whole philosophy behind reality. And his loyalty to the Leaf Village and his depth and complexity behind all that. Easy one piece is not Law. Luffy representation of freedom clears most of Law's character. Sanji's insecurity that stems from his childhood clears most of Law's character. It's either Sanji or Luffy. Bleachy as Aizen. And I agree Aizen's God complex is top tier. Of course each goes a pick, he's the main character. But I'm saying Aizen. Hunter Hunter Krollo. I haven't read the manga so this could be right or wrong, I don't know, but I'm going to say meruim or Killua. Marilyn was definitely short lived, but his character development and ideologies were top tier. Phenomenal Jujutsu. Kaisen Maki Gojo Gojo Gojo's representation of strength, loneliness, and his internal external conflicts in the Hidden Inventory. Arguero the honored one me Gojo A 0 T it's Aaron, easily. Black Clover is not yummy. Best written yummy. What? That's crazy! Lucius is better written than yummy. Oscar is better written than yummy, you know? Is better written than yummy. Noel, even though I don't like her, is better written than young Dragon Ball Z. I agree every single day. Especially with His character development and Tokyo Revengers. Mikey all day, bro. People hate on Tokyo Revengers because of the reason how Mikey got the dark impulse, but, bro, like, Mikey is literally in mainstream like Annie Monger new gen. A top 5 to 10 side character. And he's so good with his depth and complexity. Bro, I don't care. I just had to get that off my chest. That's what I've got. Full of more. Who's the best written character from each of these animes?

So he wants a feat of Naruto destroying a planet, universe, etcetera. And I love how that didn't come out of my mouth. I said show him destroying a planet or threatening a universe, or simply just just destroying a star. But you don't have that. Like you look cause Naruto has no feats that show that. He's. He's never done it and he can't do it. Like, I just. I think it's crazy. I said provide this. You can. If someone says hey king, can you show Silver Surfer killing a planet? I can show him doing. If someone says hey king, can you show Superman killing a planet? I can do that. If someone says hey king, can you show Silver Surfer or Superman maybe affecting a dimension or something like that? Yeah, we can do that. You can do that for a lot of characters. Rather it be anime or comic book. But it seems like this is the one fandom that when you say hey, can you give me some cold hard fact? Can you show him doing X, y and Z? Can you show him affecting? You can't show none of that when it comes to debating. Y'all are so trash that if you would have just came out and said he has no feats that Show him doing that, then we could have had a different argument, we could have had a whole different discussion. But you can't even do that. You can't even just admit, well, king, he doesn't have any feats that that show that. Y'all go off the statements like, oh, well, it states right here that he can destroy the world. That doesn't mean you can kill the planet. A disease can destroy a world. Nuclear bombs can destroy a world, not a planet. But they can destroy the world because they can scorch the surface of it. And even at the height of the nine tails power, Naruto has yet to show the capability to threaten that planet. He doesn't even have an attack that threatens that planet. Maybe an island, possibly. A continent, possibly. I mean, but you wanna only keep it 100. I mean, what are y'all gonna do besides cry? That's all y'all gonna do this point. I'm not going to listen here or care what any of you have to say unless you can either one admit he has no feet. That shows him destroying a planet, a universe, or a star. If you can't do that, I don't care about anything else that comes out of your mouth. Please listen to what I'm saying. If you cannot show Naruto either killing a star, destroying a universe, or destroying a planet, or threatening the existence of any of those three, I don't wanna hear anything. Because Let's keep it 100. What is your fan base going to do except what they've always done? Cry. That's. That's all you gonna do? That's all you gonna do is cry?",

There are actions I don\u2019t take not because they are inherently evil, but because it is my responsibility to build relationships that set emotionally and developmentally appropriate expectations for kids.

I guarantee you everyone who talks about how talented Ichigo is or how gifted Ichigo is has not seen bleach if they think that he's not hardworking. Ichigo is talented, but he is also extremely hard working. People always talk about how Ichigo is so talented because he was able to unlock Bangkai in the span of three days, whereas it takes other Shinigamis decades to unlock Bangkai. People don't bring up how this technique that Ichigo used to unlock Bangkai in the span of three days was created by the smartest man in the entire series. And it also came with the extreme risk of Ichigo dying. Ichigo also have to trade in the dawn guy for 3 months straight. 3 months with no breaks, no rest, no food, nothing. Just 3 months of straight fighting to use final Getsuka 10 show is definitely talented, do not get me wrong, but he is one of those characters that is both talented and hardworking.",

I need somebody in Naruto to show me a feat from Naruto that shows him either killing a planet, threatening a universe, or destroying a star. I don't wanna see no statements. Just can you show me that show Naruto destroying a dimension? Cause at this point, Hulk would solo that whole verse. Hulk at his lowest destroyed a meteor that was twice the size of earth. At his lowest, Hulk can take a step in, crack a continent. Like if you put Hulk in the Naruto verse, this is what that shit would look like. Okay guys, this is our ninja way. Let's take them out together. Ninja formation! Let's go! Hulk smash! Ah! Oh shit! No, no, no, no, no, no! Ah! Oh my god! Ah! Oh my god! Ah! Oh my god! Ah! Ah!",

Obviously that's why I keep seeing people bring up Goku. Cause he's never destroyed a planet. This just shows the length of willful ignorance Naruto fans participate in to glaze him. Cause why are we comparing an alien from a race of people that blow up planets for fun? And look, this is King Vegeta, a weak ass character relative to now why are we comparing Saiyan to a human enhanced with Chakra? Like he doesn't get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to blowing up planets. And with the whole destructive capability conversation. He put all his chakra into this move. After he did this him and Sasuke had to fight hand to hand cause they had no chakra left. If not even destroying a country is what most of your chakra is gonna do, where is the leap and logic coming from to say he can destroy a planet? I've never seen this many gymnastics done for a character to make them more powerful about statements and chain scaling and all this other shit. He put all his chakra into a punch and damaged the moon. He didn't even destroy it. But where are the calc man? Where. Where are the statements? Where. Where are y'all pulling this shit out of your ass that he can blow up a planet?",

They got bro in the flag Bandana. They got the shades on. He wears shades all the time. Studded Jean jacket. Bro, come on. So I used to fucking hate bandit Keith. I used to hate that motherfucker. Bro was cheating. Bro was arrogant. Bro was mean to yugi. Yeah! Guess what bro's strongest card was? It was a card called slot machine. Slot machine! Who else loves to gamble more than us? You got like, Funny Valentine from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Stan's name is dirty deeds done dirt cheap. That's an AC DC song. This character's name is stars and stripes. He gets to call in jets on her command. Like the Air Force. And of course there's a super obvious one of all might, right? Bro's ultimate move is literally called United States of smash. All of his moves are named after states. I don't know if it's weird to say, but it warms my heart that it's still happening in animes today. Yeah, Shit's mad funny and I hope it doesn't stop.",

    "voice_to_text": "You said for you know, you would have to be able to scale to them to hurt and and the manga she broke that bitch's horn. So. Okay, let's throw in a little thing called context and see what I actually said. Now what did I start with? 3 means that somebody has the ability to destroy a planet. It doesn't mean that they have to have destroyed a planet, because it would make no sense in the context of the story for Naruto to destroying planets. But through feat statements, chainscaling, and logic we can figure out how strong would the strongest version of a character be and what they would be capable of. Notice how I said using feats, statements, chain scaling, and logic we can figure out how strong the strongest version of a character would be. What I did not say is using one out of context feed while ignoring all of the statements and chain scaling that points to the contrary. Now, because I said this is shown and stated to be able to create and destroy entire dimensions, complete with entire solar systems. So even if Naruto and Sasuke jumped Kaguya, being able to fight somebody who has the ability to create and destroy entire dimensions with entire solar systems, to even be able to damage this person, you have to at least be able to scale relative to them. Now again, if you apply a thing called context. I'm not saying that to Be able to damage Kaguya, you would have the ability to create and destroy multiple dimensions. Because the question at hand is is Naruto planetary, not is Naruto multidimensional? And the argument I was making is that Naruto is planetary, not that Naruto is multi dimensional. If we take this same logic in the context of what I just said, it logically follows that because Naruto was able to damage Kaguya, but also has statements putting him a planetary, has fought characters with ten tails powers, who is confirmed to be a planet destroyer, has easily defeated characters who are stronger than Madara and Obito maxed out with ten tails powers, and has gotten considerably stronger since the end of Shippuden. It can be reasonably argued that Naruto is planetary or would have the ability to destroy a planet. So yes, Sakura being able to damage Kaguya confirms that Sakura is a top tier, but all her other feed statements and chainscaling prove that she is significantly weaker.",

Cause that's crazy to me. Like, when you're out in public and you're making eyes with a girl and you're, like, making it known that you're attracted to her, but you're not gonna say something. How you not gonna say something? Where are the weevos? Where are the weevos these days? I feel like there's so many, like, times that guys wanna say something to girls and they don't. Like, is there a guy watching this that can give us some insight? Like, why don't you just do it? Why don't you just do it? Are you scared? Are you waiting for her to say something first? I like my man to be assertive and dominant. If you wanna say something to me, say something to me. I'll give you the opportunity, I'll put my phone down, I'll drop the handkerchief, but I'm not gonna do it first. Did that not just be, like, the standard in my trip?

But he didn't really fight Kaui. They jumped her and none of them had the power to beat her, so they sealed her as a team. I don't know how this affects Naruto scaling at all in baryon mode. Gives him a solid boost of speed and strength in combat. Can't even use big attacks cause it'll exhaust the form in one move. Even then, he ran out of chakra before he could beat a shiki. The when I put him against somebody like Omni Man and the responses are just oh, Naruto's outerversal, he's galaxy level, so I'm the man doesn't stand a chance. Sounds like bullshit. We have never seen Naruto destroy a planet. We have never seen him do some shit like this. Look at his home. Not just this, the zipping back and forth destroying the whole shit. Guy.

And the main argument that people say here is that Demon Slayer is a very simplistic story. So the main reason that people enjoy is because the animation is so top notch? To which I always respond why does it matter? A simplistic story is not a bad thing. Dragon Ball is one of the greatest animes of all time, but let's be honest, it's a rather simplistic anime. And again, that's not a bad thing. All the way up to Dragon Ball Super, a new villain shows up, new power UPS are made, new transformations are made, and then they win. I'm not saying that there can't be depth such as Vegeta's character development, but the same thing happens in Demon Slayer as well as we get more development and more backstory behind each one of the Hashira. And even the main character Tanjiro doesn't change all that much. Slightly, but not that much. Whereas the same thing for Dragon Ball. Goku as the main character doesn't change all that much. Changes slightly, but not that much. Being simplistic is not a bad thing. I don't understand why for Demon Slayer it's demonized but not for other animes. But like usual, this just my opinion. Let me know what you guys think. Do you think that Demon Slayer is carried by animation? And if So do you think that's a bad thing",

After South Korea proposed last week, $75,000 per baby that a family has, Japan is in desperate need, okay? And they are calling all black men, specifically immigrants, um, to come and impregnate their women so that they can save their dying population. I don't understand, because, you know, black men were once and still is, on the inner side, side of the line, which means their lives. I mean, what. What are you going to guarantee us if we send our men over there to help save you? Could you imagine? Think about this. After everything they put us through, everything, y'all trying to take these men out now you need them to repopulate the earth? The United States is responsible for what's going on over there in Japan. Why should we be held responsible? And get this, they ain't even paying no money to do it. They're just saying, please, please, black men, immigrants, please come have babies without women. Here's the thing. We gonna need the Russian test, because it could be from what happened years ago as to why their population is down. You know what I'm saying? That stuff still in the soil, it's still in the air. You already know what I'm talking about. What's that white man name that thought it Was a genius idea to create the biggest bullet in the world. Oklahoma. Yeah, that's his name. So why is it that, you know, y'all called him this? Y'all called him that? You is late and you did this, and now you ain't calling? You ain't calling, but you calling. But to come save your community. And i'mma go over there and i'mma start me a negotiation firm over there in Asia and stuff. And I'm going to have black men come breed with them. But they're gonna get benefits. They're gonna get lifetime Protection from any type of child support. If they decide to leave and don't wanna stay in these here countries, they're going to be set for life. Which means anything that these kids bring, it is gonna come back directly to the black family. Which means if I send Shek over there to breathe, right? Let's just say, hypothetically, I sent him over there on a contract breeding. Anything that these kids inherit is gonna come back to us the same way they do it with these. You know, we used to be slaves on this land out here. And anything that we work, you know, I'm saying they own and went back to their family, we gonna start sending it back to Africa, back to the black families. That's the type of contract I need. If you need this, burn, because this one ain't dying. We gonna get our kickbacks out of here. Moving on.",

I'll be your sensei if you subscribe on the red play button app. But let's answer this Shazam Shinobi, let's get active! So the first sensei we can eliminate is Stein from Soul Eater. He's just very weak in comparison to everybody else on this list, despite being a really cool character. The next sensei that can go is Aizawa from My Hero Academia. His quirk erasure only works against other quirks, and there's no evidence that it would be able to work against the abilities of all of the other sensei. And his entire verse just doesn't really scale to everybody else's verse. The next sensei I would eliminate is Jiraiya from Naruto. Kakashi is a more powerful Naruto character and has higher feats. The next character I would eliminate is Dark King Rayleigh from one piece because I think Hokage Kakashi is more powerful than him. Next I would get rid of Gojo because Yami, Kakashi, and Kisuke can all get through Gojo's infinity and Master Roshi could literally just blow up the planet. I would go ahead and remove Captain Yami next. Then I would go ahead and get rid of Kakashi. And in the final battle between Kisuke, Orihara and Master Roshi, I would give the win to Kisuke. This is because Kisuke is more powerful than Master Roshi. Now, if I could pick any of these masters to be my sensei, I personally would either choose Master Roshi or Kakashi",

Kaido do really do much for Luffy outside of Awakened Year 5. The best way to explain it with Dio. All of these antagonists here, there were kind of longstanding effects of what they've done to the main character. Even outside of when these guys aren't present, Dio just appears in the main character's lives for a bit, then gets defeated, and then Sayonara the next. I would say Shigaraki, Pain, and Mahito. Mahito and pain definitely change Naruto and Yuji's perspective on life, since after Naruto defeated pain, he understood the cycle of hatred better. And then Yuji had the whole we the same we twinning, except he said it in a lot more of a, um, murderously intentful way. I shall say now. After Peyton Maito, I say Shigaraki and Peyto. Peyto is similar to Maito and peyto with how it was they were just around for a moment. But the things that peyto did to gon, bro. He seemed like a completely different person and even lost his net. Peyto affected gon so much that he stopped being the main character of the story. Then as for Shigaraki, I feel like Shigaraki showed Deku what is actually like to be a hero. What it means to be a hero. Since when Deku was in the one for all kind of world Deku showed how great of a hero he actually is with him wanting to save Shigaraki instead of ending him. Of course, the whole war going on now blah blah blah blah blah. This leaves us with an easy top 3. Aizen, Makimo, aztel, and honestly any order to me is fine. Aizen literally constructed most of Ichigo's life. Him making the hollow that became white that ended up biting Ichigo's mom, poisoning her, blah blah blah. Makimo just completely manipulated everything with Denji. With a lot of the ideologies Denji has now in part two of Chainsaw Man, a lot of them come from his experience with Makumo. I would say Makumo is No. 3, and I think there are arguments for both Aizen and Askeleton number one. Orphan's whole life is based on revenge and redemption, and none of that would have happened without escalate. However, each girl's life still would have been somewhat similar without Aizen. I'm assuming, since even without Aizen's intervention, he still would have been part Quincy and part Soul Reaper. So as I said, there are arguments for either one at No. 1, but I'm going to say Escalad due to everything that thorfin has dedicated his life to stepping from him. That's what I've got. Follow for more. And which antagonists hit impact to their main characters life the most? Bye.",

Now, even though two out of the four games on this list are mobile games, one is a Chinese exclusive, I'm most excited for that console game. Bleach easily has the most potential to have the best anime game ever, so if they do this console game right, it might just go down as the best anime video game. I mean, we already saw that with Jump Force. The potential is there, we just need the right studio to execute it.",

    "voice_to_text": "So if you were my last live just now, I think you understand why I don't do anime debates anymore. A majority of people who are doing anime debates these days have zero interest in truth seeking. It's all about winning and not admitting whenever you're wrong. My my stance is not changing at all. It's guaranteed, but it doesn't have a guaranteed so it's gonna. So that's the. That's the trade off. Because it's a flurry of attacks within an area is going to hit you, but it's not like it's a guaranteed hit. Like a Jacob's Ladder or something like that. And for the record, this absolutely no hate to this content creator whatsoever. If you want to anime debate and the thing you care about is winning, that's fine. It's your hobby, do your own business. But if you openly admit that no matter how many points I bring up, you will never change your mind, then there's no point in us debating. And if I can forbatum show you a scan that says that Sukuna's open domain expansion has a sure hit effect, and you can read it and say yes, but he doesn't have a sure hit effect, then we're not debating anymore. You're just not wanting to admit you're wrong. This is why a majority of the time if I'm going to debate someone on anime, I say they have to pay me first.",

Then you shouldn't be watching these other anime either. And then proceeded to use two of the worst examples I've seen. First things first, you brought up Master Roshi from Dragon Ball as if Master Roshi is the main character and the entire story is centered around him being a P3. Deal? We are not worried about Master Roshi at all. The entire story of what? Shunku Tensei is a redemption story about Rudy and how he becomes this new and better person in this new world. When at the end of the series he doesn't even become this new and better person. He's just as weird at the beginning as he is at the end. Even in the novel I've seen they get into even weirder stuff. That's for another video. Your next example was Raroni Kenshin and you got the talking about the author as if the author wrote any of the stuff that he was doing in real life in his manga. As far as I know, we're only kitchen has no inkling of anything that was going on in Michoku Tensei. I don't know why it's so hard for people to believe that people don't wanna watch their main character being a P3 to you. He literally put a camera in his 10 year old niece's bathroom to watch her take A bath. And then on her funeral day, spanking his monkey to it. Are you serious? It's strange. You could have brought up something like, I don't know, seven deadly sins, which was well received way back in the day, but then people started hating it because of Meliodas is strange. It's not a good look for you defending this series so tough when there are way better series and way other series that you could be defending. Bro, you're cooked for this one.",

    "voice_to_text": "Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter 2:59 translations are out and sukuna not holding back couldn't be any more clear. The repeated use of binding vows to alter his effects of range meant that during his battle with Gojo Satsudu, the furnace remained cooled as sukuna didn't have the freedom to unseal its flames. And despite their absurd power, the flames within the furnace lack both speed and range. So the only reason that Sukan had to constantly change the conditions of his domain expansion is because he couldn't afford to get hit with unlimited void until after Maharaga adapted. Which means Gojo is the reason that sukuna could not use his fire arrow. And because the fire arrow both lacks speed and range, it would not bypass Gojo's Infinity. Not only that, but as we saw with Choso being able to block Yuji, this is not a sure hit effect. This attack actually travels. And since Choso burned away over time, this means you could heal it with a verse curse technique. Like I said. And for those who saying the divine flames negate RCT, prove it because you can. So the whole Sukano was holding back debate is officially over. Like I had mentioned, whenever Gojo said that Sukano wasn't able to give it his all, that's him not being able to use the fire Arrow and his other abilities cause they were ineffective against Gojo in his Infinity. Anything that Sukano fans try to bring up now at this point Is 100% cope",

My problem comes in when people say he's badly written and he's an unlikeable character, and then when I question why is he badly written, you start listing things off like Sasuke didn't return back to the village, or he wanted to kill Naruto, or he treated his friends badly, or he didn't listen to Itachi wishes. Those are reasons for you not to like Sasuke, but those are not reasons for you to sit up here and say he's a terribly written character. In the way I look at it, you're completely ignoring why Sasuke did what he did, only because it affected a certain character that you really cared about and that you like. For example, like I've said in this video, people will say Sasuke is a terribly written character because he didn't listen to Itachi's wishes. They're completely ignoring why Sasuke didn't listen to Itachi's last wishes. And because he didn't listen to those wishes. Oh, he's a terribly rude character. No, that. That's not making any sense. There's no acknowledgement as to why Sasuke did what he did, or why he felt like he didn't need to listen to Itachi's wishes.",

Some of their sword styles are 100% at like an equalized normal level human level. There's his sword style would never actually work, but neither would Zoro's. At least not the three sword style. The two sword would be fine, but say that there are no swordsmen in the Naruto verse when we have the Seven Swordsmen of the mist of the Hidden Mist village, like some of which are on this panel. And again, it's fine if you guys wanna say oh well, they're not. They're swordsmen. They're not as good of a swordsman as, again, Saber or Zoro or Kenshin, Hamura, guts, whoever you wanna go them up against. Or Musashi. That. That's fine to say that they're not a master level swordsman, or. I mean for some of them. Um. Or to say that like they're not the greatest swordsman in anime. Cause I would agree with that take, but to say they're not swordsman is ridiculous. Like, they are. They are sword users. They wield swords in combat. They are swordsman.

    "voice_to_text": "I got a genuine question for the manga community here is the quality of the art within the manga a barrier to entry for you? This comment right here is saying storytelling over art. And overall I totally agree with this opinion. Like, a good story is gonna carry it way more than anything else. But we all know on the anime side that if the anime is super poorly animated, nine times out of 10 people are not gonna like it, even if it has a really, really good story. So my real question is, does that same mentality bleed over onto the manga side now? If I'm being honest, I'm just now really getting into reading physical manga heavily. I haven't spent that much time on that side of the medium. I'm mostly anime, but I'm really starting to get into manga, and this one comes from me talking about the Boruto manga. The Boruto manga is really, really plain. I'm not saying the story is bad, the story is cooking right now. But the manga itself is super plain, and for me that's a bit of a barrier to entry. Like, it's just genuinely not that enjoyable to read the panels because they're just kind of plain. In that same realm, I just started Sakamoto Days, which is a significantly smaller IP than Boruto. Sakamoto Days art looks absolutely amazing. The backgrounds are super detailed, the fight sequences are really, really good. It's not just a bunch Of lines. Overall it looks fantastic. So the question is like, why can an IP like Boruto not have that level of drawing in it? I just don't fully understand it. For me, art style is super huge. For me. To read a manga, I've got to enjoy what I'm looking at before I can get into the story. Now with something like Boruto, I kind of already know the story, so I could maybe argue that I could get into it simply because I'm already caught up with all of Naruto and all of the anime canon. Boruto. So like, the story can be enough to grab me, but even still, I've gone to start reading it and I'll just wait for the leaks to be honest. So you guys let me know in the comments at what point would you read a manga or not read a manga based on the art?",

    "voice_to_text": "I have been arguing a lot recently with people over on YouTube about this, so now seems like a good time to bring it back up. Did not get any stronger until the time skip. The physical strength that Luffy had in episode 1 is the same physical strength that he has at marineford. We never see Luffy working out or trying to train to increase his strength. Because he never needed to. Luffy was always ridiculously strong. The only thing Luffy needed to improve pre time skip was his techniques. While sure, early in the story his raw physical strength was enough to overpower most of his enemies, he did eventually need to develop techniques like second and third gear. But what's important to note is that those don't affect his baseline physical stats, they are temporary power boost. And so while sure, you can use this to say Luffy has gotten stronger, his strength hasn't increased. The strength Luffy used to fight people like Alveda Morgan Buggy is the exact same strength that he used to fight admirals.",

All he's done to atone so far after putting his family through the ringer for a decade, be a little nicer to them. But he gets punished for his sins. He keeps getting more scarred and injured as a result of how he treated Dobby. But again, even if he's the one to end up defeating Dobby and putting an end to all of this, that hardly counts as a tone Man, because he would have just done that anyway, as per his job description. Even if Dobby weren't connected to him, it would be a tone, man, if he were a civilian with no powers who took up heroing to put an end to Dabi. Because he was the one who created him. Not. Not because he's just still doing the job he was always going to do.",

And I'm here to say that the gap isn't as big as you really think it is. So what people are tending to forget is that one piece at first was a flop when the anime came out. So one piece came out in 1999, Naruto in 2002, and Bleach 2,006. But when one piece came out, it really didn't see a lot of success until 2,008, during which time Naruto was actually the second most popular anime, right behind Dragon Ball. Bleach is kind of floating around from third to fifth place. What's also interesting is that the Naruto, the original one, ended in 2,007, which essentially allowed one piece to get more popularity. So essentially what happened was Naruto stopped in 2,007, um, so they can start working on Naruto Shippuden. And then one piece got a little breakout, and then that's where it kept going. But it's not like it was still far away, because Naruto came back in 2009 with Shippuden.",

Okay, but I see people saying that they will not watch Muchako Tensei because of Rudy, but they love Dragon Ball and Master Roshi is essentially Rudius except he wasn't reincarnated. I have legit seen people love Rooney Kenshin. And you know, the author. He's literally. Rudy is gray rat but like in real life, not a fictional character. And really, when you look at anime as a whole, Rudy's character type. Like you know that the pervy character type exists in almost every single anime ever. But people don't have a problem with those in those other animes. It's just with Muchacho Tensei though, right? Hmm. Interesting, interesting.

    "voice_to_text": "I'm convinced once you stop watching anime, bro, it's almost impossible to get back into watching it, bro. The reason is because a lot of anime, especially the older ones, are genuinely horrible. And the reason is either because they're meant to be an advertisement for the manga, or the longer ones have the worst pacing of all time. Try to milk as much money as humanly possible. Or to try to stay behind the manga. And before people start talking about oh, your attention span is cooked. If you're telling a story and you can't keep the attention of your audience, it is a bad story. I'm not watching a documentary about the history of centipedes. I'm watching a show about teenagers who beat up aliens. But I feel like a lot of us, especially growing up, were so used to mediocre fiction because we're so used to watching whatever boring show was on Cartoon Network. Because streaming wasn't really a thing. And now when you can stream the pika series whenever you want, it's hard for me to watch a show. And one interesting thing happens every 30 episodes. That's why I'm so happy that I finished Naruto as a kid, because I know for a fact if I watch Naruto as an adult I would not like it at all. The manga is probably fine with the anime. No way. A lot of people don't know this, but one piece used to be my favorite series growing Up. And then I stopped and took like a ten year break. Then I got back into it as an adult and it just wasn't good. And I'm sure that if I finished the series when I was a kid like I finished Naruto when I was a kid, I'd probably be one of those annoying one piece stands on this app right now. Anime doesn't hit the same as it used to because most animes are objectively just not good. That's why I'm always tell people read the manga, read the manga because it is rare to watch an anime that even comes close to being as good as the manga.",

Oh my god it's so boring. No, because it's not like I'm being so for real when I say this. How small of an attention span do you have to have to come up with a take like this? It's like season 3 first off just started. It's only about like five episodes in. And what the past couple of episodes have been doing showing the repercussions of what happened at the end of Season 2, showing the stakes of Season 3, and expanding on character depth and world building. Slime typically is 24 episodes of season, but god forbid they expand character depth of world building in any of those episodes. Think that somebody who likes Naruto so much would appreciate character depth and world building, but I guess not. So I know it's not just me that thinks this, but saying that Slime Season 3 is one of the worst seasons of anime ever made, especially when it's only like five episodes in has to be one of the most brainless takes I've heard on an anime in a while. Especially when stuff like shield Hero season 2 exist, which he mentioned in his video. And even that's not the worst. Season 3 of slime is an ass. That take was.",

It's because the author of the series is a terrible person. Nobody here. Watsuki was caught with so much children material that the police thought that he was a distributor. They like his collection was so large they thought, this has to be a storage bank that he's dealing from. A lot of us just don't look at the series the same way anymore. I know that a lot of people are able to separate the art from the artist, and that's fine. If you wanna watch it, I recommend not watching it on an official service.

We just need to sit on it and press the switch without needing to exert ourselves, and large things will fall down by themselves. Sometimes using the toilet alone can be quite boring. This type of toilet is designed for one person's use only. And it's just for excretion, which is very dull. So I invented this seesaw toilet. Just bring along your friends. See, not only can two people use it at the same time, but it's also a lot of fun. In winter, it's very cold to get up to use the toilet at night. So I invented this toilet with a teleportation device. When we need to use the toilet at night, we don't even need to get out of bed. Just press the switch and we can use the toilet while lying down. Then press the switch again and it will dispose of what we've excreted into the toilet. Many households have only one toilet. When two people need to use it at the same time, the person without a toilet may feel very uncomfortable. So I invented this toilet where one can sit below while the other can squat on top. It's similar to bunk beds, saving a lot of space. I'll show you how it works later.",

    "voice_to_text": "\"So two rocks slapped together in space and magically created life from non life and then evolution took over.\" No. No, no, that's not how anything works. I don't know exactly what this comment is attempting to reference. It was just left on a video from several months ago about why chimpanzees and humans are related but that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually came from one another. So I don't know if this is talking about abiogenesis or evolution or the big bang or what. I've heard similarly factuous things about all of those and so much more because there's a lot of people out there whose whole job it is to be wrong about science professionally. And then they go out and they do debates and they make creationist videos and they try really really hard to convince as many people as possible their mischaracterization of science as one person holding up a Bible and another person holding up On the Origin of Species and \"they both have books and you just have to decide which one to have faith in\" is in any way accurate or reasonable and it just isn't. That simply is not how science works. And aren't you glad? The whole reason you're able to watch my stupid face on your cellphone right now is because science doesn't work that way. So, if you wanna learn more about what science actually says and how it actually works, I have a whole channel over on the play button platform where I make lots and lots of videos about evolution and about the age of the earth and about all sorts of other cool science stuff and I even go out and debunk those pseudoscience videos that try to teach ridiculous nonsense like creationism. And I also host several live call-in shows where people can just call me directly, live on the air, and challenge me about evolution or about religion or about politics or whatever else! So check me out on those shows as well! I'll talk about some of them over here in the comment section. I hope to see you over there because I would really love to teach you science sometime.",

I really like to read books, and I got into reading e books, so I got an e reader. This is my phone sized e reader. It doesn't make phone calls. It's just an e reader. I decorated it because that's what the Kindle girlies do, and I'm just copying them. Well, it wasn't enough to just get an e reader. I also needed a clicker that I could hold in my hands so I could lay in bed and not have to physically swipe on my reader to turn the pages. So I proceeded to get a miniature keyboard. And then not only did I get a miniature keyboard that I can customize the different buttons to work on my Android e reader device, you can literally change these keycaps. So I bought these custom keys. These also do light up, by the way. And now if I want to read my book in bed like the nerd I am, goes forward, back, and this one refreshes the screen, and I love it. It also lives on this cute stand. I have a charm. So cute.",

Like I remember a few years ago Black Clover was on the same level of popularity with my Hero Academia, Jujutsu Kaisen, Boruto, all these new gen series. And now just no one even talks about it ever since it was removed from Shonen Jump. It's only gotten so much worse for the series because since August it's only had three chapters, and two chapters literally came out last week and not a single person is even talking about them. Black Clover genuinely had one of the worst fall offs in all of shown in history. And it doesn't help with the fact that the anime has been on hiatus for like four years and all they've done with it is released a non canon movie last year. It's genuinely sad to see that a series that once stood at the very top is now just never talked about and is practically forgotten. It's crazy that this is the series that used to be like the main rival to My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen, and now Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia both kept growing in popularity and Black Clover just fell off.",

First of all, I don't know what's going on with my TikTok, but it's not letting me stitch people back. So I don't know what I'm gonna do. I have to figure that out. But I wanted to just take a second and talk about this fight right here because I know I'm about to piss off a lot of bleach fans, but this is facts. This fight was not that good. This fight was anti climactic. This fight was a big letdown. Alright? Everyone talks about this fight. The best part of this fight was the beginning, when Ichigo mushes the crap out of Aizen. Everything else, not as good. Not even close. In fact, Aizen versus everybody was way better than this. Ichigo versus Uruguayora was better than this. Ichigo versus Grimjow was better than this. There are so many moments in fights that are better than this. I don't know why people give this the hype. Yes, it was cool to see Ichigo get the final mugetsu. And yes, it was good to see his final move, even though his final move didn't really work technically. But outside of this. They were just flexing. They were just flexing. It wasn't a good fight. There was no suspense. There was nothing really drawn out by this fight. It was not a great fight. Kaido versus Luffy was Way better. Yeah. I mean, fact. Let's go through all the fights that were way better than this fight from one piece, since that's how this was brought up. First we have Sanji versus Queen. Better, easily. Zoro versus king. Hands down better. Lawn kid versus big mom. Yes, still better. And then everything that Luffy does is better. I mean, Gear 5th. Come on, come on! Gear 5th was light years better than this. And I have to remember, this isn't even the response to the video that you made, which I have to figure out how I can stitch. I might just, like, record it and then throw my thing on top. Phrasing on that one. This is not a good fight. This was a boring fight. I was extremely let down. Now, was I as let down as the end of bleach? No, no, that was a worse let down. But this was anticlimactic. It was building up. Aizen was building up. They were getting stronger. They were getting stronger. And then essentially, when Ichigo pulled up, the fight was over. There was no more fight. It was done. He was way stronger than Aizen. And Aizen, he went from being like Uchiha Madara to Orochimaru losing to Sasuke. You know what I mean? It makes no sense. It makes no sense at all. So people who think that this fight is peak. I don't think it's peak. I think there's fights in bleach that are peak Uh. Ichigo versus Byakuya, the first one where he finally reveals his bankai. Ichigo versus Rukiora absolutely peak. There are some fights in the Thousand Year Blood War um. That are pretty good, but Ichigo Aizen ain't one of them.",

Like, when they become young, their family, of course, find out about it, and their granddaughter comes over, and their granddaughter develops a crush on her grandfather and then asks him to do, and I quote, Sexy Idol poses and slurps, lusting over him. Like, this is an abomination to god. I think I need to quit anime. Like, why would this. Why?",

To this day, when Naruto finally appeared on the battlefield in the PAIN fight in this form, when I tell you, I scream this here Naruto with the serious face showing that he has fully mastered Sage mode. He pulled up on the damn toads. Everybody was ready to throw hands in honor of Jiraiya. That really is what it meant. The fact that he brought everyone and this face, he was piercing through pain. Because Naruto was there to handle business. And the fact that he mastered Sage mode in the time frame that he did was just like what he did. And now the match up has occurred. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki versus pain! And Naruto was there and it was just like. It is such a profound anime moment for me. Just because we were all waiting for this moment, waiting for Naruto to be able to avenge Jiraiya. We didn't know what the full stage mode would have looked like if he was gonna be able to master it. And he comes fully mastered it prepared and it was just like, let's go! It's such a proud moment, but such an incredible moment. And then as we proceed to see what the stage mode produces and what is capable of is just like, oh my god, it's so lit! But you tell me, TikTok. What is your favorite anime moment or anime moment that you will never forget? I wanna know.",

Oh my goodness. Uh, alright, well, uh. Yeah, the internet's, uh. Wow. This is why so many people think that my Hero Academia fanbase is toxic. Can you not see how uncomfortable Justin Briner is in this video? Can you not think that this question might make a voice actor uncomfortable? I moderate panels for collecticon, and stuff like this is one of the reasons why voice actors are so hesitant to do panel sometimes. Stuff like this is why some actors don't enjoy doing panels. Now, I'm sure this young lady didn't have any malicious intent. She probably just wanted to get a laugh. But this is why people think the my Hero Academia fanbase is incredibly toxic. And if this crap continues to happen, they're not gonna wanna do panels. And we're gonna get less and less opportunity to actually connect with the voices behind these characters that we love.",

Alright, so I saw my Mutual Teddy be saying uh, talk about this, but I disagree with his assessment of the situation. Um. If this would have been Gohan instead of Krillin? Cause essentially Teddy said you know, Krillin had already died once, so he doesn't you know Goku was still been Super Saiyan. But go Krillin already died and that was Goku's main anger. If I'm not mistaken. The Dragon Balls weren't in play yet. And I don't think Goku's dumb and basic. Not in a bad way. We know Goku's character. That's what I mean by that. Goku wouldn't have been thinking about the Dragon Balls and about bringing Gohan back that way. Especially with Piccolo already being hurt and the making Dragon Balls at this point gone. Goku would have snapped. He most definitely would have gone Super Saiyan, but there's a very good possibility that that Super Saiyan transformation then goes to him being berserk. Because the feelings that Goku has for krill and his best friend for majority of his life are completely different than the feelings you would have for your child. And the different than the feelings Goku would have for. Go on. You know, there's zero thought in my head that the catalyst that made him go Super Saiyan would still not. Where wouldn't be there? Like if he's still going Super Saiyan but I think he would have gone berserk and not like so much so unlike the old school Dragon Ball Z or even Dragon Ball Super Broly going berserk, but throughout the entire fight was Super Saiyan. Goku was still his normal forgiving self. There would have been zero forgiveness in this situation. There would be zero playing around. We've seen Goku and Vegeta both get angry. Neither one of them plays around when they're angry. Especially if someone fucks with her family. There would be no resurrection after. There would be no Frieza coming back as a half Cyborg. Goku would have mergalized this boy. There's zero chance for Frieza surviving. Sorry.",

    "voice_to_text": "Yo, can we please talk about the fact that Orochimaru versus the 3rd Hokage is one of the best, if not the best fight in Naruto and nobody gives it props? You know, this fight should not even be considered Orochimaru versus the third hokage cause Orochimaru was just spectating. Technically this fight was just hashirama and tobirama jumping the living fuck out of Hiruzen. This fight is the perfect example of let him get up! LET him get up! And and when they both popped out of the reanimation box, they had personalities until Orochimaru controlled them. They were like ain't this the little homie here? Isn't from back in the day? You're old as fuck now, how you doing dog? And the animation is so raw, fast paced, and intense. The choreography is top tier. I don't know how to explain it, but this looks like a Boondocks episode. Just the lighting and shading. The coloring is darker than usual. And it only kept getting better and better by the second. As soon as that boy monkey King Enma shown up, it became a 10 out of 10 episode. Ooh, smack the god of Shinobi like it was nothing. I hope everyone knows that Monkey King Enma is basically just the legendary Sun Wukong, so of course bros gonna be overpowered. This episode has such a eerie feeling to it. Arochimaru's body kept constantly getting discombobulated. This shit was creepy. This shit is sinister, bro. This has to Be Arochimaru's most inhuman moment. Bro! Turn into a fucking baby faced woman! What is this shit? It was stated multiple times by ENMA that Hiruzen was fighting very strange. He wasn't given it his all. Cause at the end of the day, he still loves that fucking psychopath Orochimaru. And of course, what's the most iconic way for a hokage to sacrifice themselves and save the village? The reaper! Dead seal! Shout out Minato! During Hiruzen's final moments, Orochimaru was so defeated, you can see it in his eyes. He kept calling Hiruzen a dootard. What the fuck does that mean? It sounds like some ice cream. We talk about Shippuden way too much and we don't give enough respect to OG Naruto. So next up, let's talk about one of the most hectic moments in this series, when Kisame and Itachi pulled up on Naruto. Make sure to follow your boy for this one. Let's get it!",

    "voice_to_text": "The absolute vile things the author writes in Mr. Cotense don't even stop it, Rudius. For example, in the redundancy side stories at the end of the novel, Rudius's half sister Aisha, who's almost thirty, seduces ours, who is twelve, and ours is heiresses and Rudius's son. And then Aisha, who's his aunt, proceeds to get pregnant from ours. After that, we have a Nord who is only a teenager, Mary Richard, who's over 500 years old. You have cliff, who is 16, who marries Alina lies, who is 200 years old and over 5,000 years old if you count old dragon's tail. And don't even get me started how many times she statutory R words cliff. Lot of Michelle. Could Tensei fans defend this by saying, oh, this is normal in this type of world. This is normal in a medieval setting, which is. Yeah, that is a fair thing to say if the author did not glorify these type of relationships. For example, the author be like, oh, and every timeline, no one falls in love with Rudger. They are faded to fall in love with each other. Okay, like, not gonna state any problems with this kind of relationship whatsoever. Furthermore, Rudius, who is from our modern world, should have some sense of a modern moral compass. But Rudy's is totally fine with this type of relationship. In fact, he participates in liking children. Even Nana Hoshi, when she finds out that Rudy's was 30 years old. Before reincarnating is totally fine with Rudy's having relationships with underage girls. That is completely fine to her. And again, to the people who say oh this is a redemption story. Please stop using that argument. Because what made rudious bad? Like being a predator, liking a children. Rudous did not get any consequences for any of those things and did not learn a single thing about those aspects. Only thing that changed from the beginning of the series to the end is rudious at the start of the series was a sad predator. At the end of the series he was a happy one. That's all that happened. He did not learn. The author with Michelle Potense is just trying to normalize this type of things because he's sick in the head. That's all that it is.",

Now, granted, she was just fighting. I think this clip is from when her and 17 were fighting trunks and Gohan. But, um, yeah, she had been, you know, roaming around in the streets a little bit. We've got this kind of asymmetrical part going on. We've got one side tucked behind the ears, the other side hanging over. I mean, it's still cute, but if I have to pick between her and 1717 just wins me over. Maybe it's the Libra in me, but I just like the symmetry here. I like the balance. This silk press is just unmoved and unbothered. Seventeen might need to share some of his products with 18. Or maybe that's just the look that 18 is going for. Nobody's wrong. We're just arguing preference. And feel free to drop your opinion in the comments.",

    "voice_to_text": "I am generally convinced people who defend Rudy's grarat from Ashoka Tensei have not read the novel. The reason why Rudy's got kicked out of his brother's house in the web novel was way worse. So basically what happened was Rudy's put a secret camera in his niece's, who was 10 years old, bathroom and recorded her taking a bath. And during his parents funeral, instead of attending the funeral like the rest of the family, what he was doing was beating to the recording of his niece when his brother found. What Rudius was doing after he returned from the funeral was what got him kicked out of the house in the first place. There is a reason why the author of Mushoku Tensei hides his face. Mushoku Tensei has some of the most yikes things I've ever seen, and there is no reason to defend it whatsoever. And this is not even the worst thing that Rudy's does. Like, I can make an entire series of just like, crimes that Rudy's does, which are just not acceptable whatsoever. When people say there's consequences to a lot of Rudy's actions, there is. There's not. There's like, really not any consequences. There's no learning from it, there's no redemption, none of. And it's not even just Rudius, these two. I can make an entire video on just both of them. And it's such a shame, because if the author was not sick in the head, I would recommend this novel The World Building power system, the Lord, the characters, everything is so well made and fleshed out, but it's all ruined by the author's sick fantasies.",

Before pouring my mixture onto it, I made sure to spread it as thin as I could. Thinner you get this batter, the crispier your corn flakes will turn out. And I popped it in the oven for about 15 minutes before pulling it back out and breaking up my pieces. At this point, it's still very soft, so it's easy to rip everything apart and get it into the shape and the size that you want. I was done ripping all of them up. I popped it back in the oven for about 50 minutes to an hour at a very low temperature. Once they were all cooled down and crispy, I poured my toddlers some cereal into their bowls. Today was a day that they wanted milk with their cereal, so I poured some milk on top, and their breakfast was done. I've been on a real cornflake kick lately, so this is very exciting for them.",

For me, I wanna focus on Shikamaru and the entirety of, like, the naraklan itself, but specifically, let's work with Shikamaru. Shikamaru's Nara clan has the ability of shadow manipulation jutsu. They're able to create and manipulate shadows. To an extent we see this. They're able to physically create shadows to strangle, physically create shadows, to puncture, to admit wounds, but also ordinarily be able to manipulate the shadows to control another person's ability of movement. This ability is. Is really good. It's really powerful ability. And when it comes to shadows, to be able to cast a shadow to literally take over the movements of another person's body, that. That's pretty dope. But I feel like Kishimoto never really extended on this. And there. There's an endless possibilities of what the naraklan should be capable one. Like, they should be shadow Masters, right? They should be able to summon shadows, possess shadows. There should be a shadow realm or a shadow dimension. As we saw in, um, the third hokage fight with Orochimaru, someone casted some form of a shadow based jutsu that sort of blinded the third hokage. They should be able to do this. Summon some form of realm or cloak of shadow and be able to have some sort of sight in, like, they should be masters of the night. They should Have summonings of like an owl. And they should be like an owl sage master of shadows. Like their act like their potential has never been reached. And it is crazy. Can you imagine if Shikamaru was a shadow based sage from like a I'll summoning? He could see at night. He could bring you to a shadow dimension. The where where the shadow possessions is even more crazy. And you can be stuck there in darkness forever. Like, I just wish that this would have been extended a lot more than it was. And I feel like the potential, if given, could be incredible. But you tell me, TikTok, who's an anime character that you believe, if given the opportunity, could be a lot more stronger than they are?

I mean, if you think about it that way they don't have to swap souls only twice a month, and Utah gains another teleportation technique. I think the reason why he didn't do it is mostly because always curse technique. Because swapping souls is not his curse technique, it's curse technique reversal. There has to be some sort of extra requirements that we don't know about Utah's curse just yet. Because honestly, tell me right now what could have stopped Utah from just taking a little bite out of everybody here and getting all their curse techniques? And that way he just becomes like some sort of super Utah bro. And he also beat kinjaku and ghetto. So what's stopping this man from collecting all the curse technique? Like some Pokemons, man? Now my intellectuals will tell you that curse techniques are only 5 per brain, but Utah over here got a U Haul extra storage handling unit because Rica can hold everything. And yeah, most of his curse techniques were also found in the domain expansion, so maybe it's limiting to his domain expansion which techniques is able to use. But yeah, have a good day.",

I think that this comment has brought up an interesting question, and it's a question that I've been thinking about since the reveal that the one piece world is sinking into the sea. What do we think that actually mean? Is the land going down or is the sea going up? Because technically, both of those scenarios could be described as the world sinking into the sea. And depending on which scenario it is, both the cause and the solution to that problem could be radically different. If the world is sinking, as in the islands themselves are going down, then that probably means there's something wrong with the inside of the one piece planet. But if the world is sinking because the sea level is rising, and that means either the water is all being displaced by something, or more water is coming from somewhere, both are extremely different problems with extremely different solutions. I am super fascinated to see what people think about this. Do you guys think the world is sinking as in the islands are going down, or do you think the world is sinking as in the sea level is going up?",

Let's hop into the starting off Inner Species reviewers. An anime that released on Funimation. They had a full dub cast and then they actually realized what this anime was and removed it from the platform. It's hilarious, it's great, and oh my god doesn't have a lot of plot. Then we have the Testament of Sister New Devil if you like high school DXD. This is basically a high school DXD clone, except it's better animated. Then we have date alive. This just released a season 5. I'm enjoying the living hell out of it. It's great. Kurumi's best girl. If you disagree with me, you are actually wrong. How does it feel to be wrong? Is that crazy to me? Like crazy, bro. And then we have Trinity 7. This main character actually is willing to do things. It's absolutely crazy. On top of it having good action scenes, good animation, and actual good character development. This anime is a hidden gem that not a lot of people talk about. But you know what's even Wilder than these anime though? Something that actually had my mouth gaping for a little bit. Bro. Junior High School DXD. They are confirming a spin off of high school DXD called Junior High School DXD and honestly I feel like whoever's reading this, they Need to check the hard drives of these people bro. But that's just my opinion. Follow the YouTube.",

So we've got second coming of Broly versus Super Saiyan Vegeta. Now, if you remember, the second coming of Broly takes place at the beginning of the boo arc, while this Vegeta, I'm assuming, is at the very end of the boo saga. Actually, I think that's Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. Yeah, that looks like Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta. The Lightning is what kind of gives that away. I just didn't notice that at first. So who would win? Broly or Vegeta? And it's Vegeta. The same Vegeta that went toe to toe with Kid Buu. Granted, he didn't do very much, but he withstood most of his attacks. Only on the other hand, went up against a weaker version of Goku. Gohan and Goten. Granted it took their combined power to beat him, but at the end of the day, this version of Vegeta would be stronger overall. That final explosion against Majin Buu. Arguably much stronger than a family Kamehameha. Not to mention with the power output with Vegeto and everything, he's infinitely stronger than Broly. Now, I'm not saying that Vegeta plays a part in this, but the fact that Vegeta was able to toy with Buhon goes to show that Vegeta, being one part of Vegeta, was strong enough to do so.

It does. It very much does. Whether you like to believe it or not, animation is a huge reason as to why people start watching a series. A big reason why anime such as Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen are so popular is because of their insane animation production. Now, I'm not trying to say that the only reason why they're popular is because of their animation, but you cannot deny that good animation plays a big role in boosting a series of popularity. For example, Boruto had one episode where they had phenomenal animation, and this episode was enough to spark back a wave of popularity into the Boruto series. Imagine how popular a series like Boruto or even My Hero Academia would be if they had the same level of animation as another series like Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen. So many more people would be watching these series if they had insane animation. So yeah, people really can't deny how big of a role animation plays in anime.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think my biggest problem with the Dragon Ball franchise is really the fact that in Dragon Ball Z Kai final chapters, it should have become about Gohan. Like anything after that should have been about Gohan. He should have been the new main character. Mind you, I have no problem with his character and how he turned out. It's been obvious since he was first introduced as a child that he wasn't gonna be a fighting, loving saying like Goku. But we should have seen that struggle first hand as him being our new main character. I love Goku, but we've enjoyed Goku for decades. It was time to move on. What's the point building up all this hype and cell saga, talking about Gohan being able to surpass his father, and then he just never does it. As he was stronger than Goku and them at the end of Cell Saga, but anything past that, he became one of the weakest members again. Yeah, yeah, I know. That new movie, he got like that. That beast form or whatever this shit was called. But it's such a cop out, such a clear fucking cash grab. It doesn't make up for the fact that he just got hold. Cell Saga was the perfect introduction to our new lead and they said, fuck it, we're going back to Goku. And if I'm being honest, if they had switched it and made it to where, okay, Gohan was the first one. To achieve super saying, god, that would have been so beautiful. The new protector of earth. And you can't say it's impossible to move from one main character to the next, cause we've seen shows do it. JoJo successfully changes main characters every goddamn season. And you don't even see the new main character in the preview season. They just get introduced in that new season first episode. Hey, maybe that's just me.",

Because Obito can create the portal to Kamui wherever it is that he wants. So, unfortunately, that's just not true. And I think this guy is confusing Obito's calm way with the calm way that Kakashi has. Obito's calm way allows him to be intangible to certain parts of his body, or his entire body into the calm way dimension. However, for him to drag other people into the calm way dimension, he has to make contact with them. We've seen this multiple different times. And this even how you're able to counter him. As we learn from Minato, whenever he grabs Matto's hand, he's able to try to transport him to the calmly dimension, but Minato teleports away. In order to do this, he must be fully solidified. Which is why whenever Minato actually speed blitzed him, he was so fast, he couldn't react and put himself into the Kamui dimension. So unlike Kakashi, who would try to put a Kamui right over Gojo's head, Obito simply can't do this. Without the ability to actually touch Gojo, he then can't put him into the Calmway dimension. So Obito's version of Calmway cannot bypass Gojo's infinity. Neither can Kakashi's. That's a video for another time.",

Krillin would unironically defeat every single vulture by including end of series Mark by himself. The vulturemites are incredibly powerful inside of the invincible universe, but we're talking about Dragon Ball, where they are just significantly faster and significantly stronger in every single regard. In order to destroy a planet, Omni Man needed the help of two other vulture mites and needed the planet's core to be attacked by a laser that was able to penetrate through the entire thing to make it unstable and weakened in the first place. And he still didn't even blow up the entire planet. He just attacked the core, leading to the planet's destruction. Whereas all the way back in original Dragon Ball Z characters that Krillin is significantly stronger than now could destroy planets with relative ease. I mean, I don't think anyone's gonna sit here and say that Krillin currently is weaker than the Dragon Ball Z Vegeta that bowed Goku and it was threatening to blow up the entire planet. You don't even need to go as far as Krillin. They wouldn't even get past Yamcha.",

Let's talk about. For me, it absolutely hands down my opinion. For me, for what this anime has done personally, for me and my love for anime, it absolutely is Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I definitely believe these two anime are the precipice of the anime community to what it is today. When I first got on TikTok and start talking about anime or mentioning anything about anime, the majority of the videos that other creators were making was based on Naruto, and I think that helped propel this anime to a level that it hadn't seen before with social media. If you look at the Naruto hashtag, it's like billions and billions and billions and billions. I believe it's one of the highest hashtags on this app just simply because of how it's reciprocated within our community. This anime makes you cry, makes you smile, gives you hope, gives you belief that people are good out there, let you realize that you don't have to be the best in order to succeed, and absolutely shows you that you could have a terrible beginning. You can fail and fail and fail, but as long as you believe in yourself and believe in your goal and proactively work towards that and building yourself up, you can't obtain it. That's one of the Biggest feces anime. Teaches you across the board and I love that. Not to mention it's a dope ass anime and it's a great starter anime. It's a great. It's just a great anime overall, and I definitely think it transcends time as you see it collectively. Here is still here in 2024. But you tell me, TikTok, what is an anime that you believe will transcends time or possibly is one of the greatest anime of all time? You tell me. In second place for me is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Absolutely.",

    "voice_to_text": "I saw this post and it actually got me thinking. If Eisen successfully was able to beat Ichigo and went up to Soul Society to fight Squad Zero, what would have happened to him? I think this is a very accurate depiction of what would have happened if Eisen decide to go up. There's no way I can see this version of Aizen soloing the entirety of Squad Zero by himself. Now I understand. Aizen currently at this moment has the whole Goku, and the whole Goku would probably evolve throughout Aizen's fight with Squad Zero. However, I definitely think that they would be able to subdue Aizen before Aizen's Hogyoku evolves even further. Especially somebody like Ichibe. Ichibe was able to go toe to toe with yuhaw until yuhaw decide to absorb the powers of all the remaining Quincy. Aizen at this point in the story was not on that level. If we're talking about Thousand Year blood or Aizen, that is a whole different story. Because this version of Aizen would definitely probably be able to Solo Squad Zero. This. Aizen would get absolutely thrashed by the entirety of Squad Zero, and probably by Ichibe alone. It's a good thing Ichigo was able to stop Aizen in this moment, because Aizen would have gotten embarrassed if he went up.",

Dope has been beaten by Beerus. He's been being Nigerian. I doubt he could be any of the other gods of destruction. He's not stopping Zeno. Goku's not even top five and it's all verse. Who's your favorite anime character of all time? That. That's a tough one. Honestly, I got a shout out to my boy Black Star Patrol leader. Black Star is so underrated. People find him annoying. I think he just got that sauce. He's got that sauce. He's literally him. He got the different type of drip nobody got. First off, Soul Eater just got the best drip in all anime in my opinion. The music is gas. The music is gas, bro. I read the manga for Soul Eater, right? I wanna read those. Should I read it? Yes. Like the love that they get Blacksart in the manga.

Yo haters really be coping so bad because you know, Ichigo's soul is your favorite series so you have to make excuses about it. Oh cool about Naruto. He would give Naruto every single power in the building of the series. What is Ichigo? Ichigo has Shinigami Powers, Hollow Powers, and Quincy Powers. Quincy Powers that he doesn't use, by the way. Let's just forget that one. Naruto and Luffy are both worse, but again, y'all conveniently leave that out because y'all just don't wanna cope with Naruto. You have child of prophecy, the soul of an Otsutsuki with being the reincarnation of ashira. Throwing the reincarnation of a god in there. Not only being the jinchuriki of the strongest Biju, but also having the chakra of the strongest Biju literally in his DNA, having incredible chakra reserves as an uzumaki, being a perfect sage, having stage of six paths Chakra, and being the child of the literal hokage and the previous 9,000 Turkey. What are we actually talking about right now? And then you look at Luffy. The reincarnation of Joy Boy, the successor of Roger. Powers of the Sun God. The strongest devil fruit to exist from the clan of D with all forms of hockey. Like. What are we actually talking about right now? Just because bleach is the strongest in the Big Three and the best in the Big three doesn't mean you all have to cope this badly.",

    "voice_to_text": "Remakes are having a bit of a renaissance in anime at the moment. Their shows like Trigon Stampede, the new Rurouni Kenshin, Yuritsui Yatsura, Shaman, King Flowers. There's a bit of controversy going around a new remake that was just announced. The one piece. Now, the one piece is going to be a remake of one piece. One piece has already done a bunch of takes on this. You know, there's the original anime version, there's the manga version, there's a movie version of East Blue, and there's even been the recent live action Netflix adaptation which does East Blue. So this will be the fifth version of that story. Some people are like, why do we need to be doing this again? Isn't there better things that we could be spending budget and time and production on? They're just trying to play into this success that they're having to get more bang for their buck. But the dangers of doing something like that is if you just get too much one piece going on at once, you can kind of overwhelm the audience. You can burn people out. And that's not always the best approach.",

Details are out for chapter 11 14 of one piece, and we're finally gonna get to meet the original joy boy! This week's chapter is called The Wings of Icarus, and it will apparently start with Doctor Vega Punk continuing his broadcast and talking about the Void Century. He clarifies that he actually doesn't know much about this period in history, but he does tell us that 900 years ago, there was a man from the ancient kingdom known as Joy Boy. Had the power to stretch just like Luffy. But to be honest with you guys, I doubt we'll get much from Vega punk on Joy Boy outside of a few more vague remarks confirming information that we already knew about him and a few silhouettes. The least he could do is tell us what the fuck that giant straw hat locked in a freezing vault below the Holy Land is. But during this chapter, we will also apparently see the mother flame submerged underwater in a tank. And we will also get to see more reactions from people around the world to Doctor Vega Punk's message. But sadly, since we are getting Chapter 11 fourteen this week, that means we'll be on break next week. So stay tuned for more and cope harder!",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm confused. How is Code Geass a shojo? Now I understand the confusion because people use shonen, shojo, josei, and seinen to describe genres when they are just demographics. Basically, who is the target audience? Shonen just means that the target audience is adolescent boys. So basically young teenagers to young adults. Show Joe is the same thing, but for adolescent girls, and then say Nen is targeted towards adult men and Joe, Say, is targeted towards adult women. Typically, the easiest way to figure out what the target demographic is to a manga series is to just look at the magazine that it's released in. For example, anything released in Shonen Jump is clearly a shonen. However, Code Geassa Lucia the rebellion was released in Osaka Magazine, which is a Shojo magazine. The target audience for everything in this magazine is adolescent girls. But if you think of, like, the demographic and the genre as the same thing, it's gonna get really confusing, if I asked you to point out which one of these three is the seinen, I bet your first guess wouldn't be Apothecary Diaries. In case you're wondering, this series right here is called Queen's Quality, and this one is called Requiem of the Rose King. Those two are both Shojo, and they both fall into the genre of dark fantasy.",

Et oui, marie-joie c'est quand-m\u00eame \u00e0 10.000m d'altitude. Donc retrouvez 1 phare ici. On est d'accord, c'est 1 peu bizarre, \u00e7a n'a pas trop de sens.

Il nous avait dit que le monde de One Piece va sombrer dans la mer. Du coup on peut esp\u00e9rer 1 mont\u00e9e du niveau de la mer et pourquoi pas jusqu'\u00e0 10.000m d'altitude pour arriver jusqu'\u00e0 marie-joie. Du coup, la mer, elle arrive au niveau du ch\u00e2teau de pang\u00e9a, au niveau du redline, tout en haut. Et le phare, il peut effectivement \u00e9clairer tout ce qui se passe autour. Donc l\u00e0, oui, le phare, il aurait 1 int\u00e9r\u00eat. Et ce phare qu'on voit, je.

I'm so serious. That's the entire show. Solo leveling is kind of just like SAO for the modern anime kids. Oh my god guys, he's so cool and emo and mysterious and he has black hair! Nobody cares! The main character is mad annoying. He's like oh guys, I'm a little Thai anime boy, I can't do so much! And then he turns into like every emo kids fantasy of what they think they look like but in reality they look like. The show is based off this little manhwa, which apparently is a K pop manga, which I did not know existed until today. The manhwa actually looks pretty good, but I'm not gonna lie, I'm not reading all that. The animation overall looks kinda stiff to me. Kinda reminds me of those animes. In conclusion, the anime is just emo. Bland story, bad animation, and if you like it, I don't like you.",

We have A coming got killed which is an action in revenge anime that has a little bit of fantasy involved in it. And the main character kami is absolutely freaking goaded bro. But don't get attached to any of the characters. Goblin Slayer. The first episode will shock you, but if you're looking for a really good fantasy adventure anime then this is definitely one of the tops. About a guy that likes to kill a lot of goblins and there's some crazy stuff that happens. Definitely a little bit darker. Plastic Memories is a goaded romance anime, but it is a little bit of a tear jerker. So go into this prepared knowing that you will cry by the end of this. If you don't believe me, just watch it. Gravel Fireflies one of Studio Ghibli movies that is absolutely insane and it has a great storyline and honestly it's just overall a 10 out of 10 masterpiece. Freerun is adventure fantasy. They came out at the end of last year beginning of this year. If you're looking for something that's calm, slice of lifey, and it's literally side quests then this is a good one to watch. And it has action scenes that don't need to be as hard as they are. Jujutsu Kaisen. I'm pretty sure you've already seen ads for this everywhere bro, and everybody talks about it. Go sick Is one of the best mystery anime that you will ever watch in your life. It is a little bit older, the pacing is a little bit slow, but honestly it all you know comes together in a nice warm story. Grand Blue Dreaming is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my damn life. And RE0 is a really good psychological thriller anime if you can get over the fact that Subaru cries it over and over again. But honestly, the pain he goes through is absolutely wild.

    "voice_to_text": "What's the biggest anime that nobody talks about? Like an anime that has a massive following but the following doesn't talk about it? I think there's really only one correct answer to this question because like. Well, some people will be like oh, Inuyasha. If you know an Inuyasha fan, they will talk your ear off about this show if you even bring up the name. this was one of the most popular anime on earth for a couple of years and the fandoms all but disappeared. Though I will admit that another pretty good answer to this question is Sword Art Online. Let's be real. Like it or not, Sword Art Online has one of the biggest online followings out there. This is the isekai. They got a lot of people into isekai. Between not necessarily aging well and the middle seasons being okay ish, I find that as popular as this anime series is, it doesn't get talked about all that often. But genuinely, I feel like the only correct answer to this question is Gintama. I mean, Gintama was considered the fourth anime in the Big Three for like a decade. I mean, it had the incredibly unfortunate fate of running simultaneously with bleach one piece in Naruto, but still. One of the most popular comedies shown in anime of all time. And yet. Crickets.",

    "voice_to_text": "Never explicitly stated in the show, but if you pay attention, it's clear that these field trips are a massive secret, and the kids are actively helping hide it. But, Miss Frizzle, we can't let Mr. Junket know the bus is magic. He can't know what he can't see. But why? I could see why the producers are hiding the secret, but why are the kids in on it? Maybe it's just because they love the field trip so much, and they know that if the secret got out, they wouldn't be able to go on them anymore. But I think there might be something more going on here. In the very first episode of The Magic School Bus, Arnold brings his cousin Janet to visit his school, and she mentions that Arnold told her all about the field trips they go on. Arnold told me all about your family field trips, adorthean. What did he say? Look at their reactions to hearing this. They are terrified of someone else knowing the truth. Now, I've already shown you that clip of Arnold taking off his helmet and freezing in space, but I didn't show you why he did it. Throughout the entire episode, Janet is trying to collect proof to prove that she went to space. in order to convince Janet not to bring back incriminating evidence, Arnold does this. There's no way I'm going home without my stuff. It's proof. Nobody will believe me without it. Janet, you Want proof? I'll give you proof. Here's proof. A little happy. You. You stay here with your stuff. I don't know. Arnold is more afraid of Janet exposing their secrets than taking off his helmet in space. What could these kids possibly be so afraid of happening if the truth got out? Well, in Season 1, episode 11, we actually do get to see what da thinks would happen if her old teacher found out about their field trips. Um, Mister C flat, I'd like you to meet. Take chances, make mistakes. Get messy. Oh, we never did anything like this at our old school. Holy shit! It's Miss Frizzle! They're all afraid of Miss Frizzle. Miss Frizzle may seem like this quirky, fun, eccentric teacher, but she is constantly manipulating these kids into being afraid and totally obedient. In Episode 2, Arnold asked Miss Frizzle if he could skip the field trip. Miss Frizzle, I'd really love to go on a field trip, but. But I've got this weird feeling. Well, Arnold, I do need a volunteer to stay behind. She casually says he could stay behind, but then, without telling him, they shrink down.",

Tell me how to thaw him out so I can hold him. #mdni #rec #recommended #goviral #mentalhealthfyp #mentalhealthtiktok #viral #foryoupage #fyp #anime #manga #goth #kinkyaf #actuallyautistic #autistictiktok #autistok #chubby #chubbygirl #chubbygoth #gothfyp #cosplayfyp #bpd #gothautistic #autisticgothgirl #trending #gametok #autisticgamer #GamerGirl #gothtok #gothtiktok #autisticcosplayer #disabledandkinky #autisticadult #supportautisticcreators #kittyspallaisreal #kittyspalla #kittyspallabsg #izanamispalla #namichangaming #namisnomnoms #narrationsbynami #mentallyill #supportdisabledcreators #overwatchme #borderlinepersonalitydisorder #egirl #emo #emogirl \u00a0 #germanitaliangirl \u00a0 #greyandrosexual #pagan \u00a0 #scoliosis \u00a0 #novemberscorpio #disabledcosplayer #albino #albinism #autisticalbino #gothalbino #qinkfyp #adultfyp #disabledalbino #clusterb #gothmodel #autisticmodel #southafricabased #lupus #fibromyalgia #disabilitytok #disabledtok  #disability #disabled #disabilitytiktok #disabledtiktok #videogame #videogamer #cptsd #chronicpain #chronicillness #neurodivergent \u00a0 #audhd #semiverbalautistic #autism #polyglot #autismawareness #autismacceptance #autisticcreator #autisticcontentcreator #autisminwomen #gothic #gothictok #gothtiktok #pastelgoth #adhd #tism \u00a0 #lupuswarrior #lupustiktok #lupustok #multilingual #spinalstenois #osteoarthritis #plussize #plussized #plussizedcosplayer #plussizedartist #plussizedautistic #plussizedmodel #freelancemodel #lumbarstenois \u00a0\u00a0 #supportdisabledcreators #disabledlivesmatter #disabilityrights #disabilityfyp #autismfyp #lupusfyp #ambulatorymobileaiduser #MentalHealth #bpdawareness #disabilityawareness \u00a0 #traumatok #bpdandautism \u00a0 #itstheableismforme \u00a0 #bpdacceptance \u00a0 #bpdgirl #autismandbpd #autismandbpdoverlap \u00a0 #autismandbpdawareness \u00a0 #mentalhealthtok #disabledwoman #clusterbpersonalitydisorder \u00a0 #traumatised \u00a0#Autitsickinkster #gothkinkster #bpdfyp #autismfyp #autisminfemales #autisminwomen #autistictrauma #bpdtrauma #quietborderline #quietbpd \u00a0 #mentalhealthmatters #manicdepressivedisorder #generalisedanxietydisorder #mentalhealthmatters #heartbreak #heartbroken #flirtingischeating #theresalwaysanothergirl #imyourgoofball #hesignoringmeagain #hechanged   ",

    "voice_to_text": "What live action show would work in anime format if they went all in? Now, going all in means you need a big studio, you need animation to be on point, you need voice acting, you need plot. All of these things could work if you took a live action and you made it an anime. But you have to commit. So what is this show? The supernatural series. I love this show. This is one of my favorite shows ever. Supernatural is a show about two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester. They go around fighting monsters. They eventually end up fighting Angels, Demons, stopping the apocalypse. It sounds very anime. Now, if we gave this to a studio and made them commit to making it, well, I think we could do this and it would be a hit. I know supernatural kind of had an anime done already, but there was no love in that. There was no love in that supernatural anime. Let's make it better. All right, let's commit. We're gonna get Jensen Ackles, we're gonna get Jared Padalecki to revoice themselves. Actually, you can bring the whole cast back to voice themselves. But we need to go all in on animation. We're gonna have to read adapt the story a little bit. Well, you have Angels, Demons, monsters. Two brothers fighting them all. There's a little bit of sexual chemistry, a dash of BL. And you have a hit anime on your hands, ladies and gentlemen. We gotta do this with love. Don't just be like, oh, this is kind of anime, let's halfheartedly make an anime of it. No, we gotta go all in. This could be a hit as an anime. But you tell me what you guys think.",

Then he said that the reason that he went back. What got him killed. Was that he needed to confirm some. You needed to confirm what? Even the information that he ended up sending back to the village was of no help. Why? Because shizune figured out when she did the autopsy on the main. Oh shit. The receivers again. Chakra from somewhere else. So that means somebody's controlling the pains. Jiraiya sent the body back. But when he got that body of pain that he was gonna send back. Send back to Tsunade for the all time. He was in the told. He could have left. Agato isn't there? Yeah. Cause none of them look like Nagato. Yeah.

And there's a good reason for that. It's a way better looking color that you can literally match with anything, and honestly, you can never really go wrong with it. Now, I'll admit I do own some things that are black, because there is the rare occasion that something will look better in black, but that is very rare. For example, something like my bed frame. This just makes more sense to be in black. And I think it contrast my white bed sheets pretty well, because if literally everything was white, it would be pretty overwhelming. But that doesn't apply in this case, because as you can see, I decided to purchase some white item frames. I mean, picture frames. This isn't Minecraft. And along with some nice photos of a concrete wall, I'm hoping these will breathe a little bit more life in my. And for where I'm putting them, it's right here on this wall. Now, I know this is where I put these in my last apartment, but honestly, I really did like the way it looked. And fortunately for me, the layout of my new bedroom is very similar to my last, so I have no problem putting these right back where they belong.",

I talked a lot of shit last chapter, but I'm not gonna take it back because I still think Yuji's gonna prevail. Gay guys just trying to show Sakuna's full potential. I don't know. What the fuck is this domain? What is going on? What is this? So we find out that Yugi ate his brothers. Theory confirmed. Which means Yuji can convert CE into blood and his CE output is crazy. And we find out Yuji does have soul swapping. Theory confirmed. Remember how Yuji said that he cheated? Essentially, when he swaps souls with someone, he can only do it twice in a month. He basically has their experience imprinted on his body, if that makes sense. So he swapped with Kusakabe and now he knows simple domain and shit. So Yuji is not cooked because he used simple domain? What the fuck is this? Anyway, sakuna cannot maintain his domain for a long amount of time. So Sakuna's domain only last for 99 seconds. But all of my faves are trapped in there because of course they are. And Choso is concerned for his little brother because he's yelling after Yuji, just stay alive, please, Yuji! Simple domain breaks and he gets attacked! His fucking foot! It's fine because he has RCT, so I guarantee you his foot will be back. And just when I thought it was over. Oh, There's a break next week, but I don't think they're cooked. Because either sukuna is aiming that error at Yuji and then chose is gonna jump in front of him trying to save his little brother. Which I hope doesn't happen because I love Choso. Or whoever that second person Yuji swapped with in that month. That's gonna come in handy because they haven't revealed who else he swapped with.

I've seen this one before, but on a whim I decided to rewatch it like a couple days ago and I just finished it and I can truly say this is probably my favorite anime as of now. I've always been into slice of life animes, um, but this one doesn't take anything over the top. There's no super depressing sadness or death or anything like that. It's just a wholesome, um, 12 episodes of daikichi taking care of Rin and learning how to be a father and her accepting him as a part of her life. And that's just like, really good.

It was them and otensei the resurrected forced to serve him over and over and over again to simply detonate themselves with what? That's hand on Paper Bomb Jutsu. After what?

Comic Book just posted an article saying Studio PRTS is Boruto seasonal return. Oracle says that it's been a hot minute since the world saw Boruto Uzumaki take on a small screen. This was back in March 2023 when they put a cap on his first half. Now all the eyes are set on the future. But now we finally got some information that the team is eager to restart the series seasonally. This was revealed in an in depth interview with the president of Studio Period. Right here it says, I think it's great making one project for a long period of time, which period is done so far, but at the same time, large budgets is scheduling costs involve big risk. Essentially, what I'm picking up from this is that they use bleach to practice the seasonal approach, and they like the result. So now they're gonna use it on Boruto when other animes under studio period. Do y'all understand what this means for Boruto, Bro? We're finally gonna get the quality we deserve for the series. And it's gonna be for the best part of the series. Barto 2 Blue Vortex has been 100,000 times better than the original Barto. And now we finally getting what we deserve production wise. We're taking over, fellas, you've been here this whole time? I know you feel good, bro. I know you feel good. We stayed here when it was hard.",

Let\u2019s start off strong\u2026 I'm actually graduating at the top of my class. I finished my time at college with a 4.0 GPA. I double majored and double minored and I'm also gonna be graduating with departmental honours which is not something that anyone else in my graduating class is graduating with. And now you might be thinking, \u201cEducation and English aren't particularly impressive majors\u201d but considering my background I think they are. I am the daughter of two immigrants; I'm a first generation college student and English isn't even my first language. My first language is actually Hungarian. I attended my institution on a full tuition merit scholarship and while I was there I was a very active member of our community as well. I was on the executive board for multiple clubs, I was in various leadership positions, and I also worked multiple jobs on campus which is how I was able to afford my collection. I did block out my name and the name of my institution cause I don't need y'all knowing that but here are just some of the awards that I've won in recognition for my involvement and my leadership. I finished my requirements a semester early after my study abroad in Hungary so right now I'm working full time at my karate school where I'm a first degree black belt but I do have a job lined up at my college after graduation as an admissions counselor which is very exciting because it's in my field.",

    "voice_to_text": "One generation has to go. Who are you cutting? The legendary Big Three, the old Big Three, the middle Big Three, or the new generation Big Three? We need to talk about something real quick. People throwing big Three around like nothing. There's no old generation big three. There's no new big three. There's no middle big three. There's no old big three. There is just one big three. And there's, like, one caveat. But it's not even like an impact of big three. It's just three shows that came out together. And we'll get into that in a second. But the Big Three consists of Naruto, bleach, and one piece. Three anime that dropped around the same time that blew up worldwide and drew western audiences to the genre of anime. That's why it's called the Big Three. These three cannot be touched when it comes to big three. You wanna talk about big three? You talking about these three? Dragon Ball is not in the big three. It never has and it never will be. Dragon Ball is the godfather of the big three. Dragon Ball is what made people think a western audience could love anime. They were right. We loved it. It was worldwide then. These three came at the same time and have dominated ever since. That's why they're the big three. And there's the Dark Trio. Now, these three aren't a big three. They're just not. They're called the Dark Trio because, again, three Anime that came out around the same time that have similar themes are called the Dark Trio because they dove into darker themes. They are darker themes shown in anime. You have demons, devils, darker things that you wouldn't see in a normal shonen, which is why they're called the Dark Trio. No one saying that the impact of the big three. It's just three shows, three manga that came out around the same time that have similar themes. That's it. So if you wanna talk about what the best big three is, it's this one, because it's the only big three.",

    "voice_to_text": "Kung Fu Panda Exact says that Hollywood is at a loss about anime successes. Hollywood should not be at a loss at why anime is so successful. It is a very simple answer. Because the only thing that anime creators care about is telling a good story, giving their characters proper growth, proper arcs, cool action, funny moments, things that their audience wants. They know their audience, and they give their audience what they want. So Hollywood should not be confused about this, because yet again, it's very, very simple. It's like business 1:01. Okay, when you're starting any kind of business, what is your job as a business? Just in general? Your job as a business is to please your consumer. So your consumer gives you money, which then makes the business, what, everyone? Profit. So I don't understand how this is so mind boggling to Hollywood. It's just that Hollywood is so caught up in their own little bubble that they, like, forgot, like, hey, us, we. We right here. You have to please us. We're the ones giving you money. You don't please us, you're not getting any money. They are pleasing us, so they are getting our money. There's a reason why anime and manga is beating out American animation and beating out American comic books by, like, a lot, mind you, not like, by a little margin, by a lot. Specifically in the comic book, like, you know, area. It is insane. Manga is destroying American comic books. And this is for a very simple reason. Because, again, manga, anime, all they care about is giving us fans what we want. And that is entertaining, fun stories with good characters, good arcs, great moments, heartbreaking moments, moments that make us cheer. Like they're just. They. All I care about is the story. You know what Iger was saying about Disney a little while ago? Like, we got to focus on storytelling, not messaging. That's all manga ever does is like, this is a cool story. Is it gonna be fun? Are they gonna like it? Okay, yes. Okay, then make it like that. Simple. So simple. This is not rocket science, people. There's no reason why Hollywood should be confused about anime success, or even manga. Because, again, the answer is simple. Just make it entertaining, good stories, all we want.",

And the one a lot of people don't seem to recognize, this is Rusty Rose from fairytale. Now the weakest. Look, you can put it somewhere between the bottom two. Luffy is outright stronger, you know, physically, but his imagination or overall Tune Force abilities are basically low tier versus Rusty Rose. He's not as physically strong, but he has better imagination abilities cause he's able to manifest anything that know, he's able to think of. But the tear stuff that he was, you know, manifesting through his ability wasn't as strong as Grammys. And basically the stuff that he was able to manifest and effect did have somewhat of a limit. Like of course he was able to, you know, change his no hand to a like a giant cloth thing, manifest different swords, different abilities, raise a giant tower, make golden Shields, you know, stuff like that. He was able to do that, but the tear things he was able to do doesn't compare to the stuff Grimmie was able to do. So, you know, those two will be at the bottom and in Arthur 2nd, because his imagination does have the limit of basically revolving around himself. But nobody's been able to do the imagination things Grimmy has done. Grimmy. You know what this imagining a pocket of space, you Know, making meteors drop in, turning people physically into cookies. Like grandma was able to imagine whatever you wanted. So from weakest, strongest is one of the bottom two, then the other one of the bottom two. Arthur 2nd. Grimmy first. Simple.",

    "voice_to_text": "So Sierra Leone is declaring an emergency after addicts are digging up graves to get high on a drug made from human bones. So for those of you don't know, Sierra Leone is on the west coast of Africa, and they are currently facing an epidemic where there's a drug called Kush that being used all over and manufactured partly by using human bone. This is causing people to come rob graves and steal the bones of buried people. Apparently the drug is pretty cheap to manufacture, just requires one specific ingredient that requires people to steal bones from old cemeteries, in which case the government has actually had to beef up security at cemeteries to stop this problem. And this drug creates sort of a hypnotic high, as ones would describe. They said this drugs first started being produced around six years ago in their country. And the epidemic of users and the increase in grave robberies has skyrocketed since. The doctors are also seeing an increase of around 4,000% of deaths due to organ failures, which is a direct result of this drug use.",

On top of the director being Eli Roth, who, like I said, was a very outspoken Zionist and who condemned a man for saying that genocide is bad at the Oscars. The film also stars Jamie Lee Curtis, who herself is as well as shameless Zionist. And it's just not something that I'm interested in giving any life to or giving my money to or supporting in any way. Now, obviously, I'm not gonna tell you what to do. If you wanna watch the movie, go right ahead, I don't care. But I'm just trying to give you the relevant information here as it pertains to the ongoing genocide that we are currently in, as it relates to the media that we consume. And if you wanna show saw small support, like just the minuscule, the bare minimumist of support, and at the very least, not supporting the people that are actively supporting this genocide, then you have a choice to do that by not watching this film.",

Especially when it's comparing goat to goat, and especially when it's a super long running series. So in the Naruto versus one piece debate, people always bring up the fact that one piece has more sales, but it has more sales because it has more volumes. You have to look at sales per volume, right? If I have one book with 1,000 sales, and you have 1,000 books with one sale, you can't say that we're both equally successful. That's the same logic here. So just taking sales in a vacuum and saying that one piece has surpassed Dragon Ball or one piece that surpassed Naruto because it has more sales and just looking that in a vacuum is completely and utterly disingenuous. And even when you look at digital sales because it's 2024. Digital sales are a thing. Boruto is absolutely carrying tuition digital sales. And even further substantiate how little manga sales means when you're looking at it in a vacuum with a zero context. Demon Slayer has more sales per volume than Dragon Ball, Naruto, and one piece. But it would be absolutely asinine to suggest that Demon Slayer is more successful than all these other series. So stop using manga cells as an argument is a dumb argument.",

Because you only get this night once a year. You have a connection with the creator of the heavens and the earth, and last night we finished the Quran. You can hear everybody, like, mumbling their personal dies. And you can hear some. Some people are making god for Palestine. Some people are making god get married. Some people are making god for good grades. I'm personally there to get a good performance review so I can go to Jenna. But tell me why the guy next to me is bawling his eyes out. He's crying, his heart is on the floor. And I'm wondering, what could he be asking for? Should I be. I should be making this style, like the. He probably has some connection with a law that I can't even dream of having. Just put my hands out for a second. I listen in and I just hear, oh, no. Homicides. Gojo. This guy was asking for Gojo to come back for the 27 night. His number one priority was making sure Gojo came back. So if last night was later called her, it is not Gojo over. It is not Gojo over. Gojo is coming back, confirmed.",

Sakuna would get embarrassed and it wouldn't even be close. I don't think people understand how factual this is, all right? Like Mordecai and Rigby would win this fight. So fucking simple. Like, no. Let me show you. Let me show you how easy this would be. Back in the hey and era, my dinner used to come on plates, not on their feet. 5, 6, 7, 8. You don't fucking exist! And let's just assume that the keyboard doesn't work out. How is sakuna gonna deal with the baby ducks? No no no. Y'all think I was joking here, all right? These motherfuckers are actually universal level. You can literally microwave a clock and then throw said microwave at sakuna. Right, so sakuna is gonna get passed through the time stream, and the moment that he lets hold that microwave at all during that, he's just gonna get disintegrate, make the death corn dough sandwich and shove it in sakuna stomach mouth. In order to surpass sakuna and regular Show, all you need is shorts and a fucking movie. And god forbid Benson says beat Sakuna or you're fired, right? It's raps for him if that happens. But cameraman. How is Mordecai and Rigby gonna be Fuga bro? They can eat breath mints and freeze everything around them The fire would probably freeze. Probably. It's not a competition. There's not a thing that you can say to convince me that this was a debate in the first place. Okay, so, like, sakuna absolutely gets folded. And by the way, if you haven't yet, go subscribe to the YouTube channel. The link is in the bio. Thank you in advance.",

Like why does no one else seem to like, take an issue with these motherfuckers obsession with little girls? Like the whole concept of Lolly in general just makes my skin Itchy Man. Like is no one else find that shit weird as hell? And before you weird ass lolly loving kid touches coming to the comments talking about some well if they're actually 3,000 years old, then they're actually not children. Motherfucker, you need to be investigated. And all the dumbass technicalities that these motherfuckers use to try and skirt around a clearly obvious little girl's age by just like, magically making that bitch like 32,000 years old is genuinely wild as shit. Like these fucking EDP 4 4 5 will literally show a six year old child get given ferocious fucking back shots going 137 miles per hour. But it's magically okay because turns out that little girl is actually 127,000 years old. Yeah my ass. More like 127,000 fucking terabytes. Like what are you talking about? And then these fucking kid dealers will also try to make the case that it's okay because it's just pictures and drawings. Oh yeah motherfucker, welcome to the James Charles under 18 Club. You're a VIP member. And what's even worse is that that's just not even true anymore because these motherfuckers in Japan Are starting to make lolly in real life. Like these fucking weirdos who made this Japanese AV video where they hired an 18 year old actress to play as a 12 year old school girl when she gets fucked by her teacher. The fuck? Why? And what makes this shit even worse is that you can buy this shit in like literally almost every store in Japan. Like there are 18+ sections in like certain gas stations. No, fucking insane that is. You could be going in, just wanted to get a yogurt, and you'll look to the side and there will be about three gross motherfuckers just in that section just ferociously beating their meat while looking at little children. Also, I do these motherfuckers have zero shame at all too. Imagine the embarrassment you feel when you have to open that curtain up and walk out the 18+ section holding a lolly hand tight in your fucking hand. And you have to walk over to the cashier and hand that shit to him with cash in hand. Are you serious? Well, I don't know about you, but if I'm that cashier, I'm fucking fighting you. Like, I don't wanna start any beef, but like, you're telling me that's not a reason? Like, maybe we should send nuke number three? Fuck it. Oh, but hey, at least Japan has good technology.",

Why would you argue it's ace? I think people are blinded by the fact that Itachi is such a great character that they don't see motherfucker killed his whole clan and his parents for his brother. No, it wasn't for his brother. He kept his brother alive for his brother. He killed the clan for the Lee Village. Could I would argue Luffy is a better brother than Ace? Valley! Valley! Valley! Valley! I think Itachi has done a lot of things too. Take Sasuke. He's done a lot of things to keep Sasuke out of harm's way, but he's also done a lot of things to mentally torture Sasuke. So I think whatever ace does outweighs the good that Itachi did because he's done so much more bad. Ace hasn't done nearly as many bad to Luffy as Itachi has done to Sasuke. I don't think ace has done anything bad, whereas Itachi has mentally fucked Sasuke up to the point where he wanted to destroy the Leaf Village even after he found out the truth. He killed both his parents. He killed the rest of his clan. He made him an orphan. It shows in Boruto. Now there is no one left for him to connect with in terms of his bloodline. You know, realistically, Sasuke, his personality wouldn't be like that. So cold hearted all the time if it wasn't for Itachi. If Itachi didn't do the things that he did, I would be saying Itachi clear. No, no. But this motherfucker has been more bad than good for Sasuke. He put Sasuke in a genjutsu for I think 72 hours of him just reliving his parents dying. What the fuck? To strengthen them. To make them stronger. Ace. I don't see none of that. Ace died to strengthen Luffy. Fuck it! Yeah, you wanna talk about that? Ace died to strengthen Luffy.",

Got a gaming laptop, two 32 inch gaming monitors, 55 inch 4K gaming TV, fully loaded gaming PC. Got the Corsair headsets. That's all I ever use. Got the two picks on deck. Mac mini and one, not one, but two. 61% keyboard at the Hyperx mic. Another two. 32 inch gaming monitor, 55 inch 4K gaming monitor. What? An Xbox X? I mean, not to mention my other gaming setup, which is pretty much just a lounge for gaming. You know, I'm saying, read books, even though I got an extensive library over here. So, you know, stitch this video and, you know, show me your gaming setup or tell me what you think about mine. You know, I'm saying, let's. Let's try that today.",

And as Kai and speed are walking in, they see sneakio but completely disregard his existence. And ever since that moment, he has not stopped crying. He's like, oh, I thought we were friends and blah, blah, blah. Bro, you are a brand. Risk high and speed are living one in 100 million lives. Everybody around them is set for life. Look at what Kai did for Ray. Their families and the people who work for them are set. You think that they would jeopardize that running around with you? Exactly what I'm telling you. What happened with Kai happened with Charles Barkley at the same event. There's a women's division in that slap boxing event, and Charles Barkley said that he wasn't a fan of it because he didn't want to see women slapping each other. Sneaky oh goes on to say, women belong in the kitchen. And Charles Barkley's heart drops, and he's like, oh, I don't wanna get fired if you don't know this dude. Charles Barkley has hella sponsorships. His show on TNT is going crazy. Sneaky oh put that all in jeopardy to try to just be edgy and funny. People think that Kai and speed are goofy and stupid. They already knew the situation that they would get placed in being around Him and they just moved tact. Sneaky old blackballed himself and he's mad that people don't wanna be blackballed as well. You already drew the line. Stay on that side, buddy.",

    "voice_to_text": "Drake has officially responded to Kendrick Lamar's diss. That's right. Just in case you guys haven't seen it, Drake has just posted to his Instagram with this photo in the caption I'm picking up I'm in Turks little baby. This is obviously a response to Kendrick Lamar's diss and just everybody in the industry going against Drake right now and he's just telling us that he's not gonna respond. He's busy. We also need to remember that Drake is on tour currently with Lil Wayne, so I don't think we're gonna see a diss track coming from Drake anytime soon. Now what's funny about all this is that the post that Drake just made, he actually quoted NAV lyric, but NAV just unfollowed Drake on Instagram. And it makes a lot of sense because NAV and Metro Boomin go a long way back and they've made a lot of music together. So this is just another person that's turning their back on Drake and they're joining Team Metro. If you guys think that was worse. Metro Boomin also recruited Playboi Carti on his team. And now Carti's going up against Drake because Metro Woman posted this photo with him, future, and Carti and in the caption it says going against us and you gonna lose. Low key I feel really bad for Drake because the fact that Metro Boomin is not recruiting Playboi Carti, he's recruiting NAV, he's recruiting future. All these people, this huge alliance against Drake, it's just Not fair. The rap media outlets are also anti Drake right now cause as you can see, one of the biggest rap podcasts in the world, Joe Biden, said that Drake shouldn't even reply to the Kendrick Lamar dis and he said he could sit this out. This ain't even for him. Honestly, if I'm in Drake's position, I wouldn't even respond at this point because there's too many people that are against him. Because also, if you guys missed it, Rick Ross also turned his back on Drake after being exposed that he talks bad about Drake. He's been racist towards Drake, talked bad about his family. And this is another reason why he was actually on the Metro album and it just keeps going on and on and on. Because Travis Scott actually a few days ago before this album even came out, he wanted future and Metro Woman to play this diss track that Kendrick made at Rolling Loud. So Travis is also anti Drake. This rap Civil War is actually insane. So let me know whose team are you guys are and you guys on Team Future, Team Drake? Who do you guys think is gonna get recruited? Next to both teams, who do you guys think is gonna come out on top? I love Drake, I love Metro, Boomin, I love future, I love all these guys, but from the looks of it, team Metro's winning right now. I don't know what Drake's gonna do. But any other information that's gonna come out on this beef, I'm gonna let you guys know. So make sure you guys stay followed.",

I like to call this manga collection speed running. Cause you'll see people get into manga collecting after a month, two months, three months with hundreds of volumes and thousands of dollars spent. And a lot of the time like 5% of those volumes have been read. Manga collecting is not a competition. You're not trying to have a better collection than the next guy. Take it slow, buy the series you like, buy series you wanna read. But you don't have to go crazy dropping bands on manga right after getting into collecting.",

The red goes in there. Now the purple. Okay, the purple hit the pink and we lost. Okay, bad start. Well, let's try again. Okay. Hmm. What do we wanna start with? Maybe we start with the yellow. So the yellow goes into the correct spot, then the blue goes into the correct spot. Nice. So we got them two sorted. Now that gives room for the purple to go through. No, it hit the yellow one. Right. One last try. Here we go. Okay, um, what do we start with? Maybe we start with the. It must be the yellow. We have to start with the yellow. Or maybe do it at the same time. No, you don't, cause then they hit each other. What do you start with? I'm so confused. Like, look around. Where do you start? Surely this is just genuinely impossible, even Though I made it and I know it's not. Ha ha ha! Well, I've come back for one last try. It's like 20 minutes later. I'm not even trolling, and I am not allowing myself to fail. What do we start with? Do we start with the pink? No! Ah, it's so annoying. Like, I know I made this, but I forgot how to do it. Blue, blue, blue, orange, yellow, pink, pink, red, green, purple. There we go. What do I hear? I hate the pink again. It's impossible. It's actually impossible.

Just rub me the wrong way to where by the time you get to the second or third season, you're not watching this show for her. Let's be real. Reason everyone watches the show is because of these four right here. Next is gotta be Peyton from one Tree Hill. Listen, I am a one Tree Hill stand. I am a 90s kid. But Peyton, I'm Team Brooke all the way. We get it, you're the emo girl. You hate everything about the world cause your mom tragically passed away. But that makes no excuse that she is easily the worst friend of all time. She's constantly me, me, me. Doesn't give a shit about any of her friends. Team Brooke all the way. And last, but certainly not least is Ted Mosby from how I met your mother. This man, throughout the entire of the show, claims that he just wants to find true love. But at every turn during the show, just constantly makes excuses and whines about every last thing. So by the time you get to the end of the show, you don't give a fuck how we found love.

What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Meliodas and fun. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? The moment when Teen Gohan goes Super Saiyan 2 and does the command mayor to kill cell. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? This isn't the correct answer, but Rock Lee dropping his weights and just busting up Gaara and still losing go so hard. What is the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Knives and Vash from Dragon. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? Honestly the end of attack on Titans was insane for me. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time? I'm gonna have to say gear 5 Kaido versus Luffy. What's the all time greatest anime fight scene? Ichigo and Aizen when he just grabs Aizen by the face like mid mid set. This was like the coolest thing I ever seen in anime. What's the Greatest anime fight scene of all time? Kakashi versus Obito and Naruto. What's the greatest anime fight scene of all time?

Not a problem. Point one. Milligrams of that stuff is more than enough to paralyze a whale. So you can steal other people's men. Then you're a specialist. You might even be a threat if you could use those stolen powers freely. However, that implies a higher activation cost. You couldn't have gotten the ability otherwise. If I had to make a guess, you must clear four or five conditions before stealing an ability. He's right. The old man's a tough customer. Trying to meet those conditions while fighting both of us will be difficult indeed. Meaning that you won't be able to steal our abilities as long as we keep you engaged in battle. That poisoned knife of yours is proof. Right again. Guess I have no choice. Watch my back, silver. As soon as I have him pinned down, even if you have to kill me, end him. Got it. He focused his aura into his hand. The energy potential will be huge. I don't have the defenses to block it. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! A conjured cloak, eh? This could be trouble. Even if it's a stolen ability, it would be reckless to attack without knowing what it does. Or so the average person would think. But yeah. Yeah, ha ha, yeah, I see what he's doing. He can trap the abilities of others in the conjured book, take them out, and use them anytime he pleases. But there's a catch. He can't use those abilities unless he holds the book open the entire time. The cloak is also a conjured item. It doesn't look like he's planning to attack, but it's obvious that he's attempting to close the distance between us. So it must be a defensive tool that can be utilized to draw closer to an enemy and counter attack. We can lower the risk if we keep our distance. We'll wait for our chance, then strike. This old man is really something. He managed to read my mind in an instant. Doubt I capture him alive, so the ability disappears whenever he closes the book. In any case, he's impressive. He's dodging dad's attacks by a hair, all while keeping an eye on me. His attacks have improved since last time, so we don't have any clue what he's capable of. If we want to stop him, we may just have to pay with our lives. Silver! Do it now! Haha! Woo!",

No, it is. It's pretty shit, dude. It's pretty shit. Cause they always got to go outside the walls too. Is like, they're human, dude. The all these tools have our swords and like ODM gear which does help. But for me Demon Slayer is fucked up too because those demons don't fuck around. If you're a low demon, so you're. You're honestly fucked. But I. I honestly think like, from what we know about the shows survey corpse statistics, you're dead. You're not killing. From the beginning of the show to now, there's only what, seven? Yeah, that's it. That is all the survey court. I was like, that's purely just based on the tally rate. Third record you got the abnormals, bro. Abnormals on different abnormals be the ones that go like this. Yeah, these are different. If you're not like even supporting character cast, you're dead, dude. If you're supporting character cast, dude.

She was just a casual anime fan with these being some of her favorite characters. And again, her love for anime is well documented. Why does she have to be quizzed on power scaling systems or which fictional characters would be other fictional characters or whatever else you feel like you need to quiz her on to validate her love for something? I guarantee you this person is one of those people that like black women. Didn't like me cause I'm a nerd. Now they don't like you cause you're a loser and you make them feel unsafe in these spaces.",

Me personally. Grave the fireflies. Right? Because I mean, it's sad if you've watched grave of the fireflies and you haven't had no. Just the tears, right? No easier way to say the tears running down your face at the end of the film. I think you have no soul and you might be just an alien of some sorts. Like, I can understand things like angel beats, things like your name, things like a silent voice. You can kinda argue. OK, don't have to cry a silent voice. German. But we're great with the fireflies. I think you have to cry. I think it's illegal not to. That shit is the saddest shit ever. Like, it's literally probably the saddest thing I've ever watched and will ever watch in my life. It's raw, it's authentic and it's just.

You have to have the reading comprehension of a toddler if you don't understand that scenes cannot breathe in space. It's something as well documented throughout the entire Dragon Ball franchise. And I know that people are gonna say that one manga panel saying that scenes cannot breathe in space isn't enough to prove that scenes cannot breathe in space, especially since a cure to Yama is known for forgetting literally entire characters. But saying is not being able to breathe in the vacuum of space was established in the name of arc. Frieza literally told Goku that he'll suffocate in the vacuum of space. So with this additional panel, we can establish two things. The first thing that we can establish is a consistency in the statement that saints cannot breathe in space. The second thing that we can establish is that saints need oxygen in order to survive. With that being said, we could prove that Goku is not planetary. Goku cannot destroy a planet because if he did, he would die.",

    "voice_to_text": "To a child who isn't loved properly, the answer one might expect is that they start to hate the person who doesn't give them the love they need. But far from it, the reality is that the child becomes filled with shame, a sense that it's profoundly unworthy, dirty, soiled, sinful, ugly, embarrassing. The child is unable to redirect the blame outwards. It doesn't ask what's wrong with my parents for not loving me adequately? It simply wonders in a fullon way what have I done wrong in order to have ended up on the receiving end of my parents disapproval? The child prefers to attack itself for being bad than to confront a yet more awful possibility that it's entirely dependent for its well being on inadequate and unkind parental figures. The child searches for explanations for the lack of love it has to endure and comes up with all the wrong answers. It concludes I've not been impressive enough, and therefore it undertakes enormous efforts to prove to itself and outsiders that it does nevertheless deserve to exist. At school, this kind of child might try seven times as hard as any other to show that it's clever and good. Or else a child may go down an anti social route and graffiti the nearby underpass as a desperate way of giving out would form to a feeling of badness it's tortured by inside. There is so sadly no way out from the burden of shame available either By trying to be extremely good or extremely bad, the only solution is to work against the grain of forgetting, in order to perceive for the first time an awful possibility that one could never perceive as a child, that one has done nothing wrong at all, that wrong was done to one",

    "voice_to_text": "What was your luckiest manga find? Mine is really random, but it takes place two and a half years ago, November 2021. I was in Barcelona, Spain. This was a time when manga collecting was really difficult. Big manga like one piece, Naruto, bleach, etc. Were really, really hard to find. And I was really, really close to finishing my one piece collection. So one of the days I was there, I walked into a small comic shop in a random spot in Barcelona and found two volumes of one piece that I was missing at the time. Those volumes being 13 and 23. These, if you don't know, and if you didn't collect back then, were impossible to find. I literally could not find them anywhere in the US at all. Me and the store owner even had a conversation about it when I was buying the volumes, and I was telling him about how hard it is to find manga in the US at the time, and he was really surprised, because in Spain have so much manga. They're constantly printing manga, they're constantly releasing new manga. So for him it was like, really? You really had to find them here? But hey, I was happy to have them. And I think I finished my collection like three months later, which was amazing.",

    "voice_to_text": "Naruto community as a whole, can we like, collectively do each other a favor and stop giving Naruto credit for things it didn't do as well? Naruto is one of the best any manga series ever made. Can we please stop acting like Naruto inspired literally everything that came after it? Because it didn't. Before I even get into the fact that this guy just blatantly lied, I'm gonna point something else out. One who unironically says that Asta is a wannabe. Naruto not only knows nothing about Asta, but they know nothing about Naruto. Every single time I've seen someone try to say that Asta's a Naruto clone, they are always reaching. Oh, and back to the fact that this guy was lying. Yeah, I saw your other comments said the creator of Black Clover said Naruto heavily inspired it. Yeah, no he didn't. Two actual confirmed inspirations for Black Clover are bleach and Yuyu Hakusho. And anyone who has seen either one of those two and Black Clover can tell you that it's inspired by it. What's even funnier is that anytime somebody brings up that Black Clover copies Naruto, the reasons are always bad. The main ones that people try to bring up is that oh, well, you know, Asta has an inner demon and Naruto has Kurama. And Asta wants to be the wizard king and Naruto wanted to be the hokage. As if Naruto started either one of those tropes to be that guy. But Like, Naruto did not start wanting to be number one at something, nor did he start the inner demon trope. Y'all can't give Naruto credit for everything. We're gonna ignore the fact that Goku wants to be the strongest? Or ignore that Luffy wants to be the Pirate King now? Naruto wanting to be the hokage was the first thing to ever happen, right? So funny that people try to draw comparisons between Asta and Liebe and Naruto and Kurama. Because again, Naruto was not an inspiration for Black Clover. Bleach was. So why people are comparing Naruto and Kurama when Ichigo and zangitsu were actually the inspiration is beyond me. Don't even get me started on the people who try to say that you know and know well. Or like Sasuke and Sakura. Stop. People can sit there and call me a Naruto hater, but I'm like the people that are whining about that. I was the one who was actually watching it all. It was airing on tsunami, so I don't really care how they feel about it. Moral of the story if you think that Asta or Black Clover copied Naruto, you're wrong. Believe it.",

    "voice_to_text": "so this person responded to my video again saying that this is not the first light speed feat in one piece because Luffy was dodging Foxy's photon attacks and Zorro was dodging Kuma I don't agree for a couple of reasons when explaining Kuma's ability and how it was able to harm Frankie the manga says a normal cannon shouldn't be able to have any effect on Frankie this is called the pad cannon air is repelled at light speed creating a shock wave that penetrates through anything the attack is created by repelling air at light speed it doesn't mean that the air pad itself travels at light speed so the Assumption of the air pad itself is moving at light speed even though there is no indication that is the case is entirely a headcanon and it double makes no sense when you look at characters who actually have light based attacks like an L all of a sudden these quote unquote light speed character are not able to replicate such speed feeds secondly you can dodge the trajectory of an attack without out running the attack for example if somebody points a gun at me and fires I can dodge the bullet without moving faster than the bullet because I can dodge the trajectory or the angle of the bullet which is exactly what was happening here that is assuming that this attack actually moves at light speed in a literal sense and this is even further substantiated in the data book that is explaining Kizari's power and says explicitly that Kizaru can spam light speed attacks and then goes on to say it is impossible to grasp even a single of his movement without being a proficient user of hockey pretty sure Zoro at Thriller Bark was not a proficient user of hockey I mean Zoro still is not a proficient user of hockey this however is undeniably a light speed feat unlike the other ones you mentioned because here Sanji is out of the frame Kizara points his light speed attack that is stated to be a light speed attack closes his eyes and fires it and Sanji from outside the frame enters the frame intercepts the attack directly from the exact trajectory it was fired and deflected this is a light speed feat not this and Naruto in the land of waves is also light speed because of Haku transfers from mirror to mirror he caught Haku mid transfer and pulled him down so Naruto and anybody who scales to this version of Naruto is also light speed so for the characters to be light speed here and light speed here but not light speed here and contradict this either means you're wrong or Oda doesn't know how to scale his own series",

The show premiered on adults on February 10th. I didn't even know. I didn't see any trailers, I didn't see no promotions, I didn't see anything on social media. I literally just saw this on my HBO Max last night and I was like, I saw the cover just like this, like, let me give it a chance. No expectations or whatever. I just went into it. The first two minutes literally grabbed me and hook me. I was sold immediately. I was sold to me. The first scene is like one of them like, you know how you like listen to music in the beat, hit and you got it. You hit them and you replay the song back at. That's what I did. It was. It was amazing. I won't even spoil it for you, but I would tell you. Adult Swim gave us one of them ones. Yo, adult swimming gave us one of them ones. It's so good. It's got a 9.2 on IMDB, 473 reviews. The show only came out like 3, 4 days ago, man. I'm telling y'all, I'm telling if you looking for a show to watch, you looking for a good anime to watch, there you go. I won't even spoil it for you cause I want you to have the same level Of excitement that I had when I watch this. I want. This comes out February 17th. I will be there February 17th on Adult Swim, and I will rewatch it again the next day on HBO Max, because it comes out on the next day on HBO Max. Like I said, great story, great animation. The boxing. The boxing. The box is great. Oh, my god. I'm one of the ones where I needed a show to hit right away. First episode. I don't like long, drawn out animations, long drawn out stories. I get bored really easily. I'll watch a couple episodes and then go to something else. Only three shows has, like, hook me from the pilot. Rising of the Shield Hero and demon slayer, and now this. That says a lot. I don't know if you're like that and you like that, you know the story to develop, but I need the story to punch me in the face immediately. If you got HBO Max, you got Adult Swim, you got cable hoop. I'm telling you, you're not gonna be sorry. Thank you, tsunami. Excuse me. Thank you, Adult Swim. You didn't gave us one of the ones",

On the spectrum of getting giant. That one girl's hot. Terry especially hard today because he's the reason my wife and I are broken eyes. And she's up and I'm broken. You have a good heart. Why is there a cat under the table? Finally, a pussy that wants to be around me and our pet cat. What are you wearing? You look like Little Red Riding Hood. Let's talk about some fondues and fond. Don't rat dick. Can't bit my ankle. Cat dick. Fucking cord sucks worse than the Kardashians and NBA All Star weekend because the girl from J Date ghosted me a Red Lobster using her gift. This heart shaped box reminds me that I want Terry to Kurt Cobain himself. That guy painted. Oh, he painted one wall. Oh, fuck! I meant to remove the one that had caramel. Oh, god, we're about to make a bigger chocolate mess than when that stripper's water broke on my lap at Club Escalate. Yes, I know what today is. No, not Valentine's Day. It's Black History Month, you fucking race! Stop shouting the N word! Okay, hate you too, hasty cock. Sounds like one of my preferences on porn. Oh, these look like precious as. Oh, tastes like it, too. You'd agree if you were casting the Golden Bachelor. If I were to see old people fuck, I just start looking in the windows of the nursing home again. Last time I saw something this dark and full of liquor, Patrick Mahomes's dad was at a DUI checkpoint. No, love's not real, right? Fuck you. Oh, this looks like fondue. Dude, I'm getting two girls, one cup PTSD. That Tyler Perry movie. That's actually better. To help me enjoy the fondue today, I have this giant fruit and an apple. You get that outfit? You look like Marvin Gaye. His dad and me might have something in common. Taking the fruit now to see if it's bussing or not. Hmm. Dad, how are we gonna clean this up? The neighbor's dog. We get it. Cupid's heart bone or Valentine's dicks.",

Baldur's Gate 3 is actually a new low in convincing gamers to overlook romantic red flags thanks to our alien dummy Mommy, Lasel. If you want a character in baldur's Gate 3 to sleep with you, they need to like you. And the way you figure this out is after every, like, important thing you do, they'll give you Lasel approves. Lasel disapproves. Other unimportant people approve of disapprove. You get it? And after a few hours, Laiselle might be the meanest bitch alive. I'm a straight white man. I am no stranger to a villain. Run! But Shawty is just cruel. She told me that I looked goofy because I didn't actively participate in child murder. I'm pretty sure that her, like, perfect. Her dream partner is like a Terminator robot that has some extra paddles at knee height to slap candy out of the hands of children. It's fucked up. We cannot reward this type of callous and cruel character design, is what I'm saying to you. I am resetting my saves to push over elderly people just so that she'll look at me again.",

    "voice_to_text": "If you collect vintage makeup, the Volupte Golden Gesture Compact is one of the most coveted compacts to collect. Hand shape compact launched in the 19 forties, and it's rumored to have around 12 different versions. Now, I know a lot of you out there are starting to collect vintage makeup, which I absolutely love. So if you're looking for this compact, I have about 7 of them. I'm trying to complete the collection. But let's start with this one. Is the engagement ring. All you have is the ring, no bracelet. And what you want to look for is absolutely no dings. You want the mirror intact, although it does sometimes get this sort of corrosion that happens to a lot of vintage compacts. And then inside, you want to have the puff. And most importantly, with any compact, if you can find it in its original sheath and its original box, this also came completely clean with no ring, no bracelet, and no nail polish. And this one has the nail polish, but you can actually see it's a little bit tainted. So this is not mint condition. But I just find it really difficult to find these, so sometimes I'll grab them even if they're not perfect. The card playing hand is extremely rare. But speaking of not perfect, I've never been able to find it in mint condition all of these years. So you can see it up close. It is a little bit scuffed, but I had to have it. This one's very special because it's actually on the cover of the holy grail of compact collectors. This is Roslin gerson's Ladies compact's book. Definitely need this. All collectors. In 1948, they launched the gay 90s Mitt. Now, this refers to the Victorian era, the 18 90s, when women would wear the fingerless gloves. This one's a little easier to find. It's the white mitt. There's no ring. And of course, this gorgeous bracelet. And I have one that's even more rare. Now, this one comes with the glove and the ring and the bracelet, and I do have the box for it. This back then would have sold for $7 and \u00a250. And recently, one on eBay went for over 2000 dollars. Now, this one might be the rarest of all. This is the Zodiac compact. And this one came out closer to the 19 50s. A lot of Zodiac compacts were becoming a thing. And this one is intensely rare. It's in perfect mint condition. I have the box, I have the sheath. And this one also would go for over 2000 dollars. If you find these and you don't want them, let me know. Or get them for yourself if you can get them at a good price. Because as you can see, worth it.",
