Nah, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro. You are a felon. 34 charges, accounts. And they finally plead. Not plead, but sentence you real soon. But you still got a chance to be president. Cause we know you're not going to jail. They just want you to stop being in a political office. So this is what you do. Run your campaign and advocate felonies to vote in the states. They can't vote. Felonies carry guns. A lot of votes there. You lose some, you're gonna lose some cause you got felons. But you gonna gain more promoting the felons. Allow felons to go to Canada somehow. Put that in there. That ain't us, but make it happen. I've been to Canada with a felon and I got cavity surge and I felt like I got a hold. Did he got a hold of me? Jobs. Let felons be protected and not discriminated against like you do with disability and the LGBT community. This is how you do it, Trump. Cause we know you're not going to jail. But hey, do it. You want us now, buddy? Don't matter if you go to jail, you one of us. Accept it, love it, make the best of it. Cause they trying to stop you in the office, but The power is in the people. Yeah, you gonna lose some votes cause you got a felon. But you going to gain more if you use it to your advantage. I know. Do it, run it, push it. But you one of us, nigga. Side note, this gonna be crazy cause we finna witness this. And this Negro or felon, you can say now, is not gonna go to jail with 34 charges in one case. We would never, ever witness that again. Until they decriminalize everything. Crack, murder, fucking rape, everything. Kidnapping. This is. Wow. 34 felony charges and he's not going to spend one night in jail. I'm willing to bet the ranch on it. But Trump, those are three free campaign ideas. I got plenty more. Send a check. Get the votes, baby. Let's go.",

    "voice_to_text": "Count one. Guilty. Count two. Guilty. Count three. Well, as y'all can see, it's official, y'all good buddy. Trump has been found guilty on all counts that they brought against him in court. Now, the immediate questions I have is this, how does this conviction affect his, uh, campaign for president? Cause my understanding is, if someone is been found guilty of any kind of crime, especially something as serious as, uh, misappropriation of election funds, that can make him ineligible to run for president. Now, there's no doubt in my mind that Trump is going to try to appeal, because that's just what he does. But even then, uh, if I remember the process correctly, it has to go through, through adjudication, which determines if this verdict has grounds for an appeal. And due to the seriousness of it, I stream the doubt that he would be granted an appeal. And so far, I have not heard any of latest news about his appeal. For all the falsified cases that he had in New York. And then they had dug up some more stuff, so they gonna take him back to court again. So as of y'all Republicans, might I suggest y'all might need to go back getting Nikki Haley. Please do not go back and get to Santa's. Nobody wants him. Look at how much he has ruined Florida. And the way things are going, his political career is over after 2026. So since the verdict came today, a Lot of these questions are going to be unfold very soon, but it's gonna be pretty interesting how this goes. Y'all let me know what y'all think about how this gonna go.",

They funnel the money overseas, whether through direct contributions to a country or through our nation's largest weapons manufacturers, who then funnel that money back to our elected leadership through lobbyists. And they make themselves rich. And the funny thing is, they don't hide it. Like, they're not hiding the fact that they're doing this. I mean, they make it very fucking obvious this is what they're doing. Like, take Lockheed Martin, for example. Last year, the United States government spent $47.7 billion with Lockheed Martin, which, insanely enough, represented 93% of Lockheed Martin's revenue for the year. Without our money, they wouldn't exist. But anyway, after the United States government gave them 47 billion, lucky then proceeded to spend more than a hundred million dollars lobbying the government. Those are all in the forms of gifts, trips and all kinds of other bullshit for elected representatives. Oh, and the funniest part, nearly 80% of the money we gave to Lockheed Martin, we borrowed. So we borrowed the money with interest to give it to a government contractor, who then took a nice chunk of that money and spend it on the representatives that voted to give them the money in the first place. And none of this is hidden. They're not deceiving anyone. This is all publicly disclosed. And that's not even counting all the smaller contracts. You know, those contracts that are given out to small Contracting firms that are generally owned by friends of the congressmen who push the Bill to pay them. Like, bro, you have to think about the fact that last year, all by itself, when we look at all discretionary spending, we spent $861 billion on defense, 80% of that on other countries defense. And we spend around 700 billion on everything that's not defense. We spent more last year from discretionary spending on defense for other nations than we did on everything else in the US. Every other government program, whether it's science or housing or anything, all of that together was less than what we spent on the defense of other countries. So to answer your question, that's what they're doing with our money.",

Which to me stands for all out corruption, because she ain't been the same ever since she was on the cover of Vanity magazine. She basically said that Biden and the Democrats are all in cahoots to keep Donald Trump from being on the campaign. Here's a woman that's supposed to represent her constituents of the 14 District of New York, and she ain't doing a damn thing. As a Bronx born native, I am highly offended that she does not care about her constituents. What she is doing is totally out of pocket. Everybody, no matter what race they are, who lives in the Bronx and who lives all over New York, they have a right to hear what Donald Trump has to say. And the reason why she and the Democrats are in panic mode is because Joe Biden, he can't even go to a Dollar Tree store. He can't do none of that. So don't fall for the propaganda. Trump is coming to the Bronx, we welcome him, and we gonna hear what he got to say. Trump 2024. Let's go!",

Yeah, good job. And she probably made that joke because you knew he was gonna rile up you dembs. He's sleeping. Or he's praying. Or we can just pray he doesn't stand a chance. So angry that he's. That he fell asleep. What? He's not like you. He doesn't have a little bear of crappy pappy and tucked in by mommy and daddy to go to sleep at night. He's stuck in a courtroom on the false fucking charges. And who cares if he farts? Let him fart. Like you don't. Would you rather have it in your gut and feeling the pain, the bubble guts? No, I wouldn't. I, I fart up and down the grocery aisle. If I got a fart, I'm farting. Fart. You're a fart. You suck the farts out of Joe Biden's couch cushions. Crappy pappy. Crappy pappy.

And you literally believe those are not fears of somebody dressed up in clothing to promote the agenda? I promise you they can get your folks to move on anything that they want to. Number one, that doesn't bother me because if they really felt that way, they would go do that in front of the people that they really hate. Number one. Number two, that's the part of the Constitution that's a gift and a curse. The same way we got our right to be patriotic, they got they right to be neo Nazis. That's just what comes with America. Even though I think it's all a game to get a race war going, they trying their best. They trying everything they can to start a civil war so everything can be as distracted as possible. Number one, everything they doing hasn't made the people budge. What they really trying to get out everybody is a civil war. They really trying to get the people to nut up, go crazy so they can for do martial law and the Democrats stay in power. They don't want it to get to another election because if they get to another election, everybody's gonna be peeping the schemes and the scams and they gonna be looking out for the fraud this time. So the only way they can stay in power is if they create world chaos. Now, if they can create chaos before November, then whoever's in power will remain in power. That's how that works. So at the end of the day, at this point, I'm ignoring it. I'm not worried about it. Cause A, you ain't gonna get in my face with it. B, they in Nashville, Tennessee, at all the places they can go and express that. Come on, man. And you fail right into it. I can look at the expression on your face until you just falling right for the game. So you stand there and record that and you keep on being pond. And i'mma sit back and watch it and let it play itself out. And I'm awake the November the 6th. At the end of the day, I will not budge as an American citizen constitutionally, until I see how the elections planned out. But what you won't do is get me to react before the election so you can find a way to stay in power. So that ain't neo Nazi. That's another pawn inside of the bigger game that they're playing called chess. You don't see none of them fault faces. The same with January 6th. It could be FBI agents, CIA agents, who knows who that is dressed up in that you can't identify. And it's only like 20 of them. You took the time, this is a video to show me 20 neo Nazis? You mean to telling me out of all the white supremacy, They say in the world is only 20. Count the people. Is 20 to 30 people. In that y'all folks stay white.",

    "voice_to_text": "This is one of the largest Trump rallies I've ever been to. In the last spot. So Donald Trump yesterday had a fantastically huge rally in blue state, New Jersey, a state where he lost double digits to dawn to Joe Biden last year. Now, it said to be the range between anywhere between 80,000 to 100,000 people going to a Trump rally in a blue state, no less. And the support for him was absolutely amazing. Uh, they did it in the beach. I think you're supposed to have it at convention center, but they moved it to the beach. I don't know why, I, I could be wrong. Fact check me begin. All I know is he had it at the beach. It was absolutely fantastic. He got a huge endorsement, by the way, from a former Democrat. Democratic voter. Big famous dude, too, as well, and a person of color. But this is absolutely amazing. The left in the Biden, the Biden, what's it called, whatever. The Biden voters, like Harry, Susan and all them, they are pissed off, and they're fighting whatever they can to cope with what just happened. They are sad, they are very disappointed of what happened, because Joe, Joe Biden, he can barely fill up a freaking classroom of like 30 to 30 to 40 people, let alone let any of those people supporting him. Most of the people that go to a Biden rally, I'm quoting on that because it's so small. Um, they mostly go there. Do, uh, actually yell at the dude. In fact, at that same day, uh, Joe Biden went to Seattle, Washington. You can check it out. He went to sea. Seattle, Washington, and he wasn't there. Meant with Biden voters. He was met with the left side, the progressive side, the side that actually voted for him. Unanimous mini, uh, that, uh, in 2020. And they are not there to support him. Oh, god, no. They are pissed off at him. They are calling him genocide Joe. Because of the what's going on between Israel and Palestine. They want him to stop the war. This, that and that. And it's absolutely hilarious to see. He was met with negative, negative people. So it's. It's so cool to see. Guys, this gives me so much. All this may gets me super pumped up. Coming to election in November. The polls could be wrong. I think Donald Trump is actually winning tremendously compared to what the polls are showing us now, which he's already is winning. He's gonna make gains. It's gonna probably the most historical gains and ever in our election. And there, there's no way Trump is. Can lose. No way. The court cases are failing, and the quirky are just proving more and more that this is all political theater. This is all politics. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. Well, that's everything to do with Trump. And the fact that they don't Want him to be a president again, because if he becomes president, the Democrats and the rhino Republicans are gonna lose everything they worked for tremendously, because Donald Trump is the. Is the people. Is the people's president. Donald Trump has done so much for us in his first four years, and I can't wait to see what he does for us in the next four years. John 20:24. Guys, let's do it.",

    "voice_to_text": "Say the weird thing. People are desperately seeking realness. Every time you see The Color Purple, your brain is malfunctioning. Purple doesn't actually exist. And I know that's a weird statement to hear, but it's the truth. There is no purple on the light spectrum. There are no purple photons. See, our vision sees in a three color light spectrum of red, green and blue. You've probably heard the term RGB. That's red, green and blue. So our eyes basically have sensors that detect red, green and blue. The way your brain is supposed to work, when it sees color, it's supposed to detect how much red, green and blue you're seeing. So normally, if your brain sees very little red and very little blue, your green sensors would pick up because green is between red and blue. But if your brain sees very little red, very little blue, and your green sensors don't pick up any green, your brain essentially short circuits and you see purple. Like all purple is, is the absence of green. It's not actually purple, it is simply your brain malfunctioning.",

President Obama ordered a drone strike on a restaurant in a country that we are not at war with. And he did that specifically to murder a sixteen year old American citizen who had not been convicted or tried for any crime. Like he knowingly did that and admitted it to the American public. How is that not murder? And if you're gonna be okay with him doing that, if you're gonna be okay with President Obama using the United States military to murder a 16 year old American citizen in a foreign nation, why the fuck are you acting so crazy about Trump saying he would have immunity? Obama murdered an American citizen that hadn't been convicted of any fucking crime whatsoever. So stop clutching your fucking pearls over the idea of presidential immunity.

And I'm gonna give you the answer to that one as well. I hope you stick with me the whole time. Doesn't matter why Biden decided to keep his salary illegally. He gets to do that. Is that an American? I don't think so. Moving on. Question you're not asking is why did Trump give up the $1.6 million over four years? Um, the only answer I can think is it has something to do with the tens of millions of dollars the taxpayer spent at his businesses, housing, the Secret Service, him, and his travel during that time. We spent more money on his travel in four years than we did on Obama's in 8 9. In addition to those tens of millions of tax dollar money, he also directed foreign governments to his businesses to the tune of about $7.8 million. Yet he was profiteering",

Now, while I haven't been able to find the exact time, the Lincoln Reagan Republican fundraising event is stated to be a dinner, and that implies evening. One of the joys of being a former president of the United States and being a multi billionaire is you have a private jet. Florida to Minnesota is about a three and a half hour flight, so he's probably gonna do both. Would he be a shit heel if he skips his kids graduation? Absolutely. But like I said before, being that he is the former president of the United States, it means he has Secret Service and police escorts to and from airports. It's not out of the realm of possibility for him to go from Florida to Minnesota in three and a/2 hours and hit both events same day. I guess we'll have to wait till May 17th to see.

Like, how racist do Democrats have to be before liberals are willing to call them out? whether it's saying the poor kids are just as smart as white kids, or saying that if you don't vote for me, you ain't black, or saying at the visit of 7 11, you have to have a slight Indian accent, or saying the black people aren't capable of getting voter ID, and now saying that black people don't even know what a computer is. Like, this is the fucking governor of New York. And here's the thing. She could have said that there were poor kids who don't know what computers are, and she still would have been wrong. She could have said there are underprivileged kids who don't know what computers are, and she would have been wrong. But no, she said black kids don't know what computers are.

    "view_count": 307,
    "voice_to_text": "so I find it funny that the um Donald Trump is saying that the latest violation of the gag order that Judgmentron has placed on him now the 10th time he's warned him and threatened him with jail time for violating the gag order they will hold them in contempt of court I think it's and then Trump comes back and says well he keeps violating my constitutional rights to say what I want to say you know again pushing that whole narrative that uh the right to speech has no bounds and and is just you know whatever you wanna say how you wanna say where you wanna say is protected by the Constitution it's the same lunacy that the left uses right that that and I find it interesting that we talk about some of my content on my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there curious formula uh talks about the lunacy of the left and the right when it comes to the Constitution I can think of no better example than Donald Trump on the right talking about how the Constitution his Constitution rights are being abridged and you know that's not what the Constitution you know says I should have the right to free speech unassailable likewise on the left I put up a a comment to somebody who put on a viral video here on TikTok or might have on Instagram that had women who had on t shirts that had political speech at a council meeting and they were wearing them and the council said hey they have to leave if they're gonna wear those shirts and and people were like that's wrong um we have the right to free speech we can wear a T-shirt that has a political message on here and you're bridging my my right to free speech that was on the left and I put a comment and said you know that I maybe even supported what the the comment that was on the t shirts that they people were wearing but that the council city council wherever town council every right to restrict uh that form of speech and it goes to what people don't understand about the Constitution people use the Constitution for whatever they want to use it because I bet those same people wore the t shirts in the courtroom who were Liberal will probably say that Donald Trump doesn't have the right um to say what he wants to say and I'm sure I'm sure would say the same about these people who wore who wore some of these leftist things on their t shirts they don't have the right to say they wanna say people just use the Constitution for what they want and and they base their decisions based on the ideology about what is appropriate speech and what is protected speech by the Constitution and not what it actually says listen folks the Constitution does give you the right to free speech but it's not it is not under underbridgeable it is not it is not without regulation it is not without bounds right we all know the statement that's been made famous you can't yell out fire in a crowded theater that's putting a restriction on speech the government has the right to restrict speech and a public venue to time manner and place they can do that it's like when I was on a city council in New Jersey the city council had the right to say that 25 people can speak during the hearing of citizens you may not like it you may not agree with it right and that they and and but but we had the right to do so now if you didn't like that you have the right to vote us out of office and put somebody else then who said I'm not gonna just have 25 people speaking at a council meeting at the hearing of citizens we have the right to put a restriction on time three to five minutes or whatever the time frame was that's not restricting your speed you don't have the right to speak 150 people don't have the right to speak at a council meeting if that's what the council wants they don't have the right to speak for an hour at a time if that's not what the council wants um that's the reality of it and Donald Trump yes a court can restrict what you can say when you're on trial to the people who are wearing the t shirts on the left at a council meeting yes they can say you no one can wear any t shirts with political speech at a council meeting that is not restrict your right to free speech you can wear your T-shirt outside of that room you can wear your your your T-shirt anywhere you want to Donald Trump you can say what you wanna say as long as it doesn't violate the order that you're supposed to be under when you're under when you're on trial you can't say those kind of things about jurors and the judge because you don't have the right to say that I just think it's really really interesting that in America today and throughout the world the problem of people looking and using institutional documents like the Constitution or declaration of independence or or or the Bill of rights or or any number of federal laws and statutes and regulations and and tell people like this is violative of that this is not what the founders wanted this is not this is not what you should be doing based on ideology is tearing this nation apart what's good for the goose is good for the gander and as I said it is a far gone conclusion well settled law that the government has the right to restrict speech based on time manner and place and if you don't like it then ask for an amendment to the to the law or challenge it in court and have it go up to the Supreme Court to make a new a new analysis of it but it's the same lunacy it's the same hypocrisy that's evident on the left and on the right Donald Trump is just the most um most visual and most um um um up to date sort of problem with it but it's a problem on the left and the right tell me what you think and if you have an alternative opinion subscribe like and comment below also go to my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there free speech is not based on your ideology free speech is a right that has regulation because all rights under the Constitution have regulation stay curious and think it ain't",

Jack Smith, Alvin Braggs, Leticia James, Funny Willis, they've all been accolds with the Biden administration. And, Chris, you're saying the quiet part out loud. Not only is this election interference, but this is the biggest, and I mean the biggest political witch hunt ever.

Because if you watch this dude's videos, like, this is a black man, this is a black man going to UCLA, and anytime he goes anywhere near these encampment, it's not brown students, it's not black students, it's not Palestinians or gossins or Asians or any of that shit. No, it is a bunch of white people telling a black man where he can go on campus. It is a bunch of white students saying, you don't belong here and trying to force a black man to leave their area. I mean, let's be real, at its core, that's what's going on. This is white people exercising their privilege. This is white people exercising their privilege to tell a black man that he doesn't belong there. This is white people telling a black man where he can be and especially where he can't be. How the fuck have white liberals gone so far that now they think they're right, committing racism? Cause let's be real, if these white kids were conservative, and this black dude was Liberal, and all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he can and can't go, all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he is and isn't welcome, that would be called racism. Every one of those white kids would be called a racist piece of Shit. But somehow, because they're Liberal, we just ignore the racism. I'm certainly not going to",

And common sense tells me that this is insane. I mean, we're literally living in Sri Lanka at this point. This is what dictators do of third world countries to their political opponents. This is what Putin does. And if this exact same situation was happening to a Democrat right now, any Democrat, I would be saying the same thing. Because it's wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it's also entirely hypocritical, because people that were a part of this trial were saying that the voters of Donald Trump deserve to know this information before they voted for him in 2016, in 2020. So why don't the voters get to know about Hillary Clinton's 36,000 emails then? That's so hypocritical. Why didn't the voters get to know about Hunter Biden's laptop? Why didn't the voters get to know about hunter and Joe Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and what 10% for the big guy meant? And again, I'm trying to come out of a place of common sense here as an independent voter. I wanna know what Joe and Hunter's emails were about now. I wanna know what Hillary Clinton's emails were about now. As much as I wanna know about this Donald Trump shit.

He has not been sentenced yet. And I still find it highly unlikely that they would give him jail or prison time for these charges. Putting Trump in prison would just be way too complicated. He still has a Secret Service detail, and these charges aren't the most serious, but let's face it, it's a lot of felonies, even for a dude like me who has a lot of felonies. What I still find to be the most likely scenario is that he's either gonna get probation, possibly a suspended sentence, maybe some house arrest. But even that would be complicated. And I'm not sure exactly how it would work because he's campaigning to be the president of the United States, and they have to be careful not to do anything that could be interpreted as election interference. What do you guys think? Will this affect the way that any of you guys vote? Because it seems to me like the people who wanna vote for Trump aren't gonna care if he's a felon or not.

We are now 24 counts in all, guilty. From inside, this is what we are hearing from our producers. Up to 26 guilty. Now, remember, each of these counts could maximum have four years in jail. Um, President Trump would be considered a first time offender. These are non violent crimes. Uh, so it seems that it is unlikely the judge would sentence him to prison.

You know, if those folks were black and attack the capital on January 6th, you wouldn't be calling them hostages. The threat to Trump poses greater in a second term than his first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in the sky. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls insurrection to storm the capital. Patriots! Patriots! If re elected, he wants to pardon, quote every one of them. Let me ask you, what do you think it would have done on January 6th if black Americans had stormed. Think about this. What they would have happened if black Americans had stormed the capital. I don't think he'd be talking about pardons. It's the same guy wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five guilty even though they were exonerated. He's that landlord who denies housing application because of the color of your skin. He's that guy who won't say Black Lives matter and invokes neo Nazi third right terms we all remember. Trump is the same guy who unleashed birthism, the birth of his lie against Barack. Thank you, President Joe Biden, for pointing out how racist Donald Trump and his supporters are. You all know it. If black folks would have assaulted The democracy the way you Trump supporters did. You would have demanded they bring the electric chair if it was Barack Obama who did. You would have insisted they take the electric chair to the White House. So spare me this fake outrage you got about oh, doing a little jail time. You're all a bunch of liars and hypocrites. Addition is treasonous traitors! Trump supporters, get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready cause Jack Smith and funny Willis and Leticia James and Alvin Bragg. Haha, that's funny! Are coming for you. It's over. MAGA.

We were just on that ship a little while ago and got to walk around and get a up close look at these drugs. At stacks and stacks of drugs, at the bales. You see, this is exactly how they were wrapped when they were seized from different vessels. So this is a result of eight different suspected drugs smuggling interdictions off the coasts of Mexico and central and South America from late February to late March. Now, wholesale value is about 470 million dollars. So that's just if it's sold as is when I mentioned. When it's cut down and mixed with other substances and sold off. The rear Admiral Andy Sugimoto says the value is closer to 2 billion when this gets out for distribution. The violence, it's a part of this. Overdoses that are a part of this.

A journalist from Gaza says, I saw a child enter the burning tent after it was targeted in order to help his injured mother who could not walk. And because of the heat of the fire, we could not catch him. He was bolder than all of us. Today, as we searched the place, we found them hugging in chard. Today at a White House press briefing, John Kirby was asked by a reporter if these bombings, if these actions violated Biden supposed red line when it came to a Rafa invasion. Biden is fine with it.

So what you are telling me is that your relationships, one, don't have any boundaries whatsoever, and two, you're okay with presenting second class behavior and not having any type of correction. But your relationships are going really well. But let's talk about this and some more. Psychologists and couple counselors have all pretty much agreed that these two body languages that I. Or facial expressions that I mentioned in that video signify that the relationship is terminal. In case you're a little confused on the usage of terminal, means the relationship is already drawing to a close. Meaning, if something doesn't drastically change, the relationship is already going to failure. Now, most people don't know this, and that's why I'm teaching people. But in the case if you were one of my girls and I said this to you, and it has happened where I've called them out and said, no, you don't do that. You continue to do that, the relationship is over. They have. They pulled the plug there. To which I'm okay with. Reason I'm okay with is because I know what those signs mean. And I already know that resentment is in that girl's heart. Whether it's something I've done or something her friends are whispering in her ear. It can be a bunch of different things. But that means the relationship is already at its end. And the only way to save it at that point is to correct the behavior and work Together and fixing it. But most people don't know that, and it's a very common thing. Couple counselors notice this a lot. That if they ever watch a couple and there is somebody who sneers, I think it was like a 92% chance that that relationships ending anyways. And besides, if you can't accept correction within a relationship, you are not a partner that should be dating anyways. You have things that you need to go to therapy and learn about and deal with. Probably some trauma you need to fix in order to grow and become better and actually be a dating somebody in the dating pool that is actually gonna be worthwhile for someone to date.",

We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate Hustler masquerading as a big shot. A two bit playboy, lying his way into the tabloids, pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself. He was calling it as himself poor himself, to fool the press into inflating his net worth. A clown. But this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns. We have them all over the city. People who do crazy things in the street. We tolerate it. It's part of the city, it's part of the culture. But not a person like Trump, who will eventually run the country. That does not work, and we all know that.",

No way he doesn't get blood on his hands. No, he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion, an inference, and his gang robles and follows his obvious order. It's no surprise that the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are falling under Biden. And now he's promising to use our own military to attack US citizens. That's the tyrant. That's the tyrant he's telling us he'll be. And believe me, he needs it. When Trump ran in two 2016, it was like a joke. This buffoon running for president? Nah, never could happen. We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing. Now, this is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all. We don't wanna wake up after the election saying, what, again? My God, what the hell have we done? We can't have that happen again. Yesterday was Memorial Day. It's a good time to reflect on how Americans fought and died so that we may enjoy the freedoms guaranteed to us by a democratic government. A government that is. President Lincoln said of the people, By the people, for the people. Shall not perish from the earth. Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth. I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait. Maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it. That's over. That's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave. He will never leave. You know that he will never leave. What does that mean? Is that the country we wanna live in? Do we want him running this country and saying, I'm not leaving, I'm dictator for life? I hope this new ad campaign. Campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives.",

And he said, they've got to get the hostages. They have to go get the hostages. Hostages have to be a priority. And then he said, and none of this ever would have happened if the 2020 election wasn't rigged. Was a rigged election, a stolen election. He didn't get animated talking about the return of Israeli hostages or what was going on inside the Gaza Strip. He only got animated and energized when he was talking about the 2020 election being rigged and stolen. He doesn't care about that. He cares about the 2020 election, and he knows. He knows it wasn't rigged. He knows it was not stolen. He knows that. He has known that since the beginning. He has known that since the beginning. But, yeah, his grievances are the only thing that matter to him. That his grievances matter to him more than his own children matter to him. Certainly more than his own supporters matter to him. He's disgusted by his own supporters. He thinks they're disgusting people. He wouldn't. He doesn't touch them. He doesn't shake hands. With his supporters ever? Not unless they've got a membership tomorrow Lago or are a billionaire donor. Those are the only supporters of his who he will touch. He doesn't. He's a politician who doesn't shake hands. He refuses to shake hands with his own supporters. He goes to these rallies and he stays as far away from these people in the crowd as he possibly can because they disgust him. He finds them to be disgusting people.",

I am not affected by your booze because I've seen what makes you cheer me. To take your criticism to heart, I'd first have to value your opinion. And the funny thing is, you guys are trying to attack me from like a moral standpoint, as if you hold any moral high ground whatsoever. The vast majority of you are pro choice, you are pro abortion, you are pro murdering babies just cause you don't want them. You have no moral high ground. I think stupid people should walk off a cliff. That's certainly not as bad of a position as murdering babies cause it'll fuck with your vacation schedule. Or murdering babies because you don't like what it's gonna do to your body. Like, no, your beliefs are fucking horrible. You have no morals. You support some of the worst things that have ever been created on this earth. You support Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, who wasn't a vowed eugenicist and a rampant racist. You support a party in this country. That is the history of racism in our nation. Please know that I do not give a fuck what you think of me. Because like I said before, to feel anything about your criticism, I'd first have to value your opinion. I'd first have to think That you're a good person? I'd first have to think that you have some kind of moral fucking high ground. And to the conservatives that are mad at me, I've told you this many times, over and over and over again. I am not a conservative. Sure, I have some conservative beliefs when it comes to physical policy and border security, but that's a practical argument. Most of my leanings are pretty fucking Liberal. Not Liberal to the point of batshit crazy leftist, but outside of fiscal policy, I'm pretty much Liberal on everything. And I haven't hidden this from anyone. I've said it over and over and over again. So you can be mad at me. And look, there's a few people on this platform who if they're mad at me, I take that to heart because I value their thought process and I value their opinion. But please know that the opinion of people like Harry or Dean or Parker will never bother me. Cause I don't value them as people. I certainly don't value their awful opinions. So if you wanna be mad at me, be mad at me. But if you want me to care, be somebody I respect first. Oh, and for all you haters keep jumping in my comments and giving me that algorithm boost.",

See, they were talking about what's gonna happen with the Supreme Court once Trump wins. Because y'all recognize that Trump has already appointed three of the nine Supreme Court justices. When he gets re elected, he's most likely gonna appoint two more. Because two of the conservative Supreme Court justice are pretty old, and this is gonna be their best opportunity to retire and be replaced by another conservative judge. So that would mean by the end of Trump's second term, he's gonna have appointed five of the nine Supreme Court justice. And in case you weren't aware, five is the majority of nine. That will mean that Trump Supreme Court justices will be able to make rulings and not give a fuck about what anybody else says. Like all those other people that every other president put on the Supreme Court. Their vote won't matter because just Trump appointed justices can make the decision without anyone else. Just think of how wonderful that will be. Every bullshit Liberal case brought before the Supreme Court gone. Every stupid Liberal and leftist argument brought before the court defeated. And because Trump's gonna point people who are under 60 years old, the court is gonna stay that way for the next 20 to 25 years, regardless of who gets elected president. This is fucking awesome.",

Um, but why is everyone wearing a mask? So they're making it harder for you to vote by mail. The same way, I might add, to the 2020 election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House in Florida. The White House in Florida. What is he talking about? Are these cardboard cutouts? No one's moving, no one's clapping, no one's doing anything. And I find it very, well, normal. I find it very normal for something like this.",

    "voice_to_text": "California. What the fuck is with the stoplights on your own ramps? So I went to San Jose for work last week, and I saw something that I've never seen in any other state. Like, I'm originally from the northeast, and we don't have this. And now I live in the southeast, and we definitely don't have this here. But what they had in California was a stoplight at the bottom of an on ramp. It was just a light that stayed red until you came up to it and came to a complete stop. Then the light would flash green, and it would let one car at a time go on the highway. But what the fuck is the reason for that? Because all it did was create traffic on the on ramp and then make merging even more difficult. Because instead of building speed coming down the on ramp and easily merging on the highway, I had to, like, accelerate the 70 miles an hour in a very short period. I mean, look, I was in the Tesla, so the acceleration wasn't a problem. But I don't understand the point of those lights. Why do you want people that are trying to get on the highway to have to come to a complete stop right before they get on the highway and then have to floor it to get up to 70 before their lane ends? Like, that doesn't make any sense to me. When y'all had those Put in did the state have a good reason why that happened? Cause I certainly cannot think of a good reason for those fucking lights. Somebody from California explain this to me.",

As you saw in the video, they're not just like folks who are curious and attending. They have Trump hats on, they have the shirts, they had the flags, they have all the merchandise, and even they are leaving Donald Trump's speech early. But look, I don't blame them. Trump's speech in the Bronx has been a disaster. He's sweating, he's slurring his words. He's not laying out any policy, just really terrible stuff.

Cause remember, the Democrats are putting out the message he's not welcome in the South Bronx. That's not the message I got. Look, Donald Trump is set to make a historic visit right here in the South Bronx. I decided to pop in and talk to some people who are gonna be there to see why they're excited about the former president coming to their neighborhood. I think that's amazing. I think it's epic. That's the best thing ever. Are you gonna go? Yeah. How will he be received here? Open arms. Really open arms. Everybody go show love. You come show love. They gonna show you love right back. If I do see him, you know, it's. It's a what's up? And thank you for doing what you did. 50 fifty. Honestly. People gonna have some love and hate. Some people do love them, but. Assets to perform as better than Joe Biden. Was life in the Bronx better under Donald Trump or under Joe Biden? It was better under Donald Trump. Um, I can tell you that the Bronx has been through many changes. Everything was getting back on track, and then, you know, everything is like, falling apart again. You know, she isn't gonna walk in the street. Our children have been killed. Uh, groceries. When you go to grocery store, you. You can't even buy Anything anymore. Everybody needs help. People need housing. Instead of giving migraines and everybody that's coming from other countries help, we here, we Americans, give us some help. As you know, they're giving all the money to the immigrants. Not that much, but. Okay. It's not that. It's not. I'm not against that. No, the problem is they're cutting our stuff. What can Biden do at this point? Nothing. Even he did something. The we're beyond the point of north turn when it's. Everybody's on the Trump train. I'm a Democrat. All my life I've been a Democrat. But Democrats have use us and abuse us, and they think that they own us. And Donald Trump, he's giving most opportunity. Black people and Hispanic people are very happy about him coming. Coming here, and they wanna see the options and they wanna put pressure on Democrats to step their game up. And maybe Republicans have an opportunity here. They cannot let go. What's your advice to Trump? My advice to Trump? Just to be himself, to be, um, relatable. Don't change. Don't switch up, because they're trying to take you down here. You got out of the president, you know, you. You was in the White House. A lot of people wasn't. A lot of people want your spot. Come to the park and, you know, keep it real with the people. Just let us know exactly what you're gonna do for everyone. Not just the Hispanic community, not just the black And the minority communities. But for America. Because when America succeeds, we all succeed.",

Nikki Haley was given the perfect opportunity to do the right thing and say that she's supporting President Biden because she cares about democracy and she cares about America, but she chose not to. She chose to bow down to Donald Trump and all these MAGA lunatics. And remember, Donald Trump is the same person who made fun of her military husband who is serving abroad. She even went on to say that Donald Trump disrespected the sacrifice of military families, and yet she's voting for him. Trump is also the same guy who called her bird brain on the campaign trail, sent her a bird cage after doing it, and she's still voting for Donald Trump. And finally, she's the same person who called Donald Trump a disaster and that so many Republicans are just too afraid to say that out loud and that she feels no need to kiss the ring. Well, now she's kissing the ring. She's voting for Donald Trump. This is the Republican Party. They don't care about our democracy, don't care about the rule of law, don't care about the people. All they care about is their Careers and bowing down to Donald Trump.",

He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today.",

I say to myself, you're a freaking genius. Hey, look, I had an uncle, my father's brother, who's the longest serving president. He's the longest serving professor in the history of MIT. He graduated. He was a phenomenal student, a real genius. Really brilliant guy. And, you know, I believe in the racehorse theory. Fast horses produce fast horses. He went to. Yeah. So, first of all, Donald Trump calling himself a genius when he's the same guy who looked at an eclipse without sunglasses on. His college professor called him the worst student he ever had. He doesn't know how to spell the word coffee is hilarious. But then he goes, my uncle's longest serving president. Then he pauses, he flails his arms around. He doesn't really know what's going on. Then he says, professor at MIT, this man is not fit to serve. If Joe Biden did this exact same thing, it would be front page news on Fox News for a week. But since Donald Trump does it and malfunctions a little bit, Republicans don't care. They brush it off. Trump is not well. He is not able to actually lead this country.",

Nation in the history of the world, but now we are a nation in decline. Yeah, like 30 to 40 seconds of silence. He's not saying anything. He's just frozen there. It seems like he had a bit of an emergency there or something like this. Reminded me of the time that Mitch McConnell froze in the podium, and I disagree with Mitch McConnell, but I'm thankful that he's okay. That looks very similar to me. He looked confused. He didn't really know where he was or what he was saying. I think this is incredibly concerning. Like, Donald Trump's ability to serve is certainly in question. He's stumbling over his words. He's falling asleep every single day in court, and he's doing stuff like this at his rallies. It's just happening far too often. So I don't know.

I think at one point you vowed never to come back to Minnesota after you lost the state in 2020. Is this a signal that you think you have a realistic chance to win the state of Minnesota in 2024? Well, I never said I'd never come back. I never even thought of that. I thought I won in 2020 easily. He actually did say it at a rally in Duluth in September of 2020 and appeared to be joking. I lose Minnesota, I'm never coming back. I don't care. I'm never coming back. Trump lost Minnesota by Seven Points in 2020. Yeah, so there's two options here. Either one, Donald Trump is lying. He knows that. He said he wouldn't come back to the state of Minnesota if he lost it in 2020, which he did. Or two, he's so mentally gone and as mentally deteriorated that he doesn't remember saying it. And I think both options are equally as likely. But I love to see it. I love to see Donald Trump getting fact checked in these interviews. Cause when he goes on Fox News or he goes on Newsmax or these other far right outlets, they never push back on his lies cause they're just a talking head for his campaign. He does this like independent media, these Smaller news channels. He gets fact checked like he did right there. Donald Trump is a serial liar and he has to be called out for it.",

Talks in a way that it's almost hard to follow anymore. No, I'm serious. Yeah. Turns up I'm gonna be a dictator on day one. Saying that what he's gonna do is break the tradition over 100 years ago.

Someone tried to assassinate the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, shooting him five times after a political event. He's currently in the hospital recovering from surgery and is expected to live in the United States. Another barge crashed into another bridge, this time in Galveston, Texas. The bridge remains standing, but the barge was carrying 30,000 gallons of oil, which is now leaking into the surrounding waters. The reported reason for the accident is that the current was bad, the tide was high, and the captain just lost control. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinkin announced today that the US would be sending another $2 billion worth of aid to Ukraine. And it's still pending congressional approval, but the Biden administration has announced a plan to send another billion dollars worth of weapons to Israel. Follow me if you give a shit. I have an additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine. And we put this together in a first of its kind, uh, Defense Enterprise Fund. And it has three components. Uh, one is to provide weapons today, uh, so this will assist Ukraine and acquiring those weapons. Two is to focus as well on something that Demetro just talked about. Investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base, helping to strengthen even more its capacity to produce what it needs for itself, but also to produce for others. And Finally using this fund to help Ukraine purchase military equipment from other countries, not just the United States, for Ukraine's use.",

Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hadn't shown up for debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. Let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. And in addition to this video, Biden put out a statement saying that he accepted the June 27th debate offer from CNN. And he accepted the second offer from ABC to have a debate with Donald Trump on September 10th. And then, well, Donald Trump accepted the dates. Well, so there will be two presidential debates as of now. And President Biden is right. He beat Donald Trump in the debates in 2020, and he's gonna do it again in 2024. And look, my prediction is that Donald Trump is not gonna show up for these debates. He's a terrible debater. He's gotten significantly worse since 2016 and even 2020, when people see how crazy he is in comparison to Joe Biden, who has done a lot of good stuff and is sane, they won't like him very much anymore. So if Donald Trump doesn't show up, he'll look like a coward. And if he does, he loses. It's a lose lose for the Trump campaign. Biden just boxed him in.",

In fact, they're trying to pick the jury right now. But Bob Mendez is guilty as a motherfucker in spite of the fact that he's a Democrat and he will be going to jail. It's funny how it takes a back seat to all the other crazy bullshit that's going on. And that's one of the troubles with having Donald Trump in the mix. He overshadows everything. And there are things we should be watching out for, but he drags our attention away. So while we have a day off from the criminal trial in Manhattan district, you maybe need to focus on Bob Menendez, cause he is a problem. He is a grifter, he is corrupt, he's criminal and he's a Democrat. And he's currently on trial. Picking the jury. Now, the trial probably take four or five weeks, and that motherfucker is going to jail.",

Sometimes I wonder if Donald Trump's lawyers paid attention in law school. Here's a little tip for Donald Trump and his lawyers. If you don't want a case in New York City against you in criminal court, don't commit crimes in New York City, because that's where the alleged conduct took place. If he commits a crime in New York City, you're not gonna have a trial in Alabama. What? Like if you or I were to commit a crime on the east coast, you're not gonna have a trial on the west coast? That makes no sense. Like, basic stuff. And also for all the MAGA Republicans out there, Donald Trump's lawyers had a say in jury selection. They picked those jurors as well. So unless you think that Donald Trump's lawyers intentionally picked bad jury members to hurt him, then the process is fair, and Alina Haba and Donald Trump's lawyers should stop complaining.",

You're thinking back on all the years and the effort and the studying and the tests and the sacrifices that you have put in to get to this day, to finally receive your degree. And just before they start calling names to hand out degrees, this is the speech that you hear for the ladies present today. Congratulations on an amazing accomplishment. You should be proud of all that you have achieved to this point in your young lives. I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross the stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you're going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her location as a wife. And as a mother, I'm on the stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her location. I'm beyond blessed with the many talents god has given me. But it cannot be overstated that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in being class back in middle school. What? Converts to the faith, become my wife, and embrace one of the most important titles of all. Hole maker. Translation. Hey, ladies. Congratulations on all your hard work. You can come up here and grab your degree, but the kitchen and the man that you're supposed to make a sandwich for is back that way. You've made a bad decision. What was that? And how were people not stopping him? Oh, by the way, he is an NFL kicker. He kicks footballs for a living. Yeah. Would that make you upset, or is it just me?",

That those degrees ain't shit, and they need to just wife up and push babies out. This man is a professional football player. He can afford to have his wife stay at home and not work. Going to a college class and telling them that, really, it was diabolical what was done to you. You've been bamboozled. You shouldn't have gotten this degree. Like, does the college and understand that if you're telling people they shouldn't enroll and they should just wife up, that they're all lose money. And the reason we are seeing birth rates decline is because most people can't afford to fucking live, let alone live on one income.

If you look, you may see this. The new talking point going out is now about Donald Trump's mental faculties. Not what I have noticed that I'm gonna say. What I observed is that they can't come up with their own talking point. They have to mimic. Because for forever we've been talking about Joe Biden's mental health. So now they have to try and mimic because we get a lot of traction because it's true. Um, not too much for them. So just go take a look, check and see if I'm wrong and see if I'm right about the fact that they're only talking about its mental faculties now.",

It means a right to exist regardless of what sector you're from. My intention is to never offend anyone. I want every soul in this arena to feel the reflection of love. But there's innocent humans out in Gaza getting murdered with our dollars. And those precious human lives are an extension of us. I can't get up here in a fur coat, jump around and pretend while in my gut and the ancestors yelling you better step up for us and sisters so much. And my perspective is one that saying free Palestine is also rooted in your Protection, my loves. And there isn't a drop of anti. Again means never again for all. Have we not Learned the lessons, my love? The self centering around what is potentially threatening to us is actually at the root of what disconnects all of us. The word genocide is such a point of contention for some that it's more hurtful than seeing dead babies getting pulled out of the crumbled cement in the dust. Comparative suffering leads to believing the lie. There's a them and there's a us. It's a lie. We don't own this earth. We're just guests here, my love. And at some point in time we drew lines in the MUD based on the colour of our skin, the gods we worshipped and The divine up above. And historically, we've exploited black and brown bodies to climb up the rungs. But the latter doesn't work when it depends on the oppression of some. Hmm. Hmm. And I've been hearing the earth cry lately. Yeah, the deepest cries. My, oh, my, what have we done? We got some work to do to unlearn and rewire the plugs that are short circuiting in a selfish cycle. Than we're blind to the drug that we're all addicted to. Me, myself, I. And not us. In this moment in time, we're being called to rise and become. See ourselves in the pain of others and not separate from them. And i'mma say it till I die with my chest to the sky. Free Palestine!

Scientists are now warning that there's a giant invasive juro spider with 6 foot webs that could be poised to take over US cities. So fun. Thank you. If you don't know what a Zorro spider is, they're basically a species of orb weaving spiders, which is a group known for creating highly symmetrical circular webs. Cute. Also saying that your host spiders can build unique webs that could be more than 6 feet long and appear golden when they reflect sunlight. Okay, just to make this a little bit better for you, whenever the eggs hatch in spring, the baby spiders create parachute like webs that enable them to fly up to 100 miles away from where they were born. Doro spiders are actually supposed to be in Asia, but they were recently found in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China. Then by the way, experts are believing that these invasive individuals were accidentally brought to the US inside a shipping container. So as of right now, these spiders have been spotted in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee. And they've also been spotted in Alabama, Maryland, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. So good luck. I give you these news roundups every day, so make sure you add me and come back to me tomorrow.",

So he would have no problem going to trial because he's gonna be exonerated, right? He doesn't need any policy blocking it from happening. Oh, wait. Donald Trump knows he's guilty, and he needs somebody to step in to save him. He is quite literally trying to get the government to interfere with his trials, something we don't do here in the United States of America.

    "voice_to_text": "What happened to men pursuing girls? Are we really asking this question? When was the pivotal moment that a man chose to not go after a girl anymore and put in any effort? I don't think there was a pivotal moment. However, there's been lots of little moments that have added up to a large awakening of a lot of men in regards to whether or not it's worth it to chase women. Seems like guys can just put the bare minimum and not even really put an effort anymore. They don't really care to. Well, what's considered to be the bare minimum seems to change on a daily basis. So how can anyone truly know what the bare minimum even is? why don't girls just go and make the first move and make the effort? That's an excellent question indeed. Why don't they? Did it become a thing now? It's like roll reversal where they expect girls to be making the first moves, yearning for a guy and chasing him. I imagine that happens somewhere around the same time that a lot of women were indicating to men that they want them to leave them alone. So. And a lot of cases, they got exactly what they asked for. That is, I feel like the downfall of why it's so hard to meet someone. Cause men don't put an effort anymore, don't care to put an effort. But why should they when the possible benefits of pursuing women Are often far outweighed by the risk that they undertake in pursuing those same women. It's honestly just not worth it for a lot of men to pursue women, especially when so many women want to be seen as independent and left alone.",

I mean, they were like, Donald Trump is gonna win, because, I mean, look at the size of all his crowds. And then he lost. And now they're excited because Lawrence Taylor endorsed Donald Trump. Registered sex offender who pled guilty to horrible acts with underage girls endorsed Donald Trump. I mean, listen to this again. Guy who is currently on the registered sex offender list got brought up on stage, paraded around by Donald Trump, and endorsed him. And that was a shining moment to the Republican Party and Magus.

So this is a map of the swing state of Wisconsin, and it shows you all of the different field offices the Biden campaign has opened in different counties in the great state of Wisconsin. And, of course, they've opened a lot of offices in democratic counties, such as Milwaukee right there. You can see some here up there as well. But only 14 out of the Biden's 46 field offices are in counties that he won in 2020. The other 32 are in counties that Donald Trump won, making inroads with a lot of the Trump voters and the independents who lean more conservative. And on top of this, Biden has more campaign staff and more field offices in Wisconsin and in every single swing state than Donald Trump and his campaign does. Biden campaign is quite literally squeezing Trump and his campaign of all their resources. They're making sure to hold down the democratic counties, make sure to win those votes, but they're also going after Trump voters. And these moderate Republicans and these independents live in these more conservative counties. Donald Trump has not made the same outreach. And of course, on top of this, Biden and his campaign have a lot more money than Trump and his campaign, allowing them to do stuff like this. The Trump Campaign is spiraling",

So recently, a portal was installed in Dublin in New York, and it's supposed to act as a live camera between both locations. But it hasn't even been four days since it was installed. And we had a woman get arrested because of the portal for blocking people from seeing the screen. We had a flip off battle between Dublin and New York where people were flipping each other off, which started on Dublin side. A man also decided to do this in front of the portal, surprising everyone on the New York side. And now, out of disrespect, someone decided to show a picture of September 11 on Dublin side again. This all happened in under a week, and they're contemplating on doing something back to Dublin because of this. Many are also wanting the portal to be removed, specifically. Typically after this incident, now people are not happy. And all the problems we had regarding the portal surprisingly seem to be coming from Dublin. These problems, however, were anticipated, and it's the reason why the portal won't be up for much longer. Right now, it's scheduled to be removed in November. And many are glad that it's gonna be gone since it's been causing nothing but problems. And who knows, we might be getting the removal date even earlier if something crazier happens.",

And I can guarantee you there hasn't been an administration turn the clock back on women's rights like the Biden administration has. And then she goes on and gaslights and demonizes half the women in this country. Uh, and therefore, any woman who has any sense of self respect, autonomy, agency, independence, and values freedom needs to understand there's only one choice in this election, and that's Joe Biden. So that's our pregame speech. If you don't vote for Joe Biden, you're not a woman, you lack self respect. But it's other people that are turning the clocks back on women's rights.

The video is partially blurred. The deputy appears to step to the side and knock. Seconds later, Forston opens the door, holding a handgun at his side that was legally owned according to his family. The deputy orders him to step back and then fire. Occaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aiden says his department released the video to be transparent. I want to assure you that we are not hiding, covering up, or taking action that would result in a rush to judgment of Mr. Fortson or our deputy. Fortson's mother, says her son was facetiming with his girlfriend during the shooting. A portion of that Facetime video, which appears to be after the shooting, was released by the family's attorney. Law enforcement can be heard talking about Fortson's injuries. The subtitles were added by CBS News. They just see. Oh yeah, he shadow. He shadow. My baby was shadow. Fortson's family claims the deputy had no reason to go to his apartment. The sheriff says his deputy went to the apartment he was directed to. In other words, contradictory accounts. Lawyer Ben Crump represents the family. Roger was the best of us. He was the best America had to offer, and they stole his life. The very people who were supposed to protect and serve him took Him away from Mika and their family. Investigator is now looking into this shooting. The deputy who pull the trigger has been placed on administrative leave. Nora Marks Rossman. Thank you.",

Do you understand the difference between local and federal government and the responsibilities of each? It matters. listen to this video. Let me know your thoughts.

    "voice_to_text": "So this person asked me, how did Obama and Clinton make my life better? Here's the difference between me and you and how we think. I understand that a president is not here to make my life better. I understand that a president is put in place to make conditions for the country better. So expecting a president to do things that benefit you is the first misconception of how government works. Um, you are actually supposed to make your life better. What have you done to make your life better? What has your mama done to make your life better? What has your daddy done to make your life better? And if you wanna look at your situation in particular, what has your local government done? And do you know who your local government officials are? Do you vote in local elections? What have they done to make your life better? While you worried about the president, let me give you a few reasons why being involved in local government has a more profound impact on your life. Services such as education, transportation, waste management, public safety, all of those things happen with local government. How those departments run are local governments. Those are local issues. Local government, they are more responsive to your concerns about any of those services that you should be getting. They're more responsive to homelessness in your community. They're more responsive to, you know, educational concerns that you have in your local community. Local Government manages budgets that impact the services that you are talking about. Infrastructure, education, special programs, homelessness, the police department, the fire department. How money is spent in your local community, that is a local government problem. That is what you need to be concerned about. How is local land being used? Parks, quality of life, services for seniors, services for the disabled, homeless services. All of those things are community development issues that need to be taken up with your local government. So if there's something that is not happening, then you are barking up the wrong tree when you are talking about the president. The president has no authority about what goes on in your local community. So when you're asking, what has Obama done for me? What has Clinton done? What has even Trump done? What? I live in this city, so this is what I'm concerned about. I'm not expecting them to make it good here. That's actually the residents here. That's. That's our job. It's to hold local government accountable. Okay, local. Are the streets paid? Is there trash all over the place? That is a local government issue. I worry about people that think that the president is supposed to be making things better for them. First of all, it negates the responsibility of you and your family to make things great for you and your family. I am a huge advocate of local government engagement because that is where the change starts. And That is where the biggest impact happens. Don't complain about it unless you are willing to do the work to help fix it. And local government is where the change begins.",

According to the latest reports, Donald Trump has been announced as the keynote speaker at a Minnesota fundraiser called the Reagan Dinner, which takes place on the exact same day as Baron's high school graduation in West Palm Beach, Florida. In other words, Donald Trump lied to Judge Marshawn to try to get out of court for that day, claiming he had to go to Baron's high school graduation. But now it is revealed that he's going to be attending a fundraiser instead in Minnesota to raise money for his corrupt and crooked presidential campaign. What a terrible father Donald Trump is.

Living paycheck to paycheck your whole life and being in debt your whole life should be considered poverty. But it's not. And I know this is gonna hurt a lot of Americans, but it's the truth. The US system wants you to spend every waking moment of your life working and paying into a system that will never benefit you. Slaving away your whole life just to be retired for a measly 10 years.

Going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sentence. The last thing I want to do is put you in jail. This gag order. He understands and sees that the 1,000 dollar fines is not really making any difference and knows, though, that he has a job to do in spite of how difficult the decision may be, he said. Although he is not putting him in jail for now, it seems to be yet another threat for the former president to not continue to violate this gag order. We're awaiting that official decision, Mika, because it was handed over to both the prosecution and the defense. They did not read that from the bench. When we get it, I'm gonna bring it to you, but nonetheless seems like the judge is already willing and prepared to put the former president in jail if he continues to violate the gag order. But again, understanding the gravity of that situation and really what it would go into and making that decision happen.",

Actually, I'm kind of surprised I haven't, but I have been busy and sad and uh, just whatever. So i'mma share this with you. I took this video at 3:43. So at three forty three PM. This is me taking this from my front door of looking south as the storm came in. I was in my basement at three forty six PM when it was going over my house. So this is what the storm looked like. Um, it was supposedly really wide, um, which is why I think it didn't feel like it was actually a tornado. Because it was so wide it wasn't like a funnel like you normally would expect it to be. Um. And yeah, people, I said it was the E F 5. That's what I read on Facebook the night it happened. And then yeah, I think it was a E F 3. At this point, I don't know, I don't care. All I know is that I live through a tornado and a tornado went over my house. I don't care what the rating is, and I don't even know what the ratings mean, so whatever. But here's what it looked like right before it hit my neighborhood. Look at this. Oh my god! I Shouldn't be outside. Oh, my god. Holy fucking shit. Oh, my god. It's, like, totally spiraling.

I hope people really do buy this book and they find out the truth of this story, because the truth of this story is that this was a working dog and it was not a puppy. Yeah, she's using the death of her dog that she caused to sell books. Disgusting, reprehensible. Nobody's buying your book. Stop. Nobody's buying your book. Nobody wants to hear about this.

You're learning. He cares about himself, not us. Sioux Falls. Thank you very much, Sioux Falls. We've all had parents who we loved, but who changed over the years. Needed help, needed understanding, needed care. Including Obama. I'll tell you what. You take a look at Obama and take with Trump. It's happening so fast. We can all see it. Now you do, too? Yeah. Yikes. Donald Trump is certainly not the same guy he was in 2016 or even 2020. The rapid decline we've seen in the past couple of years has been incredibly concerning. He's stumbling over his words, he's confusing people. He's falling asleep in court. I mean, this guy is not fit to serve. He is not the energetic guy that the MAGA cult makes him out to be. If Donald Trump can't stay awake in court, then how do we expect him to Be able to wake up at 3:00am and take that phone call and be able to head down to the situation room and deal with whatever's happening around the world or in the country. I certainly don't think he can do that. Trump is certainly not all there, and I hope, I really do hope that the Republicans can come to terms with that and be honest about it.",

This one in the middle being the incumbent. The election is next week, next month in may. All three of them, at a debate, agree on one particular thing, and that is that the country has a right to deport undocumented immigrants. The country is sovereign and has a right to protect its borders with Haiti. Why do all three of these presidential candidates agree? Because if they dared disagree, they know that they'd be going against the entire populace of the Dominican Republic. They would be going against the will of the people in the United States. We don't have a will of the people anymore. We have a will of the left and a will of the right, and we stand on each side of it and shout at the other side. Here there's unity. There's a sense of nationalism and a sense of patriotism. I hate all those words. Get, get bad raps and those that. That unity amongst the people creates actual logic amongst your political candidates. We don't have logic amongst political candidates the United States, because the people are illogical. A lesson once again from down here in the Dominican Republic on how you do it, how you unify as a people and how you recognize that you're a country with rights and a country needs to protect its borders, period.",

And I wanna tell you, I think it's good that America witnessed all of that. And the Democrats said his name over and over again. They said Hakeem Jeffries because they wanted to elect him speaker.

I think the American people, by the way, who I represent, I think the American people need to see a recorded vote of. Do they. Does Congress. Does the members of Congress support the UNIT party?

Absolutely calling it. I can't wait to see Democrats go out and support a Republican speaker and Have to go home to their primaries and have to run for Congress again. Having supported a Republican speaker, a Christian conservative. I think that'll play well. I'm excited about it, and I also can't wait to see my Republican conference show their cards and show who we are, because voters deserve it. Is the Republican Party has.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on Wednesday vowed to force a vote next week on Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s (R-LA) ouster, setting up a scenario in which Democrats will provide the votes needed to save a Republican speaker\u2019s job.   \u201cI think the American people need to see a recorded vote,\u201d the Georgia firebrand told reporters. \u201cI think every member of Congress needs to take that vote and let the chips fall where they may.\u201d   Hardline Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated with Speaker Johnson, pointing to him frequently turning to Democrats for their support in passing key legislation like Ukraine aid, government funding and FISA warrantless surveillance.   \u201cMike Johnson is giving them everything they want,\u201d Rep. Greene said. \u201cI find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson. And you want to know something? I want to see it happen.\u201d   Rep. Greene initially filed her motion to vacate last month, but held off on triggering a vote, trying to use it as leverage to wield influence over the speaker. When she makes the motion \u201cprivileged\u201d next week, it will require the House to act on it within two legislative days.   The House will likely vote on a motion to table the motion to vacate, which will require a simple majority to shelve the effort.   So far, only two other Republicans have joined Rep. Greene\u2019s effort \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie (KY) and Paul Gosar (AZ) \u2014 but given the GOP\u2019s very slim majority, that would likely be enough to strip the speaker of his gavel absent Democratic support.   House Democratic leaders on Tuesday announced they would vote to table the motion, saying it was time to \u201cturn the page\u201d on the chaos in the House that\u2019s been driven by the hardline faction of the Republican conference.   Rep. Greene acknowledged her motion is likely to fail but said it would serve to get lawmakers on record.   \u201cIf this vote fails and the whole conference, the whole Congress, supports the \u2018uniparty,\u2019 let me tell you something, that is not a failure, it\u2019s a win for the American people because that\u2019s a list of names,\u201d she said.   #marjorietaylorgreene #speakerofthehouse #mikejohnson #cspan  ",

like the actual integration of being kind do you know what I mean that's what we get fooled by politicians all the time because we'd rather see them do these things like oh look at their displays of niceness you know their tones and all their promises instead of like when it comes down to action the reason like I get like so heat up about this is because she proved me absolutely right I thought I was going crazy when it came down to the strikes you know what happened during the strikes okay so whenever there's like all these trucks going on like writers blah blah blah I'm like I'm a member of unions you know above anyone else Drew Barrymore should have known better she basically like stabbed everyone in the back you know what I mean and she continued on with her show and did not stand in solidarity with like the fellow like artists that like worked for her you know and that's crazy because number one she drew Barrymore she's like an actor she should have known better you know what I mean but number two the entire premise of her show the entire point of her show is that but we're having these conversations and we're listening in a different way like we're having real conversations and so I'm gonna get real and so to literally be that performative about it you know what I mean to put on that display and then to go on like when the time came and it mattered with action to sell out your own people and step over the picket line and like that is that is so low key crazy like that's actually wild because that's when it matters you know what I mean like that's the actual integration of like your knowledge of intersectionality and like nuance and everything and that is what happens that's why we get duped by politicians all the time like that that's that is like so crazy to me you know and I remember thinking that I was this is why I'm so hesitant and like very like wary of people that are so performative about like being you know announcing the essence of who they are because here's the thing like if you really are the essence of something you don't have to go around like announcing it all the time kind of like how really powerful leaders don't have to yell they can just whisper because everyone knows they're powerful you don't have to go around being like oh I'm so vulnerable I'm so you know I'm so sensitive and I listen to people because the minute I see people do that it reminds me of church people that's the problem with religion you know what I mean like I don't need to know I don't need to tone police you like I'd rather just care about your actions you know what I mean I'm not going around getting offended by like your tone and it's also really crazy too because if you really think about it it's so emotionally manipulative because like you cannot demand emotional vulnerability from somebody do you understand what I'm saying like just because you're crossing your legs and just because you have a really sweet tone of your voice and everything that doesn't mean that like you're not also be some people are not ready for that you know like emotional vulnerability is not something that you can demand of somebody it's something you kind of have to earn there has to be like you know a transaction there right and so it is energetically and physically very akin to like asking these the manipulative and like emotionally leading questions almost trying to get somebody to have a breakdown like back in the days when they would interview Britney Spears and she would be asked questions like but aren't you really sad like you know what I mean it's the same thing body language wise we just haven't gotten to that point in like you know society yet to where you can see even on like some of the interviews she does people are uncomfortable because that is not everybody's like comfort level and like the quickest way to shut somebody down is to keep pushing and keep pushing especially if they're already climbing up you know what I mean and that level of unawareness on top of like these actions it's just it it it just follows my mind there's and you know what she said do you know what she said literally when people ask her why are you literally going against what seems like what your entire show is about your entire image and like not like going on with the show she's and I'm paraphrasing but she said something to the effect of either the world or like the country at this moment she was like because you know the world needs our show right now it it's needed like the grandiosity of that do you know what I mean like that's so dangerous and that and I call it every time usually the people that are that performative about like being like look at how I am look at how kind and vulnerable I am those are the ones that do those exact same kind of crazy things or when it comes down to like what really matters they like they don't stand behind what they stand for you know does that make sense to you it's like the grandiosity to literally be like our show is needed like that's that's why people do crazy things like we were just watching game of Thrones Khaleesi when you all of a sudden think that like you have like some higher mission and like oh it's different when I screw people over you know like like to think that uh it just and then to watch the amount of people all like on her show like in the audience just ooh and awe and fall for this performance like oh she's being so vulnerable and she's no actually she's invading like personal body space you know and if she really like understood the finesse of real journalism and like what it takes to be emotionally like aware and like then she wouldn't do that I don't know I'm just it just it's and my mom probably be one of these people not these members if she if she was still alive she probably be one of these people I'm not saying it's a bad thing like but it is crazy to me and it's not even about the Kamala thing and also like what did you think what did you think that Niffy was gonna do like",

    "voice_to_text": "There is nothing more that I love in this world than being right. Last October, I posted a video about why I decided to not go through with purchasing the home that I was gonna buy on a fucking I think was like a 6.5% interest rate. Even though mortgage lenders and realtors were telling me to buy because I can always refinance later, I did not go through with it because I did not wanna be house poor. Which is exactly what a fuck, what a what, what a fucking happened had. I went through with that. It is now about 6 months later, 2024. Where the fuck do y'all see Jerome, how about to cut interest rates? I'm only 25 recently, fresh 25 recently turned like two weeks ago, and even I knew this fucking economy was in the gutter. So for you guys who have been in this industry for over a decade, to sit here seeing the sign that y'all saw, and to still influence and persuade people to go through with purchasing these homes because you guys wanted to make a quick fucking buck, you're going to hell. It is now Q2 2024, and I've seen fucking maybe 20 tik toks about people either in foreclosure or about to go into foreclosure. This is why I always say it's so important to live below your means, because in reality, especially your middle class, we're all about a lay off away from going into foreclosure or Being evicted from our fucking homes, truly, especially in this fucking economy, is taking people damn near about a year to find a new job. And even then, when they do, it's not paying what they were getting paid before.",

The letter puts Fox on notice for litigation claims arising from the network's alleged, quote, conspiracy and subsequent actions to defame Mr. Biden and paint him in a false light, the unlicensed commercial exploitation of his image, name and likeness, and the unlawful publication of hacked intimate images of him. So, yeah, Hunter Biden is going after Fox News. And I imagine this is only the beginning because there are other right wing news outlets out there who have done the exact same thing.

Prominent members of the Kennedy family have rejected RFK Jr.\u2019s candidacy and disavowed some of his more controversial positions, particularly his anti-vaccine rhetoric.   Ms. Kennedy did not mention her brother by name but said \u201cthere are only two candidates with any chance of winning the presidency.\u201d   RFK Jr. noted the endorsement on social media and said he is \u201cpleased\u201d his relatives are politically active, calling it a \u201cfamily tradition.\u201d   \u201cWe are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI hold this as a possibility for America too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.\u201d   RFK Jr. is the strongest of the third-party and independent candidates, and while he stands no chance of being elected, both the Biden and Trump campaigns fear he could siphon votes from them in key states in November.   It\u2019s unclear who he would draw more votes from \u2014 his iconic last name has been synonymous with Democratic politics for decades, but some of his political positions track more closely with potential Trump voters. #kennedy #kerrykennedy #rfk #rfkjr #potus #joebiden #election2024 #cspan ",

    "voice_to_text": "Today I bring you a fresh book publishing scandal. For the Atlantic, the writer Tyler Austin Harper wrote an expos of the New York Times bestseller White Rural Rage, and he argues that the authors of this book conveniently misinterpreted research and data in order to prove their own thesis. I'm gonna focus on two main problems with the book White Rural Rage. The thesis of the book is that white rural voters pose a unique threat to American democracy. But as Harper points out in the Atlantic, the authors of this book never bother to define what the word rural means. The word rural is defined by different academic researchers in different ways, and the authors of this book, instead of picking one definition that would work for their argument, just decide not to choose a definition of all. So rural could mean anything. Avoiding giving a definition of what you mean by the word rural, which is in the title of your own book, Harper says, is like deciding to write a book about Irish people and then drawing on studies of Irish people from Ireland, Irish Americans, people who took a 23 and me test and Learned they were Irish, and people who like to get drunk in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day. The second big problem with this book is that to prove their thesis that the threat of political violence is particularly acute in white rural America, they cite an article titled The Rise of Political Violence in the United States that directly contradicts the claim they are making. This whole scandal reminds me of 2019 when Naomi Wolf had a book coming out about how gay men were treated in the UK in the 19th century. And then while she was doing this BBC interview, the interviewer asked her about her interpretation of this two word phrase that basically her entire thesis was based on, and she had completely misinterpreted those two words, meaning the entire point of her book was null and void.",

    "view_count": 935828,
    "voice_to_text": "How's this for saying the weird thing?: my favorite un-fun fact to bring up while in mixed company here in Washington state is the fact that we are about 50 to 75 years overdue for an absolutely mind fucking bendingly massive earthquake, that in every other iteration of its existence, has completely leveled the Pacific Northwest. See, about every 350 to like 500 years or so, the area just off the coast of Seattle known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone gets a little heify and releases anywhere from an 8.8 to a 10.2 magnitude earthquake. Granted, the 10.2 is a bit of an exaggeration, considering the largest we've ever recorded on earth is like a 9.5. But there have been like suspicions that there was at least a 10.0 somewhere in Alaska about 300 years ago  But the thing you have to remember about that magnitude scale is that it is logarithmic. Which means it builds on itself to basically make itself worse. And it's based on time, not shakiness. So that is to say that if a 7.9, which is the largest quake that has ever hit California, lasts for anywhere from two to three minutes, a 10.2 on that logarithmic scale could last up to 30 minutes. Just imagine what 30 minutes of shaking would do to the west coast of the United States. And not just the Pacific Northwest. About 7 out of 10 times that Cascadia goes off, it takes San Andreas with it. We're talking destruction on a literally fucking unprecedented scale. It will make Katrina look like fucking Babytown Frolics. And just like every other horrible fucking thing to befall the American public that has happened in last 20 30 years or so, we are doing nothing to prevent or predict it. Granted, there is no predicting or preventing earthquakes, but there are early warning systems, like the ones that exist in Japan and other nations on the Ring of Fire that are extremely advanced. Like in some parts of Japan with the really advanced monitoring um they can measure everything from like far off shaking to sea level drop and predict tsunamis and quakes to the point that they can tell surgeons to halt surgeries, and open elevator doors on the next floor, and instruct people to get to high ground and to brace for impact. We didn't even know the Cascadia Seduction Zone existed until the 1980s. Which means absolutely every single building that was built in the Pacific Northwest before like 1994 is not earthquake stable. Rhe estimate by FEMA is that up to 70% of dams, schools, hospitals, and like military complexes would collapse following this earthquake. FEMA also estimates that up to a third of the people in the Inundation Zone, which in some places in this destruction path could be as far as 30 miles inland from the coast, are going to be too old, too disabled or too injured by the earthquake to seek shelter, and to get to higher ground when the tsunami comes. A tsunami, mind you that could be up to 50 fucking feet in height in some places. So basically, they estimate that at least a third of the people living on the coast right now are going to die. And that's the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, this fucker hits in like the middle of summer, like on Memorial Day or fourth of July weekend, when everyone from surrounding areas has flocked to the beaches in Oregon Washington. Worst worst case scenario, it hits at night. But either way, in 2012, when interviewed, one of the heads of the Washington State Department of FEMA stated that if Cascadia were to go off in all of its glory and release the absolute like top top top tier of what it's capable of um that quote \"The operating assumption is that everything west of I-5 will be toast\". Like body recovery efforts, and that's it. I'm \"lucky\" to live in what they call the \"Inland Empire\". Which means all I have to worry about is a much smaller, much more diluted earthquake completely leveling downtown, because of all their fucking stupid un-reinforced masonry buildings. And like having no food or water for several weeks, and probably the Nazis in Idaho going apeshit. But absolutely all of that would be preferable to anything that is happening on the coast. Did I mention there's a one in three chance of the happening in the next like 10 years? The estimate used to be 1 in 10, in 50. Bu then about eight months ago, um the Cascadia subduction fault line out in the ocean started leaking what geologists call tectonic fluid, basically the lubricant on the inside of the fault line, which is an indication that shit in there is getting kind of tight. We've never seen this phenomenon before, except maybe right before really really really big subduction zone catastrophe earthquakes, like the 2011 T\u014dhoku quake in Japan. So that sped up the timeline a little. The point is, you could not pay me in solid gold bars to ever go anywhere fucking near Seattle, ever the fuck again. No part of the coastline of the Pacific Northwest is worth that risk. Call me fucking paranoid, but I'm too fat to run for high ground. I don't like earthquakes. But I do love telling all of these facts to the Seattle socialites who come to Spokane to flaunt their money, and make us feel like shit  and then just watching their pupils get to be like the size of dinner plates, and the horror like really fucking set in. Good luck, bitch! \ud83d\ude18\u270c\ufe0f",

But I'm back and I will be on for my 10 o'clock PM show tonight and every night until of course, TikTok suspends me again. But who cares? Judge Marshan just ruled that the trial will start on April 15th. Alright, so let's be clear. Who cares? It's a two week delay. Certainly a lot of wasted time. And the nice part about this ruling was Judgema Sean pointed his finger at who is the guilty party in this specific instance. And that of course being the Southern District of New York. The same group that believe themselves to be sovereign district. They believe themselves to be above anyone in anything. Now as far as that bond is concerned. So. Hundred seventy five million dollars still. Which Donald does not have the cash for. But he can certainly get the cash. I will tell you that the only bad part about that whole ruling is that the appeals court, first and foremost gave him this um. This decision. But more importantly, that it has prevented Tis James until. I don't even know what day. That they decided, but gave um. But gave them the ability to continue to operate this business, which we all know is nefarious. All right? That they gave them the ability to go ahead and to keep running, uh, until the appeal is decided. Down the road. Um, yeah. That's the only real true benefit that Donald Trump received today. The rest. Not a good day for Donald in New York. Good day for New Yorkers. And good day for justice.",

    "video_description": "The 2024 election is right around the corner and despite juggling a multitude of civil and criminal charges Donald J. Trump is still currently the frontrunner for the GOP. There has to be a reason and I am curious to why Trump is your cabdidate of choice. There are always three sides to the story, your side, my side and the truth. I have my side, there\u2019s no telling if we will ever get the truth, but what is your side? I am also seeking answers considering recent talks about how Trump may not attend the debate next week. Looking forward to continuing this conversation. \u270c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udcd6",
