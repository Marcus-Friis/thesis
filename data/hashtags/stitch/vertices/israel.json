Hamas is only one faction (from the culture of Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region) of Israel's closest enemies that wanna completely wipe them out Israel simply wants to remove them from power and before people start spewing the Hamas propaganda one has to consider how much the Palestinian people have suffered under the hand of Hamas Yes we want the safety of children but it won't happen until Hamas is gone",

tell you guys why most people who have reached the conclusion that they're not gonna vote for Joe Biden primarily I'd say about 60% of people who changed their vote away from Joe Biden is because of the war between Israel and Palestine specifically Gaza  completely understand what's going on in Gaza is an atrocity it is genocide there's no other way to put it and the fact that the United States is supporting Israel in this madness is outrageous and I don't blame anyone for choosing that to be their single issue voter deal deal breaker I get it but here is where I kind of come into complication when Donald Trump was president now I want you guys to think about this when Trump was president he moved our embassy to Jerusalem to do nothing more than antagonize the people of Palestine right to prove a symbolic point that Jerusalem belongs to Israel if you listen to the rhetoric of the Republican Party present time and I believe it is a reflection of how Donald Trump thinks all you hear the Republican Party say is support Israel without question we must throw all the support give them all the military aid financial aid at our disposal so that they can defeat the enemy in Gaza there is no one that I've heard thus far in the Republican Party that has tried to be a voice of reason as it relates to Israel and Gaza that to me lets me know Donald Trump would not just support Israel in their actions but in bolding them at least the Democrat Party if we just look at it from a bare minimum standpoint at least in the Democrat Party there are voices powerful voices that are calling out US support of Israel and the need to withdraw when Joe Biden spoke at Morehouse just a few days ago he said himself that he is working on a ceasefire granted a little too late an action should have been taken far sooner but I can at the bare minimum if I'm just grasping for things here respect that at the bare minimum this administration can recognise the wrong that is being committed I'm not saying that they moved as quick as they needed to but at least they recognise I don't believe that what happened with Donald Trump Donald Trump is the definition of I'm gonna dig my heels into the sand and I'm gonna dare you to move me he loves opposition and the amount of opposition to Israel that is growing in the United States would only push Donald Trump to support them more I guarantee it something else to think about and this is more on a domestic front overnight the Supreme Court turned women into second class citizens it happened because we had Donald Trump in office for four years and he had the opportunity to put not one not two but three conservatives on a Supreme Court that fulfilled the Republican Party's wet dream of overturning Roe v Wade really think about that do you really wanna give that man an opportunity to add another and another and another you never know what could happen tomorrow to any of these Supreme Court justices do you really wanna give a man like Donald Trump that opportunity do you really wanna give the Republicans as a whole an opportunity to push policies such as Project 2025 that would literally roll back the years that people like Martin Luther King Malcolm X and so many others fought for us to have greater freedoms project 2025 would roll that back overnight do you really wanna give the Republican Party that type of control and power and opportunity really think about this young voters Joe Biden tried to cancel student loan debt a lot of you guys when it didn't fall through blamed him when you should have been blaming the Supreme Court why because it is a super majority of conservatives on the Supreme Court who ruled that Joe Biden trying to overturn our cancel student debt was unconstitutional you put Donald Trump back in office kiss it all goodbye at least Joe Biden now is making incremental cancellations of student debt Donald Trump would do none of the aboves so my point here is yes what's going on in Gaza is terrible and US support for Israel is out of line and I don't stand behind it at all however I'll take that reluctantly because I fully understand the latter would make that vary issue 10 times worse and also ding us here in the United States over the head this is a man Donald Trump who said that on his first day of office he'd be a dictator that's not something the leader of the free world should be joking about a man who just recently released a campaign ad that had the words that we have not seen since the days of World War Two in Germany let that sink in let that really sink in at the type of person we're dealing with here and sure you guys can vote for a third party candidate but let's keep it a buck let's keep it a hundred here R F k has no viable path to the White House and sitting out out of an election what are you doing like what are you actually doing protesting protesting how by not voting you're not hurting anybody but yourself these president's former presidents are gonna go off and make millions you not voting ain't hurting nobody but yourself and that's the how fun thing on that"

    "voice_to_text": "That Israel had pulled out back in 2005 and hadn't had any involvement ever since. Literally no one is saying that, but you would know that because you don't like to engage with the other side and actually learn history. So what actually happened was Israel did pull out in 2005, forcibly removing 9,000 of their own settlers and citizens to with the army, with the IDF, and pulling them out of the of Gaza to literally give it. What also happened was Israel, Jewish businessmen in America paid those settlers for their greenhouse equipment so the people of Gaza could have infrastructure to grow their own, um, you know, vegetables and stuff. And they immediately. People from Gaza immediately went in and destroyed it all. Destroyed it completely. Then they elected Hamas to be their government. Hamas then killed Fatah, the people who they ran against, murdered them. Hamas then started attacking Egypt. But then they realized that, like, that doesn't really get international headlines. So instead of doing that, they started, um, you know, stockpiling weapons, shooting rockets to, um, uh, into Israel. Civilian populations in Ashkelone stay wrote, uh, large civilian populations, uh, all the way to TEL Aviv. They then spent the next 17 years building a vast network of terror tunnels, around 350 to 450 miles worth, which is double the size of the DC metro in half the space. Uh, and they committed massive attacks for literally years. 2,008, 2,010, 2,012, 2,014. I know I'm missing some. There was 1 in 2,011. Also, big one in 2,018, a big one in 2021. They sent over these balloons that blew up, uh, in fire, you know, because they wanted to make sure children got them, and then they exploded. So they would kill children. Um, they would constantly be doing stuff. So, you know what happens when that happens to sovereign territory? The country that you're doing that to? You know, basically build walls to make sure that that doesn't happen. They blockade the seaport to make sure that weapons aren't coming in but aren't being smuggled in. They still were. That still happened. They still managed to smuggle weapons in and all this kind of stuff. One of the things that come on state, actually, was when international aid built water pipes. They remove those pipes and turn them into rockets. So, no, no one's claiming that Israel did nothing from 2005 to 2023. But what Israel didn't do, which they should have done, was completely eliminate Hamas. And after October 7th, it's like, yeah, we have to go in there, because this cannot go on.",

    "voice_to_text": "I'm curious to know who you are talking about when you say your own people are you talking about the nation of Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region of Jordan whose patriarch was a twin of the Patriarch of Israel or are you talking about the Palestinians In both the Christian and Jewish Bibles, the Beduoins I'm talking about are the descendants of Esau who was a twin to his brother Jacob his brother Jacob was later renamed Israel these Beduoins who were closely related to the inhabitants of Israel have taken every opportunity to eradicate Israel and every Jew from the face of the planet including converts I bring this up because the Hamas covenant comes from this ancient cultural ideology the founder of Hamas comes from that culture because a lot of the Beduoins in the Negev of Israel today have historical connection to the Beduoins who lived in the Negev 2,000 years ago like Ismail Haniyeh does Hamas is built on the ideology of ancestral hatred against the Jewish people from Edomite people which are descendants of Esau the Bedouins who are indigenous the Seir region of Jordan has sporadically tried to be manipulate the plight of displaced Hellenistic and Egyptian communities living in the land after Israel was destroyed in 70 AD to eradicate Jews through pogroms over the last 2000 years since the destruction of Judea in the land of Israel so you have two different peoples on one hand you have displaced Egyptian displaced Hellenistic societies and Arabs who make up the concept of Palestine which is also how the original concept of the Philistines came into existence before they were destroyed by Babylon in the 6th century BC and on the other hand you have Beduoins indigenous the Seir region of Jordan who have manipulated the plight of displaced Hellenistic and displaced Egyptian communities to carry out multiple genocide attempts against Jewish communities over the last 2,000 years in the land who are now enacting their passionate hatred through Hamas before you bring up all the innocent civilians that have lost their lives because Hamas is so careless about human life that they use the plight of the Palestinians to exacerbate their propaganda let me reference October 7th (in the year 2023) and connect it to the second destruction of Jerusalem and 70 AD by Rashi's commentary to Amos 1:6 in the Bible as the Edomites took advantage of the plight of the people of Gaza in ancient times they would deliberately aid the Romans in going through city after city and Judea burning them down to the ground doing horrible things to the women and seizing anyone on the roads who tried to escape this is exactly like the attack on Hamas perpetrated on October 7th, 2023 these kinds of attacks have not only occurred during the destruction of the second establishment of the nation of Israel through Judea (in 70 AD) but even after Jerusalem was destroyed and the Beduoins indigenous to the Seir region have used empires that occupied and swept the land (such as Rome and the crusaders) to amass arms and power to carry out their genocidal hatred so when you tell Mosab Hassan Yousef that he's calling for the annihilation of his own people are you talking about those among the Beduoins indigenous the Seir region of Jordan who choose to become a maniacal homicidal sociopaths by forming and joining groups and government entities that want to erase Jews from the planet or are you talking about the Palestinian people Beduoins are some emotional people especially the ones I'm talking about who have twin driven instincts and feelings towards Israel you ought to meet one in person they aren't all bad some of them can be the most passionately loving people you will meet who choose to stand with Israel and see reason but it helps to be specific in your context and do actual research to help convince us you have any understanding of what you are talking about"

Tell me why you think that you are a victim in this whole situation. Random dude. Random white dude living in the west with all the privileges that come with that. So, yeah. Eurovision decided to use an anti booing system when they showed Ed and Golan's performances. The reason was so as not to influence the jury and televoders in their voting. Because as human beings, we tend to agree with other human beings, and if we see something get booed, we're more likely to boo it ourselves, and that would be unfair to the artist. And if you actually watched the whole Eurovision, you would have seen that Edin won the second most amount of televotes, meaning that the majority of people loved her performance. And the fact that there were some allowed bullies in the audience should not affect that, should not take that away from her. And the fact that you have the audacity to compare yourself to someone living in North Korea because you don't like a decision a music competition made, it's giving victim complex. It's. Oh, my god, no. Eurovision should not promote a bunch of bullies in the audience, especially when that bullying is political. And Eurovision does its best to be as anti political as possible. Now, of course there are going to be political parts of Eurovision, as You said. But have you noticed that not a single critique against Eden has had anything to do with her talent, has had anything to do with her musical or dancing or performance capabilities? And at the end of the day, the fact that she is such a talented performer showed because she got the second most televos. 323 televos. Not only that, but if you wanna talk about the Eurovision being messed up, the Eurovision being rigged, let's talk about how she broke the, uh, record for the most discrepancy between the jury votes in the televote because the juries were afraid to say Israel because of political reasons. If the jury's opinions actually reflected what people are thinking of their performances, Israel would have gotten way more. So maybe go see a therapist, cause this is not something you should be crying over. You're not in North Korea, I promise. I know it feels like you're being oppressed. You're not. It's okay. You don't. You're not entitled to watch Jewish girls be bullied. And I know you feel like you are. I know it's that, like, deep European whatever going on inside. But it's okay. You. You can chill. I promise. It's gonna be okay.",

    "voice_to_text": "A massive congratulations to Nemo for winning Eurovision. The song and the performance, epic. So well deserved. But what they're singing here is dizzy by Ollie Alexander. And you can hear it. Such a good song. Because it is such a good song. When I first heard it, I thought, wow, this could be a winner. But as we know yesterday, it got zero points in the popular vote, which was not deserved. But I do believe it's because of the raunchness of that performance. I was watching with my mum and she was like, well, they're quite athletic, but what are they wearing? And you can't get away from that visual and really listen to the song. I think the sound was also a bit weird. Um, so I do feel bad for Ollie. Um, he's very talented. I love. I love his performances generally. So, yeah. Um, is Eurovision political? I think it's become political in. In the widest scheme of things, but my top 3 actually were top 4, so the better songs do win. Ukraine slipped in there. I think that's political. It's an okay song. Israel being number five, uh, after getting nearly all of the top points in the popular vote, to me, is shocking and surprising. The song was okay, it's very Lorraine, but not my favourite. Um, so I think that's political. And I'm not gonna go more into that, but, yeah. Free Palestine."

My blood is boiling. This is so disgusting. They patted her down in the middle of the hallway for trying to protest against genocide, and they did it like it was nothing. That woman searched her about. I can't even count how many times she touched her chest, her private areas again and again and again when you can't even see anything. Like that is so disgusting.

I have done so much research on different religions ancient and new and they all have undeniable similarities. Also 2 things can be true at once. God can be all powerful and still abide by the rules of nature and spirit that were around long before our realm was created. This world is out of balance and it will be restored but people arent ready for that. There is a spiritual war beyond anything we could imagine happening right now and its manifesting in our physical world. God has his army and so does satan, some of us are alive and some of us have passed on to join the fight in spirit. I said this to say as a human race that was created from his essence, he does love us and wants us to love him. But it cannot be forced, that wouldnt be love it would be like a dictatorship. He wasnt solders that want to be with him not robots he just controls. This is why there are laws of spirit and nature that were here before time, before our realm, and even before our God. Remeber the mind is powerful and can grant you with whatever you wish. Anything yiu ask will be given if your mind, body, and spirit are a unified front #EmpressK #APTTMH #fyp #viral #foryou #athiest #spirituality #religion #israel ",

    "voice_to_text": "so this is where I draw a line saying Christ is king is not anti Semitic nor is \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05da which means Yeshua is the king or Jesus is king nor is \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7 that means Jesus is the Messiah It is incredible that people will try to use Muslims \"saying Christ is king\" in a comment section (on that tweet without contextual proof to connotation) to make it seem anti Semitic. You know in countries that Westerners look at as Muslim there are Christians there too and  \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 just means \"God is great\" or \"Praised is God\" or \"Blessed is God\"  (depending on context/ dialect/ scripture or even Aramaic phrases included in Arabic dialects) It depends on whether someone is saying that to praise God in the context of Islam or to praise God in the context of Christianity you will never know unless you know that person specifically and it is racist to assume someone who looks Arab saying \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 is automatically a Muslim that could be arguably an anti-Semitic view considering Arabs are Abrahamic descendants of Ishmael now for Christians across the United States I want you to know we in the messianic community stand with you besides rallying for jury nullification in jury trials and appealing all the way up to the Supreme Court if they try to bring people up on charges for it; while citing the First Amendment believing in the New Testament and believing Yeshua Jesus died for our sins and was resurrected from the dead is a branch of Judaism I would go all the way up to the international levels to advocate for any person who claims they are a Jewish convert even Palestinians who have trouble immigrating to Israel over any suspected Christian prejudice this branch of Judaism is speaking of is Messianic Judaism hello I'm a Messianic Jew I consider myself the same as a gospel believing Christian because I believe in the unmerited Grace that Yeshua Jesus gave us in accordance with Ephesians 2:8 in fact Christian and Messianic both have the same meaning and word root Christian means to Christen as with oil Messianic comes from the word \u05de\u05e9\u05d7 which means to annoint as with oil this word is one in the same our history as messianic Jews was firmly established almost 2,000 years ago in foundation during the time that the authors of the New Testament were alive fifty one days after our Messiah died on the day of the Passover sacrifice (John 19:14) people from every nation under the heaven were present in Jerusalem (Acts 2, 51 days after Yeshia died) to receive the Spirit of God that is the spirit of the Messiah who came and died for our sins on the day of Pentecost which is the Jewish festival of Shavuot by which converts and physical Jews became a part of the messianic faith and this receiving on the Spirit accordance with Acts 2:5 and Acts 2:11 I'm a messianic Jew who does not support the integration of heavy rabbinics into the doctrine of faith and encourage those who call themselves messianics or Christians to read the book of Galatians and also Matthew 23 and Jeremiah 23 to see what I'm talking about At a leadership level we are responsible to examine those doctrines and see if they are relevant to scripture but if they are not relevant with scripture and confuses the context of scripture in accordance with the Jewish Tenach (Torah, Prophets, Writings) and Jeremiah 8:8 and Jeremiah chapter 23 they are not from God and we do not count them now regardless of race or one status with conversion in an Orthodox synagogue or how they define a Jew race and ethnic status does not matter to us although we do not replace the nation of Israel I will make that clear this is not replacement theology and we do NOT embrace that we do not embrace that as someone who literally lives at the furthest reaches from Jerusalem in the world, literally the ends of the earth I believe even if someone lives so far away from Jerusalem or ethnically different than a Jew or Middle Easterner if they accept Yeshua as the Messiah they too are taking it to our faith and are given the same spiritual blessing of being delivered out from sin and from the confinements of sin of this earth the same way that Jews were taken out from the confinements in the land of Egypt we are Messianic we as messianic Jews keep the appointed times of Leviticus 23 practice physical circumcision and the dietary laws however we know that even as Moses received The 10 commandments on Mount Sinai it is also said in the same instance in Hebrew \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 -He makes unmerited Grace- Exodus chapter 20:6 \"He makes unmerited Grace to those who love him and keep his commandments\" Deuteronomy 6:4 - 8 tells us to love God with everything that we are John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God our commandment is to love and keep the word of God all 66 books as Messianic Jews Christians are grafted in and we are one in the same (Galatians 3:29) we came into the faith the same way the Christians did (Ethnic Jews who embrace the gospel of Yeshua (Jesus) - such as myself) as sojourners lost and the noble memorial of the price Yeshua (Jesus) paid for our sins delivered us out equally we are all strangers no one is better than the other because of his ethnicity. In the 37 chapter of Ezekiel, one of the infamous prophets of old Ezekiel, was taken out to a valley of dry bones by the hand of God and told to preach to an impossible situation and tell the dry bones that God's Spirit will come into them and they will live Ezekiel 37:4 - 6 so the dry bones became his flesh that is the nation of Israel coming together in 1948 but there was no breath in the bones (Ezekiel 37:8) so Ezekiel prophesied regarding the Spirit of God (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) as he was commanded by God to say to the Spirit of god (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) come from the four winds (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) [Holy] Spirit and breathe upon the slain so that they may live (Ezekiel 37:9 - 10) in the same chapter (Ezekiel 37) so let us speak the word of God and let us all come and look to the one that was pierced (Zechariah 12:10) for the transgressions of all mankind  that was set before us by the One who created us God knew man would make mistakes and that our greatest defeat is our own sin and it was necessary for Yeshua the Messiah to die we all pierced him as humanity (because our own sin is our greatest defeat) and anyone that believes in Him will not perish (John 3:16) but have everlasting life (John 3:16) John 3:16. We eulogize the price that was paid for our own sin as one eulogizes upon a firstborn upon an only child Zachariah 12:10 (and John 19:34 - 37) we remember our going out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05df \u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of confinements of this earth and its wickedness on our own (by our own choice) just as the children of Israel were delivered out from \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd the land of Egypt all the days of our life as it's written in Deuteronomy 16:3 in Hebrew let us rise up from this valley of dry bones as spoken by the prophets of old in the Spirit of god and in salvation as one every time someone comes to the Lord he rises up in a vastly and joins a powerful army that will not be defeated and more and more people will rise out of this valley of dry bones unto the coming of the Messiah himself.
