I know you will not shame me into voting for Joe Biden. I don't know if you've seen any speeches from the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, but we need to be worried about Congress. And just because I don't wanna vote for Joe does not mean that I'm gonna be sitting out this election. I will absolutely be voting all the way down the ballot. And also should be known, we do have other options. We don't have to vote for the lesser of two evil. We got Joe Stein, Cornell West, people who actually align with us. And who knows what will happen when it comes down to it? Shaming people is not the way. And also, old people die every day. So let's just continue to pray for that.",

    "voice_to_text": "They don't know, uh, very much at all about the history of the Middle East. One of the things I hate the most about government propaganda and stuff. Like one is obviously they just lying to you constantly. But two is how much they come after young people, call them stupid, because they know that historically, every single generation that comes next is more progressive and more progressive and more progressive. And obviously, this one that's currently here is very progressive. Um, I'm a millennial, but I adore Gen Z. I think they're great. I think they know. They're very accepting, let me put it that way. Um, and I am very passionate about education, and for them to champion it and then call you stupid is false. It's. It's. It's a ploy. It's obviously just gaslighting people into telling these, um, thinking that these kids are getting bad educations. But you can't champion higher education, tell kids they need to go get college degrees, and then tell them they're stupid. Because they did. You wanted critical thinking, and now you got it, and now you're mad. But that's all part of how America is gonna deal with education system. Public schools are going to get worse because they want them to get worse. They're going to get worse because they want them to get worse. Because they want to create tiny little robots that know exactly what they want them to know. Why they hate TikTok, so why they don't Care about fixing school shooting problems in your schools. Because they want you to be scared to send your kids to school, so they can change the education system. And I'll never shut up about it.",

Hi, I'm stitching this again because I see that you've doubled down, and quite frankly, you and the people that agree with you have been very discouraging. So I blocked you. But this video is for anybody who is thinking like this. Um, I just wanna call you in for a little bit. If your thought process is, why are these people putting celebrities over Palestinians? Why are you not calling in the government or the politicians whose jobs are to actually stop this genocide instead of focusing on celebrities? I'm here to tell you, where have you been in the last, I don't know, eight months? There have been demands for change, there have been protests, there have been email sent calls. So much accountability towards politicians that have been elected to represent us within the government, and they have continuously failed. And why is that? Because despite them being public servants, they are in the pockets of the ultra wealthy. You claim that this movement is simply for our security complex, but you fail to recognize the security complex within yourself because you think that we haven't thought about these things. You think that our intelligence is so low that we are conflating celebrity power to government power. But what you are failing to see is that the government does not care about its people. That has been very clear. They care about the wealthy. And most of the wealthy people are invisible. The visible section of the wealthy class are celebrities, are influencers, are people within media who have platforms, speak on this. And yet they choose to continue to flaunt their wealth in a time of crises where the wealth gap is getting bigger. The middle class has effectively disappeared. Inflation has increased astronomically, and there are humanitarian crises all over the world. Celebrities have built their wealth off of parasocial relationships. To the common day people, large corporations know this. Politicians know this. That is why they use celebrities as armor. That is why they use celebrities to influence us, to buy things, to vote for things. So when the government fails to listen to its people, who else do? The common day people have access to celebrity. To say that the everyday people withholding their support, their money to influence celebrities to use their platform for good is ineffective and lazy. Quite frankly, lacks imagination of thought.",

    "voice_to_text": "I would give anything for us to stop misquoting what happened to Kitty, because the thing is, people actually did call 9 1 1 for her the first time she was attacked. At least one father and son duo did call 9 1 1. And remember, this was in 19, like 64, before there was an actual 9 1 1 number. This was back when you had to call your local police precinct and identify yourself to the police. Right? So this father and son duo did call 9 1 1, and by the time they called, she had stopped being attacked. Her attacker moved and got away, so they reported it as if the attack was over and as if she was fine. Meanwhile, she had crawled away inside a building, and so police didn't really come out to check cause it sounded like the attack was over. And again we talked about the bystander effect is if there's a group of people all looking at each other and going, I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not gonna do anything. And the Kitty Jeannouise murder was a series of isolated people at 3:00am, who may or may not have been awake, may or may not have heard what was happening, and who just may not have been aware of what was happening and might not have known to call for help given what was going on. And I really don't think that we should be using the bystander effect. As kind of a reason to explain what is or is not happening. Like regarding response in Gaza, this is more of, like a collective action problem. It's more of a misinformation and disinformation problem. Like, people know what's happening, and people are acting. So, like, even now with Gaza, it's not that we're all standing around looking at each other. This is a problem that is due to poor coordination. It is a lack of communication laterally among ourselves. And it's an inability to coordinate upwards with the people who are actually responsible for fixing the problem. Just like it was with Kitty Cheney's, right? Like, 1964, there was no 9 1 1 to call. And even if you did call, it was really difficult for you to have all the facts, all the information, and to actually report to the police. Hey, this woman's being attacked. Oh, she crawled into a building. Oh, god, the guy came back! He's attacking her again. You don't have all the information to report. And even if you do, there's no guarantee that the people who you call are going to responsive. And you're certainly not going to your neighbors and calling your neighbors and getting them on board. Right? Like, we're all just individuals acting individually. That's the problem. That's why it's hard to get things done. It's because of the lack of lateral communication. It's the fact that we're not acting as a group, not that we are acting as A group and then choosing not to do anything",

But we've already raised about 100 to about 200 dollars for Ahmed, the family that I have been assigned and trying to support get out of Gaza. If you want his information, go check the link in my bio. It's all there and you can see it all anytime. Well, I'm not a huge creator. I'm just so proud of our community and how much we sort of rally together behind this. And for those who don't know, I go live every single day playing cozy chaotic games here on TikTok. And a purple app that shopper name nameless, and I talk about Ahmed, but also have a great time and we raise money for him and for Palestine. So please come check it out. Not only that, but everyone who donates will be entered in for a giveaway to win a crochet project like this that I make. So I will literally give you my eggplant. No pun intended.",

However, I found it incredibly racist from a lot of people, especially online, that they forget and they think this is a take, but there are Arab and Palestinian and Middle Eastern in general LGBT people. Just because the majority in a certain area doesn't really fuck with it doesn't mean that they don't exist there either. Do you seriously not think there are people stuck right now in Rafa that are LGBT? Plus like hello? Are you. Are you? What racist thoughts are in here? Like I am an Arab woman myself. I am North African and just because my country is not messing with the LGBT laws doesn't mean that none of us are. this is such a ridiculous take that pro Israeli people have like oh you wouldn't even be allowed to be gay there. Israel has still not legalized gay marriage either, so what the fuck are you speaking about? Anyways, people in Rafah need your help. Who the fuck cares what their laws used to be? These people do not give a fuck about LGBT laws. By the way, these pro Israel people screaming about this constantly oh you wouldn't be allowed to live there, forgetting that LGBT people are alive in every part of the world, no matter what the laws are. They're just using you and Your feelings towards the LGBT community. To fight to. To. To. To. To. To make your brain sick, basically, to believe. Yeah, you know what? These people, for some reason, deserve this. You know what? They don't. Their laws did not support the LGBT community, so F these people. What? Again? Open your brain. Do you seriously think our people cannot be LGBT? Like, are you? Who the fuck. What do you care? Why do you. Bro, this is not about that right now. It's about saving lives. Oh, my God. And stolen land."

No, you paid $75,000 to go to a rich people's party where they all get to pat each other on the back and congratulate each other for being rich. And you paid God knows how much for that rank looking dress. And then the cherry on top of that shit cake, you decided to make this video. I wonder how many families could have left a genocide with that amount of money. I wonder how many people you could have helped. I wonder how many people you could help, uh, just by making a video asking for people to help. Because your videos get over a million views. You've got 10 million followers. Just one video could raise tens of thousands of pounds or dollars to help people. But instead, you chose to do this. So when you're old and grey and your grandkids find this video, because remember, stays on the internet forever. And you're gonna have to explain why you were on the bad people's side.

I cannot emphasize enough how much it does not matter if this creator, like she said in her comment section, only made this video using this sound because her dress was Marie Antoinette inspired. Whether it was your money or not, it cost $75,000 for you to be at that event last night. $75,000 that could have been used to help countless families trying to just survive. And not only does your presence at this event distract from the attack on Rafa, but then you go out of your way to callously make a video that perfectly exemplifies the disparity of empathy and support that exists within the class divide. And then you get upset with people and delete comments when they point that out. You are actively on the wrong side of history."

Um, there are a lot of Palestinians living in America because their parents fled or their grandparents fled. And so the kids of those people are legally tax paying citizens now in America. Right? It's one thing to be an American and know that your tax money is going to fund a Gen a Gen Gena side. Um, it's another thing to know that you have no choice but to pay money which you know is going to be used to buy bombs that are gonna be dropped on your family members. I, I realized this a few days ago and I still can't comprehend it cause I, I would be. Haha, I think I'm going to a mental coma. Um, I, I can't imagine what that must feel like. They have no choice in that. That's, that feels like a form of psychological torture. That's. It's just so insane. I just. You know, when People say there were Spain. You can't imagine. This feels like one of those, like, I, I. Oh, man.",

Schmatzee Germany was only possible because of what was happening in the United States of America. The man with the funny mustache and a lot of other Germans felt inspired by what Americans did to the Indigenous population as well as to Black Americans. it's wild to see like a well-oiled machine just like pumping out f6sc1sm and I laugh so I don't cry like I don't think it's funny please do not get it twisted and maybe read up on it because that's not a hidden part of history it is actually factual  all of these things bl33d into each other if I'm going to apply WS logic to this WS basically meant that you take away somebody else's \u270b\ud83c\udffb  and make them less than  so obviously what they did here they took away the \u270b\ud83c\udffb of a certain population (and others) that lead directly into the Shoah that's how they did it. and what's even worse is like feeling like there's nothing you can do about it right you just kind of have to watch in horror like a car accident or something and this is not a video I'm like what would you do what you would have done during the H0l0c6ust  or anything like that like this is an additional note out of the editing suite because I felt like I have to add more why not? why isn't this the right time to actually ask yourself the question? because if you already see it happening and you recognize it for what it is why aren't you doing anything? feeling helpless and powerless is one thing but now it's the right time to actually do something. get your \ud83c\udf51 up help the students help someone  heck, build community inside your community talk to people this is the right time instead of making that video and then just laughing about it even though it's not funny but it's just wild like to see in real time like oh, so that's how H got to be H and how 6 million people got unalived and this is not a video I'm like what would you do what you would have done during the H0l0c6ust? if not now, when is the right time? this was the right question. why are you saying this is not about that? because it is about that. it is. it's not really a surprise to me that a \u270b\ud83c\udffb American woman would basically think like that it's no surprise because apparently, Americans have not been told about how what was happening in their country  influenced another country in a different part of the world. but that's something that history classes have yet to rectify. because it is a fact.  anyone who wants to f1ght me in the comment section my \ud83d\udeab button is active"

Conversely if you went into the CPS, or if you're looking after a client who has a claim, you are taught how to twist language. You are looking for every comma, every full stop, is the word may, could, should, must? Every single word matters. It makes me very good in having arguments with people, but it also opens your mind to the English legal system, which covers England and Wales. Scotland is slightly different. I cannot speak for Scotland because I was not trained in Scottish law, but in England and Wales, you have to be a linguistic to really become successful, and that as boring as MUD that Keith sounds, he is very good at twisting language.
