Look, Corey, I don't know you very well, but you're a creator with a pretty good sized platform. And according to your bio, you talk about mom stuff. So I just want you to take a second and look at this from a different perspective. Let's just reverse the genders here. Say that there was a man that was on this platform and he made a video about how being a single dad is so hard. And he has take care of himself for his birthday because nobody cares. And he used that post to gain shit loads of sympathy and make shit loads of money. But then we come to find out that his kids have been taken away from him because he's a criminal. We also find out that he owes more than $20,000 in back child support. And that the only reason he doesn't have visitation of his kids is because he won't pay his child support. Then we also find out that he con people out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by faking having cancer. You making this video defending him, you still saying the same things you said in this video? No, you wouldn't and you know it."

    "voice_to_text": "It makes me question, what the hell do our government be doing with our tax dollars? They funnel the money overseas, whether through direct contributions to a country or through our nation's largest weapons manufacturers, who then funnel that money back to our elected leadership through lobbyists. And they make themselves rich. And the funny thing is, they don't hide it. Like, they're not hiding the fact that they're doing this. I mean, they make it very fucking obvious this is what they're doing. Like, take Lockheed Martin, for example. Last year, the United States government spent $47.7 billion with Lockheed Martin, which, insanely enough, represented 93% of Lockheed Martin's revenue for the year. Without our money, they wouldn't exist. But anyway, after the United States government gave them 47 billion, lucky then proceeded to spend more than a hundred million dollars lobbying the government. Those are all in the forms of gifts, trips and all kinds of other bullshit for elected representatives. Oh, and the funniest part, nearly 80% of the money we gave to Lockheed Martin, we borrowed. So we borrowed the money with interest to give it to a government contractor, who then took a nice chunk of that money and spend it on the representatives that voted to give them the money in the first place. And none of this is hidden. They're not deceiving anyone. This is all publicly disclosed. And that's not even counting all the smaller contracts. You know, those contracts that are given out to small Contracting firms that are generally owned by friends of the congressmen who push the Bill to pay them. Like, bro, you have to think about the fact that last year, all by itself, when we look at all discretionary spending, we spent $861 billion on defense, 80% of that on other countries defense. And we spend around 700 billion on everything that's not defense. We spent more last year from discretionary spending on defense for other nations than we did on everything else in the US. Every other government program, whether it's science or housing or anything, all of that together was less than what we spent on the defense of other countries. So to answer your question, that's what they're doing with our money.",

You were gonna call somebody out for misinformation? Hey, pot. Hey, pot, come in. This is kettle. Yeah, I was wrong. I used the wrong picture. That's why I took the video down, because I was wrong. But, Midas touch, this is what you do after you say something that's wrong. You take the video down and you admit you were wrong. But that's not what you do. No. You continue to pay Harry Sisson, even though he spells nothing but misinformation, and he uses your sources to do it, like you paid him thousands of dollars to spread bullshit over and over and over again. So, yes, I was wrong. I used the wrong picture. That was not his speech in the Bronx. My bad. But if I could admit that I was wrong as a content creator, as just a person who makes videos on TikTok, why can't you as a media organization? Like, it's okay, bro. All of us are wrong from time to time. You take the video down and you move on. How about you fucking try it?",

Guess who's on trial. It's your boy Donald Trump. And it's you love to sit here and gaslight people and tell them that and try to create a red herring in Michael Cohen, right? But hate to say it, he's not going to jail. If anything, his testimony is gonna be what puts Trump in jail. But I don't expect you to believe that.

In her pregnant stomach, and choked her till she passed out. He pled guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation. And you cheered for him for six years straight. Where the fuck was your TikTok about that? Oh, that's right. You didn't make one. So while a man beating the shit out of his pregnant girlfriend isn't enough to get you to make a TikTok, a Catholic giving a speech at a Catholic college about Catholic values is? Don't worry.

Their portion sizes have gotten so unbelievably fucking small. Like I remember getting Chipotle burritos and having trouble getting through the whole thing. Now I'm wondering if I need to add chips or. People on TikTok are putting out hacks so that you can get a bowl, get a side of tortilla, and then you can actually make a full burrito. But Chipotle on that bullshit. And I just like to point out that for the same price as 25 burritos. 25 bullshit ass burritos from Chipotle, you can join the MCU. You can actually be part of an entity that's fighting against this. Or you can get 25 bullshit burritos. Hey, it's up to you, but if you're interested in the MCU, check out the pinned videos in my profile, then click that link in my bio. I'm always available to answer questions as well.

Your mods then proceeded to mute me anytime I made a point. And then anytime I tried to correct a lie you told, your mom's muted me again. So since there was no actual possibility of debating with you live on TikTok, I just made videos correcting your lies. You then proceeded to send me a cease and desist from a very expensive law firm. And contrary to you saying that, the cease and desist was all about a shirt, that was only a tiny part of it. See, the rest of it was your lawyer saying that I couldn't say mean things about you. You literally sent me the lawyer equivalent of Mommy, make him stop. And then I invited you and Chris Maori down to Florida. I said I would pay for your flights, I pay for your hotel. All you had to do was sit down for a live round table with me. And conservative ain't then. You dodge that for the better part of nine months. that I got more followers in nine months than you did in four years, now you're really interested in a debate. Funny how that works.",

    "voice_to_text": "I met this man right here. Alright, guys, check out this video for context and clarity. With that being said, I wanna set this young man straight, because apparently this kid really ain't getting it, all right? And I would want. Oh, and by the way, ladies, I want you to basically go and frequent this young man's page and let him know about said Lawrence Taylor, for instance. Probably kind of spread the truth around a little bit about him, because this is gonna be hard to hear. You see, Donald Trump has done this bullshit before, alright? He's done it in 2,016. He tried to do it in 2020 and he lost in 2020. He did it in 2,016 and was successful at it because people thought that he was a breath of fresh air. No one wanted Democrats that actually hold power and office. And we all got duped. That's right, we all got duped. I wasn't duped. I voted for Hillary. But nevertheless, elections are elections. It wasn't until 2,020 where he couldn't get the black vote. Lawrence Taylor wasn't around then. Where was he then? Now all of a sudden he talks about he met this man. Really? You know, it's not a real good idea to bring somebody up there that looks like, you know, he hasn't done anything in the last, what, 20 years? After his retirement, he played in a couple of movies. Little Giants. What was the other one? Any given Sunday hasn't really done too much, and also, believe it or not, is a registered sex offender. Yeah, he is. I'm sorry, but he is. And Donald Trump is reaching right now because a lot of people are not playing this game with him anymore. They're not. The last four years of this man's presidency under his watch basically showed the fact that racism ran wild under his watch. George Floyd, Jacob Blake, a mob. Mob Barry, Brianna Taylor, to name a few. The protest that went around the run around this country and around the world for police brutality, and what did this man do? Nothing. Nothing at all. All he did was complain about democratic cities and Republican cities. Buildings being burned down, businesses being looted. We all knew that there were certain individuals that were peppering inside these protests that were either policemen or white supremacist groups trying to cause anarchy and chaos. Nevertheless, Donald Trump didn't do a damn thing. And now, since this man is doing his campaigning in a courtroom, he's about maybe this close to being a bitch to the state of New York. Very fitting. Just want to let you know that, kid, check out this video for context and clarity. You have a wonderful day.",

Happy Mother's Day for all the mothers out there in the world right now. You are all blessed. Okay, check out this video for context and clarity. I think it's time for me to set this child straight since you brought up your statistics and everything else that came across your video. I hate to break it to you, but during the middle of a speech, basically almost everybody in that entire 80,000 left. Oh yeah, there's video out there to support it. Not only that, not only that, Donald Trump is melting down. Now, if he goes out there and says he believes in himself and all that sort of junk, he's gonna need some help. Especially when he's praising fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter and shit. And I'm not making this up, my friend. Because when you're praising fictional characters played by Anthony Hopkins and shit, you really lose your supporters very, very quickly. And by the way, another thing that happened. Who's Jimmy Connors? I mean, ain't that the tennis player? Cause he mentioned him too. Like I said, Happy Mother's Day for all the mothers in the world out there.

And now he's up on stage with Trump at a rally. Trump. Trump surround himself with Michael Flynn and Paul Banner for. And OJ Simpson and all kinds of criminals.

And I know that's a weird statement to hear, but it's the truth. There is no purple on the light spectrum. There are no purple photons. See, our vision sees in a three color light spectrum of red, green and blue. You've probably heard the term RGB. That's red, green and blue. So our eyes basically have sensors that detect red, green and blue. The way your brain is supposed to work, when it sees color, it's supposed to detect how much red, green and blue you're seeing. So normally, if your brain sees very little red and very little blue, your green sensors would pick up because green is between red and blue. But if your brain sees very little red, very little blue, and your green sensors don't pick up any green, your brain essentially short circuits and you see purple. Like all purple is, is the absence of green. It's not actually purple, it is simply your brain malfunctioning.",

And he did that specifically to murder a sixteen year old American citizen who had not been convicted or tried for any crime. Like he knowingly did that and admitted it to the American public. How is that not murder? And if you're gonna be okay with him doing that, if you're gonna be okay with President Obama using the United States military to murder a 16 year old American citizen in a foreign nation, why the fuck are you acting so crazy about Trump saying he would have immunity? Obama murdered an American citizen that hadn't been convicted of any fucking crime whatsoever. So stop clutching your fucking pearls over the idea of presidential immunity.

Like, how racist do Democrats have to be before liberals are willing to call them out? whether it's saying the poor kids are just as smart as white kids, or saying that if you don't vote for me, you ain't black, or saying at the visit of 7 11, you have to have a slight Indian accent, or saying the black people aren't capable of getting voter ID, and now saying that black people don't even know what a computer is. Like, this is the fucking governor of New York. And here's the thing. She could have said that there were poor kids who don't know what computers are, and she still would have been wrong. She could have said there are underprivileged kids who don't know what computers are, and she would have been wrong. But no, she said black kids don't know what computers are. Black kids in the Bronx. And you're still gonna fucking vote for these people? Fine. Enjoy what you voted for."

    "voice_to_text": "so I find it funny that the um Donald Trump is saying that the latest violation of the gag order that Judgmentron has placed on him now the 10th time he's warned him and threatened him with jail time for violating the gag order they will hold them in contempt of court I think it's and then Trump comes back and says well he keeps violating my constitutional rights to say what I want to say you know again pushing that whole narrative that uh the right to speech has no bounds and and is just you know whatever you wanna say how you wanna say where you wanna say is protected by the Constitution it's the same lunacy that the left uses right that that and I find it interesting that we talk about some of my content on my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there curious formula uh talks about the lunacy of the left and the right when it comes to the Constitution I can think of no better example than Donald Trump on the right talking about how the Constitution his Constitution rights are being abridged and you know that's not what the Constitution you know says I should have the right to free speech unassailable likewise on the left I put up a a comment to somebody who put on a viral video here on TikTok or might have on Instagram that had women who had on t shirts that had political speech at a council meeting and they were wearing them and the council said hey they have to leave if they're gonna wear those shirts and and people were like that's wrong um we have the right to free speech we can wear a T-shirt that has a political message on here and you're bridging my my right to free speech that was on the left and I put a comment and said you know that I maybe even supported what the the comment that was on the t shirts that they people were wearing but that the council city council wherever town council every right to restrict uh that form of speech and it goes to what people don't understand about the Constitution people use the Constitution for whatever they want to use it because I bet those same people wore the t shirts in the courtroom who were Liberal will probably say that Donald Trump doesn't have the right um to say what he wants to say and I'm sure I'm sure would say the same about these people who wore who wore some of these leftist things on their t shirts they don't have the right to say they wanna say people just use the Constitution for what they want and and they base their decisions based on the ideology about what is appropriate speech and what is protected speech by the Constitution and not what it actually says listen folks the Constitution does give you the right to free speech but it's not it is not under underbridgeable it is not it is not without regulation it is not without bounds right we all know the statement that's been made famous you can't yell out fire in a crowded theater that's putting a restriction on speech the government has the right to restrict speech and a public venue to time manner and place they can do that it's like when I was on a city council in New Jersey the city council had the right to say that 25 people can speak during the hearing of citizens you may not like it you may not agree with it right and that they and and but but we had the right to do so now if you didn't like that you have the right to vote us out of office and put somebody else then who said I'm not gonna just have 25 people speaking at a council meeting at the hearing of citizens we have the right to put a restriction on time three to five minutes or whatever the time frame was that's not restricting your speed you don't have the right to speak 150 people don't have the right to speak at a council meeting if that's what the council wants they don't have the right to speak for an hour at a time if that's not what the council wants um that's the reality of it and Donald Trump yes a court can restrict what you can say when you're on trial to the people who are wearing the t shirts on the left at a council meeting yes they can say you no one can wear any t shirts with political speech at a council meeting that is not restrict your right to free speech you can wear your T-shirt outside of that room you can wear your your your T-shirt anywhere you want to Donald Trump you can say what you wanna say as long as it doesn't violate the order that you're supposed to be under when you're under when you're on trial you can't say those kind of things about jurors and the judge because you don't have the right to say that I just think it's really really interesting that in America today and throughout the world the problem of people looking and using institutional documents like the Constitution or declaration of independence or or or the Bill of rights or or any number of federal laws and statutes and regulations and and tell people like this is violative of that this is not what the founders wanted this is not this is not what you should be doing based on ideology is tearing this nation apart what's good for the goose is good for the gander and as I said it is a far gone conclusion well settled law that the government has the right to restrict speech based on time manner and place and if you don't like it then ask for an amendment to the to the law or challenge it in court and have it go up to the Supreme Court to make a new a new analysis of it but it's the same lunacy it's the same hypocrisy that's evident on the left and on the right Donald Trump is just the most um most visual and most um um um up to date sort of problem with it but it's a problem on the left and the right tell me what you think and if you have an alternative opinion subscribe like and comment below also go to my YouTube channel subscribe like and comment there free speech is not based on your ideology free speech is a right that has regulation because all rights under the Constitution have regulation stay curious and think it ain't",

Because if you watch this dude's videos, like, this is a black man, this is a black man going to UCLA, and anytime he goes anywhere near these encampment, it's not brown students, it's not black students, it's not Palestinians or gossins or Asians or any of that shit. No, it is a bunch of white people telling a black man where he can go on campus. It is a bunch of white students saying, you don't belong here and trying to force a black man to leave their area. I mean, let's be real, at its core, that's what's going on. This is white people exercising their privilege. This is white people exercising their privilege to tell a black man that he doesn't belong there. This is white people telling a black man where he can be and especially where he can't be. How the fuck have white liberals gone so far that now they think they're right, committing racism? Cause let's be real, if these white kids were conservative, and this black dude was Liberal, and all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he can and can't go, all these white conservatives were telling this black Liberal where he is and isn't welcome, that would be called racism. Every one of those white kids would be called a racist piece of Shit. But somehow, because they're Liberal, we just ignore the racism. I'm certainly not going to",
