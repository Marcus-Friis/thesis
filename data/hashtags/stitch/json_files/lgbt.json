    "voice_to_text": "what is something that you really appreciate about your therapist? so I struggle with anxiety like a lot of bitches on the planet but my anxiety revolves around this like fear of real or imagined abandonment like I feel like people are going to like \u201cfind me out\u201d or see that I'm like truly a shitty person deep down and then like lose interest in me and dip and I've had a lot of therapists prior to the one I have now and the ones prior have always like on with the approach of like oh let's figure out things that you like about yourself and try to combat these inner feelings and realize that you are a good person and you are interesting and like it has helped with my self confidence a little bit but it hasn't really like helped with the fear of abandonment you know and what I really appreciate about therapist that I have now is that he decides to hold up like a mirror to my anxiety a little bit and what I mean by that is like he'll come back at me with like an outside perspective of my anxiety and like give me insight that I don't necessarily see when I'm in my own head and I'll give a few examples like my friend group in college like rapidly started expanding at one point and it made me super nervous cause I was scared that the friends that I have I had then we're going to lose interest in me and like latch on to these new friends instead and just like completely like cut me off and I remember talking to him about this like one specific person I was like \u201cyeah I'm just like kind of mad and annoyed they were like that this person was spending one on one time with this new friend and like they were laughing and having fun together and like without me you know I felt like excluded and I felt like my friend was losing interest in me in favor of this new person\u201d and then my therapist was like \u201cokay so you are mad and upset that your friend is happy and building new relationships that make them happy?\u201d and I had to like literally pause and I was like that look that makes me sound like a fucking dick cause like my anxiety wasn't like \u201coh you're mad because your friend's happy\u201d my anxiety was being like \u201coh you're mad because your friend is leaving you\u201d but from the outside perspective yeah it definitely looks like I'm mad at my friends for making new connections that make them happy and like another example is like when I'm meeting new people I always think that they like immediately hate me or like judging me or like think I'm stupid or whatever and again it's a very self hatred type of thought and anxious thought but my therapist paused and was like \u201cisn't it kind of rude of you to think that this random person you don't know is that mean that they're just gonna start immediately judging you?\u201d and then I was like yeah you're right that is kind of a mean thing of me to do like nothing has made me want to change my behaviour more so than realizing how my actions and my thoughts can affect other people and I've never had another therapist like brave enough I guess to like challenge my thoughts that way and I just really really appreciate it about him",

And dental dams are even more expensive because you have to buy them in bulk online. So instead of purchasing these, I go to Planned Parenthood and they give away bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives and even lube. They give it all away free in giant bags. So if you wanna practice safe sex and you wanna support an amazing organization, go to Planned Parenthood, let them know you wanna be safe and they will give you bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives. And if you are in between partners, be sure to get tested while you are there. It is a good idea to make sure you aren't bringing anything into your next relationship. So remember, practice safe sex and have fun.",

    "voice_to_text": "that was trans content creator Lily Tino talking about her gender reassignment surgery while sitting on a veranda outside at Disney World the video has gone viral and is getting a lot of negative responses and rightly so because nothing irritates me more than a self serving advocate Lily is very much aware that what she has just done is inappropriate in the environment in which she has done it there is nothing wrong with talking about gender reassignment surgery and educating people at an elementary level in the way that Lily was doing so in the video there is everything wrong with the environment that Lily chose to do it in and Lily knows that because Lily continuously says in the video I'm gonna get thrown out of Disney World for doing this because Lily knows that talking about sexually explicit content talking about adult genitalia in an environment that is specifically for children and families is a really bad idea it is an inappropriate thing to be doing but the thing with Lily is Lily doesn't care because her content is intentionally rage baiting the transphobes and is intentionally rage baiting the internet to engage with her videos so that she could potentially get finance or she just gets lots of views maybe she just enjoys pissing everybody off I don't know but it's an intentional strategy tactic so that people pay Lily specifically attention it has nothing to do with the desire to educate people on trans issues or on gender reassignment surgery it has everything to do with the fact that Lily wants to centre themselves and enrage people and rage bait people on purpose so that they'll engage with her and she'll be benefited from it potentially by finances because it doesn't matter if your content is being engaged with negatively or positively on TikTok you're still gonna get compensation if you get over a certain amount of engagement and nothing annoys me more than seeing an advocate do that to their community on purpose because we all know this has nothing to do with transgenderism that is not why people are angry at you people are angry at you because you are talking about adult genitalia and a children's environment which is inappropriate regardless of your gender if you are CIS if you are trans if you are non binary talking about genitalia an environment saturated with young people is completely inappropriate behaviour and I do not want to hear the argument of it's appropriate anyway we need to educate on trans rights and stuff listen you cannot be talking about genitalia like that in Disneyland in front of families because you couldn't do that if you were sis if I sat there and talked about my knob in the middle of Disneyland no one's gonna be very impressed with me either you know it's inappropriate so the content is not what's wrong it's the environment that you're doing in and Lily knows that and Lily is selling out intentionally to the rage baiters to prove point to herself that she can and get get this content to skyrocket and go viral that's what this is about and in doing so she's throwing the community the trans community under the bus because there are trans people and queer people who have fought and who work incredibly hard every day of their lives to try and undo the damage of history and undo and unpick the myths about transgenderism about queerness by actually educating people properly Lily is not trying to do that Lily is trying to anger people on purpose and in doing so in a child like a child friendly environment Lily is playing straight into the hands of the transphobes and she knows it she is helping to perpetrate the myths that trans people are inherently dangerous around kids JK Rowling is gonna look at this sort of content and use it and weaponize it against the trans community and Lily doesn't care as long as Lily's videos are getting likes and uh engagement it has nothing to do with wanting to educate people about transgender issues it has everything to do with Lily doing this on purpose for Lily's own self and it just makes my blood boil to think about all of the trans people and the queer people who are gonna go to Disney World land or work at Disneyland who are gonna be confronted by other people now because of this video because we all know that negative content like this about the trans community is gonna go far more viral than anything positive and so people are gonna be walking through Disneyland now and when they see a trans person be that a visitor or be that an employee they are just gonna think about this video because Lily has done this on such a viral scale enraged so many people with such intent but this is gonna be the first thing that people think about when they see a trans person at Disneyland Lily has single handedly raised question marks for all of the Disney parents who see Disney in their algorithm all of the time as to whether or not trans people are safe to be around whether with their kids that is what Lily has done because it is naive to believe that everyone is aware of transitions and everyone is a bigot that is not the case a lot of people are not aware of transitions and if you're just a family with kids you know and it's just not on your radar whatsoever and this is the first thing that you see maybe you're planning a vacation and the algorithm throw this this up you are gonna be immediately jumping to transphobic and homophobic rhetoric in your own head Lily has provided the foundation for hatred towards trans people she has helped to perpetrate and solidify and validate that myth that has been age old that queer people are inherently dangerous to kids and that is disgusting because Lily is doing it for her own benefit this has nothing to do with education nothing at all this is not progressive for the trans movement this is not freedom and if you think that because you're queer because you're trans and you can talk about these things wherever the hell you wanna talk about them then you really need to have a look at yourself and go this is not appropriate you can talk about anything in the right setting and children do need educating on transitions absolutely we need to teach children about gender we need to teach children about different people from different walks of life but we don't need to be doing it unprofessionally inappropriately while they're on a family holiday or day out with you know talking about genitals and doing it in the way that you are talking about your marshmallow tunnel you know it's inappropriate and that's the issue it's got nothing to do with the content because you can educate children on this but not at Disneyland not against the wills of those around them you know it's just inappropriate and it's makes my blood boil to think that Lily has done so much harm with this video on purpose on purpose go on their TikTok and look at all of their content it is intentionally rage baity Lily benefits from people getting angry at her and so she plays into it and in doing so massively damages her own community but it's okay because she benefits and that is just it's so disgusting",

You can pause to read at the end, but I just wanted to say there's people talking about how they've never seen the representation of a butch and found dynamic like there. There are also people that find it healing and have said that they learn they can be intimate and intentional while also still being carnivorous and devouring their partner. And then there are these sweet guys who will come in and be like, is it okay that I'm here? Because, like, I know you're a lesbian. Wanna make sure you're comfortable. And I really appreciate that. I think I've built and fostered a really great community of people. I think everyone's welcome of any gender, orientation. I think anyone can benefit from healthy intimacy, representation. As well as the blogs that I write that go along with each video, I post two times a week almost. If you wanna follow the blog and join the community, you can find me on Instagram. I got so lucky with the kind of messages I get here. I'll show them now.",

This guy's a little confused on why Chris and Mr. Beast try to live the life as a man and try to be a father and a husband. Um, very easy answer, actually. Uh, it's still incredibly, uh, not accepted in the world to be transgender. Um, it's still seen as freakish and weird. People are still hate, crimed and killed just for being trans. Um, so when all you hear your entire life is anti LGBTQ rhetoric, uh, you wanna disassociate your sis, disassociate, disassociate yourself. You wanna disassociate yourself from them, from LGBTQ+ people, because you don't want that hate. You don't wanna be hated against. So you pretend like, oh, you did that. Those feelings you have don't exist, and you try to live the life that people have placed on you. And that's why Chris did that. And then I don't want to put words in her mouth, but she was probably like, I don't care what. How people will react to this. I want to be happy. So she came out as hope. She really is. So, you know, let that be a message to all you out there is. Be who you are. Be happy."

    "voice_to_text": "And so many cisgender critics are breaking this down to a film about fandom and friendship and that is just so wrong I actually think it is super important that the message of I saw the TV glow just goes over the heads of so many cis people because it is not exploitative the movie is not like here is this trans person let's all feel bad for this trans person this movie is not invite cis people to pity a trans person for 90 minutes this movie points at the cis audience and says you either understand what this person is going through or you think they are mentally ill so many trans movies are like this person is so haunted and they're so brave for being themselves and they're so hated by society and they're so misunderstood and I saw the TV glow I was like no this person is not brave this person is suffering this person is dying and nobody cares and they know it they know that that's going on but they do not care they're looking the other way in the movie the Justice Smith character is like if I don't think about it it's not real and it didn't happen which reminds me of a lot of things that are going on right now but I think that that's also like how cis people view trans people just because like trans people as a group have become like a tool for like Cis people and for like the cis political spectrum this is like kind of gone away but do you remember like right after October 7th a bunch of people like what you can't you have to vote for Joe Biden you have to vote for Joe Biden because of trans people that was always something that made me like deeply uncomfortable my suffering is not a tool for you to use to prop up like a monster  this is not something to fix by voting for the right person there's only something that you can fix by paying attention by actually seeing people and that's like what's part of what's so powerful about the movie is that it's like it's not just that you need to give people access to these things it's that you need to like let people feel free to use them none of that matters if people are still forced into the closet so people don't feel free to be themselves the problem is not just the government is not just Republicans the problem is his people it is you not paying attention not caring not seeing people",

It's just so frustrating that I have to witness someone from my own community make a mockery of themselves, and the only people. Maybe. And you know what? Maybe it's just my algorithm. Maybe there are queer people checking him, and, you know, I'm just not seeing it, but I should be seeing it far more than I am. Like, it. It.

I obviously could not have anticipated the amount of response that I'd get to that. And it's sad, really, to think that there are so many people out there who are struggling. And I promise I will stop making videos about this, but it is blowing my mind a little bit, because, like, what can we do as adults? It's so hard to make friends, but there are so many of us that are there just wanting to make friends, and I wish I could do something about it, like on a big scale, um, but on a. On a smaller scale. I have made a WhatsApp group, um, which is at the minute, about 150 people. And I made a discord server, which is about 100 people. And it's just been amazing to see people interacting with each other, to see people having a laugh. I've not laughed so much in such a long time. We've had, uh, among us nights, we've had call of duty. We've had many, many voice notes in the WhatsApp. And people who said, I'm scared to join, I'm nervous to join. What if no one likes me? Are now in there everyday chatting, talking, sharing pictures, talking about our gardening, talking about books. It's just been incredible. I've tried really hard to make sure that I've Replied to every single message, every single comment. And I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me in whatever way from this video. If I have missed your comment, if I have missed your message, I'm sorry. I'm really trying to get through everything. Um. It's just been like, on a level that I just don't. I never knew could even be a thing. I don't know how influencers do it because I. This is a full time job. Just. Just replying to. To these messages. But not in a bad way, in the best way, because it's so great to meet people and it's been just fantastic. So once again, if you wanna join the WhatsApp, if you wanna join the discord, please send me a direct message. Or if you just want a friend, please just send me a message. It doesn't have to be that you join the groups. If you just want someone to chat to, I am here. But if you do wanna join the groups, I can guarantee you that there is an amazing person or people multiple in both of those groups. So just waiting to be your friend.",

Let's talk about the fact that transgender people and cisgender women are sexually assaulted at essentially the exact same rate on college campuses. Let's talk about the fact that when sexual assaults do occur on college campuses, 99.7% of the time it is cisgender men who are sexually assaulting cisgender women. And 85% of the time sexual assaults on transgender people are also perpetrated by cisgender men. Let's talk about the fact that 32% of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having to withhold food and water from themselves in order to make it through a workday without having to use the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that 8% of those same group of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having had urinary tract infections as resulted withholding water from themselves and holding in using the restroom for an entire work day. Let's talk about the fact that doctors are aware of this. And in fact, when there's when a doctor who knows how to work with trans people is screening a patient, it's one thing that they know to look for because it's so common compared to the rest of the population to have urinary tract infections as a result of anxiety around the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that when I was in high school, a friend of mine who was out as trans had to cross the street To use the a different restroom in a different building every single time they needed to relieve themselves. Let's talk about the fact that I've been sexually assaulted and it didn't matter what was on my birth certificate. Let's talk about the fact that everyone fucking deserves to be safe. And instead of trying to work towards a safer world, you're contributing to rape culture by blaming transgender women instead of facing up to the fact that it's cisgender men, cisgender straight men who specifically are causing all of these issues around safety.",

Yeah, I'm not gonna go into the nitty gritty details of how black women are rightfully upset about you basing your entire personality out of a. Out of a character of a black woman. Um, a lot of black women have been talking about, and they are the ones that you should listen to when it comes to that conversation. But even I am gonna say, as a white person, stop being fucking racist. You make our community look like fucking clowns. With that being said, I'm gonna go to the next point. You do realise that first of all, if trans rights are gonna be stripped away, your rights are gonna be next. First of all, the. The conservatives all around the world used. Are using the same tactics that they used against gay people way back, way back. Dehumanizing, demonizing and all that kind of stuff. And also, the real people you should be scared of touching, your little nieces, little nieces and nephews are youth pastors, like cisgender men. And sure, there's few more predators. There's few more predators, too, okay? But, SIS, trans people are responsible for most sexual related crimes. And it's a quick Google search. Like, yes, I'm not denying that, um, that trans people can't. Can't commit crimes, but that does not give you the fucking right to demonize us. Like, I'm not even a trans woman. I will with my whole heart and fucking soul stand With my trans men, women, non binary people, everyone. People. POC, trans people, BIPOC, trans people, everyone. I'm just so fucking mad that a car has to come from inside of the house. But, yeah, here we are. And also, um, I'm not gonna talk about how you, uh, tell white people, who are rightfully also uncomfortable by you basing your caricature off of a black woman, how you tell them to shut up when you're not even black yourself. You're not even black yourself. You're not even black. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit.",

Now, to an extent I get what he means, but like, in the same tone, in the same context, he's perpetuating this dangerous narrative with what he's saying. So basically the reason why he believes that trans women should not be allowed in women's restrooms is because the fear of them hurting little children because they were once biological men first. And to an extent, I kind of like, understand where it's coming from, but in the same context, trans women at once again are not men. They're not men. They do not think the way that a lot of these biological men do. They do not see the water in the way that a lot of these other biological men do. And it's perpetuating this dangerous ass narrative that queer people are trans people are pedophiles. And it's just like, what a narrative that has long been falsely tied to the queer community from straight people. And it's just like, really gross and it's awful. Not only that, but the huge reason why people are agreeing with him is because he's assembling the straightness, and straight people love it when gay people, they might just straightness and they can use us as a puppet to perpetuate a narrative that is fucking wrong. When a lot of these are ape cases and cases against children are committed by self identifying straight men, and like, it's just wrong and I don't know. This video is weird. And to be honest, I think it lacks a lot of thought process. I get where it's coming from, but in the same tone, it's weird."

You wanna be the one to, like, normalize talking about what your business is down there in front of children and the world to see? No, don't. If you want to have that conversation off to the side, or maybe not at a kid's place, I could even live with that, like, more than I can with how you did it. But the fact that you want to come out here and you're talking about being visibly trans and being visibly queer and all these spaces, that's not what you're doing. What you're doing is visibly making a mockery of us and making it so much harder on just regular, everyday trans people because you have this massive following. I'm just a nobody trans person on the internet. You know? I'm not Gonna get seen by millions of people, you know, but whatever. I hope you're having fun, queen.

    "voice_to_text": "I've seen a lot of posts going around about why everybody's getting sober, and I'm gonna explain to you why this is happening. If you haven't seen the original creator's video, go back and watch it now, because he makes a really, really good point about how we're literally just getting smarter as a society and realizing that alcohol is horrible for us and we should probably not be drinking it the way we did every single weekend. Now being 24, almost 25, I think I'm in the age group where I have outgrown those 19 20, 21 year old college days where I felt it was really cool to just get blackout drunk and make really stupid mistakes. But I do want to add another layer to this, specifically in regards to the gay community and the LGBTQ community. So many of us spent our lives trying to prove that we are worth it, trying to prove to other people that we have a place and that we are productive members of society. And in doing so, we found ourselves in really demanding work environments, 9 to 5 corporate jobs that don't allow us to properly process and feel our emotions the way that humans should do. I think we can all agree that in 9 to 5 work schedule, especially in New York City, which is where I live, is actually the exact opposite of how humans were meant to live. This being said, it's very profitable for bars. Um, to cater to that emotional wound that a lot of adults, gay people are carrying. Hence why, especially in the gay community, it seen as such a cool, fun thing to just go out and do a ton of drugs, drink a ton of alcohol, go to these circuit parties, just go to the bar. That's, like, the only activity, it feels like, that gay men want to do in New York City anymore. I think everybody has to learn this lesson for themselves, though, to really, really, truly understand. And if that means embarrassing yourself, draining your bank account, feeling horrible self esteem issues because you've gone out and drink every single night for two weeks, then so be it. But as a collective community, so many of us are ready to heal. So many of us are tired of being slaves to our own emotional wounding, being slaves to our own lust and the lust of others. And the only way it's gonna heal and the only way it's gonna start is by making collective decisions to do shadow work, inner healing, and forgive the ones that have hurt us to the point that we can't move on. Because everybody deserves to move on.",

Um, anyway, this is something I'm actually gonna go ahead and just speak on behalf of the entire community for. Hell no. We are not having that. Never have, never will. We're not putting up with it. They try to, like, sneak in and weasel in before, and they get stomped out every time, time after time. It is something that we are firm in the sand about not happening. Not gonna happen. Never have, never will. I am a trans woman. I would rather be best friends with JK Joanne Rowling herself hand in hand than I would ever, ever, ever even think about having that in the community. That is not who we are. That's not what we're about. Look, we're pretty tolerant. Not that tolerant. We are not putting up with that. That's not who we are. That's not what we stand for, is not what we believe in. It ain't happening. I've never met a single member of any part of the community that believed that, and that's just. That's just where we are. We're just not having that."

    "voice_to_text": "One thing I find consistently interesting is the comfortability of bisexual women to get on the internet and come into clear spaces to complain about biphobia, when most of the time that is the most clear interaction you have had in your entire life is to get on here and complain about it. Because you don't enter queer spaces, you don't engage with the community at all because you're too busy dating homophobic, heterosexual, cisgender men. And you wonder why we don't wanna date you, because the majority of the time we have nothing in common. I don't have really anything in common with people that probably center men in their lives. Not saying you all do, but if you consistently dated men and only men, and you sit around with your friends and talk about men, we probably have nothing in common. Why would I want to date somebody like that? I probably. I'm not really even friends with people like that, so why would I wanna date you? Most of you do not know how to conduct yourself within queer spaces. Most of you don't know how to treat women because the only example you have of that is how your boyfriends treat you and all the other men that are circulating around you. Because majority of you hang out with heterosexual people and not queer people. That's why you don't have clear experiences. That's why they're not knocking down your doorstep. And then you get on here And act surprised. And it's the internalized misogyny and internalized homophobia which is really, like, blatant at the fact that you feel more comfortable coming over here to complain instead of complaining to the people that are majority actually being actively homophobic and biphobic, but those are the people you're still choosing to date. So it's a really strong cognitive dissonance. And I don't understand where it's not clicking that lesbians don't wanna participate with that type of mindset. Like, I, I, I don't, and I'm no lesbian is here. We are not responsible for holding your hand through queer experiences. Sure, there's some lesbians that would gladly do it, but it is not our cross to carry at all. So it's the same thing as if someone's in the closet. I'm 23. I'm not dating somebody that's in the closet. I'm not doing that. I'm not saying that being in the closet is bad. Some people need to be in the closet. I'm not participating in a relationship with someone in the closet because I don't want to, and I shouldn't have to, because that is more weight for me to carry when relationships are already hard. Me having to teach you how to be queer is not my job, and it's not any other lesbians job. So maybe do a little deconstruction, check your ego out the door, and then come over here and engage peacefully with people that are actively queer in their everyday lives and have To deal with it. And not people that are participating in heterosexual relationships, which are widely and socially acceptable. So I don't know. Y'all just have a lot to say, and I would just really like it if you kept the same energy with everybody in your life, instead of coming over here and leaving, starting a complaint box with people that you don't even interact with anyways.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hi there. For those of you who are not the guy that made the video that I just stitched, go ahead and go back and watch his video, because I think it's important for context. But for the guy who made the video: hi. I'm a Queer man, and I think there are some really unique insights that I might be able to give you that we can l share and maybe learn together? I think that your video has a lot of valid points, and I think that it can really help foster some empathy. The first thing I wanna talk about is that, you talk about how your friends and your family do not have or bear any responsibility for the way that they view you, and while that might be accurate to a degree, because as you acknowledge society does this thing, it is also on them to see you for who you are. That is valid. And I found myself vibing with a lot of what you're saying just in terms of my own experience of coming out as Queer and about how I have to mask in certain settings. I can't just automatically be who I am everywhere, and I think that because you at least present to be a cisgendered, straight man -- and I could be wrong on that so please feel free to correct me -- because that is my impression of you. And because your world experience seems to indicate that, it seems to me that what you're not getting is that you have not been used to having to face this? You haven't had to really question this before? But I've had to deal with it in my coming out and even in my day to day life... We as Queer people, a lot of times we have to be a certain way, in certain settings. We aren't allowed to just be who we are. Even when it comes to Pride events we're expected to be polite or respectful or out of the way and we're expected to not really push boundaries or things like that... That's a societal thing. And it puts us in a box, and it feels exactly the way you're talking about... and it sucks. and at least from my experience, because I'm only speaking from my experience. That's how it is for me, and it is so hard. It is so hard. And a lot of times it is the cisgendered straight people who have the hardest time getting it, but then here you're saying a lot of these things, and I think that that is what is... what is that cognitive dissonance for you. I think that you're dealing with an experience that your life hasn't had you face, really. I think that this experience is probably also a lot more common among people than we give others credit for, and I think it's important that we have these conversations, and we're open and honest about it, and together we can foster empathy, and we can learn to be better together. When it comes to any feminine thing... (\"feminine,\" right?) I like to paint my nails. but I have straight friends who like to paint their nails. I know people who like to do that. I know straight men who wear makeup, even though I like to wear makeup, I'm the one that gets criticized for it, right? Even if you can't tell that I'm doing it, and it's just one of those things that... It's society, man. It's society. and that's why you hear people in certain communities always talking about, we need to question these things in society. That's why we need to try to work to basically deconstruct all these things that we have been told,  because it's hard. Life is hard. Everyone is just looking for love. Everyone is just looking for support. Everyone is just looking for a little bit of dignity. that's the way life is, and unfortunately, there are some of us who have to face this more often. I would question your constant excusing of your loved ones not acknowledging this for you. because that's something that we as Queer people have to face pretty early on too, is that, there is a degree of responsibility on our loved ones to be accepting of what we're going through and to acknowledge us. That is just a baseline for respect and love, and if those people are constantly making your problems about themselves, then that's a problem with them, and I would question if that's a healthy relationship? And if you maybe don't need to work on that... or even maybe question how much you should invest in those relationships. Right? For me, when I came out, my parents said something like, \"You know we love you, but we don't love your partner, and we don't love the what you do and blah blah blah...\" Right? They were being kind of horrible, because what they really were telling me is they love an idea of me and when that idea of me does not match... Lord, that... if you hear that, that's the squirrels fighting in front of me. They're right in front of me, because the animals where I am are kind of tame. Sorry about that. lizard brain... But, my parents were telling me they love an idea of me. They weren't telling me they love me. Even though that's what their words were saying that's not what they were actually saying. They love an idea of me and they were not willing to do the work. So I had to more or less cut them down significantly as far as how much I interact with them. You may choose differently for yourself, but just wanted to offer some insights and maybe help a little bit. I know that it's hard what you're going through and I think that your specific experience offers a really unique opportunity to foster empathy and growth and maybe you can use your experience to compare with others and share with others who don't have the reach that someone like me or anyone else would have? Together we can help each other be better, and maybe make the world a little bit of a better place? So... peace, love. Remember, everyone deserves  love, respect, and dignity. Everyone. Thank you for listening. Sorry for the length of the video, and I hope this helps.\u2764\ufe0f",

But wait, no, you knew that it was wrong because your video starts with you saying that you're gonna get banned from Disney. So not only you did this, but you also knew that it was wrong and fucking disgusting. There is an appropriate time and space for educating people on such things, because, yes, talking about such things is beneficial, but not in fucking Disneyland, where kids run around you, and believe me, they do not want to listen about your genitals. I really, really don't know what's in people's heads sometimes."

To have to walk on them corn fields for 26 hours a day to make a penny and some belly button lint. That's how dry my cell phone is. What do I have? You got? What do I got, girl? What do I got? Some about chin up. Chin up for what? Turn up to see nothing but my fantasies and delusions in front of me. That's what I gotta see. I gotta make reality. I gotta act like niggas really looking at me and they're not. They're not. Where were you at on April 5th when I needed you? When I blocked him on everything I had cause he pissed me off? Where were you then? Like you talking about I'm looking out for you now this week. I don't need you now. Where were you then? Where were you on April 5th? Where were you then on that morning? Where were you then? I don't need you now. Then. You were important then."

And she is probably the way you dress, she's probably in not into females or you're not her type. If you keep thinking that way, you're not gonna get nobody. I'm pretty sure everybody wants you. But at the end of the day, buddy, you can't think that way. You probably fail at so many things, you. You probably look at me like, you know what? I'm gonna give this a try. And then you succeeded, you know, if you understand where I'm coming from. That makes no sense. Do all mask and lesbians think like this? I'm just asking. Just asking. If I shoot my shot at somebody and they reject me, I probably think that I'm not their type. They're not into people like me, you know? Are they not into people, like, with mental illness or not? People with Lupus or anything, you know? I mean, you gotta think situations like that."

but it's almost like when you are asking for something and god universe whoever if you have a higher belief it's almost like you will not be handed something you are not ready for you may feel like you are ready for it but it's almost like are you truly ready to handle the love that you are asking for type of thing of course you may not know that until you get into a relationship you know what I mean until you see that for yourself but it's almost like in these cases and that emphasizes heavily amongst everybody it is okay and it is understandable to feel romantically alone it is okay to feel how you are feeling it is okay to feel these heavy emotions that comes with feeling alone isolated with romantic love it is okay to feel how you feel and allow yourself to be validated about that even when no one else around you is and the best piece of advice I can say is you know the phrase let it hurt let it heal let it let it go it's almost like allow yourself had to feel it right journal it out cry it out scream it out do what you need to do in a healthy way but also try not to focus try not to dwell too much almost emotion because the more you fixate on this sad feeling the more that's going to keep it's gonna keep you in this spiral it's only going to keep you further in this this no this loop but that's easier than done but you know it all starts somewhere even if by doing simple things and this goes to my next point when you feel these in moments of intense emotion the triggers the best thing you can do is to be there for yourself not to say in the whole self care way right but in those moments we really feel very rough we feel very hard on yourself when you feel very pessimistic those are the most important times to where you can need to be there for yourself where you willing to tell yourself I am worthy of love I am deserving of love I am meant for love it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks love is meant for me because my heart is open and my prayers have been said and this isn't about me but from personal experience I resonate with every single thing that she said in that video I felt that exact way before it's almost like why I've been doing so much been trying so hard and it feels like the love that comes easy for others doesn't come easy for me it feels like I'm it feels like I'm cursed with another person's curse it's almost like I'm going through a battle that's not mine type of thing so it's almost like as easy it is to keep yourself in the victim mentality try to use that as instead of asking why in a victim way try to change that why into to like okay so why isn't this happening am I still healing from something ? do I have something too work on? am I truly ready for the love that I seek you know it can be different areas and I hope I'm making sense here but I'm trying not to dive too far off topic but the main point is I want to let everyone know that it is okay again it is okay to feel romantically alone that feeling of loneliness with love it is okay to feel how you are feeling validate yourself journals out screaming out crying out do what you need to do but this is your reassurance this is my reassurance to you guys that love is on the way especially you have been praying your intentions have been set your heart knows that your heart is open the more it's almost like it may not seem like it but you have already what you've already said is all like it's already wrapped up in a nice little package ready to be shipped to you it's just a matter of time of when it is ready to come your way and when you are ready to receive it what you require is a lot different to others that's where you need to stop comparing your journey to others well why is this person in a relationship and I'm not that's comparison is the thief of joy this person may have wanted a salad and you wanted the steak dinner and in relationships they wanted something different than you did and that is okay you may at the end of the day your food still gonna come you're not gonna be exempt from it may take a little longer because what you require something different you require more you desire more you want something more fulfilling keep that in mind when you witness a lot of relationships happening around you keep in mind that I am not exempt from a relationship I just require something different and my what I desire is already on the way it's already I put the order in it's on the way the order's the package is about to be shipped and delivered to me but yeah just know that you guys are definitely meant for love all you guys you guys are deserving you guys are worthy of it and again remember to always validate your emotions because despite the hustle culture despite the money culture culture whatever maybe whatever people may tell you it is okay to want love it is okay to crave love it is okay to desire love but try not to let your focus of wanting love cloud out the happiness that you can bring in for yourself and bring it in your life in the present moment the more you focus on the future and what you don't have the more you steal your own happiness in the present and as annoying as it may seem as annoying as it is to have to remain patient that's the best thing for you to do instead of focusing on it and spiraling so just continue to do what you're doing continue to establish yourself to secure yourself and try not to look as relationship as reward from it you know try to just do things for you for your life establish yourself for you make happy memories for you and love will come love will come it always does and never fails love comes when you're not looking and chasing after it because I believe that the moment you hyperfixate on love and you put your happiness on a relationship you steal your joy away at the end of the day a relationship should be in addition to not instead of that isn't to say that you know she cause she didn't say it but ultimately again it's just uh it's understandable if you're tired exhausted stressed anxious about love just know it is coming it's just gonna take a little more time and that's okay because it's gonna be something worth waiting for",

So I don't have a really cool business like she does, but I do have debt, and I'm planning a wedding for the woman of my dream. So I'm doing it. I'm joining the Cool Kids Club. I'm jumping on the TikTok Creator bandwagon. It is time. Let's group together. Let's watch each other's videos, let's interact with them, and let's follow each other. We got this together, and we will grow together. The types of videos you might see for me are TVD, probably a lot of dog videos. So if you like dog videos to help you get through your stressful day, make sure you come back and follow my videos. Thanks.",

Bi would essentially mean people that are alike and unlike you. Speaking probably about gender, uh, considering sexuality. Now, if you consider pan, pan means all. So pansexual mean you're attracted to all people of all genders. Uh, the difference between that is bi would mean like and unlike.

    "voice_to_text": "Salt Haven in London is closing down because it was boycotted by the younger generation the LGBT thing was just a fake organization anyway that didn't really represent gay people trans people properly anyway and didn't um actually give real insight into things that straight people could learn from from gay people in any way shape or form and it was just created just to usher in acceptance but not for gay people not for trans people but for p those they really want to slap the peel in the end and and they've been doing this kind of stuff since like the 70s and it backfired so now it's just this sort of blob of a organization that manipulate young people in their formative years that when you're 15 16 17 18 and kind of smart you think you really know what you're doing but you don't so then these young um Gen Z people are just kinda like these little rebels with with whatever random calls they've been told to think for the week and for whatever reason they have decided to boycott an institution um like like Foxwood Tavern um which is and which is so funny because it's been a place a a a a place a safe place for gay people for years and it's almost like sometimes these young Gen Z people they just get on a course and just don't really understand what they doing and they get used and manipulated for basically the powers that be don't want nightclubs there so they somehow figured out how to get young people to boycott things that they're gonna really need in a few years time and that people really enjoyed going to especially gay people and I think I feel like they just got used somehow to end the business and it's and it's a crying shame and they think they're doing this for some positive reason but it just sounds like they got conned into I don't even know why they boycotted it but they've got conned into thinking it's best not to go to a place that's been housing gay people for years in some sort of for some political bit it's it's actually quite it's quite sad really it's quite silly but yeah that I'm great that I'm happy that there are gay people that are actually just coming out the closet and saying actually I don't like that movement and it hasn't really done anything from from somebody I feel like it just doesn't actually help straights and gay people understand each other more I just think it's just trash and I think it's a corrupted a corrupted movement that's actually deep seated in perverts they wanna put the p in the end for perverts and you accept their perversion that's what it's about",

So all these fucking men have been living a lesbian fantasy in their basements for years, watching porn, and then they come out. Porn industry the way we're betrayed on the telly. Mm hmm. You know what I mean? This is what's like, we just don't get. Like, we are just like a normal straight fucking heterosexual couple. We just wanna live our life like real love, like we're getting married. So the only difference is that we're female. We're both female. Literally the only difference. You know, that's. That's it. Like, we had our rights, we were happy, we were rights. Like, that's the difference, you know? These bums are what? And everything. We are fucking cherry on top. No, they've come into the community so they can get into bathrooms and fiddle around. Little girls. Yeah. Or little boys, whatever your preference may be. Because that's what I mean. GG is forcing young lesbians into having sex with them because they get off on it. Because of this Fetish. And these young girls want to be so inclusive, so desperately inclusive, they'll do anything. So in today's fucked up world, we agree with pedophilia, rape of young lesbians and erasure women. Yeah.

But for now on, let's get talk about. Hey, Mr. Bucket here, Harrison Buddker, the famous kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs, just recently did a graduation speech at a Catholic, uh, college. Uh, fun fact, Harrison Bucket himself is Catholic. So he was just pushing some of the ideas that he was taught. Some of the ideas at the school also benefits from, you know, they all have the same kind of ideas.

And, um, you might recall, it was because I've been writing a book, and my parents kept asking to read it, and so I had come out to them to explain that it was a bisexual fantasy. And it went terribly, and I lost everything for a book that I thought I was just gonna digitally publish on Amazon and maybe four people would read. And it was really just for me. I wrote it for an audience of one. I wrote the book I always wanted to see myself in. And at the time, I didn't have this online community that I have now. And for no reason at all, you turn this book that four people were supposed to see into a bestseller. I have no publishing house, no agent. You did this. And today is its birthday.

The Bible defines pride as having an arrogant, haughty attitude that leads to an inflated sense of self or self importance. You know, like a kicker telling anyone what they should be doing. That is different from Gay Pride. LGBTQIA+ pride is about standing up against injustice and oppression and saying we are who we are and we are here, and we're not going anywhere. We want equal rights, and we just. It's not about being better than anyone else. It is about, like, standing our ground and just, like, being okay with who we are. Like Psalms, chapter 82, verse 3, that says to defend the weak in the oppressed. Or Proverbs, chapter 31, verse 8, that says to defend the rights of the needy. Or Isaiah, chapter 1, verse 17, that literally says, do good, seek justice, and correct oppression. HARRISON and I know, I know. When a word has two meanings, it's really hard. And I was raised Catholic. I know we don't read the Bible. I know that. But this is all work that you get to do as a spiritual person. I had to do it in deconstructing my faith and learning to be a proud queer person. But, um, Google's free.",

This is the thing, right? If you supposed to. If an establishment closes at that specific time, you need to take into consideration. Dang, what if they can't get out? Are you used to be nice where? We will close at 10, 11:00. I wouldn't get out of there till 12 1, baby, who is staying two extra hours, like. And I gotta get up in the next morning to do other shit. Y'all be. Y'all is some insecure, inconsiderate ass motherfuckers. And I want everyone. Every time somebody come in my job and when it's about to close. I go on a job when it's about to close and I sit the fuck down. Cause you're not gonna play with me, bitch. You. You got nothing coming. If you think you can play with me, hoe.

Now, I've never been on the dating app, so I kind of empathize for all these stories that I hear, but I met mine at Starbucks. He was my barista. He was making me coffee every day. And over many months, we developed a friendship, and he eventually asked me out. Now we're married. Been together 11 years. So I hope that helps. Uh, just get off the apps, maybe. It's probably better for you socially and mentally, too."

So I've never seen a Twink who doesn't have something extraordinary about them. And by large, they are academically very gifted. But let's try and figure this out. So I would agree that the Twink persona, the TP, it does include, you know, dumb. It has. It has a legally ball on to ask thing about it. But this is where I think things diverge. I think this persona, then entering this culture, happens after they have gone through school, after they have gone through, like, everything. So they end up being bullied, right? And they end up going through bad things before the Twink persona. And what do people who are bullied do? They sit in their room. And what happens when you sit in your room? You learn shit. And so this is the theory I have for whitewink. Inexplicable skill that no one knows about or why. They have a series of random things that they know how to do that there is no explanation. And this goes to my greater thesis of the peak of this example is the drag Queens, because they know how to do everything. You ever talk to a drag queen? They're very intelligent. So, yeah, I think the Twink persona expects you to be dumb. But prior to getting the Twink persona, because you're gay, you sit in your room a lot. You Learn a lot of shit. And then once you're in Twink persona, there are other expectations. Uh, you know, you have to learn how to dress. You have to learn how to do, you know, your face, whatever. That you put those skills to use, furthering them. And then when you hit twink death, right around 20 or 21, you have to bring back the other skills. And that leads to the final goal of drag.",

    "voice_to_text": "hi hi I'm really happy about everything you said everything every point that you said was perfect but I would like to just focus on exactly that sentence was where you say that western ideologies are not gonna come with western bombs but this is exactly plays in the agenda that people like to hear that being queer is actually western ideology but it's not western ideology I am Arab I am queer we exist we've always existed and on the second I would like to remind everybody that all the homophobic law that came at least to my area in the Wena region and West Asia North Africa came with colonization and let me tell you about how it happened in Egypt okay so I'm not gonna really mention dates because I'm not really good at remembering dates but this is exactly what happened British colon colonizers were there British soldiers were in Egypt you know Egypt was colonized by the British for at least eighty years and without of course adding up all the revolting against them whatever we did again but guess who was really really really working against the British sex workers in Egypt and a small tiny info sex work in Egypt has never been illegal since ancient Egypt there has been sex workers in Egypt legally working part of the society and it's a wizard respectful respectful job still the British king and of course they started working against the British so do what did the British do they went to street called high as Bakay and basically they burned the entire street so according to some people some books I think I read but most of these books are in Arabic so I don't know how to bring them here but some books actually mention that they even went inside every single house and they threw all their all of their cardboards all of their wooden items their furniture all of their stuff they threw it from top of the buildings and they burned the entire street and that's when they put one of the laws that now are taking homophobic almost most of the home people almost of the gay or the LGBT community in Egypt this law was basically that you cannot do anything against morality this word doesn't even exist in Islam this thing of like against nature against morality it absolutely does not exist in Islam so this is not western ideology so basically the first law one of the first laws that were put in Egypt against the jury community was put by the british to control sex workers and that's it another case was also Lebanon by the French Tunisia Morocco Algeria by the French Ghana by the British so we cannot ever say we can never say there's the western ideals it's just wrong it's just plays exactly for their agenda for these homophobic for these islamophobic people that this one I've always been fucking there homophobic and they killed everybody in the world and they killed all the queers and all the gays but I would like to also introduce you to I'm a Rocky researcher his name is Mussa Al Shadeedi  and he's being attacked massively in his country and Iraq but he actually talked to me about the connection between the insane homophobia that's happened in Iraq and the connection with the American invasion so basically after I don't know if you know this or not but Abu Ghreib it's not incident torture accident that the when the American soldiers basically started torturing Iraqi prisoners and and there I don't know dungeons and undergrounds or whatever and the pictures emerged and all of us in the Middle East we all of us we have seen all of us have seen that my dad saw that and we were even using CDs to see these stuff because what did the Americans have look what of the Americans have done to us the problem with this is and also she did he mentions this in his book which is basically the return of the colonizer to its youth but but he basically mentions how an act of love between two people man and man woman and woman or non binary people or whatever the gender was these two acts used to be for love between people till the American army came and they used it to humiliate them they used this technique they used sexual activities that could should be and could be consensual and between lovers to humiliate the men or to humiliate the population and then you have an explosion of homophobia in the area this is what happens on a second thought also there's another book I don't remember the writer's name but it's called ishtihet a lot of which basically meaning fetishism of the Arabs and let's talk about the entire history of how Europe used to perceive the Arabs and how they basically put a microscope on our sexuality and how we're doing things and don't get me wrong fucking Arabs were having so much fun sex parties gayness queerness and this is not western ideologies and we can ask the ottoman empire that califord the Abbasid Empire the fatimater empire all of them we have existed in the Islamic nation in the big Islamic OMA till colonialism and Europe started to come to us till the Western Christian ideology started to hitting us also the last thing that I would mention in the book is to have a lot of which is the fitzism of of Arabs um it talks about how Westerns Westerners or white people when they came to Turkey or they came to the Islamic OMA and they saw all this the sexual activities they shamed us they shamed us for it and they called the Arabs the people that do sodomy this is basically how they identify the Arabs are the people that you have anal sex because when one of the books actually they said they were very relieved to find one share one uh big king and the Islamic era that actually liked women and they were very surprised because he was one of a kind for them and it was how finally they found one that was decent like them they shamed us for our sexual activities and then they took it away from us and then they categorized it and then they start to say let's be inclusive this is what happened in our history the last thing I would say is if you if me or or Mosa Shadidi what we've been trying to do for the lessons I came to France is to basically look for my queer Arab art for my queer Islamic art and guess where it is it's in the louv metropolitan and Italy I cannot have access to it I do not have access to it Musa Shadidi at the beginning of his book regard most Amor Sabah and if you want it I can send it to you and we've been trying to translate this book so many times but needs a lot of funds of course it doesn't play perfectly for the western agenda but so beginning of his book he writes a whole big paragraph about how many museums he thinks for allowing him to take a look at our art at him as a researcher and basically he's saying absolutely no thanks to the Louvre or I think it's another British um museum that refused to give him access and they put all of the square art in their fucking in the in the in the junk in the in the closet where I don't know what you call it yeah they keep it in their storage so basically not even people that can go there can see I cannot find my queer earth I cannot find my queer Islamic art I cannot find my queer air freak African art because it's still in the houses of western elites and it's not a western ideology we've existed in an entire throughout the entire history of time and the last thing I do not feel as a part of the LGBT community anymore and I prefer saying queer because all I saw after October 7th and all of these western medias that have been talking about my identity and playing with my identity to justify the killing and the genocide of people I do not feel like I belong to the LGBT community anymore not these western ideals not these western ideologies last thing funny story the word sohop which is basically what lesbians do it in Arabic it's called sohop which basically means grinding grinding the Islamic scholar that went to Egypt he found women doing something very bizarre and he wrote about it and this is what all these Arab or Muslim researchers have been doing some of them are not even Arab they were just Muslim some of them were Iranian some of them were from India some of them were from all over the Islamic OMA if you try to find any of these books you will find them marked as erotica on Google you will find that you can really access them you can even see them all of these were researches that were done by Muslim scholars all over the Islamic Uma all over the Islamic times and",

I appreciate that this creator is, like, not saying that you should just, like, up and fucking move because the US sucks, and they're saying more like, hey, we need to advocate for better infrastructure in the US. But at the same fucking time, you are still glazing them. Do that. You are still glazing them. They actually care about their people. Their work culture is worse than the US. Oh, they got cool things. They got robots. They can pump gas in your car. I can pump gas in my fucking car. God forbid you have a fucking disability there and you try to work there. no, no, no. They have a phone charger on their fucking benches. The problem with infrastructure here is public transport and hostile architecture and shit of the like. And funding schools. Yeah, I agree with the fact that Japan is not living in the fucking future. I agree with that wholeheartedly, actually. The US is living behind the times compared to other countries. I don't think she would have made this video if she was queer and living there. I'm just saying. I don't know. Sound off in the comments. Is it just me? Does this sound kind of odd to you guys? Does.

    "voice_to_text": "not only do I really like this video it also helped me pinpoint a feeling that I've been trying to get at for a few years now people really don't help their friends anymore with things that they're struggling with and of course I think there's many different reasons for that happening obviously the biggest one being that we had a pandemic and we were all isolated from each other for about two or three years but especially for people in my age group for example I turned 23 this week and I remember having relationships in high school like this where I was very hands on I was very intuitively like I know that you need help with this you can't help yourself so I'm going to help you do it but even outside of things like a pandemic I think whenever you encounter different kinds of rejection when you encounter different kinds of rejection when you go through certain conflicts or just separations with friends or if you just have a lot of shame whether it comes from friends or family you kind of develop this attitude where you decide to be hands off on people's struggles even if they clearly need help for some people it's like a self preservation thing where they're like this is gonna inconvenience me too much I'm already over simulated all the time I can't afford to help them which is very unfortunate but more often than not that is one group of people the other side is people who are more prone to be obedient who are more prone to feeling shame and just like low self esteem because you think oh I can like sense in my spirit that this person needs help but I don't wanna make them angry by you know trying to do this for them because like oh I'm pushing at their boundaries they obviously don't want help they obviously you know they got it they got it because it it just makes you feel less overwhelmed and you don't wanna lose them and it it's it's really kind of a complicated thing to think about but I think the worst part about it is that over time you do lose that intuitiveness not with just others but with yourself and even with my partner my partner and I met in 2022 and I have had to relearn how to like be a good person like I've had to relearn how to be a girl's girl just because and neurodivergent neurodivergence goes into this too obviously because like when your brain gets used to one thing for so long and you're prone to feeling shame around certain things you have to tell yourself that it's safe to do these \u201cnew\u201d things and so I had to relearn how to be a Girl's girl I had to relearn how to like be open and like be kind and not be afraid of everything because that's really what it is it's just fear and something as beautiful as this is helping someone eat when they clearly can't do it themselves is needs to be more normalized I'm tired of having the same conversation about can you give your friend a ride to the airport like obviously you can this is what we're made for and I just I'm really happy to see that video and I just wanted to speak on that so yeah"

    "voice_to_text": "what age do you consider someone to have come out quote unquote later in life or to be I think to answer this question we need to consider what does it mean to bloom what does society think blooming means because what even is that word you know but I think what society is saying is\u2026 \u2728puberty\u2728 so let's replace bloom with puberty okay when do people when do Homo sapiens experience puberty around the ages of 12 13 right however let's give them a little bit more Grace let's say that not all people experience puberty by 13 let's say some of them experience puberty later so around the beginning of high school let's say 14 15 16 okay um so basically biology textbooks say that during puberty a lot of changes are happening to someone's body (including the brain) and one of them is basically figuring out who you are sexually attracted to and people start getting you know crushes or whatever sexual feelings I know it it sounds gross when you think of a 13 year old having those thoughts but it's been scientifically proven so okay so if you didn't know who you were sexually attracted to by puberty then you're technically considered a late bloomer yeah so if you didn't come out by high school you're technically a late bloomer but let's go beyond this I think the feeling of being a late bloomer is actually a \u2728feeling\u2728 and not like something you can figure out through puberty I think if you came out in college so after puberty we can like assume that you are above 18 in college and you are therefore an adult and therefore you have gone through puberty um but if you did figure out in college that you were queer um and you don't feel like a late boomer then you're not because I think it is majorly just a feeling but personally I came out in college I figured out I was queer in college and I do feel like I'm a late bloomer because I keep thinking keep wondering what would my life look like if I had come out earlier I keep having these recurring thoughts and I don't think somebody who wasn't a late Bloomer has them now the reason why I didn't know is well there might be a lot of reasons but I think one of the major major reasons was I live in a country where being queer was more taboo than in the United States and so I did not know any queer people in real life except for one trans person but even he wasn't considered Trans (other people used she/her on him \ud83d\ude22) did he know he was trans? I don't know he's dead now unfortunately I can't go ask them um but I didn't know any queer people in real life I did not know any queer people who were my age definitely not and so I also didn't see any queer presentation in media until I was 16 years old and so how how would I know that being queer was a possibility for me if I had never seen it it's like when you don't know the possibility of the existence of something how can you know it even exists in the first place It\u2019s like when you don't know What you don't know, you know? there's a lot that we don't know that we don't know but anyway I keep thinking about this what would my life look like if I knew and the truth is I will never know but I did come to the realisation that I'm queer during college and I'm very happy that I did and I'm very happy that the internet algorithm supported my journey because real life would have made it much much harder to figure it out um because my queer awakening was like a celebrity that I found on YouTube so but yeah if you if you feel like a late bloomer then you are one I guess but I also understand why people who are much much older than me might think that I don't deserve to be called a late bloomer because that's like much more extreme like to them maybe that word might hold more weight like somebody who comes out in their 30s Is a late bloomer but I feel like if you can see yourself in a feeling and when somebody describes a feeling you resonate with it then I guess you are allowed to use it I mean I'm not like going out and telling people I'm a late bloomer lesbian no I'm just you know I usually tell people when I have come out if they ask me and usually figuring out in college that you're queer is like a common ish experience but not necessarily everyone figured out then a lot of people did figure it out earlier so I guess it's different for a lot of people I feel like I'm this point I'm just rambling but you get what I'm saying yeah",

I went to the Ren Faire this year. I also went last year. It was pretty fun. I like going to art exhibits and museums. I love Doctor Who, and every year I go to a doctor who convention. I have a small business that I've had for five years where I sell my art, crochet, and jewelry. I like to look for rocks and fossils, stuff to get all dolled up and go for fancy tea to go to the gardens. I'm not very good at it, but I do enjoy dancing. Here's me dancing with Rico Nasty. She's really nice. Here's me doing stand up and drag. I really enjoyed doing comedy. I used to figure skate competitively when I was little, and I really love doing it now. I don't do it competitively, and I'm not very good anymore, but I find it really, really fun. I'm much more balanced on ice than I am on ground. I went to an oddities and curiosities expo. It was really fun. A bit ago, I rescued and care for this butterfly that fell outside my building that had a crumpled wing. And then when she passed away, I preserved and pinned her. I love for the butterflies so much that I ended up getting and raising some other butterflies. And then Releasing them. They were so cute. But, yeah, I can't say I'm too interested in Taylor Swift. So I guess my life is pretty boring and I'm just really normal.",

    "voice_to_text": "It's hardly surprised that we did so badly at Eurovision again for that performance from Ollie Alexander. It was absolutely appalling. I mean, it wasn't the worst of the night, that surely has to go to Ireland, but somehow they did really well. God knows I. Because it was awful. A bunch of screaming people, that is all it was. But Ollie Alexander's was just gay erotica, simple as that. And for a show that should be including children, children should be able to watch it. It's a singing competition, that's it. So why is it always got to be who can be the most controversial? What? Why is that? Why do people need to do that? I mean, always was just a bunch of naked men just thrusting and just shaking about. And he's singing with shambolic. It was shaky, it was poor, the sound was awful, the song is crap anyway, no wonder we got zero points from the wider public outside of the UK. Now, one guy I have no problem seeing, you know, men dancing about, I'm fine with that. But why do you need to always, always shove it down people's throats? Why do gay people always need to do that? Because it just makes us all look really, really shallow. You can enjoy that and that's fine. You can do that, it's fine. But why does someone like that have to represent the UK and a worldwide audience to what, I think 200 million People watch it every year and it's no wonder we do so badly. The one year that the UK has done well in the last god knows how many years is two years ago with Sam Ryder. And why is that? Because we put art and talent above everything else and we should have won. The only reason we didn't win was because everyone gave Ukraine the sympathy vote. Since then, we've had a girl who hates the UK who can't sing. I can't even remember her name, but she was awful and no one's heard of her since. Now we've got Ollie Alexander, who the week before said that the UK flag is controversial. You can't sing. He puts gay erotica in his performance and then wonders why he doesn't do well. He actually gets humiliated and probably now his singing career has gone down the pan, if it hadn't already. Why can't we just get back to a time where art and the singing talent and vocalisation was put at the top of the tree. That was more important than anything else. Why now is choreography and how someone is gonna be so controversial and how controversial can I be? Why is that always put to the top? Singing is down here. How controversial can I be? Is put up there for simply likes and attention. And it's just really, really embarrassing. And it's no wonder the UK just shouts every year with people as. As woke as You are doing your revision for, like. Like Ollie. Ollie Alexander. It's no wonder he's so bad with people like that. They're running the show for the UK, so we're always gonna do badly when you've got way for lefties ruining it for everybody else.",

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, so I'm seeing this narrative being put out there that doctor who is now. It's actually really interesting about how people are finally realising that doctor who is woke. And they think it's only just begun with Jodie Whitaker. Well, as said in the other video, it's been going on a bit longer than that. I mean, it actually started at the beginning of Doctor Who. I mean, they give some really good examples. Um, the meep pronouns thing, though, where the meep goes, I just go by the meep. That's actually called back to Tom Baker, who basically used the doctor as well. What the meep said is what Tom Baker said in one dot 2 episodes. And if you're going to Sarah Jane Adventures, where Matt Smith did a crossover, Clyde asked him, you know, if you can regenerate and look like anything, could you also be black? And he said, yes. And now we have it. Judy, get well. They're not. That's not the first time it happened, because Peter Capaldi caused another Time Lord to generate and he went from a white old man to a young black woman. But the gist is, Time Lords are literally gender benders. They can change their gender with every regeneration, whatever they please. I mean, if regeneration is only brought up because William Hartnell couldn't continue with the series due to his health, but it's brilliant how there's really, there's no gender in the Time Lord world, because They can be man, they can be woman, they can be non binary, they can be whatever they want. They can change their appearance, they can be white, black, they can be Chinese, they can be Japanese, they can be Korean, they can be Russian, etc. Just a regeneration. And yet they think now it's gone woke. I mean that's like people watching Star Trek and thinking it's just now gone woke when it's been woke since it first began. I mean you do realise that a lot of SCI fi's are woke? I mean there's Andromeda until the later series where went really really wrong. There's Stargate SG one, Stargate Atlantis, Star Wars, X Men, you name it, it's woke. It always has been, always will be. And there's nothing wrong with that. So love it or hate it, it's here to stay.",

Okay? I understand.

I'm a trans woman on the internet who runs a little trans news segment. I am not the trans police, so I just wanted to clarify that first. I'm a trans news anchor. And anyway, what I wanted to say with this is that Lily is intentionally making rage bait content. She's very aware of what she's doing because she does it a lot. She usually does it in the form of, like, waiters misgendering her and things like that to kind of get our attention with things. And something that our community gets hit a lot on is that we don't police our own people. And there's a time and place for everything, and this is absolutely not it. So I am calling you out for this. You should not have talked about your bottom surgery at Disney. Monitors and conservatives love to fear monger us and prioritize that like propaganda is that we do all these horrible, horrible things and like, you know, say these things to. Around children, things like that. And as much as we fight against that, and then you come out here and make a video that gets seen by 1.5 million people. Was inappropriate. It's wrong. You should not have done it, and it's gonna make us all look bad. I think you should apologize.",

I've got the sad playlists I've got I've got receipts okay like for as long as they're saying that they knew for they would have had *plenty* of time to like prepare for me to come out and learn and I don't know just like change their actions, I guess? so I don't know I'm choosing to believe that they were BS\u2019in a little bit when they said that they knew for so long yeah you can retroactively see the signs but I mean come on. anyway does this make sense do you do you all like see my thought process?? let me know",

I don't know, dude, that makes no fucking sense. But the reason why they chose that artist for Eurovision was because she was non binary and shows the spectrum of genders that actually exist in reality. Also, they chose her because she's representing Celtic paganism, and in Ireland, Celtic paganism is a big thing. You know, it's kind of how we got Halloween and stuff. And the kind of the point of Eurovision is to represent the country you're from and that country's culture. Like, I'm sorry, you want Eurovision to be all about your religion and your faith and your culture, but that's not what Eurovision is about. It's about celebrating your culture and the place that you're from. And Celtic paganism is a big part of Irish culture in history. Has nothing to do with Satanism or evil or wickedness. Whatever you fucking said in this video. Ireland just chose an artist that was good at representing not only the LGBT community, but also their culture and history. But if you wanna blow up godly artists, simple. Tell them to make actually good fucking music. Music that represents the culture and society that they live in. And then maybe, just maybe, the Eurovision committee will choose that song to represent their country. So get off your high Horse and realize that other religions and other cultures exist in around the world. It's not all Christianity.",

Mind you, I was in my early 20s and in active addiction, so naturally, I was intrigued, but I did want clarification because it didn't really sit well with me. Although he was initially charged with first degree murder, it was brought down to a lesser charge because he didn't actually commit the murder.

When any other race or ethnicity does shit like this, other than black people, it gets pushed out, it goes viral, it does numbers, it's up for days, maybe even weeks. But when black people do anything semi against the grain, oh girl we are silence. And even queer voices too. And TikTok is just known for being racist. TikTok is kind of racist. TikTok is also kind of homophobic, sadly.

    "voice_to_text": "Cause I don't wanna do certain shit. Let's talk about the shit that I don't wanna do that other trans people want you to do. Alright? Call me naive, but I had no idea there were actually people out there, members of our community, gatekeeping what being trans is like, it's some kind of test. Like, if you don't get all of the optional stuff, then you're not trans. That's wild to me. Like, the only thing that makes a person not trans is being sis. Like, take me for example, I've been on hormones now for like 9 months or something, and the hormones have fixed my dysphoria. Isn't that the point? That you look in the mirror and you feel good, that you feel comfortable in your own skin? Like, haven't I achieved what I set out to do with my transition? I look good, I feel good, it's changed my mood, it's changed so much about me for the better. Great. Fixed, right? Like. Like gender affirming care saves lives. And everything else is. Is extra. It's optional. If you need more stuff to make you feel happy, to make you feel right in your own skin, like voice training, like certain surgeries. Great. More power to you. I hope you can be happy. But I'm good. And I don't think that only being on hormones, the hormones that have saved my life as a trans person, makes me any less trans. It's wild. If I get Voice training, that's something I choose to do, but I don't have to. Like, my voice doesn't really give me dysphoria. It's just upsetting if I get misgendered when I'm on the phone to someone or something, but it's not a big deal. I don't hate my voice, and I don't like surgery. I'm not made of money. I can't afford all these surgeries that I don't need. When I look in the mirror, I don't think, oh, chin wrong, nose wrong, forehead wrong. Some people do, and those people can be trans or sis. People get surgeries if they think it'll make them feel more comfortable, but it's. It's optional stuff. I had no idea that there were things that make you trans and things that don't. And if you don't go far enough with this stuff, then you're not transgender. Are we joking? I'm a very, very happy trans woman on her hormones, feeling great. Isn't that enough? I'm me now. What is wrong with our community if there are people gatekeeping like this? No, no, not there for that. Not. Not having it.",

And to that I always say, just because you can talk about something, does that mean you should? Just because you can talk about a certain thing or talk in a certain way, does that mean you should? You know, I'm never gonna walk into a mechanic shop and start busting their balls. I'm never gonna walk into a mechanic shop and go, huh, you're using those kind of wrenches. Or watch you become a mechanic. There's so many other things you could be, you know, I'm never gonna do that. You know why? Because I know nothing about being a fucking mechanic. It's not my place to speak on it. But, you know, straight people like to speak on being gay a whole lot. They do, you know, because a lot of straight people see being gay as a sin. You know, I see that a lot in my live chats. You know, religious people saying, change your ways. This is a sin. And then saying whatever they want about being gay because they think they're saving somebody. They have the whole Messiah complex, you know, I See that a lot. I see a lot of straight people who just don't understand what it means to be gay, so they start gay bashing, and there's no repercussion to it, you know, so they just do it. I've seen that a whole lot. You know, I've seen plenty of people who are straight talk about gay stuff, talk about gay things in interesting ways. I've had straight people tell me that I have bottom energy, which it's like, okay, not sure you really get to say that, but, you know, go off, I suppose. I just think. I don't think straight people have ever been uncomfortable to talk about gay things, make gay jokes, you know, I think they've just been quiet about their opinions about it, but I don't think they've ever been uncomfortable, because I see it every day, and I agree. You know, some things aren't yours to talk about, and that's okay. That's why we meet people, that's why we share our stories. You know, that's why we brought in our horizons, because we don't get to know everything. Which means while we can talk about everything, maybe we should"

    "voice_to_text": "so I wanna talk about this in terms of disability accessibility because this is something I want people to understand about the differences between the able bodied people in these communities and the people who are disabled and what we have to consider and this is no criticism of anybody else who can roll with it you know I was in my 20s and I was the type of person who would go out all night partying and still be coming down off of of you know the the sparkle of the evening and end up rolling straight into PT at 4:30 in the morning for the next day I was working 60 to 80 hours a week and still finding time to to party like I understand that life I'm also disabled and 40 now I don't have that energy I don't have that and it causes a certain level of logistics that a lot of people just don't know about they just don't understand the cost and the thing is that it's a cost both of energy and time but also cost literally so for example the cost of just getting to a place energy wise logistics wise you may be able to run into the airport throw your stuff on the the conveyor belt and get through the airport just fine if you're me you have to make sure you're there make sure you're there early enough that people can convey you there because you can't walk across all the terminals and survive or you're gonna put punish your body to the point of walking because they aren't actually taking care of the disability services the way they're supposed to and making sure that you can transport any kind of mobility devices with you which they break far too often like these are logistics that are just baseline things of getting access to places and the fact look up the number of wheelchairs that get broken by airlines every year uh then you have to get to the venue and you have to have a place in the venue because if you don't get a room in the venue you're not gonna have the energy to get through the entire day so you have to be able to rest you can't even just do everything because you don't have the energy to and those places very rarely consider people in wheelchairs they very often have tables too close together and lots of people milling about and people who aren't listening who stand in your way or ableist people who refuse to act like you even exist because you're inconveniencing them by needing to get past them in a wheelchair um there's a lot of really really absurd shit that happens and so every single thing every single thing that happens at this is more energy more work more uh like output to try and figure out and logistically handle you cannot improvise if everybody wants to go out to an after party and go to a you know a restaurant is that restaurant accessible does it have food that is safe is it there's a whole other level of of logistics to consider that you just can't improvise the way other people can and it gets really really isolating because everyone else just wants to go and they're gonna go and so you end up compromising and just going yeah okay fine everyone go have fun have fun right you don't get to do those things and then afterwards you have all of the same logistics to get back and everybody else just drops and runs with it because they don't have to worry about those things And good for them like I don't begrudge people the fact that they don't have to worry about these things but it is something that logistically a lot of us who are disabled can't engage in these things we can't take an extra week off of work we can't take an extra week to recover with the flare that's gonna happen from all of the travel and all of the stress and all of the overclocking ourselves outside of our tolerances even if we would love to be there even if it would be beneficially professionally to be there we can't afford it energy and and otherwise and so this is just something I wanna bring attention to it's something that it means I very often don't have the same kinds of professional vetting that other people do because I can't be in those spaces I can't afford the amount of overtaxing baselines it takes to even access those spaces and a lot of people just don't realise that so I just wanted to talk about it thank you for giving me the time to uh vent about it because it's just something a lot of people don't seem to get when they can just go ahead and roll straight into another week of of work or whatever else they do because for some of us that's not even an option and so very often we opt out because we can't get our money's worth to go to these kinds of events anyways",

    "voice_to_text": "okay respectfully this is why I don't like straight people using queer terms like I have people in comments who like that's exactly what it means and I think one of the reasons people get this so confused and are so wrong um there are multiple reasons but I think the main one is because they're applying like a heterosexual framework to queer relationships and the fact of the matter is like you just you can't they're not straight so you can't do things in a straight way so Pillow Princess is part of a dynamic that is inherently queer the other half of that dynamic is a stone top a stone refers to someone who doesn't really like to be touched and I have some experience this this I am a trans guy and there are parts of my body that I feel kind of dysphoric about and I don't like to have them touched and when you have parts of yourself that you don't like to have touched a Pillow Princess is a god set because there is a person that you can touch and give pleasure to and they are giving you lots a verbal and physical feedback about the pleasure they are receiving and how great of a job you're doing and you don't have to worry about your body and your own body issues you can just focus on them and the good time that they're having and you can experience that pleasure from giving someone a good time well I think if you're a straight person it can be kinda hard to understand these terms cause there's a bunch of other stuff going on in the background uh anyway Prizl princesses don't just lie there they are definitely active members who are actively participating just not in the way that you might traditionally think of it",

    "voice_to_text": "SVP for this wedding is by scanning the QR code on the like. So this woman is basically complaining that she's received an invite to a wedding, and her nan and her mum have also received an invite to a wedding, and she's mad because the only way to RSVP is through a QR code. And as a 2024 bride who has also given the only way to RSVP on my invites through QR code, I have some thoughts. And the first thought is, why we so quick to dismiss the older people can learn how to use technology? Like, they're older, they're not inept, like, they still got brains. They can learn to use technology. Like my 97 year old Nan, like, we sat down with her and showed how to do it and she was like, oh, that's really cool, that's really easy. I'll know how to do that again in future. That's it, that's all it takes. Like, old people, they're not stupid, they can learn how to do things. And also, like, if somebody really doesn't know how to use QR code, or maybe doesn't have the technology to be able to use it, which I know some people don't, I really don't care if people just drop me a text to be like, by the way, didn't really know how to use it, so just let you know we can come. And then I ask them what food they want because that's one of the Choices on the QR code and that's it. It's done. For me as a bride, doing a QR code has been so much easier than anything else because I don't have to. Like, it just all goes into a Google form then goes into a spreadsheet for me. Or I like look at the responses, put in spreadsheet and that's it. So for like, me as a bride, it saves so much admin cause I'm not constantly chasing people up. Like it's easy. Most people receive the invite and just did it straight away so it takes 30 seconds. The main reason why me and my fiance decided to go with QR code over the traditional like, post it back is because postage is so freaking expensive now. Like, we weren't about to ask people to go to the post office to post a letter or go and buy a whole book of stamps just to send us our invite back. Because I'd like. Most people don't have stamps in the house nowadays. Like, especially young people. Like, I personally don't. I don't remember last time I used a stamp. So I'm not gonna ask people to go and go all the way to post office, buy stamps, post it. And with the state of our postal system right now, who knows if things will even reply reply even arrive back here. Like really? Like, is it going to? Probably not. Then I'm gonna be chasing people up and it's Just gonna be a nightmare. Like QR code. Speaking from a bright perspective is so much easier. So much easier. I, I don't get the problem. I really don't.",

The World Professional Association for Transgender Health just lower the suggested age to 14, not fucking 5! And the only reason why they lowered it to fourteen was because they thought it was unethical to withhold that treatment, because at that age, when puberty is happening, that can lead to more gender identity issues and more body dysmorphia and otherwise. But it's 14, not five. And prior to that, it was 16, not five. So stop with the bullshit and the bigotry and the stupidity. Fuck!",

Let's start there. But in his video, he's talking about how he does not show affection towards his significant other or whoever it is that he has at the house in front of his son. What's wrong with that? And he goes on with a valid point. What happens if his son goes over to his friend's house and does what he saw his dad doing? Now, we all know that there's homophobes out there. I mean, his son could be teased, he could be beat up, all sorts of different things. He's protecting his child. What is wrong with that? Furthermore, it amazes me how so many people have so much to say about how other people are raising their kids. Specifically the ones that don't have any. Where do they do that at? Where do you have the right? Leave this man alone, please."

When you respond in a completely neutral and, um, non confrontational tone. They do not know. They do not know what to do with it.

Like, why are you surprised that people are calling you self hating when you're literally out here fucking expressing internally homophobic ideas? Why are we surprised? Why do people get so surprised when we call a spade a spade? You were literally out here shucking and driving, tap dancing on your knees, groveling for these fucking straight people that are probably gonna vote for you to fucking not even have rights. They're literally fucking doing it as we speak. But you're sitting here kikiing with them like they give a fuck about you or like they actually care about what the fuck you're saying when all they're doing is using a gay voice like yours. Who's fucking tab dancing? Another Christian Walker wannabe ass fucking lame ass nigga. Yeah, they're using somebody like you to fucking give a voice to their own homophobic fucking opinions. That's all that's happening. You're just a token. Every community has these. We got our black Republicans, we have our gays who want to act like they are the moral police of the LGBT community. We got our women who want to be pick me's and tell them what to do. Every fucking marginalized community has people like you who wanna blame the community and like fucking act like you're the one exception. That's just so reasonable that everybody else is just tripping. Shut up. Like you were honestly, seriously pathetic, you sitting here talking about some. Oh, well what if they see it and then like, your argument in itself is so fucking stupid because, okay, so if a straight couple raises a child, they do PDA in front of them, what's gonna happen, quote unquote according to your argument, when they go and perform that same behavior on another child, then what? Are they not potentially also gonna be in trouble for doing sexual acts as a child? Like, what the fuck kind of stupid ass fucking argument is that? Like, are you serious, bro? People need to see healthy relationships in general, regardless if you have a straight, uh, parents or if you have parents that aren't straight. Especially if you have parents that are straight. Because society already does not like fucking showing people who are fucking same sex in in relationships, even raised children or be families in general. So people do need to see people in love. Like, I don't. I don't. And then you got goofy ass people in the comments on some. I don't even hug my man in front of my kids. I don't even kiss my man in front of my kids. I don't even. You're all fucking liars. You're literally fucking liars. Because be serious, bro. Y'all hold yourself to a different standard then you hold gay people. You act like gay People or just supposed to act like best friends all the fucking time and never hold hands or nothing in front of children because they're gonna corrupt you. You're. You're pathetic. Seriously, you're pathetic. And literally just be straight and leave the fucking community cause we don't want anything to do with people like you. You're a sad and pathetic person."

I'm not a racist, I'm not a homophobe, I'm not a transphobe. Mate, you don't get to decide that for yourself. But I'm an ally. A gay man is literally sitting here telling you you're being homophobic, and your response is, nah, nobody knows the oppression more than the community that's oppressed. I don't tell black people that I'm not racist. Or if they say that, I'm being racist because they know what racism is more than I will ever know as a white presenting person. And if somebody says that to me, it's a moment of reflection, not defense. Because the reality of life is that we're born in, into the systems of oppression. And if we're not in that oppressed group, then at times when we're called out by those oppressed communities, it's a time for reflection. It's not a. It's not an attack on your personhood. It's not attack on you personally. So it's like, I can admit that there is unpacking of my own racism. I was born into it. It's not my. Not my fault. It becomes my fault when I don't wanna do the work, when I don't wanna unpack stuff. And that's what this person's doing. It's so tiring, man. Just don't take it as a personal attack. Understand the dynamics of the society that you were born into and unpack it. Then you become an ally. Then you're not being homophobic. Listen, listen.",

And now I am on my way to a job interview. I had to go back to the house to change clothes. I saw her with my very own eyes. Do you think she said anything to me about these? No. Do you know what? Flappers? My gas. The fact that I've never had a yard sale, and they said that is something everybody should experience. So we're getting rid of a whole bunch of our stuff and having a yard sale on Saturday. Instead of donating to goodwill, where it doesn't benefit anybody, we're gonna take the proceeds and we're going to donate them to the women and children's shelter. Do you not mean parachute? She had to give away. Great. Listen, a great man once said, if you can't afford to buy two, don't buy one. Where's mine? I didn't think so.",

I'm so happy that another feminine, gay black man is bringing this to the light. Let's talk about it. Thank you for speaking about this as well. But yes, uh, black women have given me a way harder time with my gay experience than black men have online and in real life. No, I'm not generalizing all black women, but this is just my experience. Black women who have came across feel like they own femininity, and they weaponize that against you. They feel like everything that you have, hair, nails, makeup, clothes, body, personality, is theirs, like you stole it from them. Which isn't the case at all. Although there's been a lot of black women who have accepted me and loved me. Of course, on the other side of the coin, the amount of homophobia that comes from black women specifically, it's shocking. Now, this doesn't make my love for black women any less. Obviously, I love y'all, but I'm just so happy that I've seen another person talking about this, because we need to fix this problem."

Well, first of all, I'm actually really glad this creator is saying this. A little harsh, but there is such a myth. As a couple specialist, I hear so often people comparing which attachment style is worse and which automatically highlights theirs as better or more secure. And in reality, we're all difficult. We all have shit. We're all bringing it into it, the relationship. And what you do in that place, in that position, when you're highlighting your partners struggles, insecurities, burdens they bring into it, when you're highlighting it, you're actually putting each other at odds. And from this place, you will be enemies. You go to war. Because we have to know how to reach our partner in a way that brings them relief. So because we're not born anxious or avoidant, because attachment styles are not personalities, we can actually help our partner move towards security by offering them relief in the moment that they're being activated. And we do it for each other. This is a couple's problem. So if you're one of those people who are like, hey, you are so avoided. I can't be with avoidance or I can't be with anxious people, just know you're difficult, too."
