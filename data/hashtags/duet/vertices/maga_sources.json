Well, now it's happening right in our own homeland. Sometimes you just go abroad and you see the way that you're viewed. It reminds you of how much our own nation has rotted at its core. The time for changes now. 2024 is a 1776 moment. I am proud to be an American. But it doesn't feel that way now when the rest of the world looks down upon the kangaroo courts that send our own political leaders to prison. Enough of it. I don't care if you're on the left or right. This is a danger to the future of our country, and I'm asking you to step up this year so we can actually get this right. We have a country to save, and if we don't get this right, In the next seven months. I think it's quite possible we don't have a country left."

I don't think I've ever seen a more egregious miscarriage of justice than this. You had a prosecutor that ran his entire campaign on putting him in jail. You had people from the Biden administration present at the trial. You had a judge that told the jury, hey, you don't need a unanimous decision to convict him. You only need four guilty votes. And you had to stay in New York, go back and change the law so that this was no longer outside the statue of limitations. An unbiased person can take a look at this and say it's clearly a witch hunt. But what's hilarious is this is backfiring on them in a major way. It's like that scene from Star Wars when Obi Wan tells Darth Vader when they're fighting, if you strike me down now, become more powerful than you could possibly imagine. I'm not just talking about my rear end, either. After the verdict broke, his donation site crashed from too much traffic. It even beat out a word I'm not gonna use, but you can see for yourself on Google. This isn't 1963. You can't just get away with it. There are far too many resources available.

That's a critics is the message from the new progressive Manhattan district Attorney Alvin Bragg. Mr. Bragg has new policies that's to some is a stunning reversal of the traditional law enforcement policies. Bragg stressing diversion and alternative to jail time by crisis intervention over putting some criminals behind bars. He will no longer incarcerate law breakers unless it's murder, a crime that involves someone's death, or a felony. Bragg says his goal is quote, safety and fairness. He also wants the defendant's rights to be considered his officer. Largely no longer enforce some trespass crimes, resisting arrest, fair beating, sex work, and is reducing charges that could mean no jail time for armed robbery, some of those cases, stealing from stores and storage areas of homes, and dealing drugs. When Bragg ran for district attorney, he promised not to charge shoplifters for stealing stuff worth less than 250 bucks, meaning you could potentially shoplift up to that amount and still get away with it. Police unions and criminal justice advocates are outraged, saying Bragg is giving criminals a free pass.",

The Democrats have succeeded in their years long quest to turn America into a whole country.",

What was that? 75 million liberals orgasming at the same time? 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. Yeah! Way to go, dad! Damn it, Eric, this is not good. Why you even here? Because they let me out on Thursdays. Mr. President, you have nothing to worry about. This is a real disgrace. Mr. Trump, sentencing will be. Do you have merch already? Sure do. Corrupt New York T shirts, only $49. Sentencing is on July the 11th. Am I going to jail? Not a chance, sir. Here are the next steps. 34 felonies. The bigliest and best amount of felonies you could have. Joe Biden can't even count to 34. So we're gonna file an appeal. Our country's gone to hell. And if we lose that, we'll go to the New York Supreme Court. I survived home alone, too. I can survive this. And then we go to your buddies at the Supreme Court. I appointed those guys. They'll find me innocent. Sure. Will I still run for president? Well, you can't be a police officer or governor, but President? United States. Sure. Let's change who people vote for. This won't change a single thing, sir. Pretty good system. It is. And I'm pretty sure when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, a sex offender with 34 felonies is exactly who they had in mind to be president.",

    "voice_to_text": "Thank you for joining us here today. Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump was arranged by Manhattan grand jury on 34 felony counts. This case is an abomination. You know, it's obviously political. Seven years try to come up with this case. They're just wrong on the law. The only crime that Donald Trump is being prosecuted for is the crime of running for president. Political persecution at the highest level. They, quite frankly, given up on trying to beating at the polls. Either gonna steal it or stop it. By law firm. A Democrat prosecutor elected on a get Trump platform. What's going on here is a disgusting disgrace. It is war on Trump. It is war on the Republican Party, and it is a war on the republic. This case is the weakest case I've seen in 60 years of teaching, practicing, and writing about permanent law. And I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant. His name was not Donald Trump. This judge, I mean, you don't need a prosecutor if you have a judge like this. This judge is not on the level. It's a terrible case, but the judge has been pretty much a rubber stamp on everything that Bragg is wanted to do. They're perverting the system of justice. You know, that's where the danger lies. The corruption and subversion of our institutions by the left. This is the Democrats entire strategy to confine President Trump to a dirty criminal courtroom. And Keep him off the campaign trail where he can bring is winning message to voters across this country. New York has become a legal banana republic. They are so determined to get Donald Trump. Look, convicting Donald Trump, that's all they have. I think they have no cards, and they're depending upon Trump getting convicted. That Trump Train doesn't show any signs of flowing down. The only verdict that matters is the verdict at the ballot box.",

Donald Trump was convicted of interfering in the 2016 election, which he, quote, won by the tiniest of margins. In all likelihood, these crimes, coupled with his documented collusion with Russia and false stories about Hillary, which he got placed in the National Inquirer, then enabled him to select three Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He saddled America with trillions of dollars of debt thanks to his tax cut for corporations and billionaires. And multiple credible resources have estimated that his COVID misinformation and lies cost hundreds of thousands of Americans to lose their lives unnecessarily. These Trump felonies had monumental consequences, and the judge, district attorney, prosecuting lawyers, and jurors were terrorized and continue to be terrorized endlessly by Trump. So I say Donald Trump should go to jail immediately for these crimes, which America paid an incredible price for. What do you think?",

This is what Putin does. And if this exact same situation was happening to a Democrat right now, any Democrat, I would be saying the same thing. Because it's wrong. Not only is it wrong, but it's also entirely hypocritical, because people that were a part of this trial were saying that the voters of Donald Trump deserve to know this information before they voted for him in 2016, in 2020. So why don't the voters get to know about Hillary Clinton's 36,000 emails then? That's so hypocritical. Why didn't the voters get to know about Hunter Biden's laptop? Why didn't the voters get to know about hunter and Joe Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and what 10% for the big guy meant? And again, I'm trying to come out of a place of common sense here as an independent voter. I wanna know what Joe and Hunter's emails were about now.

I remember y'all saying that Trump would weaponize the DOJ, go after his political rivals, and then he would lock them up. But Trump didn't do that. Your own side did that. Are y'all good? I mean, we all know that Trump is gonna win this on appeals, no doubt. And then come November, he's gonna win the election, and then on January the 20th of 2025, he is going to get inaugurated. He is gonna be America's daddy in 2025. There's nothing y'all can do to stop that. No matter how hard you try to prevent, he still gonna be your daddy in 2025.

This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters after leaving the courtroom. \u201cThe real verdict is going to be Nov. 5, by the people,\u201d he said, referring to Election Day. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do a thing wrong. I\u2019m a very innocent man.\u201d   He also falsely blamed President Biden. The case was brought by the state of New York and has nothing to do with the federal government.   Judge Merchan will sentence Mr. Trump on July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention.   Each count carries the possibility of up to four years in prison, but the judge is likely to impose the punishment concurrently.   The judge could also opt to impose a sentence of probation, with no prison time, or he could impose a fine or community service.   Mr. Trump is expected to appeal the decision, a process that could take months to years.   It\u2019s one of four criminal cases involving the former president, but the others are not expected to go to trial before the November election.   Being a convicted felon does not prohibit Mr. Trump from seeking the presidency.   #donaldtrump #trump #hushmoney #cspan ",

    "view_count": 364482,
    "voice_to_text": "Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. He and his supporters are lying about what that means. They're pretending his crimes aren't serious. No crime. Everyone says there was no crime. Rubbish. Witnesses testified that during the 2016 campaign, Trump arranged illegal payments to deceive voters about information that could have changed the outcome of the election. The crimes were successful. Voters did not find out until after the election that Trump allegedly had affairs with a porn star and a former playboy model while his wife was caring for their Newborn son. Trump won by only 80,000 votes across several swing states, votes that very likely would have been influenced by this sort of information. These illegal payments were serious enough to put Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in prison, and it was Trump's own Justice Department that put him there. As president, Trump continued a criminal cover up from within the White House. He reimbursed Cohen's payments to Stormy Daniels in a series of checks and then made criminally false business filings to conceal their purpose. Every single charge Trump was found guilty of is a serious enough offense to carry a penalty of up to four years in prison. Now, Trump claimed that his trial was rigged. This trial is rigged, but the verdict comes from a jury of ordinary citizens who unanimously decided that the evidence proves his guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. The fact that Trump has been separately indicted for even more serious crimes doesn't diminish the Seriousness of these felonies. Never before has a convicted felon been a major parties candidate for president. A criminal record like Trump's would be a serious obstacle to getting any job in the White House, let alone the highest office in the land. Trump willfully and repeatedly broke the law and has shown no remorse. If the Republican Party continues to support a criminal convict as their nominee, they have no business calling themselves the party of law and order ever again.",

You know, it's obviously political. Seven years try to come up with this case. They're just wrong on the law. The only crime that Donald Trump is being prosecuted for is the crime of running for president. Political persecution at the highest level. They, quite frankly, given up on trying to beat him at the polls. Either gonna steal it or stop it. By law firm, A Democrat prosecutor elected on a get Trump platform. What's going on here is a disgusting disgrace. It is war on Trump. It is war on the Republican Party, and it is a war on the republic. This case is the weakest case I've seen in 60 years of teaching, practicing, and writing about criminal law. And I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump. This judge. I mean, you don't need a prosecutor if you have a judge like this. This judge is not on the level. It's a terrible case, but the judge has been pretty much a rubber stamp on everything that the Bragg has wanted to do. They. They're perverting the system of justice. You know, that's where the danger lies. The corruption and subversion of our institutions by the left. This is the Democrats entire strategy to confine President Trump to a dirty Criminal courtroom and keep him off the campaign trail, where he can bring his winning message to voters across this country. New York has become a legal banana republic. They are so determined to get Donald Trump. Look, convicting Donald Trump, that's all they have. I think they have no cards, and they're depending upon Trump getting convicted. That Trump train doesn't show any signs of slowing down. The only verdict that matters is the verdict at the ballot box.",

I know this brother wasn't trying to insult his own sister's intelligence. Let's go. One more thing. One thing for certain, and two damn things for sure. My brother James. It's not Biden who's trying so damn hard to take our voting rights away. It's not Biden who elected federal judges only to give state lawmakers the okay to make laws to suppress me and you from voting. But, bro, I have more. It was Trump, not Biden, who nominated three Supreme Court justices, gave the signal to other states to overturn Roe v. Wade locally, on a local level only so we could be challenged in court. So we can work his way up to the Supreme Court. Knowing damn well the Supreme Court had enough justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. Then that why Trump said what he said. Thanks to the Biden Harris administration book that created 2.6 million jobs for our people, our unemployment rate is the lowest under them. Thanks to his administration for expanding the Affordable Care Act. Because of that, many of us have lower health insurance premiums. While Trump was in office, he did everything that he can do to prevent us from having health care. And reference to the Affordable Care Act that he tried to dismantle while he was in office. This is what He did reduce outreaching opportunities for enrollment. He cut ACA subsidies to insurance companies. Did I tell you how he's been trying to tackle rent Gaulgian by landlords? Oh, they've been fighting for a ten thousand dollar tax credit for first time homebuyers. But you see, that starts with Congress because they hold the purse strings. Where were you at in 2,022 when the ByteDance Harris administration expanded access to 12 months of Medicaid and CHIP postpartum coverage? Because you see, it is our sisters who suffer the most when it comes to the maternal mortality rate in this country. It was Biden's administration signed an executive order to advance accountable policing since we couldn't get the George Floyd Bill to pass the Senate. When it comes to our people having small businesses, the biggest increase comes from Biden. Honey, we didn't benefit from Trump's tax cuts. His tax cuts reinforce discrimination when businesses were hurting during a pandemic, especially our people businesses. He gave most of that money to big corporations in his people. Did I mention the $16 billion that Biden gave to HBCU's? But it was Trump Supreme Court justices who stopped Biden's student loan debt forgiveness plan. Wanna ask me again what Biden has in common with us?"

A 13 year old victim is forced to give birth over confusion about the state's abortion ban. She was just 12 years old when it happened, and yet, because of Mississippi's archaic abortion laws, her mom didn't know whether she would qualify for the exemption. And even if she did qualify, it's unlikely that any physician would have performed one anyway, given the high penalties for doctors who violate the state's abortion ban. And so now, at 13 years old, this little girl in seventh grade has an eight month old child. This right here is the direct result, the direct result of what Donald Trump did to the Supreme Court.",

    "voice_to_text": "New Yorkers say they're shocked after seeing Muslim patrol cars roaming their neighborhoods like police squads. These Muslim community patrols just began operating in Brooklyn this year, and according to the council on American Islamic Relations, they are the first of their kind in the United States. The patrol spraying up was an apparent response to some 14 biased incidents against New York Muslims in 2017, actually a rather low number considering there's over 8.6 million people living in the city, according to the group's vice president Noor Rabba. The group currently has 30 members, but plans on rapidly expanding to cover the entire city. He describes the Muslim patrols like a neighborhood watch but on steroids, with members dressed like police officers and driving cars identical to police squad cars. Residents say they're uncomfortable with the patrols, which they describe as being similar to Sharia police. Others have raised doubts about the purpose of the patrols, saying New York's police department is already very diverse, and their only job is to patrol the city streets and protect people from harassment or crime. So why does there need to be a Muslim group tasked with the same job as the police? Even other Muslims have raised questions about the need for the patrols, with residents expressing fears this is just another form of Sharia law enforcement. Similar groups can already be seen in other major European cities in Denmark, Germany, France, Sweden, and Britain. These patrols have been going on for years, and a CNN report caught Muslims from patrol in London harassing residents in Whitechapel. One man can be heard insulting a gay man, calling him offensive names and telling him he wasn't welcome in a Muslim area. Others denounce residents for drinking, claiming this is a Muslim area and alcohol is not permitted. They also harassed a woman as she was crossing the street, warning her that her short skirt was not allowed in Muslim areas. And now with the arrival of these Muslim patrols to New York City, Americans are becoming worried they'll fall under the same harassment for not following Islamic practices.",

You know, when you look at it from a policy perspective, if you just look at it on paper, what he did was effective. A lot of people think it was effective. You don't like him as a personality, so ignore that. Don't do that. Look at it in terms of a policy perspective. People liked the ideas that he was putting forward. And you can see the same for Biden. His approval rating in our poll clocks in at 37%. That is his low in our poll. That's the lowest the president has checked in in an NBC poll since the final days of the George W. Bush administration in 2,008. The disapproval rating, also an all time high in our poll for Biden.

    "voice_to_text": "Speaker Johnson told reporters earlier this week he knew intuitively that non US citizens had been voting in the elections. How does an election official certify that someone is a US citizen when they come to vote? There are multiple protections around those. First, it is against the law. There is a federal statute, 18 US Codes, Section 6 11, that says it's unlawful up to a year in jail and finds it for a non citizen that votes. In addition, under the Help America Vote Act, which has been in place for over two decades, every single registered voter needs to provide ID before registering. And that ID is almost always a driver's license number, which is checked against the motor vehicles file. And when you go to motor vehicles, you know you need to show legal presence. Most people show a birth certificate from the United States or passport, which shows that they're citizens. That can be checked against that. If they don't have that, if. If they. If they don't have that, they can provide a Social Security number, which is also checked. Or they have to provide ID at the polls before they vote. So there's absolute ID for voter registration. And we know these two protections have been enormously successful because this is knowable, despite what the speaker might have said. Georgia, for instance, ran an audit of their entire voter registration system. They found a about 15 people that they couldn't confirm whether they were Citizens or not. And determined that literally zero of them had voted. Same with other states have done similar things. The data is all in the state databases. They can check it. We can be very confident that voting by non citizens is extremely rare. Virtually not existent. Not zero, probably, but very close to zero.",

    "voice_to_text": "Huge breaking news right now. In Donald Trump's election interference criminal trial in New York City, judges Mercian has admonished Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's lead attorney, during closing arguments for making, quote, highly inappropriate and outrageous statements to the jury. At the conclusion of Todd Blanche's closing arguments to the jury, he said, to think twice before sending a man to prison, referring to Donald Trump. Now, in criminal court, a jury's job is to adjudicate guilt or innocence. It's not to give punishment to a criminal defendant. Punishment is the job of the judge, not of the jury. Which is why it is highly improper for a defense attorney to argue that possible punishment to a jury. Prosecutors quickly objected, and Judge Marshawn called Blanche's comment highly inappropriate, outrageous, especially given the fact that Blanche used to be a federal prosecutor who should have known better. And as a result, Judge Marshawn will be giving a curative instruction to the jury when they return from lunch. Closing arguments are continuing with prosecutors up next, and then we could have deliberations in a verdict. So stay tuned for all the news you need to know about.",

We'd forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing. Now, this is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all. We don't wanna wake up after the election saying, what, again? My god, what the hell have we done?

    "voice_to_text": "I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all Americans on January 6th, 2 thousand twenty one. For two decades, I was a DC police officer serving the citizens of the district of Columbia, primarily working in narcotics. On January 6th, 2 thousand twenty one, I heard distress calls coming from fellow police officers on the capital as thousands of Trump supporters rush them and brutally assaulted members of law enforcement. That day, I, like many other hundreds of other DC police officers, put on a uniform and responded to the capital to assist our brothers and sisters in law enforcement defending the capital from a violent, armed mob of Trump's supporters. These supporters were fueled by Trump's lies and the lies of his surrogates. Lies that the 2020 election was stolen. Those same lies have been spewed by Donald Trump and his secure surrogates about what happened to me and so many other police officers on January 6th, 2,021. That day, I was brutally assaulted. I was pulled from the police line by a man named Albuquerque Head, a Trump supporter who later played guilty to his violent assault on me. While being restrained by the violent mob, I was beaten. An individual named Kyle Young tried to strip me of my firearm, while chance of killing with his own gun were echoed by other members of the crowd. At that time, Thomas Civic, a man from Buffalo, New York, Stripped me of my badge and my police radio, my lifeline to call for help from other officers. All the while, I continue to be beaten and then struck with a Taser on my neck by Daniel Rodriguez, another Trump supporter, who also played guilty to his violent assault on me. All four of these individuals are self admitted Trump supporters. All four of them commit, committed violent assault on law enforcement. I'm just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump supporters inspired by his loss, the lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans, to turn against police officers. At the end of the day, this election is about Donald Trump and his vision for the office of the president of the United States. Not as a public servant who answers to the elected, to the people who elected him, but is an authoritarian who answers to and serves only himself. Thank you.",

But as people start to look around, something raises eyebrows. A Trump 2024 campaign flag on the Delmar Post Office property. A federal agency in. This is a day of memorial for soldiers who passed away. And to do that today makes it even more, uh, upsetting to me as a veteran. Some people say this is not the place for a political statement. Regardless of which party you support or which candidate you support, this is federal property, and this is not the place for you to eke out a position and perhaps persuade public opinion. It's equally wrong if it was a Joe Biden flag. According to the United States Postal Service website, it says the only flags to be displayed at postal facilities are the flag of the United States of America, the Postal Service flag, the POW flag, and flags directly related to the USPS programs, missions, and activities with special permission. It's refreshing. Refreshing? How so? We have a little change of pace. We were normally so democratic in this town. So do you think it's okay to have this flag on federal property? I can see where that's a little sticky that it's on the federal property. That's could be a problem. Seems it belongs to everybody. The USPS communication specialist tells me in an email the flag in question Was not placed on our staff by postal personnel and will be removed as soon as possible and by early afternoon on Memorial Day it was gone.",

If even for a short time, people would bring us meals at rest areas and truck stops, hold up signs thanking us on overpasses and featuring us on the news. But then the world went back to normal and once again we were the enemy of the interstate. Now fast forward three and a half years later and a majority of the American truck drivers have seen their income cut by almost 50%. Yet we still have to deliver the goods and we still have to provide for our families. We still have to pay for repairs and diesel to our semi trucks. We still have to pay for permits and insurance while half of our pay is in other people's pockets. The FMCSA doesn't care about the American trucker. They simply wanna limit our trucks to 60 miles an hour, making us even more hated on America's roadways. Who is gonna step up and take care of the American truckers? Set regulations so the brokers cannot charge whatever percentage they want, all the while robbing the American truck driver who actually does the work. Now American truckers cannot even afford to go home to See our families, let alone our doctors. Because we are the ones struggling under this administration.

Somehow he even got self styled patriots to support a man who called for terminating the constitution and on January 6th rallied an angry mob to threaten democracy, leaving death and destruction in its wake. That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden Harris head, because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'll use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed.

Weren't you two protesting on January the 6th of 2021 what you are still claiming to this day to be your own particular injustice? Or did you already know that your type of fake injustice don't count because you also know that none of you were protesting any injustice but rather were in the process of creating yet another one for everyone else to deal with? So please tell me, to whom exactly are you then comparing the pro Palestinian and the BLM people to to then conclude that they are the worst people? Ohh, I see. You are comparing the pro Palestinian and the BLM people  to the Jewish people, right?  Because after all, who else could be worse than the people who claim to have higher privilege than you do because theirs is divine given? But hey, at least they're not lazy black or brown people who are getting in the way of your white privilege like the worst people are, right? Let me ask you this also, Emily. Why do you think that the pro Palestinian people are protesting the Jewish people and not the government institutions of Israel, which are the ones committing all the injustices and atrocities? Don't you know there's a difference between the two? And if not, why is it then  that anytime you see the worst people protesting any type of injustices, you always think they are protesting you? Don't you realize that you're telling on yourself each time you do that? And one last question Emily saves America.  From what exactly are you trying to save America? Is it from the worst people?

They allegedly only used hammers, manual saws, and basic tools. Does that make any sense to you? Look at these grand structures and ask yourself, how could they achieve all this with such primitive methods? It makes you wonder if our historical timeline is accurate or completely fabricated to hide something. It gets even scarier. What if the dates on these buildings are wrong? Imagine if that No. 1 wasn't a one at all. Our history could be off by 1,000 years. This brings us to who could have built these intricate structures? Have you ever heard of Tartaria? Tartaria is a colossal empire that conveniently gets left out of mainstream history. But you can never truly erase history, as many references can be found in old maps and documents. Tartaria was a highly advanced civilization with technology and knowledge far beyond what we can imagine. They have even been credited to have built the Great Wall of China. And many of these intricate buildings pictured earlier. Could Tartaria be the missing link that explains these architectural marvels and historical anomalies?",

Older millennial was heavily intoxicated during this entire live. It lasted about an hour before he got shut down. And y'all, when I say the whole thing was a train wreck, I'm not kidding. Harry and Chris came with factual information with sources to back up their claims. When Harry asked for the source to something, older millennial laughed and said, oh, that's the facts. It's not my fault you don't like facts. Ultimate trust me bro stuff. And it only escalated from there. Older millennial didn't like being corrected on his incorrect numbers, to the point that he repeatedly muted and booted Harry. And as guest links didn't have any actual information either. They would both make accusations or ask questions and then when Harry or Chris went to answer them, they would just yell over them. They didn't wanna have a good faith argument, they didn't wanna have a debate. They had no factual information. They just wanted to use this as an excuse to yell at and demean Chris and Harry. Aside from being belligerently drunk on TikTok, it was super cringy how older millennial kept trying to say he was more important because he has a million followers. Like apparently how many followers you have on TikTok sums up your life's importance. And I don't know, that's pretty sad. Both older millennial and guest use that Time to degrade Harry and Chris for being so young, as well as make a lot of accusations about them. And yeah, older millennial did argue to unalive disabled people and argued that women that have received a specific type of health care should be sterilized. As if he has some moral superiority to judge anybody with. How many DUIs now? And now he's trying to gaslight people on his page. That's not what I said. Yeah, it is. He even double down. But lucky for you, you don't have to believe me. I recorded the entire thing last night, and after 9 hours of trying to upload it to YouTube, it is finally there. I know it's an hour long, but I posted the whole thing because I didn't wanna be accused of editing anything. The link to the YouTube's in my profile. If you don't believe me or you wanna see it for yourself. It's all there. Now, after all of this, if you're still supporting older millennial, kindly see yourself off my page. I don't want you here. And honestly, he should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed for him.",

And yesterday, in front of nearly 5,000 people, he said he wants to kill everyone with a mental disability. Yeah, so I guess we've kind of reached, and then I'm perfectly fine with throwing mental, mentally disabled people off a mountain. All right. Um. I believe in I. I believe in the betterment of humanity. I don't think we should care. Later in the day, he doubled down on his statement when questioned about it by my friends Harry and Chris. People. Yeah, I think people who are gonna hold humanity back, we should eliminate them. Can you define, like, hold humanity back? Yeah, people who have met an IQ standard that they cannot support humanity or support a normal job or are mentally disabled. After his interaction with Harry and Chris, he seemed to recognize that this was incredibly damaging to his public image, as well as potentially damaging to his business, MCU, that he publicly owns. So he decided to backtrack and lie to everyone. And this clip that he posted that is now taken down. He said this entire conversation was about abortion, so liberals will never let shit take it out of context, go to waste. So you're about to see a ton of videos about me. You're not gonna see that that conversation was about abortion. See, we were having a discussion about abortion, and this was a lie. The original conversation, Was about veganism. You don't. You wouldn't feel bad for, like, throwing a mentally disabled person off a cliff? Like, you could just go vegan. I don't understand why you're. No, no, I just, like, you're going to be a burden in humanity. Off the rocky. Go. I know that eventually I would run into somebody who will bite this bullet. It's just. This is the first time someone's actually bitten this bullet. To avoid veganism. But even if it were to be about abortion, this is still the older millennial supporting eugenics. I wanna make this next bit very clear. These ideologies are no different than the ideologies of Mustache Man in Germany in the 1930s, as well as the same ideologies that drove American slavery. These beliefs are morally a poor and depraved beyond belief. And I would like to make it clear this is not a political issue. I bet that we can all agree, regardless of who you're voting for at the end of the year, that we should not support creators who publicly support genocide. Let's hold the older millennial accountable for his actions.",

It showed negative and sung my praises in the first half of her CNN interview with Alison Cooper, but changed her tune in the second half. Gee, I wonder why. Under appeal, the rape charge was dropped by a jury. Or Arthur Engoron, the New York State Waco judge who find me almost $500 million under appeal for doing nothing wrong. Used a statute that has never been used before, gave me no jury. Marlago at $18 million. Now for Mercian end quotes. Lot of defamation there. He defamed Eugene Carroll, whom he owes $91 million to. He attacked the judge who's currently overseeing his criminal trial. He also attacked Judge Arthur Engron. And let me remind you, not One mention of the troops who served this country, which is who we're supposed to be honoring this Memorial Day, and this guy wants to be president of the United States and the commander in chief.

And I'm just wanna remind everyone, here are just a few of the things that Donald Trump has said about soldiers who risked their lives for this country. Multiple media outlets tonight reporting that President Donald Trump made disparaging comments about America's fallen troops, including calling US Marines killed in World War 1. Quote, losers and suckers. What animal would say such a thing? And candidate Donald Trump said this about then Senator John McCain, who was a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam. He's not a war hero. He's a war hero. Five and a half years. He's a war hero cause he was captured. I like people that weren't captured. What animal would say such a thing? According to a stunning new profile in the Atlantic, following wounded army captain Luis Avila's rendition of God Bless America, Trump walked over to congratulate and embrace him. But moments after that, the former president told Chairman Millie, quote, why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that. The wounded never let Avila appear in public again. Trump told Millie, the words of a president matter. President's words do matter. And Donald Trump's have been very negative of those in the military. Just a reminder, this election season is coming up, but on today, take a moment, reflect on those who pay the ultimate Sacrifice to defend your freedoms and make this country the way it is today.",

I truly do love you. I'm not here for your money. I don't wanna be a paid promoter. I wanna do this for heart. I wanna do this because I want your prayers, I want your heart and I want your ear. I wanna teach you guys diversity within the transgender umbrella. And I want to have that. You know that there's some of us that are willing to stand with you to defend American liberty, American Equality, woman's rights and sanity in this nation. There's a reason I'm the most censored trans woman. There's a reason why I can't go on meta. There's a reason I can't fly on Instagram. And that reasons you, because I love you and I stand with you. And I will counter the message in a propaganda coming out. Cause maggot is nothing but love to me. They've been nothing but family to me. You guys have brought me through, you've adopted me, you've helped bring me to a closer relationship with god. You pray for me, you've turned my life around. And I wouldn't be here today, and I would not have the relationship of god today, I would not have the peace of my life if it was not for the people of this movement. You Are my fellow Americans. And I truly love you, not just on this app. I see you guys out in public in the way, it's just, it's amazing. We are family. And then I know it drives a left nuts. How can a trans woman. Well, because it's not about my trans identity, it's about my heart. It's about who we are. It's about standing up and defending the values that we share. And I wanna teach you how the Marxist left, how the analogs, how the alphabet man have taken a weaponized to gender identity movement. And I wanna help you guys better protect yourself. So I thank you for those who that invite me into your lives with an opportunity to do so. Um, I'm just gonna make this kind of quick and let you know that I am gonna be moving. I'm moving up north to Pennsylvania for the next few months. And I'm very excited to do so. And I wanna get very active, uh, with helping to, well, get the message out there that MAGA there's, there's a lot of love. So doesn't matter how you vote, you see me out in public, you off from the off looking at me and seeing this signal of the double fisted, I love you because that's a message I want to get out to America. It's love. You know I do love you all no matter how you vote. But my MAGA family is very special to Me, because they've shown the love back, whereas the other side has not. And I appreciate you, and I wanna let you know. Thank you. My door is always open and so is my heart. I look forward to growing with you all. Bye. I love you.",

But why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple. And the truth, the real truth is I won by 400,000 votes. At least we believe. But we do have an accurate election. No, I dare you to. The former president was pushing to see if he could somehow, you know, it would move me somewhere. Someplace. Cause I think that's been an effective strategy for him over his business career, political career. The people tend to debacle instead of stand firm on their principles. In Georgia, Trump had lost to Biden by 11,779 votes. What? So what are we gonna do here? But I only need 11,000 votes. Tell us. I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. Why? Why do you keep fighting this thing? It's just doesn't make sense. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right. Trump didn't understand. It just. It just doesn't click with. Didn't click with them that someone wouldn't just give in. It just did not occur to him that there was some higher level of loyalty to the law and the Constitution. They knew that we had followed the law and we followed the Constitution. And I Think sometimes moments require you to stand up and just take the shots, doing your job. And that's all we did. You know, we just followed the law and we followed the Constitution. And at the end of the day, President Trump came up short. But I had to be faithful to the Constitution, and that's what I swore. I know what to do. This call becomes critical because it's recorded. We get this here in the presence, own voice, how he's doing it, what he's doing, how he's putting pressure on these people. So, look, all I wanna do is this. I just wanna find, uh, 11,780 loves. This is a scheme to overthrow an election. He knew the number that he needed to hit to change the outcome of the election. And Trump accused Ruffensberger himself of a crime. Allowing election fraud. It's more illegal for you than it is for them, because you know what they did and you're not reporting it. That's the thing, you know, that's a criminal. That's a critical offense. The president of the United States demanding that an election official find thousands of votes and then strongly implying that there would be criminal sanction in the event that those votes were not found. I mean, that is terrible evidence for the president. What I knew is that we didn't have any votes to find. It continued to look, we investigated. Like, I just shared the numbers with you. There were no votes to Find that call is damning, and I think it's going to be damning potentially in front of a jury.",

Rocket Dump ran for president under the slogan time to get serious now. For the record, since Trump became president, if anything, the world is laughing harder than ever before. Because while all US presidents do get made fun of, impersonating Trump has become an international cottage industry. Israel has Trump kicking a Muslim man while dancing loudly to Guns N Roses. Germany has him dancing to Uptown Funk. Spain has him flipping off the world and again, dancing like an idiot. And there's more. Here he is in Pakistan. Here he is in Bulgaria. Here he is in Taiwan. Here he is in Ethiopia. Here's a pretty shitty one from Turkey, where they're not even trying. Here's a Korean Trump. And here's one from an Italian comedy show singing born in the USA on a stealth fighter before being taken out with a bucket on his head. Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the lot.

This one is from Russian TV with a comedian making fun of Trump's suspiciously close relationship to Putin. And there is a fun little surprise for you just at the end. Not now, Hillary. The other day, Hillary asked me, Donald, do you love Russia? I answered, yes, I do. I love Russia, but you have no evidence against me. Oh, my god. That is as happy as I've ever seen Putin ever."

    "voice_to_text": "When Donald Trump ended his first term, it took $71,000 a year to buy a home in this country. Now it requires $121,000 a year. There are three things that matter when you vote. It's not about mean tweets. It's not about tone. It's not about indictments or any of that. It's who is going to give me a better economic future? Who is going to keep the country in a more stable setting when it comes to crime in the border? And which. Which president has shown to have less war abroad? Let's go one by one. Under Donald Trump, every single person, this audience, was on their way to own a home, to be able to get richer. Under Joe Biden, it is out of grass for every single one of you. It is harder than ever. Number two, the border. We have 10 to 15,000 people a day coming across the southern border, uh, completely destabilizing, um, our immigration policy. Number three, um, Israel, Hamas. War is obviously tearing this campus apart and tearing apart our country. None of that happened under Donald Trump. Russia never invaded Ukraine. Donald Trump is the first president in 40 years to not declare a new war. As president of the United States, we had less war and more peace. People were getting richer, and we had more stability. So those are the three things that I would look at. Because under Joe Biden, you will have less rights. The government will Spy on you more, they'll restrict your First Amendment rights more, they'll destroy your purchasing power and the money you have in your pocket. You'll have more international war and more destabilization here with crime and things happening on the border.",

I'd like to propose that we go tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. See, that right there is called freedom of speech. Our First Amendment. Something that your president and his puppet masters are sucking away from us by the day. I bet a Trump supporter could never do that at a Biden's speech. He'd be thrown out, or he would have finished his night in jail. Do you know what happened to him at the end of the day, Harry? Hmm? Nothing. He stayed there. He finished watching the convention, and then he went home to his family, because that's his right to freedom of speech. No problems whatsoever. But that's not what we're here for. Come on. Keep watching, Harry, and make sure you pay attention. You should nominate Trump for president of the United States. Whoa! The boo kept coming. They said what they said. They stood their grounds. You know who also stood their ground? DJ T. The first time in 50 years a political opponent go to another party and hold a convention, speaking to everybody. You know what that showed me, Harry? Trump has giant balls. Huge balls. Something Biden knows nothing about. Talk about defending freedom, but I've actually put everything on the line to resist. Now, that man walked into that crowd a angry, Mob pissed off people practicing their First Amendment. And let's be honest, by the time he got done, more than half of the crowd respected and started going in favor of Trump. I stand before you tonight as your best hope of defeating the weaponized bite. Let me tell you something. If I was never a Trump supporter after this, he would have surely, surely earned my respect. Because with everything that happened, the crowd ended up silent and listening. Everyone here tonight believes that we must fight for the same fundamental freedoms. Freedom. Freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of the right to own a firearm, and freedom over taxation. That man went to a rough crowd, and by the end of it, he earned most of them's respect. That's a win if you ask me. We'll commute the sentence of Ross Ulbrich, who was sentenced with all the weaponized Justice Department trying to drain his bank account. With all those fake Trump up charges that he is crushing all of them. With all the hate he's getting from a little less than half the country, he is still fighting for everyone, for everyone's freedom. And if you're any kind of smart, even a little bit, you would stand with Trump, get that sleepy old piece of shit the fuck about a White House, and stand with the party that actually wants a future for you, a future for your children. Cause their future really depends on it. It's Not too late, even for you, Harry. Get on the right side of history. Make America great again.",

Cause I don't feel like that should be highlighted. I don't think that they should be pushing their agenda on myself because I'm straight male, I have a wife and I have children. I don't think that I should have to be bombarded and, and brainwashed through media through those months or that or pride black history. I don't think that's something that should be, you know, dictated to me. Is it a learning opportunity? Not at all. Because when I was in school, we Learned, you know, certain black leaders, things like that. I don't need to hear it every single year for a whole month. We just exited Black History Month. Wanna ask you if there's anything that you've heard from Trump or anything you did during Black History Month that sort of elevated your awareness of black America. I have a lot of black friends. You know, I. We don't really. We're just friends, you know, we get along, we don't keep. I don't really. I don't. I live my day to day and. Why black friends and, you know, whatever. Happens, happens. You know, we all get along. Yeah. And would you say the same like Pride Month? Is there anything you'd like to see Donald Trump do about Pride Month? Or to celebrate? It's getting the point of the Pride Month. People running down the streets, gays and whatever thrown in our kids face and all that. I've seen a lot of that on social media and all that. I don't want that around. I don't want that around my kids. If you're gonna be gay, if that's your thing, keep it to yourself. You know, do what you do. You know, that's how I feel. You know, don't put it down straight people's throats, so to speak. What do you feel Donald Trump should be doing in Black History Month and Pride Month? Same thing he does the other 10 months of the year. I mean, we don't have a white History month, uh, so, you know, I don't think we have to be. You know, I don't get. I guess what I'm trying to say is we. We believe. I don't know yet. That's sticky question. I mean, it really is. What did Black History Month mean to you, and what would you like to see Donald Trump do it for Pride Month? They shouldn't have a separate month. I think every month should be celebrated as a Black History Month because there's been so many leaps and so many strides for black history and what our countries came from. I just Think we should all be whole as American. And I don't think we should segregate and separate, because that doesn't lead to unity, cause you're still labeling it as one thing and not the other. It should just be unity, you know?"

And by the way, that post where Harry is promoting that domain is still on his ex account. So you are promoting mag at this point. But that is because this guy's zero hour bought the domain page because it failed under Harry Sisson for $1 99 and now he says it will succeed with a touch of maggot to it. Mwah! I love this shit. But Zero Hour did offer it back to Harry Sisson if he would donate $200,000 to Donald Trump's campaign. And this is hilarious because this is the exact transfer of funds from the DNC to Harry's management company, Palette Management, right as Harry was coming on board with them. And one other thing, Harry, you are a paid shield by the way. And look at right over here. Why are you consulting for Midas Touch? You are 19 to 20 years old when this happened. That says a lot about Midas Touch. Midas Touch is on TikTok also. And Harry, since you're studying law, you might wanna look up the term Lex Taliones. Wait, there's more? I do love watching Harry get ratio on X. He literally has more negative comments about him than he Does likes on his post. At this point it is greatness. But I will tag zero hour in this post. Y'all go give him a follow because he's doing fantastic work on X and he's on TikTok now.",

When, as Mercy Otis Warren would say, the checks of conscience are thrown aside and a deformed picture of the soul is revealed. The presumptive Republican nominee is the opioid of all opioids. An easy cure for what some believe is the solution to our myriad pains and problems. When in fact, with him, you end up re enslaved with an even bigger problem. A worse affliction and addiction a bigger delusion. James Baldwin would say, the author and finisher of our national existence, our national suicide, as Mr. Lincoln prophesize.

It says here you want to allow the president to replace federal employees with who he deems loyalist. That will agree to any Bill he wants to pass? Yes. So you basically wanna legalize a dictatorship? Yes. I'm not done talking. You basically wanna legalize a dictatorship and take away the working classes ability to protest and fight for their right, giving total power to the ones who have more money and not to the ones that made them rich. Yeah. Definitely. Yes. Yes. So just a personal question. This would openly create new slaves. How are you agreeing to all of this? Because I'm rich and none of this actually affects me. And some of it benefits me, even if it's to the detriment of the rest of the population. So you're okay with oppressing the majority of America as long as it means more power for you and your team? Yes, I'm definitely okay with that. My family is good. But have you considered the families that aren't good? Also the fact that the wrong person in power could pass unethical bills and destroy America? I just told you, I'm rich. I don't care about any of this. Just pass the Bill. Yes, to everything. I got things to do. So money has LED to your abandonment of ethics, morality, and any sense of empathy for the rest of America. So you are a legal terrorist. Yes, yes, yes.

I've never seen a white male billionaire screaming at the top of his lungs, this whole system is rigged! And across the stage was white woman, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama sitting over there looking at him like, no, it's not. I said, now wait a minute, bro. It's what he said. And the moderator said, well, Mr. Trump, if in fact the system is rigged, what would be your evidence? He said, I know the system is rigged because I use it. I said, god damn! And then Hillary Clinton tried to punch him in the taxes. She said, this man doesn't pay his taxes. He shot right back. That makes me smart. And then he said, if you want me to pay my taxes, then the tax code. But I know you won't, because your friends and your donors enjoy the same tax breaks that I do.

This is and this is why you have moms to go on a school board to throw this pornography out. The reason we're winning the United States. We're not depending upon a conservative elite who are gutless and feckless. We're depending upon mothers and fathers. And school boards were depending upon working class people taking their extra time to go to precinct strategy cause they said, hey, we're prepared to stand and fight and not let our country be taken. And that's what's important. Everything else is just conversation. You have to have the political will and the muscle to sit there and say, they can call me a racist, they can call me a nativist, they can call me a xenophobe, a sexist, a homophobe, all of it. When they get to that name calling, that means they've lost the argument and we're winning. You've got to draw that puss. You got to lance the boil and draw that puss out of the system. And the conservatives aren't prepared to do that. They'll curl up in the fetal position because they're Not going to be acceptable with the clubs. You have to get over. You have to understand, we're unclubbable and we're uncoverable, and we're fucking proud of it, okay? And we're gonna save our country.

    "voice_to_text": "We have some breaking news this hour. Jack Smith, the special council has new filing in the Mar a Lago documents case. In it, special Council Smith asks the federal judge overseeing this case, that's Judge Aileen Cannon, to bar former President Trump for making statements that endanger endanger law enforcement. This is filing as in response to Trump this week complaining that standard boilerplate language contained in the FBI search warrant which was used to search Mar a Lago in the summer of 22, 2022. Trump is complaining that it was actually a secret attempt by Joe Biden to use the FBI to kill Donald Trump. This is an excerpt from that filing tonight on the part of Smith, quote, Trump's repeated mischaracterization of these facts in widely distributed messages as an attempt to kill him, his family and Secret Service agents has endangered law enforcement officers. Trump's conditions of release should therefore be modified to prohibit similar communications going forward.",

    "voice_to_text": "Trump's motorcade arrived in Crotona Park tonight. The crowd surged to get a look at it. More like a pop star than a politician. Not everyone wants a pop star for president. First of all, he's a big fat bigot, and he, he just doesn't have any love in his heart for anyone, anyone of color, anyone who's in the LGBTQ+ community is a crook, a liar, and the chief. And he tries to make money off people, and that's what he's doing right now. Well, hello everybody. Thank you for very much. Is just some turnout. Presidential candidate Donald Trump came to the South Bronx today to speak to some supporters and to a fair amount of empty space in Cartona Park. He was as Bella Coast as you'd expect. Our black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose. Trump is a billionaire, and the South Bronx doesn't house any billionaires. Politically, Trump shouldn't get his hopes up. If you did a poll about who's more popular, Donald Trump or LED paint, I suspect LED is more popular than Donald Trump on the Bronx. And yet look at that crowd. There are a lot of red hats in there. They're all from out of state. Go out there, look at all them cars that are parked and check the where they came from. Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas. Well, maybe not all this young man is from Queens. Ever. Been to the Bronx before? Yeah, I've been to the Bronx once. This is my first time coming here. But like a lot of others, he supports Trump. He's a great person. He does care for all the American people, for the country. He saved the country. We were in great shape. Now in terrible shape. There were a few tense moments as the two sides shared space in the park, but most were tolerant of one another, if dismissive. I'm not surprised that ignorance is here. Um, and I choose to not be ignorant cause I read books. Donald Trump can now say he held a rally in the South Bronx, home to immigrants and minority communities, and that it was well attended. It's just not clear that the people who attended were from the Bronx. The campaign controlled who got in, and the campaign, of course, picked only supporters in Kratona Park.

So this was Donald Trump's crowd size at his rally yesterday? Very, very small, very underwhelming. But Trump supporters are trying to claim that the screenshot was from before the rally at around 11:00am, because it says 11:09 down there. But that's not 11:00am, that's eleven o nine PM. Matter of fact, take a look at the reporting from that channel when talking about the rally. Presidential candidate Donald Trump came to the South Bronx today to speak to some supporters and to a fair amount of empty space in Crotona Park. He was as bellicose as you'd expect. Yeah, that's ABC seven, which runs at eleven PM in New York. They were taking clips from earlier in Donald Trump's rally and reporting on it during their eleven PM slot. That's why it says 11:09. It's not AM, it's PM. You can also see in this screenshot from their website talking about it at eleven PM or 10:54 where the article was published. And also, if you zoom in on the photo, you can see that it's Donald Trump standing at the podium speaking. That there's Secret Service around him protecting him. So no, Trump supporters, this did not come from hours before the rally. This was while Donald Trump was speaking. The crowd was just not that big.",

This is from their Eyewitness News at eleven PM at night. So when you see the time stamp on the bottom of the video, that's the time that this aired at night. At eleven PM at night. They are showing footage of Donald Trump from earlier in the day. That's why you see Donald Trump literally on the stage in this video. And you also see the Secret Service around them.

That doesn't look like Donald Trump, does it? No, it doesn't. Because that was Barack Obama in 2,008, speaking in Saint Louis, Missouri, where 100,000 people showed up. Here is that exact same picture in an article from the time talking about this rally that then Canada, Obama had. And this is the actual crowd for Trump's rally yesterday. Not that big, is it? Our little buddy Joseph over there, aka the older millennial, has never stepped foot in New York or the Bronx. So of course he got it wrong. Look, I know geography can be really hard, so I'll break it down and make it easy for you. New York City is not Missouri.

You already tried to make this claim about a speech in New Jersey, and you were debunked like fucking five seconds after you made the video. This is Trump speech in the Bronx. This is what it looked like today in the Bronx, New York. This is the bluest of fucking blue state. I thought I could go 24 hours without clowning the older millennial, but I was wrong. So that was Trump speech in the Bronx today, right? That's impressive. Let's take a look at it again. That's impressive, man. I bet you're wondering, what's that building up there on the top? That looks pretty cool, doesn't it? I did a search for it, and I'll show you a different angle of that building up there. Hmm. What's that thing in the background? Kind of looks like an arch. Hmm. It is an arch because it's the old courthouse in ST. Louis, not the Bronx. Another motherfucking lie. It was a speech, though. It was a speech. Look at that. And let's get a close up of who's giving that speech. You give Trump credit for Obama's economy, now you give Trump credit for Obama's speeches. Talk your way out of this one. And you know what's really funny? Take a look at the caption you put on the video. Dude doesn't read shit. So if you follow him, How are you not embarrassed? He has a million followers. A million playing you people laughing behind your back as he fucking lies to you. That's an open lie. You guys pulled this shit just last week with New Jersey. You research anything? You have any self respect? This dude is a wannabe Tucker Carlson, and he's gonna continue to do this because you guys don't have the stones to call him on it. You like being lied to? That's some beta shit. Oh, he's lying to us. It's okay. He's our hero. You guys love being lied to because the truth is too painful for you. You don't like the truth? Remember, facts don't care about your feelings. He fucking lied to you again. If you go into the build your Bron library, you'll see me stitching him 30, 40 times, calling him out on his fucking lies. I'm not the enemy. I hate bullshit. I hate fucking lies. No matter who tells him. I don't give a shit who you are. So everyone who has self respect and the balls to do so, call him out. Blast him. He's not gonna apologize. He's not gonna own up to it. He might delete the video if there's enough blowback, but people like him, narcissist like him, don't admit when they're wrong. The more you lie, the more I'm on your ass. Call not your bullshit. Call him out."

So for those of you that aren't new here, you'll notice that my username currently has an R E X or R E Z or some weird letters at the end. Yeah, whoever got a hold of my account hacked my account, change my username, tried to delete everything off of it, and it's taken me a few days to get back in touch with TikTok and gain access the account back. So if you think I'm gonna stop the series, you're wrong. But I would just like to say they really thought they had me there. And I just think that it's absolutely insane the amount of white fragility that probably LED to that whole thing happening.

Okay, so for four years and you're $100,000 in debt. Compare that to 76% of people who went to trade school for two years, found their self working directly in the field they went to school for. And they went to school for two years and are only in about $12,000 with a debt. So let's weigh that out here. College, your Dre, your average four year degree, between 80 and 120 thousand dollars a debt. And there's a 52% chance that you're not even gonna be working the job that you just spent four years on. Or. Or you go to trade school, you spend $12,000 in debt, you stay there two years and there's a 76% chance you're doing exactly what you went to school for. Just saying. The statistics are pretty, pretty easy to understand in my opinion. All I'm saying is don't let somebody push college on you if you know it's not what you want to do. Because four more years of English and science and math when all you want to do is work with your hands and get in and out so you can make some real money and start a living.

But Donald Trump, about a month and a half ago, it was reported he had a little meeting with oil executives. He's having trouble with money, of course, and he says to these oil executives, hey, tell you what. You give me a billion dollars toward my campaign, and when I get to be president, I'll take off all regulation for you oil companies. You can do whatever the fuck you want. Well, that's kind of embarrassing, because that sounds illegal. That sounds a lot like quid pro quo, which, again, is fucking illegal. That kind of went by the wayside with all the other bullshit going on with Donald Trump. But then today we hear the Senate is looking to mount an investigation into this little quid pro quo scheme that Donald Trump had. Just what Donald Trump needs is another fucking investigation, another possible criminal trial. But he's got to pay the price. They're gonna have to get in line to prosecuting convict Donald Trump. But it looks like the Senate is at least going to do an investigation and then maybe refer it to the DOJ. Good job, Donny.",

Leonard Leo, who packed that court, was funded by fossil fuel billionaires. And they got their money's worth, because that court stopped Climate Progress over and over again, saving the fossil fuel industry hundreds of billions of dollars in cleanup. But that wasn't all that court did for the fossil fuel industry. It also whittled down the ability of prosecutors to make cases of corruption. It used to be, when I was making these cases, that you would trust a jury to decide what was improper corruption. This court took away that ability of American jurors to make that decision. And instead, they narrowed it down to a specific, exact quid pro quo. So it has been very hard to investigate and prosecute the fossil fuel industry for its efforts corrupting that building. And then comes Donald Trump, and he has a private meeting with big oil execs, and he says to them in that private meeting, give me a billion dollars quid, and I will give you quo. All the fossil fuel helping rollbacks that we can provide. He actually had a list. At the same time, big oil folks are writing his executive orders for him in anticipation of him being elected. There is a real stink of corruption, and with respect to this episode, it hits the quid pro quo barrier. So Chairman Widen and the Finance Committee and I have written to all of the companies present at that meeting demanding answers, information, documents about what took place, about what LED up to it, about what the context is for that quid pro quo corrupt offer. And just yesterday, my house friends, wonderful colleague Jamie Raskin and I held a press conference to announce that our investigation about big oil fraud had gotten to the point where we were formally referring the matter to the department of justice to do the same kind of investigation that they did of Big Tobacco, which, by the way, they won. So we have got to reel in the corruption of Big Oil. This quid pro quo offer gives us a hell of a good reason to pursue it. And thank you very much to LCV into climate power for all of their support in these efforts.",

There's a lot of people who think that the reason that they've done. They called for this early debate with Trump is because they know Biden's going to totally bite it in this thing, and then it's gonna give them, uh, leverage to be able to get rid of him at the convention.

    "voice_to_text": "We have some massive breaking news. It is just been discovered that Justice Samuel Alito of the Supreme Court was flying another January 6th insurrectionist flag at another property he owns. That's right. Just last week we discovered that Justice Samuel Leto was flying an upside down American flag outside of his house in Virginia, which was a symbol that a lot of January 6th insurrection is carried into the capital. And now we discovered another provocative symbol was displayed at his vacation house in New Jersey. And this is one of the many pictures obtained by the New York Times. And that is the flag right there. It's called an appeal field to heaven flag. It was carried by a lot of J6 rioters. It's also known as the Pine Tree flag, and it dates back to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump. I mentioned the New York Times obtained a bunch of photos, but they also got accounts from half a dozen neighbors and pastors by. And it shows that the appeal to heaven flag was a loft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September of 2023. Here's another image from another angle of the appeal to heaven flag flying at Justice Lido's house. And at the same time that this flag was flying at Justice Lido's house, a key J6 case arrived at the Supreme Court challenging whether those who Storm the capital could be prosecuted for obstruction. And in the coming weeks, the justices will rule on that case. So while that flag was at Alito's house, he was considering this case. Are you kidding me? And here's a picture of some of these January 6th rioters carrying this flag at the capital. You can see it there, There's many examples, but, yeah. Justice Alito flying multiple different flags with connections to the January 6th rioters. Insanity. It is beyond past time that Justice Samuel Leto steps down from the Supreme Court. This is unacceptable. This arose trust in the Supreme Court and hurts their legitimacy. Justice Leto, step down immediately.",

Judge Juan Mercian was born in Columbia. He came to the US when he was 6 years old. He started his legal career back in 1994 as a graduate of Hofstra University School of law. And he's been serving as a New York Supreme Court judge for about 15 years. That's Judge Juan Mercian. Trump has a gag order in this case.

When Donald Trump began his first presidential campaign, his major selling point to voters was he was so rich that he could pay for his own campaign and therefore was incorruptible and he would never ask them or anyone else for money. Then Donald Trump proceeded to never spend a penny of his own money on his presidential campaign. He loaned his first presidential campaign some money at the beginning, but of course that campaign paid him back through the donations of those poor, deluded people who send money to the liar who promised he would never ask for money.

As we get closer to a Trump verdict, I see more people apprehensive of a not guilty verdict, as it will mean he gets wind in his sales for a potential November victory. And this is true. And while a guilty verdict is no guarantee he loses in November, and not guilty verdict is definitely going to increase his chances, I see tons of people saying four more years of Trump will destroy America. And look, I find Trump repulsive myself, but four more years of Trump by itself will not destroy America. What will destroy America would be eight more years or 12 more years or 16 more years of him, as he is now suggesting in his rallies. Now, of course, it's not possible, within the constraints of the Constitution, for him to be president for more than four more years. So either he is just saying stupid shit to the crowd because that's something that he does, or he plans to untether himself from the constraints of the Constitution. But the president doesn't have the power to do that. In order for him to become a dictator, it's going to require the complicency and cooperation of the multi branches of government, including the Joint Chiefs. So ask yourself, is the system already so corrupted, so easily manipulated, so rotten, that it will allow this to take place? If the answer is yes, then This country is already shot. It's already dead. We just don't know it yet. If Donald Trump is capable of becoming a dictator, it means that the disease existed long before him. He's just a symptom that brought it to light. I'm not gonna do the whole Chicken Little scene and tell you that Trump is going to become a dictator, but I do think there's a reasonably good chance that he will try. Of course, dictators never call themselves dictators. But should he succeed in becoming a dictator, it means the ship. Ship was sinking anyway. It just needed the right person to push it over the edge. And if that's the case, isn't it better that it happens sooner than later? Isn't it better it happens now than kicking the can down the road and letting the next generation deal with it? I, for one, believe my children's and grandchildren's inheritance shouldn't be my failure. If the collapse of the Empire is eminent, then let it collapse now. Let's get this show on the road. We will survive four more years of Trump if that's what happens. And if it's more than four more years, we can guarantee that the streets will run red.",

Gotta get it going. And he is clear as a bell. In my second term, we will roll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment. President Trump, when he was in office, he underwent, uh, testing for his cognitive dissident. I don't like flies. Preston Trump has more energy than a 40 year on his first day of his trial. Reuters reported that Trump appeared at doze off during Dre's election. It said, the guy's sleeping. He's meditating. On April 22nd, MSNBC reported that Trump's lawyers were fighting to keep him awake. I, I think he's praying. Ah! Oh, mom. Donald Trump could get up on stage, pull his pants down, take a up at the podium, and I still would never vote for you Democrats again. Anybody have any Tic Tacs? Liberals hate humans. Because I'm just gonna speak very bluntly here, because the liberals are largely enthralled to demons who hate humans and wanna destroy the real dictatorship, which were over 12 days into, is Joe Biden. They fear Donald Trump and they fear what's gonna happen if he becomes president again. And I'll tell you, they should fear. So all Donald Trump has to do is stay calm and stay calm during the entire debate and let Biden rant and rave, because Scranton Joe is looking and sounding meaner. And more petty by the day. And then Trump, by comparison, he easily appears presidential. But Americans are not struggling. You know, this is the worst platform. They're looking at Republicans in Washington and laughing at us. I mean, it's just not cool to be a Republican, and even not cool to be for Trump. They like to say, I'm a threat to democracy. What the hell have I done?

Yes. I'm not done talking. You basically wanna legalize a dictatorship and take away the working classes ability to protest and fight for their rights, giving total power to the ones who have more money and not to the ones that made them rich. Yeah. Definitely. Yes. Yes. So just a personal question. This would openly create new slaves. How are you agreeing to all of this? Because I'm rich and none of this actually affects me. And some of it benefits me, even if it's to the detriment of the rest of the population. So you're okay with oppressing the majority of America as long as it means more power for you and your team? Yes, I'm definitely okay with that. My family is good. But have you considered the families that aren't good? Also the fact that the wrong person in power could pass unethical bills and destroy America? Ho, ho, I just told you, I'm rich. I don't care about any of this. Just pass the Bill. Yes. To everything. I got things to do. So money has LED to your abandonment of ethics, morality, and any sense of empathy for the rest of America. So you are a legal terrorist. Yes. Yes.

The full video showed Trump had simply followed the lead of Japan's prime minister in June. Two thousand seventeen. NBC News reported that Russian President Putin said he had compromising information about Trump. Actually, Putin said the opposite. Do you have something damaging on our president? Well, this is just another load of Nazis. Where would we get this information? The New York Times and CNN shared a story with photos of immigrant children in cages. It turns out the photos were from 2,014 during the Obama administration in November 2,019. Newsweek falsely reported that President Trump was spending Thanksgiving golfing in Florida. He was actually in Afghanistan serving dinner to US troops. Good morning CBS aired a story in March of 2020 supposedly showing a New York hospital crowded with patients it's all hands on deck in America's hospitals. What was actually file tape from Italy. A week later, CBS News mistakenly used the Italy video again. In may, the BBC and the Guardian reported because Trump wasn't wearing headsets, he didn't bother to listen to the translation of a speech by Italy's prime minister. But Trump was wearing his earpiece in his right ear, as always at the White House. Newsweek reported Poland's first lady refused to shake Trump's hand, but later acknowledged she did.",

What that means and stands for is that X and mathematics and algebra is an unknown variable or a missing value. Because our parents never knew where the fuck we were. We were always missing and always unknown as the what the hell we were doing. Well, we're not a missing value anymore, but we're definitely an unknown bearable. And everybody says the same thing. Well, who started this? What happened? Why is Gen X all the sudden getting together? Why they fucking blowing up TikTok? Why they blowing up X? Was it the pink haired girl? Maybe two degree? But I think it was all more because there was a collective spirit and synchronicity of all of our generation knowing and understanding that we are the last generation that can save the Republic of the United States of America or it's about to turn communist. If you want your children or your children's children to have anything, it's time for us to get together and stand up. Gen X rising. Because there's a war going on right now. It's a spiritual war, a global war, a political war, and a media war filled with bullshit and propaganda and lies to the point that the only way that we get the truth is through the values and common sense that we were taught by our parents and grandparents and that we Learned Growing up, it's time that we have to stand up and stand strong in the face of adversity. And this has nothing to do with political lines and colors, ethnicity, location, but a collective spirit of love, understanding for each other. Because the bureaucrats, aristocrats and global elite, all they do is push the vision into sention to keep us divided. And while there's a few that always have some fly ass fucking comment to say piss off, we don't give a fuck. We don't give a fuck about your feelings or opinions because we're generation X. It's time to unite and stand together. Because if we don't, our children's children are going to live in slavery. It's time to cast aside differences that never ever mattered to us growing up. The only reason they matter now is because them fucking masters up there in Washington tell you that's what you need to believe in. It's time to embrace that feral spirit. It's time to embrace that independence and perseverance that we had growing up. We need to all be leaders and show the future generations that we have to be strong for each other. How to pick each other up, to find solutions and tactics to send those in power a message that we will not go quietly into the night. That we're gonna fight and down our feet ever before we fall on our knees and live in fear and slavery. So it's time, Gen X. Let's become The unknown variable",

That appears to be a reference to Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. And so the Biden campaign is pouncing on this saying Donald Trump is not playing games. He's telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power. Rule as a dictator over a unified Reich. They note that he's made other references to Nazi Germany before, talking about his political opponents as vermin, talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of this country. Well, Donald Trump's campaign is saying this post was an accident. Let me read you the quote. They're saying this was not a campaign video. It was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word while the president was in court. Again, that video has since been removed, but it's caused quite a stir. Even the president is expected to address it at some point today.",

I got thinking about it and I realized, well, it's probably fucking both anyway. He reposted a video, and this video was talking about what it would be like if Donald Trump were elected president again. God forbid. They used a term in that video that was interesting. They said unified Rake. Why would they do that? I mean, I've never heard any other politician in America use the term Reich. The only politician I've ever heard use that was a crazy guy in Germany in the fucking 40s. But Donald Trump and the people who support him chose to use that word this time. Now the thing is, Reich as just a word, it's pretty innocuous. It has synonyms like state, nation, country, land. You could have used that, and since we're in America, that would have been the wise choice. But they specifically chose to use the term Reich. It's what I've said before, the saying the quiet part out loud. They're trying to send a message, a dog whistle, to all those people that are all about authoritarianism and dictatorships and that sort of thing. They're calling them out, saying, you know, we need your help. Let's get this bitch going. But this isn't gonna work for Donald Trump. Most people know what the term right means and what it can be associated with. Donald Trump thinks this is going to help him. I beg to differ. Donald Trump continually does things that fucks himself over. So let's just let him go. If you want to talk about a unified Reich, good for you.

Hidden messages you should be concerned about. Industrial strength significantly increased, driven by the creation of a united rash. And it's repeated again under the giant MAGA word at the end of this ad. So, fascism. He's telling you who he is at this point. If you are watching this and you're voting for him, you're telling me who you are, too. I, I got nothing. Literally Nazi talk. Oh, my god. Okay, yeah, that's it.",

I know veterans that drive trucks. So please, guys, let me know your thoughts on what the fuck he is talking about. Because transportation, trucking, heavy haul freight, hauling, this is the backbone of America.

Trump posted a new ad foreshadowing a second Trump term that says he will create a unified Reich, echoing the Germans from World War 2, if you're catching my drift. And here's a screenshot from the ad, and it says what's next for America? But if you zoom in right under there, it says the creation of a unified Reich right there. Oh, and they didn't just do it once, they did it twice. Here's another screenshot from that very same ad where it says MAGA. And if you zoom in under that as well, it says A unified Reich. Oh, and before Trump supporters try to write this off, the Germans in World War 2 were known as the German Reich. That's what they were identified as. That's the same word that Donald Trump just used in that ad. Look, Donald Trump and the Republicans aren't trying to hide it anymore. They're putting it in front of our faces. They are telling us what they want to do in their ads. Trump is the same guy who, according to his own former advisers, praised Mustache Man from World War 2 and kept his literature around his bedroom. We have to take this incredibly seriously. This is not a joke. This election is not a joke. We have to make sure that Donald Trump never sees power again, because he's an incredibly dangerous man.",

Let's skip Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, because everybody knows how indigenous people were treated by our Founding Fathers. But let's move past that later on in our history. Let's go to Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln gave millions of acres away of indigenous land to white men so they could expand westward. He also approved an execution of 38 sue warriors. Sue South Dakota! Sue warriors! Then go to Teddy Roosevelt, who believed that white European people were inherently and innately just better, smarter, and therefore entitled to get whatever they wanted at the expense of indigenous people. Now, am I gonna go to South Dakota and flip off Mount Rushmore? No, for two reasons. 1, I take my dogs when I travel in Christie gnomes there. That's a problem.

Doctor Hemoy lives in the United States and was a former US Army combat surgeon who is now in Gaza. Earlier this week, he posted a message for President Biden, and I think all of you need to hear it. As a US Army combat surgeon, veteran and international crisis first responder, I've built my life on service in the belief in the US government. I took a hippocratic oath to help people, whoever they are, wherever they are. When the call came in December 2,023, the doctors were needed through the World Health Organization. And being specialized in combat trauma and reconstructive surgery, I signed up to serve. I have never in my career witness the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza. I arrived in Rafaa as a part of a team coordinated by the WHO. We understood the dire conditions and plan to leave together in two weeks. On May 13th, in violation of international law, our team of medical professionals were denied exit. I want our president to know that we are not safe. When the call came in to evacuate, I was asked to choose to either evacuate and leave my team behind or stay with them. I could not, in good conscious, leave my team behind. That is not what I was Taught. That is not the Soldier's Creed. We don't leave Americans behind. This is against our values as Americans. As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team. And as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans. This burden falls on the international community and President Biden to use their full influence to ensure medical personnel can continue their critical work without being put in harm's way. We worry that the European hospital we are currently in will suffer a similar fate of Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals, where humanitarian workers, patients and civilians were massacred. As for our patients, it is with a very heavy heart that we will ultimately leave them behind without care. And this responsibility remains in the hands of the international community. We entered with a commitment to be relieved with another medical team, and now this, too, is being denied. The people of Gaza deserve more than their burnt out, collapsed medical healthcare system. To my wife, daughters, and son, I know that it hurts that I am not coming home this weekend, and I am sorry, but I know that you are proud. And I am upholding my oath to never leave anyone behind. This man is a hero. I just ask, um, if you are still watching, that you pray for this incredible doctor, um, for both his safety and that he can complete his mission in saving lives and providing care. I would be so proud. If that was my dad, if that was my. My husband, my colleague. Whatever. Um. Doctor Hawami is a hero. And I, too, pray that European hospital is protected, because we have seen what Israel does to hospitals.",

And I'm not talking about the critics who just carry on about, uh, Biden's failed economy. I'm talking about real people who say this is an still an unequal society. Well, you say, yes, it is an unequal society. And Joe Biden is the first president in years, in fact, arguably the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is really taken on the structure of the economy in terms of using anti trust law to break up some of the biggest monopolies, making the labor laws really work for people, making it easier for workers to organize unions, increasing the number of people who get time and a half overtime. And we could go through the list. And it's also creating a lot of new manufacturing jobs. You know, the CHIPS act and the, the other major investments that Joe Biden has made really are very much about building the middle class in this country. It's going to take time. This is not something that can be done overnight. And it's not gonna be very persuasive to people that are cynical about the economy and feel that they're not getting ahead to say, oh, you're doing very, very well. That doesn't work. You've got to say, well, here is the direction the economy is taking under Joe Biden. Here is why Biden is doing it, and here is why you Are and your children are going to be much better off in the years ahead.",

Now, I'm old enough to remember a bunch of you narcissistic gaslight social media influencers sounding like a parrot with your Democrat talking points. Y'all would sit here and say, Donald Trump is a con, he's a criminal. Why would you support that? Well, I think it's kind of ironic. Because of your TDS, your Trump Derangement Syndrome, you have been simping for Michael Cohen, who is actually a criminal. And it doesn't matter how hard you try to spin it and say, oh, Trump knew about what Michael Cohen did. Well, according to Costello's testimony, Cohen admitted to doing it by himself and not at the direction of Trump. Like, you literally can't make this shit up. What's done in the dark will come to the light. And just like this judges tactics are against Costello, which is somebody who they thought testimony would hurt Trump, but Costello's truth is actually helping Trump. Ain't that some shit?

Apparently, the teacher was like, whoever can match the famous quote with the celebrity can get Friday off. They don't have to come to school. And she was like, who could tell me who said, there is nothing to fear except fear itself? And some girl named Sally in his class raised her hand, and she was like, Franklin D. Roosevelt. And the teacher was like, wow, that's amazing. You get Friday off of school. And then Sally was like, no, thank you. I'm Japanese. We value our education, so you'll see me here tomorrow. And the teacher was like, okay, let's give someone else a chance. Then teacher was like, okay, can anyone tell me who said, ask not what the country can do for you, but what you can do for the country? Then apparently, some other kid in the class raised his hand and said, that's John F. Kennedy. And the teacher was like, congratulations. Enjoy your Friday off. And the kid was like, no, thank you. I'm Mexican, and we have a hard work ethic, so you'll see me here tomorrow. That's when the teacher was like, okay, let's move on. It's clear nobody wants the day off. And that's when my little brother was like, these damn illegals. And then the teacher turned around and said, who said that? And then my little brother, without any hesitation, stood up and said, Donald Trump! See you losers on Monday! \u0647\u0647\u0647 \u0633\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0634\u0646",

    "voice_to_text": "So the Liberal left tells you to follow the science. Okay, well, did you know you can scientifically prove the statement liberalism is a mental disorder? Yeah. See, 75% of a human brain mass is made up of a substance called mylum. Mylum is 100% made up of cholesterol. Now it's funny cause alzheimer's didn't exist before 1979. Which is funny cause if you look right prior to 1979, you saw this big push during the 70s to tell you that cholesterol was bad, we didn't need cholesterol, we needed to get it out of our system. It's weird too, because that's when we started to see products like margarine and other things come onto the market to replace butter, cause they were low cholesterol or no cholesterol alternatives, and they're literally one molecule away from being plastic. We saw this massive rise in vegetarianism and veganism and we went from first finding alzheimer's in 1979 to today in 2024, Alzheimer's being one of the leading causes of death in the western civilization, which is a neurological disorder degenerative, where you kill brain cells. Now where do we see veganism and vegetarianism where they tell you you don't need to eat animals, when in fact you do, cause that cholesterol that you need to keep those brain cells is in the animals and animal fats and butters that you eat. It's not in the vegetables that you eat that are devoid of cholesterol. So we can scientifically show that back In the 70s, to be called the Liberal was a negative thing for Democrat. To now liberalism is taken over the Democrat Party. And according to studies coming out of the psychological world, people who identify as Liberal have a higher instance of mental disorder. That's scientifically proven. Again, so we can definitively prove that liberalism is a mental disorder because you are devoid of cholesterol and you're losing brain cells. What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.",

Now, Mr. Scumbag Congressman has been married to his wife for twelve years, and they together have seven kids. But now he's divorcing his wife for Beth. So someone asks husty Congresswoman Beth about her situation, and she says, oh, well, I mean, I'm single and he's getting divorced, so I don't know what the problem is. Maybe people should stay in their own lane. I'm paraphrasing. And honestly, that would be all well and good. I mean, I think it's kind of a crappy thing to do to your family, obviously, but it's a family matter. It would all be fine and good unless you were part of the family values party. Where's your family values now, Congressman? When you leave your wife, your second wife now, to move on to your mistress? Where is those family values, those things that helped you get elected?",

This nasty toxin targets your bladder and kidneys. When your body detects ochratoxin A, it freaks out and dehydrates your tissues to dilute the toxin. Ever drink coffee and then need to pee 20 minutes later, even when your bladder isn\u2019t full? That\u2019s your body\u2019s urgent response to flush out the toxin, because ochratoxin A is known to cause cancer. This isn\u2019t just an inconvenience\u2014it\u2019s a serious health concern. Think about it: your body goes into overdrive, pulling water from your tissues to dilute and eliminate the toxin as quickly as possible. This can leave you feeling dehydrated and constantly running to the bathroom. It\u2019s a vicious cycle where you\u2019re losing more fluids than you\u2019re taking in, which can have broader impacts on your overall health and hydration levels. Moreover, constant dehydration can lead to other health issues like headaches, dizziness, and even long-term kidney damage. Your body is working hard to protect you from the toxins, but this process takes a toll on your overall hydration and wellness. The good news is that there\u2019s a way to enjoy your coffee without these worries. Dave Asprey\u2019s Danger Coffee is lab-tested to be mold-free, ensuring that each cup is safe for your body. Plus, it\u2019s packed with essential minerals that help your body detoxify more effectively. These minerals support your body\u2019s natural processes, helping you stay hydrated and healthy.

    "voice_to_text": "Trump is lying when he characterizes the trial this way. Biden trial, I call it. President Biden has nothing to do with this trial. Let's be clear about how indictments work. They are issued by grand juries made up of ordinary citizens who've been summoned for jury duty. A prosecutor presents evidence to the grand jury, and if a majority think there's enough evidence to prosecute a suspect, only then does the trial move forward. Regular people voted to indict Trump in all four of his criminal trials. The reason we have grand juries is to prevent the kind of personally motivated prosecutions that Trump is both pretending to be a victim of and promising to undertake if he's reelected. On top of that, these are state charges. In the New York trial, the president has no authority over them. He couldn't even pardon Trump if he wanted to. It's the same situation with Trump's criminal trial in Georgia. Now, a federal crime was also committed, and Michael Cohen was prosecuted for the federal crime by Trump's own Justice Department. Cohen went to prison for the crime. If Trump really believed this was no crime. Everyone says there was no crime. Then why didn't he pardon Cohen? Also, it's clear from the federal charges against Cohen that Trump's Justice Department saw Trump as the man behind the criminal scheme. But it's the Justice Department's policy not to indict a sitting president. It appears Trump only escaped prosecution at the time because He was president. The hope of evading future prosecutions could be one of the main reasons he's running for president now. So far, Trump has succeeded in delaying his three other criminal trials. So while a case involving a porn star and playboy model might seem boring compared to allegations of stealing nuclear secrets and trying to overthrow the government, this might be the one chance to hold Trump to the same legal standards as any other American. I'm Alan Piper at a Piper 13. Follow Courier Newsroom for updates on all Trump's criminal trials.",

Any regrets about that kind of language, especially given that you were trying to make a point, frankly, about decorum in the hearing room? I have no regrets, and I'll tell you why. Because Marjorie Taylor Greene is the type of person that if you give her an inch, she'll take a mile. And the fact that they continue to allow her to break the rules of decorum over and over and over, whether it's the state of the union that the president is delivering and she's wearing a MAGA hat or otherwise. The reason that she didn't have committee assignments before was because she did not know how to conduct herself as a member of Congress. And so if I just sit there and say, oh, well, Marjorie said it about me, what's to stop her to continue to do it again and again? And at the end of the day, I was elected as a representative of Congress, but that doesn't mean that I'm supposed to be somebody's doormat. But Michelle Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. Are those days basically over? Um, I don't know that we can even call this a low. I mean, she goes to hell, and then I do my best to remind her as to why she should not cross me. So one of your colleagues, Jamie Raskin, actually suggested that some members might Have been drinking. Others have said that as well. Making that suggestion. That's a pretty serious allegation. Do you think that that played a factor here? I think when Marjorie Taylor Greene. It doesn't require alcohol for her to be unhinged. I'll be perfectly honest. I don't know. I don't have any facts to that, so, you know, I won't say and I won't participate in rumors when I don't have any facts behind it. So you also called Greene racist, what she said about you. Why is that? Yeah, because as I've received so many amazing compliments from MAGA America throughout my time in Congress, a lot of times when I would go viral, instead of them trying to address the things that I laid out in a very factful way, what they would try to do is say, oh, look at her hair, or look at her nails, or look at her lashes. And they would all then associate anything that I do as a form of beautification with being, quote, unquote ghetto. And so to me, she was just basically repeating the nonsense that MAGA world is constantly putting out there. Because I am not the only woman in Congress that wears lashes, and there are women on her side of the aisle that wear lashes as well, as well as hair extensions. But she's never felt like that was a dig that she needed to take at anyone except for me. A black woman who sits On the committee. And then of course she went after AOC and called her unintelligent. A brown woman that sits on the",

The quarter wall and brought out the very last in the trading, the Dow did move over 40,000, settling at around 40,000 3 point 59 with a gain of about 140 134 points. This such as about a five week winning streak. Uh, a lot of this void by the fact that people are optimistic we are gonna achieve a soft landing, that the growth is, is slowing to the degree that the Fed has some wiggle room here to cut rates. Now, whether that happens is anyone's guess, but the fact of the matter is that the trend has been the market's friend. Earnings coming in better than expected. A lot of country companies that are forecasting improving economic news as well. The bottom line here, in case you're counting in the last four years, the Dow is essentially doubled, uh, from 20,000 to about 40,000. And again, just since 2219, 22,022, we've come storming back to. To put on these extra 10,000 points. Now, a lot of that backdrop again, is an improving corporate structure, the inflation problem eased up, and again, optimism that rates could come down. Now, there are some wrinkles here. We'll be going into that this weekend. But for now, all optimistic on the stock front. In the meantime. Hmm. I wonder what's making the stock market perform so well. I wonder why inflation is cooling. And I wonder Why? Those interest rates are going to start coming down real soon. Hmm. I know why. Because of President Joe Biden and Biden nomics. Ha ha ha ha ha! With an economy so good, why do we need Donald Trump? Trump supporters you heard Fox News. Haha!

And what does Speaker Johnson have to say on the subject? Just last week, he declared that he knows intuitively that a lot of non citizens are voting in federal elections, but it's not been something that is easily provable. Not provable because there's no proof. The Washington Post has it right. Republicans have increasingly acknowledged that their claims are all about the vibes. Republicans aren't governing based on facts. Frankly, they're not governing at all, and it's an embarrassment. This hearing is about preemptively covering Donald Trump's lies. The hearing isn't about law and order. It's about laying the foundation for the next big lie. It's about saying that illegal voting is the cause of an election defeat.

    "voice_to_text": "Has everyone heard the most recent insanity from Donald Trump? He was talking at one of his rallies, and he says that when he's president, he's not gonna allow colleges to be taken over by radicals. And if they've come here from another country and they're here to spread johanism or anti americanism, he's gonna have them deported immediately. So let's follow this through. Trump is president and there's protests at a university, and he's gonna make good on this pledge. Just how is he gonna do that? He's going to send in federal authorities onto campuses around America. That how very Gestapo of him. Or does he plan on strong arming the local, local authorities, state authorities, and go in and enforce exactly what laws? Can anyone tell me exactly what federal laws are on the books that would allow him to take such an action? Does anyone ever think he's even heard of the First Amendment? Oh, yeah, he likes to use the First Amendment in defense of his own speech. When a judge puts a gag order on him and says that's a violation of his rights, but someone else's rights. Oh, no, no, no. We. We send. Send in federal authorities to crush the those people's rights. The mere suggestion of the federal government stepping in and crushing protests at college campuses reeks of abuse of power and federal overreach. I thought Republicans were supposed to be opposed to an overbearing federal government taking a heavy Handed control over local issues. I know they used to say that. However, since Trump has taken over the Republican Party, any belief and limited government seems to have just banished from the Republican Party. Trump suggests that the federal government step in and crush commons and college demonstrations. And the crowd cheers. The creation of a federally controlled news agency. And the crowd cheers. Federal prison camps to house the nation's homeless. And the crowd cheers. A lot of my videos cover the failure of the entirety of the political establishment, and because it's that entirety of the establishment that has brought us to this place. But MAGA insanity is just. It's a whole new level.",

Start off by first saying to my colleagues across the aisle, you have been traveling. You are on the road today, and I know you must be tired. Uh, you all were visiting Donald Trump's trial today to defend his porn star hush money case. And in fact, we have some cute pictures of you here today, and I. They are some cute pictures, so congratulations. And also some from the last few days. And looks like you guys had a good time in the courtroom today. But you know what? I don't know. The speaker looks a little bit stressed here. I mean, it's a lot, right? To ask someone who's facing a criminal trial and running for president to ask his political allies to travel over 200 miles on a voting day here in Congress to pop up to New York and snap some cute pictures to defend him because the judge has ordered him to stop threatening the jurors in his own trial. I mean, some might actually view this as direct interference in a criminal court case. It's not exactly law and order, as our friends like to talk about all the time. You missed some votes. Yeah. You weren't here. You didn't. You didn't show up for votes. You didn't vote on some of the bills that you claimed were your priorities, some of your public safety and border bills. I mean, I can see you had some important business to take care of here today. The chairman did manage to find time today, after they canceled the hearing this morning, to have his political fundraising team send out this fundraising email.",

Or maybe not so. This post is from the Facebook page of the Benedictine Sisters of Mount Saint Scholastica. It says, as a founding institution and sponsor of Benedictine College, that's where the speech was made. The sisters of Mount Saint Scholastica find it necessary to respond to the controversial remarks. And so on and so forth. It says, the sisters of Mount Saints Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker's comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic Benedictine Liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested. Instead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division, so on and so forth. It goes on to say that women don't need to be homemakers. There's your woke Liberal mob, the Benedictine Sisters. So for those of you who are defending that misogynistic fool and think the rest of us are off point, take it up with the Benedictine Sisters.",

And I kind of, like, awkwardly look at my friends. I was like, I feel really embarrassed. Do I point out that it's not cow? Like, hamburger is a pig. Everyone knows ham comes from pig. So I joked back. I was like, well, I want my pig cooked, um, well done. You're not supposed to. You're not supposed to eat pork, like, uncooked. Everybody knows that. That's why it's always been super weird to me that people will get, like, red in the middle on their burgers. And so she looks back at me, she goes, you mean your cow? And I'm like, I don't know how to have this conversation right now. Like, I'm not a teacher, I'm not. I don't know how to educate you kindly. And I was like, sure, my cow. Haha.

Then at the end of the press conference, Boebert tried to speak, but was heckled by protesters, who taunted her with mentions of the musical she got kicked out of.

A disc jockey in California convicted of assaulting four children after becoming friendly with their parents. No, he's not a drag queen. No, he's not transgender. He's a 62 year old man who was living in rural California at the time of his arrest. My project debunking the right wing myths about groomers and looking at who actually has been charged with or convicted of assaults on children since mid February of last year when I started aggregating the data. Of 10,007 names now in the database, only one has been a drag queen. Only five have been transgender, but 748 work in the religion business, 497 of them are ordained, 292 police officers, and 83 are politicians. Not drag Queens, not transgender pastors, priests, rabbis, missionary cops and poles. And while many say this shouldn't be political, of all the politicians, 59 out of those 83 71% Republicans. Compare that to 11 or 13% Democrats. Nine of the 10 states with the worst per capita incidence of those committing crimes, top to bottom, are Republican controlled. None of the 10 states with the best record are. So who's the real threat to children? Melbourne, Knowles, Owens, Jenner and Carlson? The facts don't care about your feelings. The data is available for your review and for your analysis at who is making news.com. It is still preliminary data. Will Be working on data cleanup and making sure that no one in the database has eventually been acquitted. For a few more weeks that'll take, and then I'll have a final report."

I just find it funny that white women are constantly cuddled, protected, and granted the ability to comfort black women. Unwarranted.

And she got her ass cooked, okay? Her meat was falling off the motherfucking bone. After that roasted Marjorie Taylor Greene couldn't even pick up her face cause her face was on the fucking ground. Her face was melted.

I don't think that's my problem, is why does the chairman want to strike with Jasmine Crockett said Marjorie Taylor was the one who started the shit. Okay, you don't start no shit. Won't be none, bitch. I'm glad that Jasmine took it to Twitter to speak her peace, because they love to try to silence a black woman's experience. Representative Crockett tweeted, so Marjorie Taylor want to talk about my appearance in committee? It's against the rules to do so. She refused to apologize. The chairman ruled it was okay, and I asked For clarification, what qualifies as engaging in personalities? And basically wanted to know if I could talk shit about her appearance as well. Y'all know what she look like, right? Pause. I know what she look like, and I'll testify. Is bad built. Her stomach is shaped like a sack of laundry. Her stomach look like balled up homework. She got bad skin, she got bad hair. Her ends are split to the motherfucking root. Jasmine told no lie. Shame the damn devil. Let's continue. This is what happens when mentally deficient people who can't read or follow the rules, don't give a damn, somehow end up in Congress. Oh, girl, you said a word, and that's how the fuck you stay on business. I want everybody who agrees with what Representative Jasmine Crockett said.

And there's something that hasn't been used since early 1900s called inherent contempt of Congress. It's actually something that any one individual member reserves. The attorney general thought he was above the lawn. Did not comply not just with one subpoena, but with two subpoenas. Those are subpoenas from both Chairman Jordan and Chairman Komar. I wanna read this to you because ultimately, if in 10 days, the department of justice does not do their job and hold the attorney general responsible just like they would any other American, I think that it should be our job in house of representatives speed and to bring an inherent contempt proceeding against the Attorney General. Of which I've already filed that privilege motion, um, over a week ago. I would like to read it real quickly. And saying that resolved. That if in 10 days after the passage of this report, the department of justice has failed to indict Attorney General Garland, the speaker of the house of representatives shall issue his warrant commanding the sergeant in arms up or his duty to take into custody the body of the said Attorney General Garland, whoever found and bring him to the said Attorney General Garland before the bar of the house of representatives then and there to provide documents, materials and answer such questions pertinent to The matter under inquiry, as the house of representatives may order the speaker of the house of representatives to propound and to keep the said Attorney General Garland and pesty to await further orders of the house of representatives.

Mr. Garcia, maybe you could just lift up that picture of our President Trump sleeping. As you say, I think he's praying. But if he is sleeping, you know, certainly looks pretty while he sleeps. What? He looks pretty when he sleeps. Oh, my. That is one of the most strange and weird things I've heard come from an elected member of our government. Seriously. But really trying to say that he's just praying when he's falling asleep in court. You have all these reporters watching him fall asleep, his lawyers trying to wake him up, having to shake him, and you think he's praying? They will do anything to defend Donald Trump. I really hope that we can all agree that we can't have these MAGA Republicans in government anymore. It's just too strange and too crazy."

My voice as a man is not necessary here. Men, we don't need to speak on behalf of or for women. But as a man with a wife and hopefully one day a future daughter, I wanna put a differing male perspective out there as something that I would say to them. Here are the basic facts. Women have overtaken men and now account for over half of the college educated workforce in the United States. More single women own homes than single males. And women are dominating higher education in a faster rate than they ever have before. I know when I was in law school I was like 75% women. I was surrounded by women. The truth of the matter is this. Men like this feel like they're losing their grip. They feel like women are pulling ahead of them and they are throwing a little temper tantrum about it. But do not for one second let them gaslight you into thinking that you are not doing what you're doing. To quote Taylor Swift, 14 time Grammy Award winning billionaire. Old habits die screaming",

It didn't matter where you were from, where you came from. If you were part of the click, you're part of the click if you grew up with us. We got on our bikes every fucking morning, rode together, honey crawfish together, ran the woods together, built clubhouses together, helped each other up when they fell down. That's our mentality. It's still our mentality. When one brother falls, you stop, you turn around and you go pick him up. You help him. If they're too injured to get back to the house, you carried them back to the house while somebody else pushed their bicycle. And that's what we're gonna do. We're still in that mentality. We never gave a fuck whether you were black, white, brown, Asian, Indian. None of that shit fucking mattered. And it still don't matter. It's only these new generations that keep pushing this shit. And then politicians trying to keep us divided. And we're done with it. They have awoken a sleeping giant. 65 million people are awake now. We're building a movement, a generational movement that doesn't give a shit about anything else but saving the republic. And that glides my Heart, it makes me happy. It's about time that we found something to bring us together. Because all they try to do is keep us divided. All these politicians, these aristocrats, bureaucrats, these world leaders. All them people, man. We need common sense solutions to problems that they have created to keep us divided. Their worst fear is us united and coming together. Their worst fear is the people. If they keep us divided and at odds with each other, with no common ground, they can run roughshod and do whatever the fuck they want. So now we need to do whatever we want. We need to let them know that 65 million people will not deal with their bullshit. With the bullshit of 600 people who are running this country or think they're running this country, because they're not. We're about to. To all my Gen X brothers and sisters, I love y'all! Peace!

And we'll get, like, thousands of followers, and then we'll all commit to watching one another's videos for a few minutes a day, a minute at a time, and we'll make money. And then they create some hashtags around it, and everybody's like, cool, cool, let's do it. We're like the young kids making money on the social medias. And then, of course, um, as I understand it, bunch of MAGA freaks come along and they decide that they're gonna hijack these hashtags and turn this into political bullshit, as they are prone to do. Um, and so I have some thoughts about this. First of all, if you're a MAGA freak and you're following me, get the off my page. Second of all, if you're a MAGA freak and you are a Gen Xer, just so you know, everything, MAGA is antithetical to the Gen X experience because this is Gen X. Are you see, we believe. You stay in your yard, and I'll stay in mine. You mind your business, and I'll mind mine. But, like, if you wanna go throw orgies and dress up as game of Thrones characters while you do it, have at it, pal. Have fun. But when you start telling me I got to dress up as a game of Thrones character, throw Orgies at my house. You see, now we got a problem. And that's essentially what's happening with the MAGA movement. You freaks want to tell us what to do. You wanna tell us who we can love? You wanna tell us what we can do with our bodies? You wanna tell us what religions we should follow? You wanna tell us what books we can and cannot read? Uh, so on and so forth. So you believe that you're like the anti government movement? Wake up, you dumb motherfuckers! You are the epitome of wanting government control. You want the government to tell us all what the fuck we can and cannot do, like George or wellion kind of shit. So, um, yeah, before you start calling me a Liberal or a libtard, just so you know, if that's true, it's because you weirdos turn me into that. Like, I couldn't have cared less about all this shit 12 years ago. Couldn't have cared less. You see, because I was born with a lot of rights, and we've fought for and obtained a lot of rights that have been around for many, many years now. And I didn't really sign up for all this excess thinking about what's gonna happen with our government, what's gonna happen with our country. Like, I just wanna go back to doing what I wanna do. So, um, quit hijacking everything cool, you freaks. And also, if you're not a mega freak, stop letting them Hijack our shit. Like, don't not use these hashtags because they've hijacked them. I mean, they've already hijacked the American flag, for fuck's sake. Let's not let him do this. Let's keep our hashtags. Let's follow one another and make some money. Okay? That's my thoughts.",

That President Biden has invoked executive privilege to prevent the American people from hearing the audio recordings of his testimony with Special Counsel Robert Hurr. The American people will not be able to hear why prosecutors felt the president of the United States was in special counsel Robert Heard's words. A quote, elderly man with a poor memory and thus shouldn't be charged. Just think about that for a moment. President Biden is apparently afraid for the citizens of this country and everyone to hear those tapes. They obviously confirm what the special council has found and would likely cause, I suppose, in his estimation, such alarm with the American people that the president is using all of his power to suppress their release. And. And rather than defend our closest ally at war, President Biden is using his authority to defend himself politically. But first.",

And that's why it's showing up in the polls, because President Trump is gonna. Is stronger on the border, he is stronger on crime, he is stronger on China, he is stronger on the economy, he's stronger on everything that matters to our citizens today in this country where Biden is weak. This fall, it's gonna be about strength versus weakness. The politicization of the legal system is not working. It's actually failing. It's.

    "voice_to_text": "Okay, so let me make sure I have this straight. So bunch of Gen Xers come together, and they're like, wouldn't it be cool if we all follow each other? And we'll get, like, thousands of followers, and then we'll all commit to watching one another's videos for a few minutes a day, a minute at a time, and while make money. And then they create some hashtags around it, and everybody's like, cool, cool, let's do it. We're like the young kids making money on the social medias. Then, of course, as I understand it, bunch of MAGA freaks come along and they decide that they're gonna hijack these hashtags and turn this into political bullshit, as they are prone to do. Um, and so I have some thoughts about this. First of all, if you're a MAGA freak and you following me, get the off my page. Second of all, if you're MAGA freak and you are a Gen Xer, just so you know, everything, MAGA is antithetical to the Gen X experience, because this is Gen X. Er, you see, we believe. You stay in your yard, and I'll stay in mine. You mind your business, and I'll mind mine. But, like, if you want to go through orgies and dress up as game of Thrones characters while you do it, have at it, pal. Have fun. But when you start telling me I got to dress up as a game of Thrones character, throw orgies at My house! You see, now we got a problem. And that's essentially what's happening with the mega movement. You freaks want to tell us what to do. You wanna tell us who we can love? You wanna tell us what we can do with our bodies? You wanna tell us what religions we should follow? You wanna tell us what books we can and cannot read? Uh, so on and so forth. So you believe that you're like the anti government movement? Wake up, you dumb motherfuckers! You are the epitome of wanting government control. You want the government to tell us all what the fuck we can and cannot do, like George or Wellian kind of shit. So, um, yeah, before you start calling me a Liberal or a libtard, just so you know, if that's true, it's because you weirdos turn me into that. Like, I couldn't have cared less about all this shit 12 years ago. Couldn't have cared less? You see, because I was born with a lot of rights, and we've fought for and obtained a lot of rights that have been around for many, many years now. And I didn't really sign up for all this excess thinking about what's gonna happen with our government, what's gonna happen with our country. Like, I just wanna go back to doing what I wanna do. So, um, quit hijacking everything cool, you freaks. And also, if you're not a MAGA freak, stop letting them hijack our Shit like they don't not use these hashtags because they've hijacked them. I mean, they've already hijacked the American flag, for fuck's sake. Let's not let them do this. Let's keep our hashtags. Let's follow one another and make some money, okay? That's my thoughts.",

We are proud contributors to Project 2025. Alright, so let's walk through some of the provisions of the mandate. It calls for eliminating the department of education, eliminating the department of Commerce, deploying the military for the use of domestic law enforcement against protesters under the Insurrection Act of 18:00 0 7. It also has the repealing of Schedule F status for thousands of federal employees to allow a president to replace career civil servants with unqualified partisan loyalist. That's probably my favorite of it. It also prohibits the FBI from combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, like Russia and China, who are actively trying to interfere with American elections. I don't know why or how anybody can support Project 2025. And I know that there was allegedly a joke about, um, dictators, and whether or not that's funny, but in.

Um, this is all a bunch of MAGA supporters, Trump supporters, and they think that they're gonna do what they did in on January 6th, 2021. They think they're gonna do it again, and they're gonna succeed this time. Man, I've got some really bad news for you guys. You see, the last time you did this, the last time you attempted it, um, you had Donald Trump on your side. He was the president at that time, and he neutered the National Guard for you people. He gave you every single advantage, so you could just walk right in there and take the place over. And you failed epically just against the capital police, let alone. There was no National Guard there. They sent a letter to the National Guard. You can't use. You're not to go unless you're ordered to go by the secretary of the army or something like that. They couldn't use helmets or weapons or Shields or. You guys just failed against the capital police and what they had on hand. If you think that you're going to attempt this shit again, listen. The United States government, Is. It's pretty slow, I'll give you that. But we learn from our mistakes. And if you think you're gonna get anywhere near the capital building to do that shit again, you're wrong, scooter. Because Trump is not the president. Joe Biden is the president. And if you think he's gonna neuter the National Guard just so you can walk in there and do the same shit over again, you're wrong. You're not gonna get within a mile of the capital building. They're gonna have Washington DC locked down tighter than Dick's hat band, if you know what I'm saying. You're not gonna get through the barricades. You're not gonna get to the barricades. They're gonna have checkpoint set up all over the place. It's. It's not just not gonna happen. Look, have your fun on TikTok and the internet and post your hashtag red dawns and all the rest of that bullshit that you're doing, but if you got an ounce of of self preservation, just don't do it. There's some truth for you.",

Well, Robert Whoopi, I'm not sure if you ever listen to yourselves, because you're sitting here trying to persuade the public that you can read Trump's inner thoughts while you ignore the results of his actions, which included a better economy, lower taxes and four years of peace around the world. All of which are gone under the current president. So I would say the total craziness that you're talking about is taking political advice from a panel of mentally ill hosts and a washed up Hollywood actor who have no idea what they're talking about.

Shortly thereafter, the insurance company came out and said, we'll pay out too. In what world does the US government and insurance company pay out immediately without an investigation? Nothing to see here. Don't go digging around. MAOI is still dealing with the debris removal and fighting with insurance companies 10 months later. But the bridge? No problem. Let's just pay it out. And then? And then? Now we find out that the 21 members of the crew are stuck on the ship, not allowed to leave. Trapped. And their phones have been confiscated. Why are they prisoners? The news says they can't leave the ship because of visa restrictions. What? We let ungodly amount of people through the border without visas, but now it's a problem.

We also hold the record for number one most related Pew pew shootings and violence amongst developed countries. Alexa, play we are number one by Nelly. Alexa, stop.

We have the world's highest homeless population as well, so this next one's a doozy. What is the highest racial disparity amongst several categories? Wealth, education, and health.

    "voice_to_text": "So this is an interesting story. This is Courtney Gore, who ran for a school board seat in Texas on the same conservative bullshit the rest of them do. You know the children are being provided with chronography in school, books need to be banned, yada yada. Yeah, you know the deal. But unlike other MAGA, when she actually got elected, she decided to actually look into things. Cause she was just kind of a normal mom who was outraged by the constant deluge of bullshit she was getting from right wing media. So she went in and actually started doing some research on what the kids were being taught. After a Gore reviewed hundreds of pages of school curriculum, she was shocked that the pervasive indoctrination she had railed against as a candidate did not exist. her core mistake was thinking that the rest of the GOP was reasonable and would be happy with this information. So she ran to tell them that she thought it was all bullshit. And you guys can predict what happened. They got really pissed off at her. She got behind a committee that said every book that was banned should be returned. She stood behind the results of that study and recognized what the real purpose of this entire platform is. Bagor said she feels that she was unwittingly part of a statewide effort to weaken local support of public schools and lay the groundwork for a voucher system. But what did The GOP do. And confronted with all of this, they tried to force her out. Not only did they try to force her out, they called her a traitor and to not listen to the other board members because they were just lying to her. This got so heated that a man ended up showing up to a school board meeting with a pew pew on his hip, saying that they had profiles on each and every one of the school board members and that they knew where they lived. It's just crazy to me that she was able to get looped into it to begin with. Is clearly kind of reasonable person, the one she was actually confronted with the facts, she said, hey, this is bullshit. And the rest of the Republican said, if you ever say anything like that again, will unalive you. Cause that's where the GOP is at. They will do anything, anything to accomplish their genuinely soulless and evil agenda. My favourite quote from her in that article is extremism is the problem. In other words, MAGA is the problem. And that none of this indoctrination, nothing that they believe is actually happening. And when confronted with that, they'd rather un alive you, then accept reality. Next level cognitive dissonance. And that's kinda where they're all getting to protect yourselves.",

It's a 50% tax, that's what it is. Not one thing is cheaper under Crooked Joe's. Food, gasoline, cars, trucks, rent and mortgages. They're all through the roof. The whole country is going to hell because of this guy. He's got a 50% tax and nobody ever talks about it and nobody wants to hear about it, but that's what it is. It's called an inflation tax. Biden's price hikes are killing the American dream. Perhaps most tragically of all, the 50% Biden inflation tax hits working Americans and young Americans the hardest. Crooked Joe and his cronies are getting rich while you're struggling to get by. He's made it impossible for you to save, to buy a house or to have a wedding, while simultaneously driving up the price of everything for which you want to save. The month I left office, the 30 year mortgage rate was 2.65%. Now it's almost 8%. Joe Biden is the worst president for young people in American history. The Biden inflation tax is also crushing corner stores, restaurants and small businesses of all kinds. One thing is very clear. Whether you're young or old, black or white, you can't afford four more years of crooked Joe Biden. The worst ever. I will end this nightmare and we will once again have the Greatest economy in history. The history of the world. Thank you.",

    "voice_to_text": "All you MAGA buffoons out there that said Joe Biden was too scared and he wouldn't debate Donald Trump. He was afraid. He was a coward. I don't expect all of you to retract what you said, because that would mean you have a moral compass and you have character. But Joe Biden hasn't only agreed to one debate, he's agreed to two debates. He's not afraid of Donald Trump. Just because he's 81 years old doesn't mean he's not capable. Joe Biden won two debates against Donald Trump before the 2,020 elections, and he's gonna win two more. And this benefits Joe Biden why? Because once again, he's gonna prove to the American people that he is mentally competent and ready to serve another term. And number two, Donald Trump won't be able to interrupt because the microphones will be turned off if it's not your chance to speak and there will be no live crowd. This, absolutely 150% is going to be the reason why Joe Biden is going to be reelected in November for another four years. And Orange Turd will have to go home tomorrow. Lago"

And America First Legal is a member of Project 2025, which is dedicated to creating the playbook for the next conservative administration and what it calls the project pillars. Correct. We are proud contributors to Project 2025. Okay. And are you familiar with Project 2020 Five's mandate for leadership? In fact, I am. Okay. And in fact, you wrote some of the sections of this mandate related to the DOJ, correct? Sure did. And the mandate outlines policy priorities for the next conservative president, is that correct? It does. You've done a great job. I just want to let you know. Alright, so let's walk through some of the provisions of the mandate. It calls for eliminating the department of education, eliminating the department of Commerce, deploying the military for the use of domestic law enforcement against protesters under the Insurrection Act of 18 o seven. It also has the repealing of Schedule F status for thousands of federal employees to allow a president to replace career civil servants with unqualified partisan loyalist. That's probably my favorite of it. It also prohibits the FBI from combating the spread of misinformation and dis disinformation like Russia and China, who are actively trying to interfere with American elections. I don't know why or how anybody can support Project 2025. And I know that there was allegedly a joke about, um, dictators and whether or not That's funny, but in. In the United States of America, dictatorships are never funny. And Project 2025 is giving the playbook for authoritarianism as well as the next dictator to come in.",

    "voice_to_text": "Yesterday, Cohen told the court that after first resisting, Trump eventually ordered him to pay Daniels $130,000, telling him just do it. In response, Nike has changed their slogan to Yay Sneakers, Yay today. Prosecutors had Cohen bring us back to 2,018 when the stormy story broke and Trump was desperately trying to keep him from damaging his presidency. That year, the feds began to look into Cohen's illegal work for Donald Trump, culminating an FBI raid on his home and office. Cohen testified that he received a phone call from Trump after the raid, and Trump told him, quote, don't worry. I'm the president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's gonna be okay. Stay tough. You're gonna be okay. That. That really smells like some Mafia talk. Cohen also testified about a 2,018 phone call with another key player in the whole hush money scheme, National Inquirer publisher and the mummified remains of Colonel Sanders, David Pecker. The Enquirer was getting heat at the time from the feds for illegal campaign contributions. Cohen testified that Trump told him to reassure Pecker that, quote, the matter was gonna be taken care of. And the person, of course, who was gonna be able to do it was then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump wanted to quash an investigation into his own wrongdoing using Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Seen here mad that you opened the cupboard and disturbed his nap. Please welcome former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Hello! Hey, hey, everybody. I have returned it as I, Jefferson Morugal Sessions the third, and I will not stand by I lay while that Yankee lawyer drags my good name through the fudge. Former Attorney General Sessions, did you follow through on Trump's promise and derail a legitimate FBI investigation? How dare you doubt my honors? Up! I swear on a stack of gone with the wind DVDs that I have an alibi. I was standing shoulder to shoulder with 23 of my closest friends in a tight cellophane sleeve. And frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn what president dips his nilo wafer. That's just the way the me crumble beat it does for. Trump responded with the legal defense known as. Because yesterday, Trump took in Cohen's testimony with his eyes shut, nearly reactionless, moving only occasionally to whisper or pass a note to his attorney. And. And I'm being told we have one of the notes. I'm trying to sleep. Also Learned a fun new detail about Trump's response to the Access Hollywood tape. Because Cohen testified that it was Melania's idea to characterize Trump's comments as mirror locker room talk. Well, that makes sense, cause anytime Trump tries to get near Melania, she locker room.",

    "voice_to_text": "I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you. How many of you are sitting here now, about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabel, would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother. By making it to this moment through all the adversity thrown your way from COVID, I hope you learn the important lessons that suffering in this life is only temporary. As a group, you witnessed firsthand how bad leaders who don't stay in their lane can have a negative impact on society. While COVID might have played a large role throughout your formative years, it is not unique. Bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues. Things like abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values in media, all stem from the pervasiveness of this order. Our own nation is LED by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith, but at the same time is delusional enough to make The sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally. He has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people, it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice. The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves. Whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion, we fear speaking truth. Because now, unfortunately, truth is in the minority. Congress just passed a Bill we're stating. Something as basic as the biblical teaching of who killed Jesus? Could land you in jail. I'm certain the reporters at the AP did not have imagined that their attempt to rebuke and embarrass places and people like those here have been addicting. Wouldn't be met with anger, but instead met with excitement and pride. Not the deadly sins sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it, but the true god centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify him.",

The Bill, which has been dubbed the moms act for short, claims that pregnancy.gov would be a database of relevant resources for pregnant people, but in reality would just be messaging from anti abortion nonprofits in crisis pregnancy centers, which often provide false and misleading info. The database would not contain any info about Obgyns or reproductive health clinics. Oh, and it would also ask those pregnant people to submit contact information for the government to use for outreach. You think this sounds a little sketchy? You're not alone. Critics say pregnancy.gov would basically become a national registry of pregnant people. And why is that dangerous? Because in a recent interview with time magazine, Donald Trump said he would be okay with red states monitoring women's pregnancy so that they can know if they have gotten an abortion and prosecuting them accordingly."

Meaning, whenever a woman gets pregnant, that she has to go on a national data base and let the government know that she's pregnant so they can monitor her pregnancy to make sure she don't go nowhere and get herself an abortion. You know, that way, if they find out she did that, they can bring her back there and string her up, you know, or whatever they decide to do with her. Um, well, that's what that lunatic bitch Katie Britt decided she wanted to introduce his legislation. You know, the one that gave the creepy little state of the union rebuttal speech at her kitchen table. A bitch ain't never cook nothing in her life. Anyway, that's what she wants to do, which speaking basically for all white nationalist Republicans that we've put in the office right now. So, I mean, y'all think that's a good idea? Really? Do you? MAGA. So, meanwhile, while she's doing that, we've got a speaker of the house of Gilead there, Commander Mike Johnson, hanging out in the courtroom in support of a man that was on trial for paying off Corn Star and a playboy playmate. Because, you know, Mike Johnson is a such a godly man, a Mr. Moses himself. And he knows all about that pornography because him and his son have an app on their phones that they basically Share with one another what pornography each other's watching. Um, so anyway, what do y'all think about that database there? You know, keeping a good database of pregnant women in this country? I mean, it makes perfect sense, right? Let's. Let's register our women, uh, but not our firearms, right? Um, so we need. We need to know which ones are fertile at all times, right? Maybe even put some nice bright orange or pink tags on their ears so that we know which ones are breeding stock, you know, and then if we go along with that, then maybe we can even start up some forced breeding camps. Grow us up a good white population of little babies right there. Patriots. Fascist kind. That's what you're electing. That's why people can't stand you. Because, see, I know that we like to bitch about prices whole, man. Our food was so much cheaper. Trump was president. Our gas was so much cheaper. Trump was president. Well, thanks, Obama. But, um, the truth is, uh, that Democrats have actually tried to introduce legislation to stop all the price gouging that these corporations have been doing to us. Uh, 50% of our price hikes have been because of straight up corporate greed, not supply chain issues or anything like that. Corporate greed. Democrats have tried to stop that, Republicans block it. But I think we know that. See, if we was really interested in policies or prices, we wouldn't elect Republicans anymore. But we have a problem. And that problem is that our racism, our homophobia, our xenophobia, our misogyny, our hatred is way more important than our own self interest. That's the problem, right? MAGA inmate Trump, 2024.",

Johnny, you didn't learn anything when you were escorted out of the White House after chief of Staff John Kelly fired you over the investigation into your gambling habits? Yeah, the minute I saw that video, you look familiar to me. But you obviously didn't get enough of the Secret Service, right? Well, it seems like more people than just I took notice of who you were because they notified the Secret Service that you were bragging on social media about being the cause of innocent people being arrested. And Johnny wasn't joking in that video. That's who he is. Can you imagine what kind of piece of shit you would have to be to be fired from the Trump White House? Yeah. I hope Johnny gets everything he deserves.",

This country, and, uh, we have a lot of them. They wanna come and say, just stay back and pass lots of laws to stop things like this. Yeah. Donald Trump just said that the Republicans shouldn't come to the courthouse with him. They should stay in Congress and pass policies to block the charges against him. Really? You know, that's a very strange thing for someone to say who claims that they're totally innocent, right? I mean, Donald Trump says he hasn't done anything wrong, there's no crime. So he would have no problem going to trial because he's gonna be exonerated, right? He doesn't need any policy blocking it from happening. Oh, wait. Donald Trump knows he's guilty, and he needs somebody to step in to save him. He is quite literally trying to get the government to interfere with his trials, something we don't do here in the United States of America. But in Donald Trump's ideal world, where he's a dictator, that happens all the time. This man is so dangerous for democracy, I can't even put into words how bad a second Trump term would be. Don't fall for this. Don't fall for his incoherent garbage."

He's up six. Look at this. Nine in Georgia, 13 in Nevada. My goodness gracious. My god, that is a huge lead. No Democrat has lost that state since John Kerry lost it back in 2,004. How about these great lake battlegrounds states? This is something that the Joe Biden campaign can work with. Look. Pennsylvania, Donald Trump up three, but that's well within the margin of error. Wisconsin, Donald Trump up one. Well within the margin of error. And actually, a Joe Biden lead well within the margin of error, up a point here. This they can work with. The Joe Biden campaign, this, the Donald campaign, Donald Trump campaign absolutely loves, and it looks like a lot of the other polling on the Sun Belt battle when you're looking into the numbers. Why do you think Biden is doing better in the Great Lakes and Trump is doing so much better than sun belts? Yeah, the Trump coalition is changing. That's basically what's cooking here. This is at least one of the big reasons why. So this is among likely voters in these, uh. In all these, uh, battleground states we just spoke about. Back in 2000, twenty, 84% of the Trump campaigns, uh, the Trump, uh, coalition was white. Look where it is now. It's 78%. The non white portion of The Trump coalition, it was 13% in 2020. Look at this now it's 19%. So the Trump coalition is becoming more diverse. And of course those Sunbelt battleground states are more diverse than the Great Lake battleground state. You're looking at the Nevada's and the Arizona's. Of course, if you look at Nevada, Arizona, heavy Hispanic population. Georgia, heavily African American population. With the Michigan does have some black voters in it. But Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are heavily, heavily white. Very interesting. Okay, add it all up, what does this say about where the race stands right now? We're talking Electoral College and the race to two seventy. Yeah, the race to two seventy. It's advantage Donald Trump. But he's not over the 2 70 Mark just yet. Alright, so if we flip Nevada, Arizona and Georgia here in your lighter shades of pink, you add them to the states. And of course the 2nd Congressional District up in Maine, which Donald Trump won last time around, that gets into 268 electoral votes. If we keep Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania in the too close to call category, along with Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. Joe Biden at 2:25. So it's advantage Donald Trump. But Joe Biden does at this point have a path to 270. Yeah, and right now, as you're pointing out, neither. Yeah, neither there. Neither there. And we have a long road to it. Yes, we do.",

I'm a guy that says he got a fight, but he wants to take TikTok away. So if you're young and if you're smart, vote for Donald Trump. Thank you. Re enterprise guy my ass. You think we don't remember this? Dude, we're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. We may be. President Donald Trump said late Friday he would sign an executive order to ban TikTok in the United States, matching up the pressure. The only reason it even got banned now is because you started this shit. But just like everything else in your presidency, you completely fucking failed. You promised, but you don't deliver. And you wanted TikTok gone because all these young kids on the internet punked you and made fun of you by Buying all the tickets to that rally. And you started it. That's the reason why that bipartisan Bill even got passed now to begin with. You started it. The young people and the Americans in this country are not dumb enough to forget what you did only a few years ago. Go f yourself, Donald. And that's what it is. Throw me a follow"

I don't know he set our economy on fire he has truly set the world on fire if you want to know how a weak and pathetic president really is and then the things they do just think about this this week he announced that he will withhold shipping weapons to Israel as they fight to eradicate Hamas terrorists in Gaza that was shocking to hear it even while there are still American hostages being held by Hamas and they're saying oh October 7th never happened you know they say that and Biden has fallen for it. Crooked Joe's action is one of the worst betrayals of an American ally in the history of our country I support Israel's right to win its war on terror is that okay?

Well, this week, just in time for Mother's Day, Katie donned a new shirt and a different cross necklace to remind us again just how much she wants The Handmaid's Tale to become a reality. Kreepo Katie, with none other than Marco Rubio as her co sponsor, has written legislation that says that the government should run a website that will act as a registry for pregnant women nationally. That\u2019s not how they say it, obviously. They say it's an information clearinghouse for moms-to-be, where pregnant women have to input their contact information and location to then receive information about pregnancy and motherhood. Except the information that they're receiving is only from crisis pregnancy centers, which, if you're not familiar, are fake clinics where people literally wear white coats and pretend to be medical professionals and lie to women about their gestational age, about their options, and so on. Katie Britt and Marco Rubio have been debating what to call this website -  They first wanted life .gov. That was too obvious, so now it's pregnancy .gov. And their idea is that women who put their information in will be contacted by someone from the government to talk to them about their options. Except the government doesn't have the capacity to do that. So you know who they're gonna outsource that to? Crisis pregnancy center.s Think about how dangerous this is, okay? Women are gonna go online looking for info, They're gonna see a dot gov website and they're gonna think it's trustworthy. But instead, the government is collecting their demographic and geographic information and sharing it with people who are not only frauds, but are receiving taxpayer dollars to forcibly deny women ____. Now think about the women who start this process and realize there's something sus going on, So they stop talking to these people and then go get care elsewhere. The government now has proof that they were at one point pregnant. And in the GOP's America, the government can now pursue criminal punishment against them. And don't get it twisted for even a second -  Katie Britt and the GOP know exactly how f\u2019ed up it is to want a national registry of pregnant women. To the point where when people asked if she would also support a national registry of gun owners, she said: absolutely not."

Look, COVID broke something we can't fix. But as for me myself personally, I have officially endured my last scuba di toilet. I am retiring. Come here, Damian. This is Damien. Tell them, young man. When I gave you a D on your math quiz, what did you say? Oh really? Cause you thought it was pretty funny in November. What did you say, Damien? Uh, I said you had a funky neck. That's right, he said I had a funky neck. Hell no! Y'all won! This is Jay, this is Kendall. These two got in a fight in my classroom and when I tried to break it up, they turned on me. I got peaced up by two 12 year old non binary asexuals. Y'all run! Come out! Sometimes I like a little packet of Crystal Light in my water and The kids just couldn't let it slide. Tell him what you said, Haley. I said you drink Crystal Light packets because you can't afford real lemonade. Yeah, then I found out the kids started go fund me for me, called Help Our Broke Single teacher buy some lemonade. It raised $10,000. Yeah! Y'all won this year. I live by one word. T S I D D A H N.

Some of them reportedly nicknamed the former President Diaper Don, when one woman wore a sweater that said diapers over Dems. We have rated this claim as true. This isn't a Democrat, this isn't a Republican thing. This is just some. This is some bizarre.

A man who thought an endless stream of made up, folksy anecdotes were enough to hide the fact that he believed in nothing, nothing at all, except building his own brand to help his family get rich. Really? Really. President Biden doesn't believe anything. He lies to enrich himself and his family and boost his own brand. She's literally talking about Donald Trump. She just described Donald Trump. And she was also completely unaware that she just did. Trump ran for president originally to boost the Trump brand to make a bunch of money. And then when he got into office, he enriched himself and his families. He made $5 million plus while serving as president. And when he left office, his family took a two billion dollar loan from the Saudis. Give me a break. The point just went right over Laura Ingram's head. All the way over. She couldn't even see it. I mean, please. Donald Trump's the liar who used the office to enrich himself, not Joe Biden. Get out of here."

They started bumping into the recently independent country of Mexico, which at the time wanted to become more economically productive, so they started renting out huge plots of land to American settlers. As Americans settled the land, they brought slaves with them, which were illegal in Mexico. This caused the Mexican government to oppose the settlers, who then rebelled and made Texas an independent country, which was soon annexed by the United States. Then the president of the United States, James K. Polk, was obsessed with gaining California from Mexico, so he sent Mexico a 20 million dollar offer to purchase the land. As Mexico declined this offer, he sent American soldiers into this disputed region in Texas, who were shot and captured by the Mexican army. He used this event in the Congress to declare war against Mexico. United States, being the more powerful of the two, easily won this war. They paid Mexico $15 million for all of this land. In a matter of less than 20 years, Mexico lost more than half of its territory to the United States.",

And I hear them say, we're gonna go and help the woman get out of the building. There might be something going on with the building or something's wrong. So brother, his name is Abid, in the white shirt, starts running, like, laughing and just trying to be helpful. Brother in the blue button down, steps into frame, sets up the camera, just, you know, to record them helping or whatever. And then he steps out of frame. And right as his brother makes it to the end of the block, a direct air strike hits him out of nowhere. And then he runs. He starts screaming, Abbot! Abbot! And he starts running. And in the background, he just makes it to the very end of the block, and he's screaming, which means he was murdered. He was unalived. And the part that's, like, killing me right now is that while he was running to, like, help the lady or whatever, he was laughing. You can literally hear him, like, laughing, and he's just trying to be helpful. And this young man, his brother, accidentally captured the last moments of his brother being alive. And I believe the caption on his video was like, I didn't believe I would ever capture the moment my brother was murdered. But he did.",

Yeah, I'm just wondering, when does the mattress tag removal trial start? Cause I'm pretty sure even if he removed that mattress tag in 1979, they're coming for him. Pray for Trump.

    "voice_to_text": "That deal didn't settle well with the fucking Saudi, so they flooded the damn market. So in 2,020, he had to go over there, make that stupid OPEC deal to get them to stop. I don't know if you meant to say what you just said. Yeah, you. You just said the opposite of everything you've been saying. If I was grading your homework, though, I would certainly give you a smiley face to go with your air biscuits. You know what? The hell with that. I'm gonna send you a real can of grams. Butter tasting biscuits. Yeah, so let me fill in the gaps that you missed. Trump wanted Saudi Arabia to increase production by 2 million barrels a day to offset sanctions he was gonna put on Iran. Yeah, and he used the murder of Jamal Khashoggi as leverage to do it. Cause the whole world wanted to sanction Saudi Arabia. Once he got Saudi Arabia to increase production by 2 million barrels a day, he then granted Iran waivers and said, y'all don't have to have any more sanctions for another six months. That flooded the whole market. And you're right. That is the reason he had to go do that stupid OPEC 2020 deal. Because Saudi Arabia and Russia were both pissed off at Donald Trump. He cost them hundreds of billions of dollars when he pulled that shit on him with Iran. So they flooded that shit out of the market. When COVID hit just to Get Donald Trump to come over there and make a deal. Because if you wanna make money in this business, make a deal with Donald Trump. Yeah, he's the dumbest son of a bitch on the planet. You can get over on him any day. Two year production cut. Two year 10% production cut. Wow, that's unheard of. That deal didn't end until may of 2022. That production cut is why we had record gas prices in 2022. You're getting there, brother. You're getting there, man. I'm so proud of you.

Senator Katie Britt introduces a Bill to create a federal database of pregnant people. The Bill is called the More Opportunities for moms to Succeed Act. They love their little abbreviations. The MOMS act would mandate the creation of a federal website called Pregnancy Gov, which Miss Britt calls a clearing house of relevant resources available for pregnant and postpartum women and women parenting young children. Oh, Gilead, here we come. In. The Bill she list. Oh, it's a tool to help pregnant women. But we know, we all know what it's really about is tracking women who may need an abortion. And of course, they want to jail women for that. Jail women, jail the doctors, jail anyone who drove them anywhere. And this Bill, if passed, would allow the federal government to do that. This Bill is nothing more than a tool to control women. This is what Republicans want for any woman in America. Republican, women, Democrat, it doesn't matter. They want to control your life. They want to monitor what you do. And if you do anything that's outside of their moral world, they want to put you in jail. She's back in the news. She was creepy before, she's creepy now.

    "voice_to_text": "Wanna take a minute and review some of Trump's political positions with me? These are Trump quotes. Quote I am very pro choice when asked about his opinion of partial birth abortion quote I think Hillary Clinton would do a fabulous job. When he was asked about who would best represent America when negotiating with Iran. Quote income tax needs to be raised on the rich. When Trump was asked about taxes quote terrific guy, a lot of fun to hang out with. Trump when he was asked about his opinion of Jeffrey Epstein quote I support a ban on assault weapons. When Trump was asked about his view of gun control quote I like to take the guns first, due process second. Donald Trump while sitting president quote you wouldn't believe it, but I'm pretty much a Democrat. When Trump was asked about his political affiliations recently, Trump was asked if he identified as a conservative and he responded quote people think that I am, but I'm not a conservative. All of the above are all in context and all accurate. Trump quotes like these and tons more, and they can easily be fact checked. Anyone understand this? How could a man who's on record for holding all of these positions become the leader of the Republican Party? Well, there's really only two options. One is that totally by coincidence, as he entered his golden years and decided to run for office, he had a life changing epiphany and changed His views on nearly every major topic except maybe gun control, which he still seems to support most gun control laws. Or the second option is that he never really was a man. Had core values at all, but rather whatever was politically expedient, whatever seemed to fit the moment. Statements were based upon what he thought would bring him the most benefit. Now, which of these two are most likely? That a man in his final years changed every fundamental belief he had ever had his entire life? Or a man who's on record that saying the key to his success is hyperbole, aka lying. Just conned the population who are easily manipulated. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm gonna go with number two. Personally, I'm not a Democrat and I'm not a Republican, but I do say to the Republicans out there, go find yourself a decent candidate for the sake of all of us.",

    "voice_to_text": "Donald Trump was called the Orange Turd repeatedly by Stormy Daniels and by his own lawyer. That's right. That's how Donald Trump's day went today. The woman he has paid more money to than any woman he hasn't married. Criminal defense attorney Susan Necklace repeatedly called her client, Donald Trump the orange turd on what she thought was an effective cross examination of Stormy Daniels. So imagine Donald Trump sitting in that courtroom today, slumped in his chair, leaving his eyes closed for long stretches, being forced to listen to one of his criminal defense lawyers, on whom he has lavished money, money provided by his political contributors, listen to her repeatedly call him the Orange Turd. And Donald Trump is, of course, the most vain human being who has ever entered that courthouse. Was that the first time he's heard himself referred to as the Orange Turd? The Orange Turd landed an hour into a belavered cross examination by Susan Necklace that was repetitive, tedious, and almost entirely irrelevant. At 10:00am, high price lawyer Susan Necklace said to Stormy Daniels, quote, isn't it a fact that you keep posting on social media how you're gonna be instrumental in putting President Trump in jail? Answer, show me where I said I would be instrumental in putting President Trump in jail. Question, do you recognize that as your post? Answer, yes. Susan Necklace then shows the post on all of the screens in the courtroom for the jurors to see, and For the spectators to see, and for Donald Trump to see. You are responding to the post someone else's post there. Answer yes. Someone calling me a human toilet, so I capitalized on the joke you said. Exactly, making me the best person to flush the orange turd down. Answer yes. Susan Necklace brought the orange turd into the courtroom and kept it there. The questioning about the orange turd went on and on. I don't see instrumental or jail there. You're putting words in my mouth. Question so when you said you were the best person to flush the orange turd down, you weren't saying you were gonna be instrumental in causing him to be convicted of a crime? That was not what you meant? Answer no. Question what does that mean? Answer I'm pretty sure this is hyperbole. If somebody calls me a toilet, I can say flush somebody. See how that works? You said you were going to flush President Trump. Answer I didn't say President Trump. It says orange turd. So if that's what what's interpreted by you, I'm asking you whether you knew what you meant when you said an orange turd. Answer yes, I do. Question you don't want to admit you meant Mr. Trump? Answer I absolutely meant Mr. Trump. Question why did you say no? Answer it doesn't say instrumental and putting him in jail, and so it went."

    "voice_to_text": "In 2018, Donald Trump traveled to the village of Mount Pleasant in Racine, Wisconsin, where he used a literal golden shovel to break ground on what he said would be the eighth wonder of the world. The project Trump was touting was a deal with the Taiwanese electronics company Foxconn. Foxconn promised they would build a massive LCD screen manufacturing plant, investing $10 billion of their own money to do so and creating what they and Trump touted would be 13,000 jobs. In exchange, the state government of Wisconsin was prepared to give Fox Con $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives, which, if paid out, would have been the largest tax incentive given to a foreign company in US history. With the promise of that many jobs, the local government of Mount Pleasant practically destroyed itself trying to make this plant a reality. To make the plant possible, Mount Pleasant has ended up borrowing money to buy up land. Mount Pleasant is on track to spend close to $900 million in land acquisition and infrastructure. That's 38 times our annual budget. To clear room for the giant factory. The local government spent so much money buying up that land that the town itself had its credit rating downgraded. 100 homes and farms were bulldozed to make room for this plant. This is Prairie View Drive, and this road here used to lead into an entire neighborhood of houses. The Foxconn's building, they've been cleared out. Those residents are now asking, was it worth it? Kim Mahoney is One of them, she built her custom home in this subdivision with a dozen neighbors. The whole process has been somewhat of a nightmare. Now Mahones is the last house standing. Her neighbors took offers from the village government to move out and raise their homes. She says she received a low ball appraisal, so she stood her ground. I think this whole project was a scam. There's a real fear that we have been taken for a ride. Our only hope is that they build something. Unfortunately, the residents of Wisconsin were taken for a ride. Foxcon did build a small factory in racing, but it only employs about 1,000 people. The massive 20 million foot factory with 13,000 jobs never materialized. But today, six years after getting sold a Bill of goods by Donald Trump and his Golden Shovel Racing, Wisconsin got a new deal. Foxcon turned out to be just that, a con. Today, President Biden was in Racine to announce a 3.3 billion dollar investment by Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence data center in Racine. Project is expected to create more than 2,000 union construction jobs and another 2,000 permanent data center jobs. Jobs for which Microsoft is partnering with local technical colleges to train the local workforce. And this new data center will be built on the same land that locals cleared for Donald Trump's Foxcon plant. President Biden is quite literally fixing Donald Trump's broken promises. The question now is, will voters notice?"

Dumbass literally stood up, publicly, asked Big Oil for $1 billion to reverse Joe Biden's climate laws. What a fucking idiot. Yeah, he did. He told Big Oil, you give me a billion dollars, I'll reverse Joe Biden's climate laws. And you know what they're working on? They're working on writing the executive orders for him. Yeah, oil and gas lobbyists are already working on writing his executive orders for him. Do you know why? Because oil executives worry that a second Trump administration won't attract staff skillful enough to do so. They are literally saying, That the Trump administration will be too incompetent to write these executive orders in the right way or whatever? I don't know. But let's not be surprised. This isn't the first time this has happened. He did this in 2020 at a rally. Yeah. A lot of people don't remember. It didn't get a lot of press, but he was speaking at a rally, and he said, hey, if I ever need to raise some money, I can just call Exxon and offer him a couple of drilling permits for $25 million. To which Exxon had to immediately come out and say, yeah, uh, that. That's. No, that's not a thing. By the way, those permits are like ten grand a piece. So an oil company, Mr. Trump, an oil company isn't going to give you $25 million for something that's worth $20,000. That shows how much you know about oil, you fucking potato. I would really love to see a response. I would really love to see a response from the oil executives that were there at Mar Lago when Donald Trump asked them for a billion dollars. What is that, a bribe? Do you call that a bribe? What do you call it? If you give me a billion dollars, I'll do this for you. I don't know if it's a bribe or what you call it, but whatever it is, it's corrupt, and he fucking did it. But he can't be bought. Can't be bought. Yeah."

So you just showed your hypocrisy for everyone here to see, because you and the fakest true media are the ones saying Trump is a danger to our democracy.

This is from the Washington Post, and they obtained evidence Donald Trump's secret meeting with oil CEOs at marlago. In a secret meeting with these executives, one of these CEOs started complaining about environmental regulations. And even though they had spent $400 million to lobby the Biden administration, it was not working. So shout out to the Biden administration for not bowing down to these oil and gas folks. But here's where it gets remarkable. Trump asked the CEOs to raise $1 billion for him in his re election campaign, and in return, he would immediately reverse dozens of Biden's environmental rules and policies. Trump went on to say that giving this $1 billion would be a deal. And to think about how much more money they would make under his policies and not Biden's. Look, this is as clear as it gets about the stakes of this election. If we elect Donald Trump, he is quite literally telling us he's going to sell us out to these oil and gas executives. Now, President Biden is going to continue to fight climate change and not bow to these CEOs. The choice is clear. We have to elect President Biden in November.",

Who says that parts of the. The Constitution should be terminated? Who says he wants to put the US military in American cities? He wants to build camps for tens of millions of people, right? Like, that's what we're thinking about doing. This. Like, this huge yikes factor when it comes to him. But part of the reason he wants to destroy the rule of law and thinks that parts of the Constitution must be terminated is because in cases like this, where he's facing more than 30 of the more than 80 felonies he's charged with, it just seems plain that the evidence is very, very, very strongly against him. And so on top of the scariness about what he's offering us, political figure, on top of his likely criminal liability in these multiple criminal trials, we also then just get this yacht factor stuff, right? I mean, he. And he hides. She's doing a porn company promotion at a golf tournament. His infant son is four months old. He has his bodyguard ask her if she'd like to have dinner. So she goes to his room. There is no dinner. He's wearing satin pajamas. She says, get dressed. He tells her, I'll get you onto my reality competition TV show, and I will help you cheat at it. Right? He gives her advanced. He says, I'll give you advanced notice of the challenges on the show, and that will help you. He tells her, oh, me and my wife don't sleep in the same room. He asks her when she was last tested for sexually transmitted diseases. He tells her she reminds him of his daughter. She goes to the bathroom. She comes out of the bathroom, and he is stripped down to his underpants. And she tries to leave, and he steps between her and the door, and she doesn't want to do it. She says she doesn't feel threatened, but he says to her, I thought you were serious about what you wanted. If you ever want to get out of that trailer park. They have sex. She is not into it. He does not wear a condom. That is particularly concerning to her, and he should know that it is because she has just explained that to him about her work in the adult film industry. They meet several more times. He makes more sexual advances. They never have sex again. And ultimately, it is only when he finally says, no, I'm not putting you on my TV show that he stopped that. She stops picking up his calls. I mean, that's the character. I mean, Jimmy Carter almost lost 1976 cause he said he committed lust in his heart. But this is who we're thinking about putting back in the White House right now.",

And even though he had no proof of to back up that claim. And he was right. His supporters to this day still believe him. There's many people out there that believe he won with no proof.

They found a dark spot in the brain. And the belief is, Mr. Kennedy says anyway, that there's a dead parasite in his brain. Meaning, I quote from Robert F KR.

So he goes to court, and he tells the court that he doesn't have the earning power that he used to have because of health problems. What health problems, exactly? Um, a dead worm in his brain. The New York Times got their hands on the deposition. Basically, two years prior to the deposition of cage, junior was experiencing memory loss and mental fogginess. And his friends were so concerned about it that they said, you know, you might have a brain tumor. It wasn't a brain tumor. It was a goddamn worm. The New York Times spoke with, uh, different infectious disease experts, and they all speculate that it was a pork tapeworm larva. And if that's not enough, he also had mercury poisoning. The reason for that most likely came from eating too much fish, which contained mercury. He said in the deposition, I have cognitive problems. Clearly, he has short term and long term memory loss. The New York Times reached out to RFK junior to comment on this, and he said that he has fully recovered from. From all of it. And that may be true, but he's not releasing his medical records, so there's no real, independent, concrete way of knowing. This is the same guy, by the way, who's basically known for conspiracy theories and recently went on CNN and said that Joe Biden was a bigger threat. To democracy. Than the guy who tried to orchestrate a literal coup. So, I don't know, could this relate? I don't know. How did we get here? How is this real life? We're literally talking about brain worms."

But the problem is Nikki Haley, someone who dropped out two months ago, is not campaigning for president, got over 20% of the vote. As things stands, 113 thousand Republicans said, no, I'm not gonna vote for Donald Trump. I'm gonna vote for a candidate who's not even in the race. The Republican Party is not united behind Donald Trump. When you're losing 22% of the vote to a candidate who hasn't been in the race for two months, that shows you that this guy right here, not that popular. There are a lot of Republicans out there who won't be voting for Donald Trump in 2024, or will even be voting for President Biden. These numbers are devastating for Trump in his campaign.",

    "voice_to_text": "So y'all know CPAC? You know, the political action conference hosted by the slaps? Well, where do you think they're hosting it right now? Florida? Texas? Any guesses? I'll give you a second. Alright, time's up. They're hosting it in Hungary. It is upon courage that all virtues rest. We are gathered in Hungary at the center of this fight. Prime Minister Orban shows us, just like President Trump, that if we don't quit, we win. The globalists would do anything they can to get you to quit first. Holy monotone, Batman. Nobody will ever accuse her of being a good public speaker. Don't you find it interesting that she's comparing Trump to Orbon? And don't you find it weird that Americans are hosting a conference in this country? Trumpers. You don't find this even a little bit disturbing? Ah, who am I kidding? Y'all don't care. Oh, but she has more. A fight stops when we say it does. War Room was built for this fight. For this time in history. As chief executive officer of War Room, I commit to see pack hungry America, the MAGA movement, and especially President Trump, that we have not yet begun to fight. The CEO of War Room. Are you guys familiar with what that is? Do you know who runs that? Because she's about to tell you. Please turn your attention to the screens for a message from my father, Stephen K. Bannon. Yeah, the puppet master behind Trump. I can Only assume that he sent her because he's not allowed to travel. Didn't he get his passports taken away? One of my heroes in the world today, in addition to President Trump, is Victor Orbon, the presidential country. He is a leader in this populous nationalist or sovereignty movement throughout the world. He has traveled around the world for a decade to undermine governments and overthrow democracies. This is who is pulling the strings behind Trump. His actions in defending Hungary, in defending the citizens of Hungary, in defending all of Europe and the Judaeo Christian West, cannot be minimized. In other words, he wants to institute a theocracy. They will do everything to make sure you quit. They will. The source backed globalist. And it's more than just source. And it's deeper than just source, y'all. If this doesn't scare you, it absolutely should. To make this abundantly clear, the right and the Trump camp are aligning themselves with an authoritarian dictator, which, based off the commentary of Trump, is not surprising. And honestly, I don't even think I have any words for Trumpers because this is who you support. I'm gonna need y'all to stop pretending like you're patriots and you love this country, because the Trump camp has made it abundantly clear what they want to accomplish, and it is to institute this nonsense.",

And today, we're gonna go with reason number one. And any veteran worth their salt should find this absolutely repulsive. And that is Donald Trump's disrespect for John McCain. Like McCain or not, the man was a decorated Navy fighter pilot. A prisoner of war for nearly six years. He refused an early release offered because his father was appointed the commander of the Vietnam Theater of operations. And he was tortured so badly that he spent the rest of his life without the ability to raise his arms over his head. If you compare John McCain, a man who refused to use his father's influence to a benefit that likely would have allowed him to live a life with the basic function of his two arms, to a man like Donald Trump, who not only used his father's influence to his immense benefit, he still lies about the extent to this day, but he also made every effort and succeeded in dodging the draft all together. Comparing the POW to a draft dodgers like comparing apples to Buicks. Or in the case of John McCain, to Donald Trump. A national hero to a national disgrace. Veterans should not vote for Donald Trump. Now stay tuned for another 23 reasons why that's true. I appreciate y'all."

So you remember when they impeached Trump over his phone call with the prime minister of Ukraine, claiming that Trump was gonna withhold military aid until Ukraine did what he wanted them to do? Biden just did that with Israel. See, the whole basis behind the impeachment of Trump was that the president is not allowed to attach strings to money the Congress already passed. But Biden just did that. See, Congress passed an aid package for Israel, and Biden is delaying that aid, trying to pressure Israel to do what he wants them to do. He is doing exactly what they accuse Trump of doing. Except he's being far more blatant. Like when they said Trump was doing it, there was at least a question of whether or not that's what he was saying. But there's no question this time. Biden is being very open about the fact that he is delaying the aid until Israel does what he says. Until Israel acts the way he wants them to act. That's an impeachable offense.

We were founded by very strong Christians. These were men of faith. Every sign of our declaration of independence was in fact a Christian. Anti racist is a whole weird ideology that quite frankly tries to make white people second class citizens. White Americans are being treated as second class citizens. There are now two standards of justice. The dual system of justice. They care more about the illegal immigrants at the border than they do the American people. They're giving out handouts to them. Our country just don't care about us Americans. It's all about handout to all the illegal immigrants. The foreign born population is now growing by 132,000 people every month. The non whites are reproducing rapidly. To be continuing this trajectory, eventually there'll be no more native born Americans. Our people literally are an endangered species. Of our people having few children. We've got to start protecting our race. If you're white, you have to go to the back of the line. Discriminating against white people. There is racial discrimination going on right now in this country against massive numbers of white Americans. How precisely is diversity Our strength. So how is diversity our strength?

So, according to you, Joe Biden killed the Keystone Excel, went to Saudi Arabia because they were gonna get off the dollar, and told them we shut down our pipeline so we can buy oil from you, so you can stay on the dollar. And now Saudi staying on the dollar, that's. Yeah. And you run two investment firms, tens of millions of dollars. Then could you explain why. Why we're importing less from Saudi Arabia than ever? I mean, we had this low spot here from COVID, and then see this high spot? That's where Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia. And ever since he left, it's done nothing but gone down. This is oil imports from Saudi Arabia in 2019. This is oil imports from Saudi Arabia today. Less than half. Less than half. Yeah, I. I won't be taking you up on your free class. Yeah, that's. That's not a thing.",

This is stunning news because not many folks believe that Stormy Daniels would actually take the witness stand. Given that many people believed prosecutors don't necessarily need her testimony to prove the hush money payment. Now, a big topic of conversation this morning was over whether or not Stormy Daniels can talk about the allegations of a sexual encounter between her and Donald Trump on the witness stand. And Judge Marshawn allowed the prosecutors to ask Stormy Daniels about how she felt about the sexual encounter and just general details. Prosecutors clarified that they will not go into anything that could be embarrassing to Donald Trump. Stormy Daniels will not testify about genitalia, for example. According to prosecutors. If you recall, Stormi Daniels was the one who received the 130,000 dollar hush money payment that is central to Trump's criminal case. And while the hush money payment itself is not illegal, what is illegal is if Donald Trump made that payment to interfere with an election, or rather to violate federal election law, which is what he's charged with here. There are going to be fireworks in this morning's trial, and Donald Trump woke up very upset. Honest, truth, social. As soon as we have more information, I will provide it to you. So stay tuned for all the news you need to know about.",

Every 4 years they come into our neighborhoods and say, we're gonna make stuff better, we're gonna do this, do this, do this. And then finally us black people like you, man, of my ability to dunk a basketball, all my neighborhoods are still the same, our schools are still the same. And that's why I think black people are leaving disappointed in the Democratic Party. Because I ain't gonna lie, I voted democratic every time just cause I thought it was gonna help black people and poor people. Cause black people, poor white people, they're in the same boat. And like I didn't care who the president was, I'm not gonna lie, but I voted. I only voted Republican one time in my life and that was for John Casey. And I didn't even know he couldn't win.

I've been trying for five weeks to be able to interview Mr. Navarro, and there are provisions that ought to allow this. And I was informed directly by Director Peters, who runs the bureau, that that request would be denied. And the reason it's being denied is because Peter Navarro is too notorious to be interviewed by a member of Congress. John Gotti was interviewed when he was in prison. The Qanon shaman was interviewed in prison. Director Peters herself brought NBC News through prisons to showcase the work of corrections. It's being done. So I think there is something else a foot here. Mister Navarro, I'm being told, is not being allowed to access his attorney. And it is because it is shameful what has been done to Peter Navarro based on a sham January 6th committee and a sham indictment and a sham conviction that we ought to work to remediate immediately upon President Trump's rightful and righteous return to office.

This book that I've written is full of stories of my past hard decisions, and I told the truth. And I think that's very different than a lot of politicians that we have today. A lot of politicians telling that story. Do you feel like, oh, maybe I should have said it. Do you understand why people don't like that story? Well, everybody's known that story for years. That's what most people don't realize is that in South Dakota, they've used that story to attack me and my political campaigns for years. I wanted people to know the truth. This dog was vicious, it was dangerous. It was killing livestock for the joy of it and attacking people. And I had a choice between keeping my family safe. I had little kids at the time, a very public business of inviting people out to come out and enjoy our hunting lodge in our business. And I don't pass my responsibilities off to anybody else. So that story is in the book because I want people to know that I'm honest and that I. When I have difficult Jobs that I take responsibility of myself. So you're standing by the dog story? Well, I'll tell you what. It's the facts, okay? That's the facts. And I understand that they're attacking me for it. Just. Yeah, they are.",

The Republican former lieutenant governor of Georgia, Jeff Duncan, says he'll be voting for Biden in November. Quote, unlike Trump, I belong to the GOP my entire life. This November, I am voting for a decent person I disagree with on policy over a criminal defendant without a moral compass. Yeah. Wow. Jeff Duncan just completely snubbed Donald Trump, the MAGA, Republicans, and the tired GOP. And there are a lot of Republicans who have either said the exact same thing or just straight up said that they will not be voting for Donald Trump in November no matter what. Look, I vehemently disagree with Jeff Duncan on his politics, but this is somebody who cares about America. He's willing to stand up against his own party and say, yeah, this lunatic should not be anywhere near the Oval Office. So thank you to Jeff Duncan, and hopefully we see more Republicans following suit."

I am not performing political analysis. I am literally describing what they literally did. We do not want to be a democracy. Originally, congressmen were elected by a direct democracy, senators were elected by their state legislatures, and presidents are elected by the Electoral College. We are devolving into a democracy. Because now congressmen and senators are elected by the same pool. A direct democracy. And with the national popular vote coming, we're gonna be electing our president by a direct democracy, too. Bad idea. Bad idea. We are devolving into a democracy. We do not want to be a democracy. Okay. As Danny Wesney at the Seattle Times reported, delegates of the Washington State Republican Convention then stood up one by one to argue that the US should repeal the 17th Amendment, which allows us to vote for our United States Senators. After that resolution passed, they went bigger. They voted to put this language into their platform. Quote, we encourage Republicans to substitute the words republic and republicanism where previously they have used the word democracy. Every time the word democracy is used favorably, it serves to promote the principles of the Democratic Party, the principles of which we ardently oppose. Vote. We oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature. We oppose legislation which makes our nation more democratic in nature. So say Washington state Republicans, officially in writing in their party platform. What's going on here"

And number two, um, is that they always vote for the wrong person. We can't have people who vote, vote for the wrong person. It's just. It's insane. We can't have that. Number three is that Democrats have an inherent genetic defect. It's hereditary, okay? It's in their chromosomes. Um, seems that Magadan is off his medication, but I'm going to tell my kids when they get older that this was every single Trump supporter, because, honestly, he's pretty typical. So, two Donald Trump supporters today is I went about my day. One of them, at 9:30 in the morning, was drinking a Budweiser while wearing that clown hat while he was going to operate heavy machinery. Second was in a liquor store buying two sleeves of fireball on a Monday afternoon while wearing a shirt that said, build the wall, deport them all. You're a lovely folk. These people claim to be patriots who love the Constitution, but at the same time, are glad to disenfranchise Americans voting rights, because they know the only way they can win is to cheat.

And in his order for Donald Trump's tenth violation of the gag order, he ordered Donald Trump to pay a thousand dollar fine for the violation. But the judge also said, quote, therefore, defendant is hereby put on notice that if appropriate and warranted, future violations of its lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration. So, yeah, in New York, for violating a gag order, you can face up to a thousand dollar fine. That's the maximum. Or jail time. And after Donald Trump's 10th violation, seems like the judge is not putting up with his antics anymore. Look, Donald Trump can't keep interfering with this trial, insulting members of the jury, insulting witnesses, insulting court staff, all of this stuff. He can't keep doing that. He does not have a right to do that. And the judge should absolutely hold him accountable to which he sees fit for these violations. And look, monetary fines can't be all it is forever.

We've reported on this for a couple of years, but in no case are they doing it more openly than their attempt to shut down a conservative news channel called one American News. OAN? So why are they doing this? Well, they say the channel pushes something called disinformation. A disinformation, you should know, does not mean that something is dishonest or factually incorrect. It can be entirely true. It just means that the people in charge don't want to hear it, and they don't want you to hear it. So it's therefore disinformation. It's a term stolen from the Intel agencies, which are part of the apparatus in the federal government that Democrats are using to shut down the news. So here's California Governor Gavin Newsom going after OAN for daring to say that the vaccine might not be safe and effective. Well, the platforms are of concern, of course, and platforms have to do a better job across the spectrum. But they're also those that are propaganda machines that are out there as well. Let's be candid. One American news. You're familiar with them down here? Perhaps one of the great disinformation networks in America? Oh, yeah, that's one of the great disinformation networks in America. There's a guy who lies every day for a living, and it's not a guess. It can be proven. There's a guy who locked down the entire state and then Went to the French Laundry and Napa for dinner without a mask on. That guy is accusing other people of disinformation. So what you have here is the oldest story ever told. The people in power don't wanna be criticized in a so called democratic system. They don't want voters to know that they're liars and incompetent. So they shut down anyone who tells the truth about them or who spreads a message they don't care for. It's just abusive power. It never changes. It's been going on since Nebuchadnezzar. And he Learned it from his grandfather. Cause it's never not existed. But this country officially disallowed it, made it illegal with the Bill of rights, which is just now being ignored.",

So\u00a0his\u00a0name\u00a0is\u00a0John\u00a0McEntee, and\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump's\u00a0 personal aide until he was fired after\u00a0he\u00a0failed\u00a0a\u00a0background\u00a0check\u00a0 because\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0financial\u00a0crimes\u00a0investigation. That's\u00a0right\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0literally\u00a0too\u00a0unethical\u00a0 for the Trump administration. McEntee\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0a\u00a0close\u00a0Trump\u00a0confidant\u00a0 since 2015. Here he is working out  of Trump Tower. And\u00a0now\u00a0McEntee\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0charge\u00a0 of planning Donald Trump's  Project 2025 agenda. I\u00a0work\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Heritage\u00a0Foundation\u00a0 on their Project 2025, which\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0charge\u00a0of\u00a0staffing\u00a0 the next administration should Trump win. In Project 2025, is\u00a0a\u00a0set\u00a0of\u00a0extreme\u00a0policy\u00a0plans\u00a0 that Donald Trump is planning to enact if he's reelected in November. It includes things like  a national abortion ban. It also includes things like  separating immigrant families, imposing a Muslim ban, ripping away LGBTQ+ rights, pardoning January 6th insurrectionists, going\u00a0after\u00a0birth\u00a0control\u00a0and\u00a0IVF, and just so much more. So\u00a0when\u00a0you\u00a0see\u00a0this\u00a0guy\u00a0on\u00a0this\u00a0app, just\u00a0remember\u00a0what\u00a0he\u00a0and\u00a0Trump\u00a0 are plotting. They\u00a0are\u00a0coming\u00a0for\u00a0our\u00a0rights\u00a0 and our freedoms. It's\u00a0all\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0Project\u00a02025\u00a0agenda. We\u00a0have\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0out\u00a0and\u00a0vote\u00a0in\u00a0November because the stakes are  too high to sit this out."

She seemed kind of sad and slowed it down, so I was taking her order. I was like, what's wrong? I told her I had been raped and I was way too young to be a mother. And that's when Monica called over another employee, Trish, and they shamed me into changing my mind. I quickly pulled up pictures of bloody fetuses on my phone from my favorites folder while Monica showed her how they remove the baby with the milkshake machine. I was scared shitless, so I decided to keep the pregnancy. And now I have a baby I can't afford to take care of. I love seeing her every morning on my way into work cause she pitched her tent right outside the restaurant. Oh, no, the baby's hungry. I bet a spicy chicken combo would fill her up. I'll be great, thank you. Yeah, and it's only 6:19. Never mind.",

    "voice_to_text": "Haha, oh my goodness, this is funny. Trump Playboy witness Karen Mcdougall drops bubble bath photo titled catch and kill and you know this is going to be good. Mcdougall alleges that she had a ten month long affair with Donald Trump ooh! While he was married to Melania between 2,006 and 2,007 before he ever became president. Mcdougall allegedly first met Trump in 2,006 at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, where he taped an episode of his reality show The Apprentice. Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner threw a pool party for the show's contestants and invited dozens of current and former playmates, including McDougal. And now Karen is reflecting on the good old days with Donald Trump. Yes, she posted this yesterday and boy, oh boy, you can kind of understand why a married man like Donald Trump, his throat got a little dry, a little parched. That little playboy party. I'm scaring. You need some hush money or something? Cause I got that. Mcdougall shared the photo, taken from a bubble bath, with a copy of Ronan Farrell's 2,019 book catch and Kill Lies, Spies, and a conspiracy to Protect Predators in view. She captioned it reflecting. You should also note that Pharrell wrote the 2,018 New Yorker article titled Donald Trump A Playboy Model and a system for Concealing Infidelity with the subtitle one Woman's Account of Clandestine Meetings, Financial Transactions, and legal packs designed to hide an extra marital affair. Well, Karen, it's nice to see that You're in the mood and reflecting on those good times with the former president. I'm sure Melania is having quite the moment reflecting with you Trump supporters. Get those knee pads and those elbow pads ready, cause Jack Smith and funny Willis and Leticia James and Alvin Bragg are coming for you. It's over, MAGA. It really is.",

    "voice_to_text": "On our nation's college campuses, we've got roiling crises. All around the world, everything seems to be on fire. Places like Israel and Palestine, Ukraine, Iran, even here at home, where the threat of autocracy continues to gather. But also in the places that probably deserve more of our attention. Haiti, Myanmar, sedan. Other areas of conflict around the world. In so many of these painful instances, the patterns are similar. So called leaders act with malice and apparent impunity. They exploit people's very real fears and anxieties. They inflame ethnic conflicts. They pit people and communities against one another. They deploy misinformation and disinformation. They exploit inequalities. They peddle grievance and resentment. And they thrive on dehumanization. When you dehumanize someone, when you call them vermin, poor animals, when you say, an immigrant community will poison our blood, you create a permission structure that allows people to harm them one by one, or family by family, or community by community. This sort of attitude is a dangerous thing. All of history's worst moral catastrophes, from slavery to genocide, are fueled by this sort of dehumanization. Our history books are replete with these types of leaders, replete with the havoc they've reeked, the injustice they've wrought, the wars they've started, the lives they've destroyed. And those of us who believe and are shared humanity in democracy should be worried that these forces of dehumanization might have their way again in 2024.",

    "voice_to_text": "Oh, some of you guys are just gonna love this. Did you know you can look up inflation by state? Yeah. I was doing some research tonight, and I realized that you can look at a map that shows the inflation rate in every individual state. And upon learning this, you know, my brain went into overdrive. I thought, oh, shit. If we know the inflation of every state, and we look up the minimum wage of every state, we can determine if minimum wage causes inflation. Some of you are gonna be surprised by this. A lot of you aren't. So here we go. The three states with the lowest inflation in the United States are New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, all states which have a minimum wage which is greater than the federal minimum wage. As a matter of fact, uh, Rhode Island has the smallest minimum wage of all those, at 14. New Jersey and Massachusetts are both 15 or over. So double the minimum wage. And these states which have a minimum wage which is much higher than the federal minimum, have the lowest inflation in the United States. The next three states with the lowest inflation. New York, fifteen bucks an hour. Connecticut, 1569. May 14, 15. So the six states with the lowest inflation in the United States have a minimum wage which is at least double that of the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour. Can you believe that? What about states that do have the federal minimum wage? Some of those states have some of the highest inflation in the country. Yeah, some of the states with a seven dollar and 25 cent minimum wage have some of the highest inflation in the country. We're talking about North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Texas. 7:25 an hour. Some of the highest inflation in the country. Every state in the United States that uses the federal minimum wage. Is their minimum wage 7:25 an hour. Every single one of those states has higher inflation than the six states with the lowest inflation. That has at least double the minimum wage than those states. Every single state has higher inflation, and pretty much the only outlier is California, which has high inflation and high minimum wage. Of course, California has ridiculous energy policies that leads to ridiculous energy prices, which leads to ridiculous inflation. That's not a factor in any of those other states. So tell me again how raising the minimum wage increases inflation. I'll wait, thanks."

Because a lot of times, by the time you go to court, it takes so long to go to court to get the due process procedures. I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man's case that just took place in Florida. He had a lot of fires, they saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second. Can't buy a handgun at 18, 19, or 20. You have to wait till 21. But you can buy the. The gun, the weapon used in this horrible shooting at 18. Uh, you are gonna decide. The people in this room, pretty much you're gonna decide. But I would give very serious thought to it. I can say that the NRA is opposed to it, and I'm a fan of the NRA. I mean, it's no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. They want to do it. These are great people. These are great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. It doesn't make sense that I have to wait. Till I'm 21 to get a handgun. But I can get this weapon at 18. I don't know. So I was just curious as to what you did in your Bill. You know, we didn't. We didn't address it was present. But I think you know why. Cause you're afraid of the NRA? No. No."

And in one case, you have somebody that comes from Somalia, which is a failed government, a failed state, who left Somalia, who ultimately came here, and now is a congresswoman who's never happy, says horrible things about Israel, hates Israel. Hey, shoes! Hey, shoes! It's pretty simple. And if the Democrats wanna wrap their bows around this group of four people, one of them kept Amazon out of New York. Tens of thousands of jobs would have been a great thing. And New York has not been the same since that happened."

Talking about how racist she was and how she was out to get him. So what I just told you guys is not a coincidence at all. His ass was indicted by a federal grand jury.

Many of them were making racist gestures toward her. And it's interesting how the police come after her and not. These guys were all screaming at her and going in her face. In particular, people were, like, making monkey sounds at her. Like this guy right here, you can see it. Or here's another angle where he was doing it. Again, openly racist, disgusting stuff. And no matter what side of this debate you're on, Palestine, Israel, you can recognize that this is wrong. This is gross. So what did Donald Trump do? Well, the most Trump like thing he could possibly do, and he posted a compilation of videos, including that one from the university of Mississippi, praising these kids who are being racist to that woman. Like, how awful is that? This is somebody who wants to be president of the United States praising people who are doing things like that? Give me a break. That is what Donald Trump's all about. The bullying, the belittling, the going after people for who they are, what they look like. That's who Donald Trump is.

And I didn't wanna come on here and admit this, cause I know that's what they want, is that's what these are, the emotions that they're trying to evoke out of us, cause they understand the racialized context, they understand how that imagery of, you know, monkey and ape beast has been used to subjugate and completely alter and shift the realities and perceptions of black folk within the US. I didn't wanna come on here and admit that that made me angry, seeing that, but I feel like it's worth holding space for that anger, honoring it, honoring it and talking about why seeing that evoke such a deep emotional response. I don't know if anybody else can relate, but when I watch these videos and I'm filled with an indescribable rage, it's almost as if, like all the instances of anti blackness and racism I've ever felt in my lifetime, like flash across my eyes and it further adds to the anger and rage I experience in watching these Violent displays of racism. And that's what I felt today. Like, I'm angry not just because of what I saw in that video, but for so much more. For so many more reasons. I'm not just angry at the fact that these white men have all the privilege in the space to do that without facing the consequences. I'm angry that this woman was by herself experiencing this. I'm angry that for what, 24 years of my life, I've endured racial gaslighting by people outside of the community and people in our community who have found ways to duck and weave and conversations about racism and anti blackness in the US. I'm angry that we as a people, we as a black folk have not gotten retribution, have not gotten resolution to black trauma, black pain, black oppression. I'm angry that these students are being brutalized for protesting a genocide, a humanitarian crisis, and. And this sitting president does not give a fuck. I'm angry at the people who will see what's happening in the DRC and Sudan and Gaza and Haiti, see how the US has fucked Haiti over and still ask people to participate in systems that don't serve us, still berate and speak down to people who are are hesitant in choosing the lesser of two evils, who are still hesitant to even consider Biden as a candidate. I am angry because we are due for a revolution, and the the cost of that quite literally will Be our lives. I'm. I'm fed up.",

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peacefully to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. End of quote. Let us be clear. Protests and demonstrations have played an enormously important and positive role in modern American history. Without protest, LED by Doctor King and others, we would not have made progress in eliminating segregation in America and combating racism. Without protest, women in America would still be second class citizens, unable to control their own bodies or have equal opportunities in the workforce. Without protests, many of our gay brothers and sisters would still be hiding their sexual identity. Today, on college campuses all over this country, students are exercising their constitutional right to protest. They are standing in opposition to American policy which is providing billions of dollars for Netanyahu's right wing, extremist Israeli government's war against the Palestinian people. A war which has already killed 33,000 Palestinians and injured 77,000 more, two thirds of whom are women and children. A war which has destroyed or damaged more than half of the housing in Gaza. A war which has essentially annihilated the healthcare system in Gaza. A war which has done incredible Damage to the civilian infrastructure in Gaza, electricity, clean water and sewage. A war which has bombed everyone of the 13 universities in Gaza and left hundreds of thousands of children without schooling. In my view, demonstrations must be non violent. Not only is that the right thing to do, it is the most effective thing to do. The focus must be on the suffering of the people in Gaza, not bricks flying through windows. And absolutely, we must all work together to make certain that we free our country from all forms of bigotry, anti semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia and every other form of hatred.",

The auditing firm that audits the finances of Donald Trump's truth social has been charged with falsifying documentation to make it look like their accounting work abided by SEC standards. And now they have been Bard from doing audits for any company that files with the SEC and have agreed to pay a massive 14 million dollar penalty. And what an ironic time this is for the auditing firm engaging in falsifying its business records. Who's auditing Donald Trump's truth social? A guy who is on trial for falsifying his business records. And a guy who just lost a massive fraud case himself. I guess fraudsters attract fraudsters."

They found evidence in my son case after there was no evidence. They came back and said they found evidence and they had found fingerprints. What came to find out in court that that was a lie. They said a second testing had been done, and my son fingerprints were found on the scene. And that was a lie. He. The attorney, uh, Daryl Korn, tried to get my son to take a 20 year plea deal by falsifying evidence. And as you can see, corruption is just running rampant within Fulton County Jail. It's time for something to be done, man. We gotta do something. Y'all allowing these kids to be locked up knowing. That lady is corrupt. She spent the money that was meant to help the kids, and then she recalled them. She recalled all the young people after she spent the money that was meant to help them to create a. A safe Environment for them not to have to be out here in these games. Now, let's ask her what she did with that money. It's time to do something to clean up Fulton County. We're not talking about tomorrow. We need to start today. You got over 800 people in that jail who shouldn't be there, haven't been indicted. They won't take them to trial. How's that justice? And you know what the crazy thing is? Fulton County. Sit back and watch it.",

And he admitted that by pleading the fifth over and over again. This is a United States district attorney pleading the fifth, which, if you're unaware, the Fifth Amendment allows you not to answer questions if the answers to those questions would be self incriminating. And what questions was he asked? Well, the first question he was asked, did you knowingly break any laws while investigating Donald Trump? He pled the fifth. Then they asked, did you knowingly break any laws while working at the Manhattan DA office? He pled the fifth. Then they asked, did you knowingly violate anybody's constitutional rights while working on the Trump investigation? He pled the fifth. They said, did you violate any constitutional rights while working at the Manhattan DA office? He pled the fifth. Then they asked, did you misuse any federal funds while investigating Donald Trump? He pled the fifth. They said, did you misuse any federal funds while working at the Manhattan DA office? He pled the fifth. They asked, did you violate any New York State bar rules while investigating Donald Trump? He pled the fifth. They asked, did you break any New York State bar rules while working at the Manhattan DA office? He pled the fifth. And lastly, they asked him, did you violate any cannons of legal ethics while investigating President Trump? And he Pled the fifth. He pled the fifth on every question about everything to do with his job, about anything to do with the Trump investigation. And the only reason you wouldn't be able to answer those questions, the only reason you would plead the fifth is to protect against self incrimination, because that's what the Fifth Amendment's for. It protects you from making statements that would be incriminating to yourself. So we know what the answer to all those questions would have been if you didn't have the Fifth Amendment. Are you paying attention yet"

My generation has never lived in a world without mass shootings or a world that's not getting hotter and hotter by the second. This is not the reality we chose for ourselves or the future that we want for the next generation. But the truth is, we're the ones who have to deal with the broken system we didn't create, where our reproductive freedoms are under attack, and we struggle. We struggle and we struggle to afford housing, healthcare and Equality, education. And if we're gonna stand a chance at solving these issues, then we've got to remove the Republicans. Republicans! Republicans who are standing in the way and replace them with Democrats who will fight. Fight for our future. So this summer, we're not taking no for an answer. We're going on a tour. Going on a tour across the country, stopping in Republican health districts to flip them blue. Flipping these seats blue is key to fixing our future. And yours, too. Simply put, Republicans don't care. Don't care about our voices or our lives. And as we speak, they're coming for each and every one of our freedoms and blocking. Blocking all progress. But when we win, we can finally turn ideas into action and movements into policy. But it won't be easy. Won't be easy. It's gonna take every single one of us, no matter your generation. Yes, that includes You, you, you, you. That includes you. So please visit tour to save democracy.com to learn how you can get involved and help us build a movement."

Three major events in my life, and I can tell you where I was when I found out about each one of those. Today, May 2nd of 2024, I was at work when the former president was referred to in a court transcript as Von Schitzen pants. His attorney read a transcript from Michael Cohen to someone else I didn't really see. I was too busy laughing. But basically, Michael Cohen referred to the former president as Von Schitzen pants. So, now, in law school, in the future history books, in the future, there will be a footnote that the former president, the 45th president of the United States of America, was once called Von Schitt's in pants. As an adult, not as a baby, as an adult. So there's that. Um, have a good day and be kind.",

He's not the same man. His energy is gone. No one can deny it. And Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he's starting to throw around the nuclear war to. You heard that? Nuclear. You're learning. He cares about himself, not us. Sioux Falls. Thank you very much, Sioux Falls. We've all had parents who we love, but who changed over the years. Needed help, needed understanding, needed care. Including Obama. It was. I'll tell you what. You take a look at Obama and take with Trump. It's happening so fast, we can all see it. Now you do, too? Yeah. Yikes. Donald Trump is certainly not the same guy he was in 2016 or even 2020. The rapid decline we've seen in the past couple of years has been incredibly concerning. He's stumbling over his words, he's confusing people. He's falling asleep in court. I mean, this guy is not fit to serve. He is not the energetic guy that the MAGA cult makes him out to be. If Donald Trump can't stay awake in court, then how do we expect Him to be able to wake up at 3:00am and take that phone call and be able to head down to the situation room and deal with whatever's happening around the world or in the country. I certainly don't think he can do that. Trump is certainly not all there. And I hope, I really do hope that the Republicans can come to terms with that and be honest about it."

And they have their own installations that are military installations. Because you do not wanna create human Shields out of civilian populations. Hamas does that, and they do it on purpose. So? So I. Listen. It is a tragedy that there are Palestinians who have lost their lives in this conflict. Just like murder. Just lose their lives. One second, one second, one second. Do you think. Do you deny? Are they human beings? Now, you can say that you want to be supportive of the Palestinian people, but you also have to acknowledge that Hamas invents themselves among the Palestinian people. Hamas could have ended this conflict long ago. There have been at least five different offers now for ceasefire. Five different sources, five different resources. Is this guy wanted me to answer a question or do you want to keep talking? So, like I said, Hamas has been offered agreements to a ceasefire. They have Rejected all of you.

Well, Sean, you know how the fake news works. Um, they leave out some or most of the facts of a story, they put the worst spin on it, and that's what's happened in this case. I hope people really do buy this book and they find out the truth of this story, because the truth of this story is that this was a working dog and it was not a puppy. Yeah, she's using the death of her dog that she caused to sell books. Disgusting, reprehensible. Nobody's buying your book. Stop. Nobody's buying your book. Nobody wants to hear about this. And then trying to justify it by saying, oh, well, it wasn't a puppy and it was a working dog. Get out of politics. Seriously, get out. I hope that this is something that Democrats and Republicans can actually agree on. Don't do stuff like this. Don't do it! It's evil.

Okay, so you agree that. That people who break in and vandalize the building should be prosecuted? Exactly. Okay, I'm just checking, because you did help raise money for people who did so on January 6th, which was, you know, impeding and official proceeding. Breaking into a building that they weren't allowed to be in and vandalizing the capital. Well, Caitlin, I know that this is the obsession of the national media to talk about what happened two years ago, three years ago on January 6th. It's not an obsession. Just seeing if it's a double standard. No, let me know. Let me. Let me answer the question, Caitlin. I mean, look, here's my basic argument about January the sixth. If you beat up a cop, of course you deserve to go to prison. If you violated the law, you should suffer the consequences. But there are people who protested on January the 6th who have had the complete weight of the Justice Department thrown at them when, at worst, they're accused of misdemeanors. Now, again, there are people who are accused of worst offences, and that's a problem. But you can't have Black Lives matter protesters who rioted and vandalized goes free when you have people who were actually peacefully protesting on January the sixth, who have the book Thrown at them. That's the double standard that I'm most worried about. Yeah, I. I don't think there's an obsession with January 6th, but. But it is a legitimate question, and given what you just said there, and as Trump is getting closer to, you know, as he's a presumptive Republican nominee, he has said he would pardon. It's considered a blanket pardon for everyone on January 6th. Are you saying that that shouldn't happen? People who beat up cops should be excluded from that? Well, I think what President Trump has said, and of course, he can speak for himself, but I pay attention, pretty close attention to what he says, and, yeah, I think what the president has said is that people who have this double standard applied to them should be partnered and.",

    "view_count": 345392,
    "voice_to_text": "Wealthy whites Louisiana residents won a year's long battle to separate from poorer black neighborhoods and form their own city. I'll explain. Last Friday, April 20 6, The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed a lower court's decision clearing the way for the incorporation of the city of Saint George, a suburb of Baton Rouge. Nearly 15 years ago, the battle for Saint George began with wealthy, mostly white residents of the area trying to start a new school district before ultimately shifting gears to creating their own city. In 2015, efforts to collect enough signatures to bring the incorporation proposal up for a vote failed. But in 2019, with enough people signing the petition, the measure made it onto the ballot at that year's election and passed with 54% of residents voting in favour of the separation. At the time, supporters of the move said it would clear the way for better schools, lower crime rates, and more infrastructure committed to their part of the Parish. Critics, on the other hand, call the move in effort to distance a suburban area from bloccanpora residents of Baton Rouge. Sharon Weston Broome, the mayor presidents of the combined Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge Parish government, said the separation would lead to an annual laws of $48 million in tax revenue. It would imperil the city's budget. That's when the courts got involved, agreeing with city officials that the proposed operating budget for Saint George was just not accurate. Well, fast forward to 2024. And the Louisiana Supreme Court disagreed with the lower court decision, ruling 4 2 3 that quote, Saint George can provide public services within a reasonable period of time. Now, the establishment of Saint George is moving full speed ahead. City has already created its own fire department and is assembling a city government from scratch. Despite the legal victory, Saint George residence and Baton Rouge Parish officials alike fear detangling their affairs will be a long, an arduous process.",

    "voice_to_text": "Hey, it's me, JoJo from jurors and shocker, I have something to say. Donald Trump says he will deport more than 11 million people, that he'll build migrant detention camps and deploy our military at our border and in our cities. But Joe Biden is old. Donald Trump says he will let red states monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans, but Joe Biden walks slowly. Donald Trump says he would withhold funds appropriated by Congress and fire any US attorney who refused his order to prosecute someone. But Joe Biden fell off his bike. Donald Trump says he will pardon those who attacked our capital, even those who have pleaded guilty. He maintains he can order the assassination of his enemies, sell nuclear secrets, and use the military to support a coup. But Joe Biden isn't exciting. Donald Trump says he might not help our NATO allies if they're attacked, that he'll gut the civil service, close the White House pandemic preparedness office, and pack his administration with anti democratic loyalists who maintain the lie that he won the 2020 election. But Joe Biden isn't perfect. Donald Trump is an adjudicated rapist, business fraud, facing four indictments and 80+ felony charges, including subverting our very democracy and intentionally mishandling our nuclear secrets. He's promising to be a dictator on day one and he is not clever enough to kid about it. Joe Biden is old. So is Trump. He walks a bit slowly. So does Trump. He fell off His bike. At least he can ride a bike. He isn't exciting and he's certainly not perfect, but he doesn't wanna be a dictator. He doesn't want states to monitor and punish pregnant women. He doesn't want to deport millions, build detention camps, or deploy our own military against us. He's not a sexual predator, not a business fraud, and he's not facing a single solitary felony charge anywhere for anything. He never plotted a coup. He did steal our nuclear secrets, and he didn't hide them in his fucking bathroom. But he is, at this very moment and all the way up until November, the person who can beat Donald Trump and keep his despotic, sociopathic, moronic, racist, sexist ass out of the White House. He's done it once before. And in the four years since he did that, he's gotten us by partisan infrastructure legislation, lowered prescription drug prices, lowered unemployment, addressed gun violence, created millions of jobs, steered us through Covid, and managed the economy so well we are stronger post pandemic than nearly all of our pure nations. And he's never once called the January 6th attackers hostages, never mentioned refusing to accept the results of the election or Muse about shooting his rivals. So this is the choice before us. These are the stakes. Democracy or a despot. Which do you choose?",

Take a look at it. Trump just isn't the same. You're noticing it now, aren't you? You can see it. He's old, sleepy, confused, weak. His jaw kept falling on his chest and his mouth kept going slack. He's not the same man. His energy is gone. No one can deny it. And Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he's starting to throw around the nuclear war. Terry, you heard that? Nuclear. You're learning. He cares about himself, not us. Sioux Falls. Thank you very much, Sioux Falls. We've all had parents who we loved, but who changed over the years. Needed help, needed understanding, needed care. Including Obama. I'll tell you what. You take a look at Obama and take with Trump. It's happening so fast. We can all see it. Now you do, too? Yeah. Yikes. Donald Trump is certainly not the same guy he was in 2016 or even 2020. The rapid decline we've seen in the past couple of years has been incredibly concerning. He's stumbling over his words, he's confusing people. He's falling asleep in court. I mean, this guy is not fit to serve. He is not the energetic guy that the MAGA cult makes him out to be. If Donald Trump can't stay awake in court, then how do we expect him to Be able to wake up at 3:00am and take that phone call and be able to head down to the situation room and deal with whatever's happening around the world or in the country. I certainly don't think he can do that. Trump is certainly not all there, and I hope, I really do hope that the Republicans can come to terms with that and be honest about it."

They think this is the business model that needs to be done. There you go. All these political stunts. You see, boys and girls, this is why you don't elect people like Margie Taylor Greene to public office. Because she thinks that there's a current UNIT party in Washington, DC. And anybody that's paying attention can see that there is definitely a big divide between the two parties. She's just upset because every once in a while, a few Republicans grow a freaking conscience and go, eh, we're gonna vote for it. But probably best of all, now, Margie Taylor Green and the rest of the domestic Terror Squad are calling for Mike Johnson to be booted. Reports coming out say the house of representatives will vote on a motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson next week. Now, me personally, I hope they do it, because we're, what, six months out from the November election? So what are you projecting to American voters? You're projecting that the Republican Party is filled with a bunch of jokes who are incapable of getting anything done for the American people, and that will tank honest legislation if it means not helping Joe Biden. So again, I ask, why are we allowing people like Margie Taylor Greene to sit in Congress and help Vladimir Putin and push this propaganda? Like the whole reason she's Mad is because she's realizing that she is not the majority. She is in a very small minority in Congress. That's why she's freaking out. We shouldn't have people in Congress who don't understand international relations and who don't understand history and who can't see the writings on the wall that the world right now is about that close to a freaking World War. And I'm like her. I actually will support something that Mike Johnson said that I agree with. He said, I'd rather send ammunition and resources over there than American troops.

Last night at UCLA, a fascist mob showed up, just members of the public, dragged people from the encampment, mace them, jumped them, beat them with two by fours, fired actual fireworks at their head, and attacked old women. I need the centrists or even the Democrats that sometimes come across my videos to treat this how they would if it were happening under a Trump presidency. Because the fascism, the scary fascism that you say will happen if he's elected is already here. What do you mean? You cannot protest a foreign government on your own soil?

So when she confronts him about it, bro is sitting there playing dumb like he don't know what she's talking about. She takes his phone, and in his phone is a video of him recording her. She records that video, so she got proof of it and ask him, ain't this you? And he still sitting there like, what are you talking about? Trying to play dumb. I'mma tag the girl below who this happened to, cause she uploaded their original video. So if you ain't see it yet, you could go watch it. And it's really ironic because this happened right here in Milwaukee. It's almost like god in the universe was saying, if you one gonna change your mind, okay, let's have a situation play out where you live and see if it changes your mind. The reality of it is, fellas, is just simply a lot of weird dudes in the world. That's just a fact. Like, think about this guy. If he was weird enough to try to record her in broad daylight with people around in a public setting and not get scared. Imagine him alone in the woods with somebody and nobody's around.

I'm gonna do a second video where I do a synopsis of the article, but every American should read it. And, MAGA, this is a question I have for you because, you know I like to ask you questions. And since you normally just read headlines, this is the last paragraph of the interview. Whether or not he was kidding about bringing a tyrannical end of our 248 year experiment in democracy, I asked him, don't you see why many Americans see such talk of dictatorship as contrary to our most cherished principles? Trump says, no, quite the opposite. He insists. I think a lot of people like it. So my question is, MAGA, do you like it? Do you want full government control in the presidency? And by the way, that would be for Biden, Trump, anybody who holds that office. You guys don't want this? A system of government by the whole population or all eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. You don't want our representatives to be elected? You want them to be, what, installed? Never leave? We don't get a voice. We the people. What do you think, MAGA? Is he right? Do you want a dictator? An authoritarian government? Do You",

It's part of Three Sixty's continuing series, the 53%, which is the average proportion of women voters in presidential election since 2000. Here's Randy's report. Would you like a plate? Come on, girl. Thanks for putting this together. It's not the catch and kill that's the issue. It's the cover up that's the worst part. You know, it's the devil's in the cover up. Well, the accountant and the numbers don't add up. He completely sees himself as tefan like he does. Nothing sticks to him. And I'm really nervous that he's starting to look like he's right. One of these is gonna have to take him down. I just can't see how you slither. Out of 90+ charges, how many of you believe that Trump should be on trial for this? Raise your hand, all of you. There is not only smoke, there is fire. How many times can you say it's a witch? I'm personally tired of hearing it. So if he's misappropriating campaign funds or, you know, election funds, then yeah, he needs to be prosecuted. If we have one person who is above the law, then what is the purpose of the law? Your account wrote it down, right? Recorded it. You got witnesses who said you did it? It's not. Yeah. What he's paying for. Even in the story, because the porn Star the. Right? Yeah. We're characterizing in castigating the women, right? They were doing a job. So prosecutors say that Trump has violated his gag order, attacking prosecutors, witnesses, jurors, willing to do whatever they want. So then does even $1,000 per violation, or, you know, going to jail for any period of time, is that enough, given his influence? He's gonna have to go to solitary because secret service cannot. Right, cannot protect him in general population. I don't care. Put him under the jail. Put him in solitary. We do not. We do not shriek from putting other inmates in solitary confinement. Right. Put him there and shut up. He can talk to the walls, he can talk to the rats. I don't care. When it comes to your president, do ethics matter? Yes. The leadership of the free world? Yeah, ethics matter. Of course they matter."

They moved all their criminals from Venezuela right into the good old USA. And Biden let him do it. It's a disgrace. But sir, where are those numbers coming from? Uh, I guess I get them from the papers. In this case, I think it's a federal statement or. Well, they're coming actually from Venezuela. They're coming from Venezuela?

Courtesy of Trump himself, he sat for an interview with time magazine where he laid out his priorities for a second term. And it's quite a his comp, I tell you. Trump says all true what I'm about to inform you this. He says he would carry out a deportation operation to remove more than 11 million people from the country. He says he would use the military to build migrant detention camps. He would let red states monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress. He would fire any US attorney who wouldn't carry out his order to prosecute. He's weighing pardons for everyone who attacked the capital January 6th. He said he might not come to the aid of an ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasn't paying enough. He would gut the civil service. He would close the White House pandemic preparedness office and staff his administration only with those who believe the election was stolen from him. And when they asked about dictatorship, he said, I think a lot of people like it. And he's on the cover of time magazine. He should be on the cover of doing time magazine. That's the"
