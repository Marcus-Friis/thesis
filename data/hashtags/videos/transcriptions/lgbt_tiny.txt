 Congratulations on the person you got to become from those experiences. Congratulations on the feelings you wouldn't have felt without going through what you go through now and what you went through before. Congratulations on the current opportunity of showing a positive way of how strong you can be and how strong others can be in moments like this. Congratulations on feeling whole with a person and having that experience to feel whole in a way a lot of people won't get to have in their lives. And thank you for showing me and other people who struggle with losing people, how to cope with things like that. Thank you.

 It's a multitude of ways that they can go. It could either be because he's some friends and I really used to know about everything, you know. Especially if they find out. Normally when they look like something, like it's a bunch of years, it's a bunch of years' pieces. You know, that's how they gonna give. But then with somebody that ain't going forward, that's when you're gonna get that fee big. That's when you're think I'm gonna be a problem. I'm not gonna be a baby. Which I got to understand is, soon when it comes down to living, like, women are still women. So it can go from that line of being okay, we fuck around and it can also be okay, wait, you just another bitch out the street. And depending on how she feeling, you from there being a bitch out the street. Like I let girlfriend sit out there, you talk and I, we boot out, that's the deal. That's that, that ain't even existing right now in this moment. Now sometimes that really 10 times they're thinking for women like they're probably not at the problem. They really don't sighted that land. You know what I'm saying? You really ain't never been there. You can say about, you know, saying, had a move, you know, she thought really didn't mean through, you know, stuff like that.

----------------------------------------

Video: @a.is.for.alex_video_7372263868602633515-Scene-002.mp4
 The more and more I hear uneducated people talk about trans women going into bathrooms, the more I realize that y'all are not afraid of trans women. Y'all are afraid of cis men. Y'all are afraid of cis men. Let's talk. What a lot of y'all are afraid of are men coming into the bathroom assaulting you and getting away with it, which is a very valid fear. I'm not going to invalidate you for that. But can we sit down and be real for a second? If a man truly wanted to assault you, he would not have to put on a wig and dress to do it. He would not have to put on a wig dress and take estrogen shots to do it. Trans people aren't transitioning, going through the hormone therapy therapy in general, going through all this discrimination just to go into the bathroom and look at you, just to go into the bathroom and assault you. Sorry to tell you that, but that is just that's just not happening. As somebody who is friends with trans women, then to the bathroom while a trans woman is in there, there has never been a situation where they've made me feel uncomfortable. They go to the bathroom, wash their hands and leave, like everybody a lot of y'all need to check your biases because your concerns are valid. They are very, very valid, but the way that you are expressing them is through hate and bigotry and that is not okay, especially coming from somebody who is a part of the community. They don't, they're just not going after trans people, babes. They think all of us are child predators trying to dismantle society. They're going to come for you next door.

 I knew that there were people who were still cool with the Meckaller or whatever, but I didn't know they all were really still rocking with the Meckaller. Like, when are we gonna cancel that shit? Like, you're telling me that the Meckaller is an event that we don't even see the inside of and we're raving about it every single year? Like, oh, Meckaller outfits! Meckaller outfits! Meckaller theme! Like, why do we care? Why do we care? And why do you care? More important! Like, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but like... You are one of the faces of the queer community. Okay, on TikTok, you are one of the faces of the queer community. And you, as a face of the queer community, are not saying anything about what's happening right now. And the only thing that that does for you is make you look bad. It's not a good PR move. It's not a good... It's not a good... Like, oh, I don't want to lose followers. It's not... It literally just makes you look bad. Because they're saying anything, because you're scared that you're gonna lose followers, because you think that some of your followers are on? That's fine. Or, you're on this side yourself. That's the only two ways that it looks, babe. Like, you have all of these followers and you get all this PR and like all of this stuff. Please. Like, how many people have to... Until it's good enough for you. Until it's good enough. Like, please. Do better. Also, learn to multitask. It's not that hard.

----------------------------------------

Video: @accrualworld87_video_7372680919607430432-Scene-002.mp4
 I don't need to watch the rest of this video because I am a super attractive person, and I know the five signs off by heart already. Sign one. People will literally stop and stare at you in the street. I can fact-caused two car crashes because people were staring at me rather than staring at the road. Sign number two, your energy attracts children and animals, which means they wish to spend all their time with you, which can be fucking annoying. The third one is people think you're friendly and approachable, and so they wish to spend time with you and they wish to talk to you. Even if you don't want them to, and if you're really lucky, they might even fall in love with you, and therefore you have to ring the police. The fourth one is your generally very funny, and you can use that wit and that sarcasm to break down barriers and form bridges with people, which can lead on to bigger and better things. And last but not least, you realise you're so beautiful, because you spend hours staring in the mirror and it takes you hours to get ready. They are the signs that you are a super attractive person. Welcome to the club.

 It's hardly surprise that we did so badly at your vision again. So that performance from Ollie Alexander, it was absolutely appalling. I mean it wasn't the worst of the night that surely has to go to Ireland, but somehow they did really well. Good news, I was at it, because it was awful. A bunch of screaming people, that is all it was. But Ollie Alexander's was just Guy Rotica, simple as that. And for a show that should be, including children, children should be able to watch it. It's a singing competition. That's it. So why has it always got to be who could be the most controversial? What, why is that? Why do people need to do that? I mean Ollie's was just a bunch of naked men, just thrusting and just shaking about. And he's singing with Shambolic. It was shaky, it was Paul, the Sam was awful, the song was crap anyway. So no wonder we got zero points from the wider public outside of the UK. No one guy, I have no problem seeing, you know, men dancing about. Don't fight with that. But why do you need to always, always, show it down people's throats? Why do you gay people always need to do that? Because it just makes us all look really, really shallow. You can enjoy that and that's fine, you can do that, that's fine. But why does someone like that have to represent the UK and a worldwide audience to what? I think there's a two hundred million people watch it every year. And it's no wonder we do so badly. The one year that the UK has done well in the last God knows how many years, is two years ago with Sam Rider. And why is that? Because we put art and talent above everything else. And we should have won. The only reason we didn't win was because everyone gave you crime, the sympathy vote. Since then, we've had a girl who hates the UK who can't sing. I kind of remember her name, but she was awful and no one's heard of her since. Now we've got Oli Alexander who's the week before said that the UK flag is controversial. You can't sing, who puts gay erotica in his performance and then wonders why he doesn't do well. He actually gets humiliated and probably now his singing career has gone down the pan if it had no end. Why can't we just get back to a time where art and singing talent and vocalisation was put at the top of the tree? That was more important than anything else. Why now is choreography and how someone is going to be so controversial and how controversial can I be? Why is that always put to the top? Singing these down here, how controversial can I be, is put up there for simply likes and attention. And it's just really, really embarrassing and it's no wonder the UK just shied every year with people as woke, as who are doing your revision for like LIKOLIA, Oli Alexander. It's no wonder that it's about people like that, everyone in the show, for the UK. So we're always going to do badly when you've got way for left is ruining it for everybody else.

 This is the one right here. And it was a while ago, but I was so mad. I was reaching to grab another planet and this new leaf, it was like tiny and just coming in. I didn't break it all the way off, but I definitely snapped like the tiniest little end off of it. And then as it grew, the affected area just got more and more visible and ugly. Of course, I leave it on because they can still photosynthesize. But since then, it's given me this leaf and this new one that's still hardening off. So honestly, it's fine. But no, I was so pissed at myself.

 And here is that same plan two months later. It's like immediately after I said this plant doesn't grow at all, it decided that it was going to pop off like this. Like there's so much new growth. So many new leaves coming in all over this plant. This is insane actually. I guess I just wanted to make me look like a fool.

 See, this is something that I actually struggled on for quite some time and then I realized that I was totally the problem For expecting this plant to not rip in the first place I mean they just come from really windy climates and they have these giant floppy leaves So the leaves come with these tearaway perforations. They're just already on there That's like the edges of like notebook paper so you can just like tear them away And it's not easy for those tears to open up because in windy climates If the leaves were able to rip they would just blow right off the plant and break off It's honestly just that those pieces of leaf are like just barely attached to each other and they're not meant to stay that way And one day I realized expecting my bird of paradise not to rip would be like expecting my monster at not to have holes

Video: @allos_scare_me_video_7372694923021258026-Scene-002.mp4
 This type of behavior is emotional abuse, literally. So this man was ranting and raving about how his son doesn't want to come see him, and he doesn't like to come over to his house. And people in the comments are, oh well, that's your father and he's your father, and you only get one dad, you only get one of me. Okay, I feel like parents do not take, I feel like parents do not take enough accountability when it comes to the emotions and feelings of their children. And him literally embarrassing his son and posting this video from thousands of people to see is emotional abuse. And for the record, if your child does not want anything to do with you, there has to be a reason why. There's absolutely nine times out of ten, there's no, if a child doesn't want anything to do with their parent, it is not for no reason. And he thought that posting this video and ranting about how his feelings are hurt because his son doesn't want to come over to his house, and he doesn't want to speak to him anymore, is making it worse. And I doubt, I feel like parents, they don't respect or treat their children like people when they're little, but the tables flip when they get older. And I feel like the relationship you had with your parents where you were going up or the way they treated you will really show as the kid gets older. Like, there's no reason for him to go online and embarrass his son like this. And parents wonder why their children go no contact with them, or their children don't want to speak to them in their adulthood. And no, we shouldn't just blindly respect people older than us just because of their parents or their family. That's not how that works. Parents take accountability, stop treating your kids like they aren't people. I promise you, I promise you the same way you treated them. They will give it right back to you. It's going to come right back around when they reach adulthood. Thank you.

 You know, I've watched quite a few of your videos during some research after seeing this video. And I just find it incredibly ironic that you are so against trans women when it's very clear that you want to be a black woman. Considering that you have made appropriating AAVE and the stereotypical personality of a black woman, your main personality, I find it ironic that you're coming after trans women when you're the fake one. You can sit there and you can clack your dumb fucking extenders and yap your fucking mouth and try to make friends with all the cis and hetero people who secretly hate you anyway. But the rest of us can clearly spot a pick me bitch when we say one. Hope this helps.

----------------------------------------

Video: @anarchyrising420_video_7365862837652065578-Scene-002.mp4
 So we have a bit of a unique perspective here because we actually escaped. We escaped a death cult when we were 19 or so. Called Jehovah's Witnesses. We were born into it, fifth generation. It's only really existed for five generations. So our family's been in it for as long as it's existed. And something just never really felt right with it. Which is easy to be the case with something like that. But it just like there was no real spirituality to it. It was just control and demand. And I would say tradition, but not even. Like there was no actual traditions to it. It was very strange. And I know it's not what most Christians experience. Although there are large swaths of Christians who do. So we ended up considering ourselves atheist from about 13 years old. For the most part, not 100%. We're a dissociative system. So some of us took a little longer than others to fully leave. But by the time we were 19, we were kicked out for being queer. And then we started learning about politics and the world around us more. Realized, of course, that we were queer and trans. We started learning. And we realized not only A, there is a huge evangelical movement in the United States. Which is responsible for a lot of the reasons that the world is getting worse right now. But other parts of the Christian community don't really call them out much. And the history of Christianity itself is rooted in colonialism and control. And when you get to the history of the Bible, you realize that it was created by the Septuagint. And which was a political body of political leaders from the time. Who ended up twisting the Bible so that it could mean anything that they wanted it to be many things to many people. But the one thing that no matter what it had in common was that it told you to listen unquestioningly to those who claim to be the leaders of the church. And it really is the heart of Christianity. It's not like the spirituality you find in other faiths. And I can say that because we've since found a really rich spirituality in in painism, specifically in Hellenism and heathenry and meeting the gods and connecting with them and feeling cold to them and feeling genuinely like they're communicating with us is it's not something we'd ever experienced before. Even when we tried to reach out to the Christian God in ways that weren't related to the witnesses, even when we've talked to other Christians and they've described their experience and stuff. It's just quite frankly it's a it's it's a dead as far as I'm concerned. Wisted religion. And people are realizing that like I'm not the only one who understands the Christianity is a high controlled religion with roots in colonialism and white supremacy. I'm not it's it's really hard to make that desirable to people when we start realizing that and it should be hard to make that desirable because it's awful. The only people that that appeals to is people who are willing to be controlled willing to turn their brains off and people who like the white supremacy and colonialism. So no it's not it's not really going to appeal to most people. So the church is dying and may it die soon.

----------------------------------------

Video: @anarchyrising420_video_7367802565704109354-Scene-002.mp4
 It's definitely really hard to keep track of everything, all of the information out there. We spend like 16, 18 hours a day staring into the void of news and it's hard for us to keep track of everything that's happening. But let me try and use the 10 minutes here, hopefully less, to help explain. First in Palestine with Israel, Israel actually invaded and began taking over the land of Palestine back in 1948 with the assistance of the UK, the US and a bunch of other European countries. The day that that happened is remembered on actually May 15th, which is coming up here, and it's called the Nakba and a KBA, I'm pretty sure it might be a queue. Anyway, so point is, this has been going on since then. Ethnic cleansing, genocide, mass displacements, everything you can imagine. There's now CNN has articles out showing that there are in fact concentration camps designed specifically, not like the work camps or the death camps that the Nazis had, this is a torture camp. This is just holding Palestinians and torturing them until they die. I'm not laughing out of humor. It's so, it's so nuts. Anyway, so that's happening, what's been happening since October 7th is just the most recent escalation and because of TikTok and the internet now, it ended up becoming what is being called the first live streamed genocide, which is unfortunately accurate, but it's gotten a lot of people aware of what's going on. And so the block list thing actually happened because of the Met Gala a few days ago, a week ago, something like that at this point. Anyway, so the just mass disparity between people scrolling and seeing the obscene wealth on display at the Met Gala and then seeing all of the horrors coming out of not only Palestine, but there's also the Congo, which is genocide and ethnic cleansing campaign based mostly in slavery, specifically trying to mine cobalt. And I know there's another medal that I cannot think of the name of right now, both of which, however, are integral in making electronics, like the iPhones and Apple products that come out every year and like vapes and if it's got batteries in it, and it's an electronic type it's probably harming the people of Congo and incentivizing the slavery and the genocide is happening there. There's also stuff happening in Sudan, which I'm going to be honest, I don't know much about, I really wish I did. I can't do much education there. I just know that there's a lot of people saying that there's like 800,000 people, I think, that are trapped in this one city that is being attacked and also there's not food and aid getting in there because of the people in control of this city. Again, I don't know much about it. I just know it's a horrific situation. I'm currently trying to learn more about that. So there's also, there's stuff going on in Puerto Rico. There's issues with, there's targets on the backs of trans people and queer people around the world. And so like all of this happening, people are unable to make rent and unable to pay for food and stuff, even here in America, which is supposedly the richest nation in the world. And so all of these things happening together and people seeing them and scrolling one by one past these horrors and atrocities and people screaming for help interspersed with let them eat cake, right? Interspersed with the copulence of the Met Gala is just such a display of the disparities in our world that people really just said, fuck the bread, fuck the circuses, we're taking our life back. This is unacceptable now. There's already been the massive wave of unionization. People have been really organizing. There's been the BLM protests that happened, you know, that have been happening since 2015, but especially kicked off in 2020 when everybody was staring into our phones because of COVID and people got out in the streets and more people than ever were prudalized by the police because they went out to say, hey, maybe stop murdering people, right? Like, and so all of this stuff is happening and quite frankly, everybody's fucking sick of it and we're taking our, we're taking our life and we're taking our society back. And so the block lists and the abandoning digital cards and the protests that were started by the students at Columbia and have been led by students. I mean, all of this stuff, each one separately is kind of targeting a different problem to some degree, but it's also, it's all completely interconnected. There is no way to take what's happening to black people here in America and separate it from what's happening in Palestine or the Congo or Sudan because the police and the military here in America is training and funding the actions that are happening over there, right? NYPD and the LAPD both have offices in Israel. In fact, the NYPD has offices all over the world. Supposedly, one city's police department, but offices all over the world training doing combat scenarios with the fucking IOF, like generally known as the IDF, like these are all completely interconnected. There's the stop cop city movement because there's what are called cop cities that are popping up, where they are trying to build these massive prison and military, but police training facilities, right? Like these are essentially military bases, but for police, right? And people are realizing that the police are an occupying force and like all of these things are coming into play and the blacklist is definitely a very small part of that, but also capitalism is not the sole factor, but it is one of the major factors that all of these issues are resting on. And so if whether people realize it or not, these blacklist are intended to attack capitalism as one of the primary sources of people's misery. And so it's really, it's this mass movement, but all of these little pieces, like separate from each other seem confusing. They don't necessarily seem like they go together unless you do start seeing that big picture, which is a lot more than I can help anybody learn in 10 minutes, but hopefully this was a good explanation, at least like an intro video, to help get people just kind of caught up understanding where we're at and where we're going from here. From here, we're going to we're going to fuck shit up and take our life back all of us together. We're going to build a better society where all of us can have what we need and want and you know, it's not going to be a utopia, but why can't we fucking try? Why not? We can. If we get these greedy, rich, powerful fucks out of our way, because no matter how much power, no matter how much money they have, there is no power like the power of the people. The power of the people don't stop.

 The line can't seem to decide on whether or not women fetishizing gay men is a bad thing.
----------------------------------------

Video: @anoddfellow3_video_7364940912771812638-Scene-002.mp4
 So I am a gay man and I have a lot of things to say about this whole fudoshi situation. So for those of you who don't know, the term fudoshi is Japanese in origin. It originates off of this Japanese forum website called two-channel. Fudoshi itself is a pun on a Japanese term for a proper woman and it instead means rotten woman. And this is rotten in the sense of like the classical definition of rotten, like decayed, spoiled, stuff like that. And this was a term used largely by men to refer to women in fandom spaces. Who are typically do things that they didn't like, such as, you know, shipping characters in general or whatever else. But notably it was not a term that exclusively referred to women who enjoyed the a boy's love genre. And the reason that these women were called rotten specifically was because in Japanese society, there is a expectation that in a woman's life at some point she will leave behind the things of the things of her childhood and such. And you know, begin to focus on adult life and being, and like being the mother of the family. And these women were called rotten because they had spoiled themselves by either making themselves quotes around this by making themselves undesirable to men or by, or in the case of ones who were married shaming their families and husbands and such. And so this term was eventually reclaimed by women in these fandom spaces. Like, oh, you're saying that I'm rotten. Well, all Bias rotten as I want to be. And they began self identifying as Fujioshi. And so what people in Western spaces have done is take a derogatory term that was reclaimed by the people it was used against and using it as a derogatory term again. So a lot of people are using the language of gay liberation to be misogynistic because Fujioshi began as a misogynistic term. And frankly, which of these sounds more homophobic to you? Is it A, there are women who consume media about gay men and like it? Or B, gay men are endangered and need to be protected from the scariest straight women. Like one of those sounds far more homophobic to me than the other. Additionally, to ignore the effect that the anti-Fudoshi movement, I guess you'd say, has had on gay trans men would be at best naive and at worst outright malicious. Like the amount of people who will say, oh, these are just straight women pretending to be gay men to infiltrate gay male spaces to get with gay men because they fetishize them. Like, if you switch the genders around the night, that's basically just classic trans folk rhetoric. Like, there really is no way around it. And that's not to say that all anti-Fudoshi people are transphobes. There are definitely transphobic people, mostly TERFs, who will peddle this narrative of straight women attempting to fetishize gay men. And then there are people who otherwise would not hold a lot of transphobic views hearing that and thinking, oh, I don't like gay men being fetishized. So I'm also against Fudoshi's and just agreeing that without any agreeing with it at face value. So the ultimate takeaway to this is that whenever you hear about a group of people, do your own research, like look into them from sources that are notistic cock videos. Yeah.

I've been on this planet for 42 and a half years in June, and in my experience, there are people who will defend you, who walk through fire for you, as much as you will stand up and defend and walk through fire for yourself. For me, that is my little sister. I was tormented and bullied all the way through high school. And she defended and stood up for me as much as I defended and stood up for myself. If that more sometimes, so it's unfortunate because you had not met those people yet, they do exist. Trust me, they do exist.

 The whole thing in this guy's tirade, they're so boring and tiresome is someone repeatedly telling a marginalized person about their oppression and self-defining themselves is not that kind of thicket. I'm not a racist, I'm not a homophobe, I'm not a transphobe. Mate, you don't get to decide that for yourself. But all I'm gonna know why a gay man is literally sitting here telling you, you're being homophobic and your response is nuh-uh, nobody knows oppression more than the community that's oppressed. I don't tell black people but I'm not racist if they say that I'm being racist because they know what racism is more than I will ever know as a white presenting person. And if somebody says that to me, it's a moment of reflection not defense. Because the reality of life is that we're born into the systems of oppression. And if we're not in that oppressed group then times when we're called out by those oppressed communities, it's a time for reflection. It's not an attack on your personhood. It's not an attack on you personally. It's like I can admit that there is unpacking of my own racism. I was born into it. It's not my fault. It becomes my fault when I don't want to do the work, when I don't want to unpack stuff. And that's what this person's doing. It's so tiring, man. Just don't take it as a personal attack. Understand the dynamics of the society that you were born into and unpack it. Then you become an ally. Then you're not being homophobic. Listen.

 The closest thing to intercourse to heterosexual males will have is physical combat. Maybe think about all those dudes in high school parties that just wanted to get drunk and fight people. And wonder how many have then moved to Atlanta or on the DL now? Or intentionally went to jail. Imagine if we were allowed to hug each other when we fell down or cry and given a proper dictionary to express our emotions. I actually think men have the ability to be more emotionally articulate than a lot of women, but you know, we weren't given the proper toolbox for that. What do I know? Happy Friday.

 I just have a few questions that I just want to say, like get off my chest. First of all, what's wrong with you? That kid is just enjoying himself, like, per, just put on his makeup, making himself look all great and all that kind of stuff? That's fine. Second of all, is it? Do you find any sort of like satisfaction with being homophobic? What's your end goal with that? And third of all, how do you feel if someone made fun of the way that you live your life? Huh? How about that for a change? How would you feel if someone made fun of you and the way you live your life? He's a kid. He's a kid. Let him live his life. He can be part of the LGBTQ plus. No problem. There's nothing wrong with that community. That you just let him live his life. Is it that hard? Like the comments, right? The comments offered to that video, right? Are not helping. They're not anywhere near as better. They're even still making fun of that person as well. Like they're saying stuff like, oh, I just wish I was born in the 80s so that this whole stuff wasn't allowed. It's horrible, man. Just let the kid just live his life. Yeah.

 Actually, Brandon, no, they're not. The church are those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, not LGBT people because you say that they're already the church. The people that are already the church are those who have placed faith in Jesus. Those are the only people that are part of the church. You see, the church isn't this inclusive thing that anyone and everyone is already part of the church. Now, anyone and everyone can go and be part of the church through Jesus Christ, but it's not by their own doing. It's through Christ's doing. Let us remember that. Let us not forget that. It's through Christ, not through ourselves, not through our works. Now, LGBT people can come onto the faith, but they are not already part of the church, like you said.

Although there's been a lot of black women who have accepted me and left me of course on the other side of the coin Liam a amount of homophobia that comes from black women specifically it's shocking Now this doesn't make my love for black women any less obviously I love you But I'm just so happy that I've seen another person talking about this because we need to fix this problem

 What is a friendship lesson that you've had to learn the hard way as an adult?
----------------------------------------

Video: @bearbie.tv_video_7374218732001856811-Scene-002.mp4
 Number one, stop putting your expectations of what you would do or how you would handle a situation on to other people. They would disappoint you every time. I'm sorry to say it, but they will your best friends. The new friends you make, the old friends you've had, they will all disappoint you if you continue to put your expectations of what you would do in the situation or what you would do for someone on to someone else. You need to vocalize those things. You just cannot assume. Like trust but verify. You can trust that your friend will be there for you with things and will do what they need for you or support showing the ways that you're looking to be supported. But trust that they will do it but verify that they will make sure you know what I'm saying. Put them in like a little situation where you can test that but don't put them in a string you with situation. Don't be down bad. You need a friend. You ain't never rely on this friend for nothing and then now you want to rely on them for everything because that will never work. rely on them for something very little. We're relying on them for like a conversation about you know, a boy or girl, however you want to do that. I don't know. Figure out a way to test that they would be there to support you because baby again. So you just automatically put expectations on people to be something or do something that you need without verifying that they're able in a quip to do those things. You will be very upset. Also making new friends is an adult is very tough and very hard. Do not expect it to be easy. You have to remember when we were back in high school and when we were in school and we were doing things like that like we had to be around certain people every day. Every day whether we went to the same classes or not we still were at the same school building from 8 to 2 or 7 to 2 30. However y'all did it. We were there. That entire day, you know what I'm saying for that seven eight hours or even six to eight whatever it was we was there for that. You know what I'm saying. You don't have that in real life. You know what I'm saying. There's not a there's not a constant being around each other five days a week to where your lives kind of intertwine. You'll remember that someone is living their own life especially as an adult. So when you make a new friendship with them. You can't expect them to be like, oh, this will be my best friend. They're gonna be there for everything for me every time I need them. They're gonna be there. They're gonna drop everything they need because that's not gonna happen. You're putting again unrealistic expectations out there for people and you're gonna set yourself up for failure because you know about expect these people to be there for you. When you need them at y'all back in call and they're gonna disappoint you because again they're a grown adult. They might have a family they might even have relationships that they're dealing with problems they're dealing with. You're just again when you're making a new friend you're stepping into their life. Don't try to take the man over their life because you're stepping into it. You need to find out where you fit in not force them to be something that they might not be able to. My last rule for y'all is just be as genuine as you possibly can. If you are always being yourself you will attract great people or you will attract like minded people. If you're putting out a front or if you're trying to play a part it will never work out for you because you can only play a part for so long babe. Like after that part and that role has been filled and you are done with it you are gonna try to switch it up and when you try to switch it up to be who you really are not who you portray to be there will be a problem in the relationship the friendship whatever it is like just don't do it just be yourself be genuine again we're all grown we're all adults. We know how to this is for me and this ain't for me and if you aren't for somebody don't turn yourself into something that you think they want just so you can fit it will make you stress and we are to have enough to do things to deal with being a dot so like again. Stop trying to push yourself into that mold if you don't fit move on babe there is so many other people in this world I promise you you will meet great people just go out there and be willing to meet them to another thing be open be open to willing. will need more people you know I'm saying like don't shut yourself off or just but oh this is the only crowd people that I like to talk to are the only crowd people that I like to entertain. entertain more people outside of your friend group especially if you are like experiencing problems are continuously going the same cycles with your old friends like. competing the same habits and expecting different results baby is the definition of insanity so stop being in saying with these other maniacs okay love y'all.

 Hey Ryan, I'm a trans woman who uses the women's restroom because... Oh, I also have a vagina. What other restroom am I gonna use? See, let's say you have to be with you and you went into the women's restroom. I personally would not care. First of all, also, if you and your niece walked past me... You're not talking about TV and children really never really talk to TV. So you can just say that you don't feel comfortable and we don't really care if you feel comfortable quite frankly. It's the restroom. You're gonna be in the restroom for about 30, 45 seconds, maybe a minute. Maybe a couple minutes if you have to poop. But we never really have conversations in the restroom, right? What's the last time you had a conversation with someone in a public restroom? Besides, at a club. Oh wait. Okay, exactly. We can move on. Also, I just don't know why you trying to kiss these people's asses with these ideals. You know if they think negatively about trans people, they're gonna come for you too, babe. You're not safe. Love that neighbor. Please.

 Alright, her question is whether or not she's allowed to lie about being a lesbian in order to win argument with a man who's bothering her. Now I'm not a member of the Council, I am, however, an active member of a subcommittee, the Chapstick Quiers. There's like three of us there. And I say yes, absolutely. You can lie about anything to win an argument with a man who's annoying you. Make up facts. That's what he's going to do.

 Can any of my alphabet homies rationally explain to me why you would voluntarily spend your hard-earned money to vacation in a country where your very existence is illegal? Not only that, you are there as a tourist spending your hard-earned money and supporting the economy of a country that hates you so much That they would literally arrest you for nothing more than your sexual orientation. I mean this may be extreme But I feel like that's the equivalent of a black man showing up to a clan rally and dropping a few dollars in their collection plate as they pass it around I don't know how clan rallies work, but I just assume that they're like church Don't have to travel abroad to financially support the people that hate you I'm sure you have some wonderful local hate organizations that would be happy to take your hard-earned money Listen, if you two gentlemen would like to continue financially supporting people that hate you You'll be happy to know that I am now collecting donations on behalf of the Westboro Baptist Church I'll put my cash out down in the bottom and just rest assured that every penny will make it to them Now you don't have to give a lot just whatever you think is fair to the people that hate you and despise you so much that they want you dead

 Maybe they're attracted to these men for their personalities, or maybe they're just attracted to physical body types that are Not conventionally attractive. It's not that complicated. Also these women are people and these men are also people and people are allowed to Be attracted to and date whoever they want. I I Don't see what the problem is who exactly is it that you think these perfect amazing gorgeous beautiful women should be dating Instead of their boyfriends to whom you cannot understand the attraction Because I think the answer to that question Genuinely says more about the situation than anything to do with the men

 You are 100% right and I'm going to go ahead and provide an example.
----------------------------------------

Video: @billynomates.1988_video_7365139484029029665-Scene-002.mp4
 You know, for some of you claim to be a marketing, you are really not selling this. I mean, comparing your example where you said there was a child-free bar, really? I live in UK and there are various pubs and bars. And most of the time, if you want to take a children's own way, take them to the pub because there are child-friendly, family-friendly pubs. If you say bar, people will automatically assume it's a nightclub and children should not be there, so automatically bars are child-free. But anyway, yes, there are some bars and pubs that are child-free and some are not. And it's usually due to safety and licensing. I mean, I'm a local weather spoons. We, they are family-friendly, but children have to be in designated areas where the bar area is. Only people eating it over can approach the bar. Is that offensive? No. That's being safe. And it's complaining about the, you know, dog-friendly. What's wrong with her and the dog-friendly place? Because a lot of people tell the dogs I have to walk and, you know, they want to sit down, have a drink, and there aren't many dog-friendly places. I mean, where I live, there are a lot of dog-friendly places because there are a lot of dog owners, so they see, you know, we'll have to have a friend leave or customers to come and, you know, buy our products. What's saying, oh, is that saying child-free? How about to say you have no children? This is the exact same thing. I mean, you even try to say debt-free was bad because it's not utilizing your money. What being debt-free is actually a really good thing because it shows that you have managed to scream for save and buy it outright instead of actually owning, oh, we, oh, we money to someone else. I mean, are you going to say that dairy-free is bad? Hands-free is bad? Are you? Because it's just a load of rubbish, really. Because at the end of the day, the only time I've heard child-free used, you know, an offensive way is when people have kids try and shove down other people's throats that they should have kids when they either don't want to have kids or do two medical reasons they can have kids, and they're shoving all these kids going, oh, look, they're so great in the face. I'm a parent. I would never shove the idea of other people having kids because it is a massive, massive decision, but yes, those get you in debt. And at the end of the day, if you're taking a fence, that's someone who is child-free, I'm sorry, but that is really a huge problem right now. And as I said, as a parent, I don't find the term child-free offensive at all.

----------------------------------------

Video: @billynomates.1988_video_7368257091833810209-Scene-002.mp4
 It's actually really interesting about how people are finally realizing that Dr. Huiz woke and they think it's only just begun with Jody Whiska. Well, as said in the other video, it's been going on a bit longer than that. I mean, I should start at the beginning of Dr. Huiz. I mean, they give some really good examples. The Meep Pro now thing though, where the Meep goes, I just go back to the Meep. I should call back to Tom Baker, who basically used the doctor as well. All the Meep said is what Tom Baker said in one doctor who observed. And if you go into a Sarah Jena Avengers where Matt Smith did a crossover, Clyde asked him, you know, if you can regenerate and look like anything, could you also be black? And he said, yes, and now we have it, Judy Getwar. Though that's not the first time it happened because Peter Capaldi caused another time or two generations to generate and he went from a white old man to a young black woman. But there just is, time lords are literally gender benders. They can change their gender with every generation, wherever they please. I mean, it would, if regenerations only brought up because we've had an uncle and continue with the series due to his health, but it's brilliant how there's really, there's no gender in the time lord world because they can be man, they can be woman, they can not binary, they go whatever they want. They can chase their parents, they can be white, black, they can be Chinese, they can be Japanese, they can be Korean, they can be Russian, etc. It's just a regeneration. And yet they think now it's gone woke. I mean, that's like people watching Star Trek and thinking it's just now gone woke when it's been woke since it first began. I mean, you do realize that a lot of sci-fi's are woke. I mean, there's Andromeda until the later series where it went really, really wrong, there's Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis, Star Wars, X-Men. You name it, it's woke. It always has been, always will be. And there's nothing wrong with that. So love it, I hate it. It's head to stay.

Video: @billynomates.1988_video_7372435431864028448-Scene-002.mp4
 I'd rather talk about, well, this course, is the clacking coming from your nails or the cogs in your head or both? I mean, as a nice straight man, I love nails as much as an expert in but I don't really understand how that length works or that stuff you have on it, but that's just me. I prefer shorter ones. Also that joke you put on your bias in your comedian, that's been done to death mate. If he actually does response to this, he's probably going to say, what's wrong with my nails and they're just like my thing. I mean, that's my soul. The guy tried those nails, he went to the toilet, wiped himself and screamed. Oh, we have it because he scratched himself. But let's get back to the subject. You seem to have nothing about the top pick. You don't seem to have anything about public bathrooms. I mean, public bathrooms are really that safe. And there won't be blue lights in my local toilets stopping people from, you know, you would know that women are most likely to be harmed by people they actually know personally. Allowing trans women into women spaces does not give them a free pass to commit a crime. Also, there have been plenty of articles released lately of cis women committing horrendous crimes more than trans women. But I don't see you on your pay saying we need to stop cis women accessing women spaces. So we can save little girls. I mean, if we put the same energy that haters like you have towards the trans community against cis men and women who harm children, we'd have that problem solved very, very quickly. But no, for such a strange reason, it's all the trans community's fault that these crimes happen when 10, 20, 30 years ago, it was blamed on people who were lesbian gays by sexuals. They wouldn't want them in the bathroom because kids should be near that the dangerous folk seriously. No. Most of those crimes are committed by cis straight men. So how about you just, I don't know, stay some facts or stay in your lane.

 My guy I fear you're lost in the sauce. So let me try to help before you put your foot further in your mouth. You seem to be confusing descriptive and prescriptive notions of our society. Things that are descriptive are factually grounded and based in reality. Prescriptive describes what should be done. So descriptive refers to what is demonstrably true, and prescriptive refers to what ought to be. And according to data, what we descriptively know to be true about fraternities is, those associated with Greek life are at a higher risk of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Fraternity men have higher stereotypical gender attitudes than non-faternity men and sorority women. Fraternity men had higher rates of rape myth acceptance. And that fraternities are nexus of sexual violence on campuses. And being a male athlete or fraternity member is possibly associated with homophobic and transphobic attitudes. These are things that descriptively we know to be true. No one is saying that it should be that way, that it should be prescriptive. People are simply acknowledging that it is true. And thus, your identities are relevant as you exist in spaces and interact with fraternities. We know that men prefer to listen to women, that they disregard women's contributions, and they quite literally listen differently. Never mind that most fraternities were founded quite literally when pretty much only white men could go to college, and that they were socially exclusive groups on top of that. Descriptively, we know that social identities affect how different people interact with different groups of people. That's not a moral failing. That's not indictment of you or your friends specifically. We are just aware that your positionality is conducive to frat culture, whereas other groups are not and recognize that. People from ajouritarian groups take white or male or cisgender or heterosexual as negatives. When usually, we're just using them as markers of social interactions.

 Alright, we're going to have an etymology line. The prefix by means both or two, like, think bicycle with two wheels. Now, if you consider that injunction with the prefix homo and the prefix hetero, homo meaning the same and hetero meaning different, you're essentially, you know, by would essentially mean people that are alike and unlike you speaking probably about gender, considering sexuality. Now, if you consider pan pan means all, so pan sexual would mean you're attracted to all people of all genders. The difference between that is by would mean like and unlike, so people with a similar or the same gender and people with different genders, but it does not necessarily mean every other gender. This sort of funky etymology is how you get your heme lesbians, by the way.

None of which I would have gotten had it not been for you guys. If it had not been for the random kindness of strangers on the internet, I would not have gotten to this place where I am the most fulfilled that I have ever been in my entire life. And I will lie, it's still a struggle. I still live paycheck to paycheck. I'm still a teacher, so it's not like I'm living like Larry or anything. But the struggle is worth it because I'm doing something that I love. I'm living my dream. And if random acts of kindness can help one singular black queer educator get to hear, imagine what it could do for a family of 40, and it's struggling to access food, water, diapers, baby formula, and other basic necessities. The kindness of strangers on the internet saved my life, and that is so much more literal than you think it is. How many more lives could it save?

 Western values are not going to follow Western bombs.
----------------------------------------

Video: @bloodyrony_video_7369563576161357088-Scene-002.mp4
 Also, I'm not sure today as a... Hi, hi, hi, hi! I'm really happy about everything you said, everything. Every point that you said was perfect. But I would like to just focus on exactly that sentence, whether it's where you say that Western ideologies are not going to come with Western bombs. But this is exactly place in the agenda that people like to hear that being queer is actually Western ideology, but it's not Western ideology. I am Arab. I am queer. We exist. We've always existed. And on a second note, I would like to remind everybody that all the homophobic law that came at least to my area and the one I read in, in West Asia, North Africa came with colonisation. And let me tell you about how it happened in Egypt. Okay, so I'm not going to really mention dates because I'm not really good at remembering dates, but this is exactly what happened. British colonisers were there, British soldiers were in Egypt. Egypt was colonised by the British for at least 80 years. And without, of course, adding up all the revolting against them, whatever we did again. But guess who was really, really, really working against the British? Sex workers in Egypt. And a small tiny influence, sex worker in Egypt, has never been illegal. Since ancient Egypt, there has been sex workers in Egypt, legally working part of the society, and it's a with respect to respectful job. Till the British came. And of course, they started working against the British. So, what did the British do? They went to street called Hayel as the K.N. Basically they burned the entire street. So according to some books, I think I read, but most of these books are in Arabic, so I don't know how to bring them here. But some books actually mention that they even went inside every single house and they threw all their, all of their cupboards, all of their wooden items, their furniture, all of their stuff, they threw it from top of the buildings, and they burned the entire street. And that's when they put one of the laws that now are taking home of, most of them, most of the people, almost of the gay or the LGBT community in Egypt. This law was basically that you cannot do anything against morality. This word doesn't even exist in Islam. This thing of like against nature, against morality, it absolutely does not exist in Islam. So, this is not Western ideology. So basically the first law, one of the first laws that were put in Egypt against the country, was put by the British to control sex workers. And that's it. Another case was also Lebanon by the French, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, by the French, Ghana, by the British. So we cannot ever say, we can never say, there's the Western ideology. It's as strong as just plays exactly for their agenda, for these homophores, these these homophobic people that they have always been always being a king there. A homophore became the killed everybody in the world, and they killed all the queers and all the gays. But I would like to also introduce you to an Iraqi researcher. His name is Mulsar Shadditi, and he's being attacked massively in this country, and Iraq. But he actually talked to me about the connection between the insane homophore that's happened in Iraq, and the connection with the American invasion. So basically after, I don't know if you know this or not, but Abu Ghirib, it's not incident. Torture accident that the, when the American soldiers basically started torturing Iraqi prisoners and, and they're, I don't know, dungeons and undergrounds or whatever, and the pictures emerged and all of us in the Middle East with all of us, we have seen all of us, have seen that my dad saw that and we were even using CDs to see these stuff because what did the Americans have, what look what if the Americans have done to us? The problem with this is, Mulsar Shadditi mentions this in his book, Ruguwa and Mostama El-Saba, which is basically a dirty turn of the colonized search, it's young, but he basically mentions how an act of love between two people, man, man, woman, woman, or non-binary people or whatever the gender was. These two acts used to be for love between people, till the American army came and they used to humiliate them. They used to significantly use sexual activities that could be, and could be consensual, and between lovers, to humiliate the men or to humiliate the population. And then you have an explosion of homophobia in the area. This is what happens. On a second thought, also, there's another book, remember the author's name, but it's called Ishtihhella, which basically meaning, fittishism of the Arabs, and it's talk about the entire history of how Europe just to perceive the Arabs and how they basically put a microscope on our sexuality and how we're doing things and don't get me wrong. Fucking Arabs were having so much fun, sex parties, gayness, queerness, and this is not Western ideologies. And we can ask the Ottoman Empire, the al-Kelifat, the Abbasid Empire, the Fatima Third Empire, all of them, we have existed in the Islamic nation in the big Islamic Uma, till colonialism and Europe started to come to us. Till the Western Christian ideology started to hitting us. Also, the last thing that I would mention in the book is to head out, which is the Fittishism of Arabs. It talks about how Western's Westerners or white people, when they came to Turkey, or they came to the Islamic Uma, and they saw all these sexual activities. They shamed us, they shamed us for it, and they called the Arabs the people that do saw to me. This is basically how they identified Arabs, are the people that you have in of sex. Because when one of the books actually they said, they were very relieved to find one share, one big king in the Islamic era that actually liked women. And they were very surprised because he was one and a kind for them. And it was how, finally, they found one that was decent like them. They shamed us for our sexual activities, and then they took it away from us, and then they categorized it, and then they started to say, let's be inclusive. This is what happened in our history. The last thing I would say is if you, if me, or Musa, shouldy-dee, what we've been trying to do for the lessons I came to France, basically look for my queer and her art, for my queer Islamic art, and guess where it is. It's in the Louvre, not your polyton. And Italy, I cannot have access to it. I do not have access to it. Musa, shouldy-dee, at the beginning of this book, we'll go on most cameras about, and if you want to take a send it to you, and we'll be trying to translate this book so many times, but these are a lot of funds. Of course, it doesn't play perfectly for the Western agenda. So at the beginning of his book, he writes a whole big paragraph about how many museums he thinks, for allowing him to take a look at our art, a him as a researcher, and basically he's saying, absolutely no thanks to the Louvre, or I think it's another British museum that refused to give him access, and they put all of the queer art in the fucking, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the closet, where I don't know what do you call it. Yeah, they can, in their storage. So basically not even people that can go there can see. I cannot find my queer art. I cannot find my queer Islamic art. I cannot find my queer african art, because it's still in the houses of Western elites, and it's not a Western ideology. It would have existed in an entire, throughout the entire history of time, and the last thing I do not feel as a part of the LGBT community anymore, and I prefer saying queer, because all I saw after the 7th of October, and all of these Western medias that have been talking about, my identity, and playing with my identity, he justified the killing and the genocide of the people. I don't feel like I belong to the LGBT community anymore. Not these Western ideals, not these Western ideologies. Last thing, funny story. The word, so half, which is basically what lesbians do, an Arab, it's called so half, which basically means grinding. The Islamic scholar that went to Egypt, he found women doing something very bizarre, and he wrote about it. And this is what all these Arab or Muslim researchers have been doing. Some of them are not even Arab, they were just Muslim. Some of them were Iranian, some of them were from India, some of them were from all over the Islamic Umm. If you try to find any of these books, you will find them marked as a radical google. You will find that you can hear the really access them, you can even see them. All of these were researches that were done by muslim scholars, all over the Islamic Ummah, all over the Islamic times. And...

 Can anybody provide examples of this? I'm just really confused about how straight people are hurting the conversation and what issues we are failing at. I feel like as a straight person, myself, I just don't get it. I always talk about straight women too. Are we talking about, like, doubt that's going to be something that you'll bring up as a problem? I just don't understand. It just, like, I would love examples. Like, please tell me something that's straight people are hurting and how we can better engage in the conversations. But, like, as far as I know, I haven't seen anything that's, like, super outrageous or at least nothing has been brought to my attention. So let me know.

 You know what? I'm starting to think that all this transphobic rhetoric that you constantly spew online to try to get attention from liberals and conservatives alike, roots from the fact that you probably got rejected by a trans woman in the past, and you couldn't build a bridge and get over it.

 When I started asking myself that same exact question, that was when I started to not take the Black Lives Matter movement seriously. Because statistically, we kill our own people more than white people. And when I started seeing those statistics, I just started to wake the fuck up. Black people, when you start holding our community accountable. Okay, we sometimes are our own enemies. Like for a week, we be sabotaging ourselves. Because you're right, when some white cop kills us, there's protests, and one to put this guy in jail, put him under the jail, throw the key away. But when we kill each other, crickets in the media.

 Personally, I don't have a problem with what they're doing over there in Peru, and I also feel that other trans individuals shouldn't see this as a problem either and let me explain. For one, here in America, when you go to the doctors to try to get on testosterone or estrogen, they are going to put you into mental disorder or mental illness category in order to basically make it medically necessary for you to transition. Because in the past, with other trans individuals fighting for our rights, they made it to where in the medical field, they see it as medically necessary to transition because it is classified as a mental disorder or mental illness. It is why I'm able to be who I am right now and is why other trans individuals themselves that choose to go through medical transition also are able to be who they are. Because the insurance does not see it as an elective anymore, they see it as a basically a necessity. So if you take away the fact that we are not mentally ill or have a disorder, then of course the insurance is going to feel the need to cover it. And I don't know about you, but I like much of testosterone being about 40 bucks every six months. That is cheap. And I'm blessed and privileged enough that insurance does cover a big portion of it because without that, it would be really expensive. The reason why activists have a problem with basically calling trans people mentally ill or having a disorder is because it is stigmatized in our society to have any of those things. And really in actuality, the activists that are against this are actually confirming making it seem like it's a negative thing to have a mental disorder or a mental illness. They actually took the time to normalize mental disorders and mental illnesses instead of trying to be say like, well, it's wrong to call it mentally mentally ill or is transphobic to call mentally ill, then they will make more progress. Look, it's not transphobic to say that someone like me has a disorder or mental illness. It is, I was not born in the wrong body. Okay, that is the reality. There was nothing wrong with how it was born. I wasn't born in her sex, nothing like that. My brain just does not align with my body. That doesn't mean I was born in the wrong body. That means I have a mental illness and mental disorder. There's nothing wrong with saying that. I don't feel crazy. I don't feel like I shouldn't be taking seriously or anything like that. I just needed help and I have that through the means of insurance, making it easier from it to access my medicine. And the more that we push reality into this, the more we're going to be taking seriously as a community. That's what I need to realize.

Yeah, that did not last long and Governor Ron DeSantis was essentially baying for them to come back because he understood or he fucked around and found out the importance of truck drivers.

 How is it that women and gay men can come out and accuse somebody of something and just say they did something, say a man did something and everyone believes it with no proof? Why is it that these gay men and trans and stuff keep coming out saying what straight men are doing with no proof? And then you go back and you go and you watch soldier boys response to this. There's a bunch of women in the comments saying yeah he did it, he did it because he not mad enough. Okay, so if he was mad and screaming, you all would have said yeah, he did it because he mad. So he came in for losing, but I find it odd. Are y'all love to criticize black men being gay or down low? When there's no gay person on planet earth and black women, none. Y'all are openly proud gay and there's no backlash or anything from y'all doing that. But if it's some straight men that's apparently gay, oh he's the worst thing in the world. How does this make sense? Seriously.

 So for contact I'm 33 and I came out when I was 22 and I just remember when I came out I felt like I was so like I consider myself a labor at the time and now like 10 years on looking back at it I don't know why I was so self-conscious about coming out at 22 like literally nobody cared and it was literally just me telling myself that I was coming out So Lee and I'm gonna be honest I don't know if this is a common experience for people But I feel like unless you came out in your teens at any point that you come out You feel like you have all these misdears and you're like why didn't I come out sooner? For me, I grew up in a really religious household so I just I didn't really have like the permission mentally to take a look at myself until I actually moved out of my parents' house I actually had to leave at their house while I was in college So I kind of just kept on pushing that part of myself down until I finally got my own place And I've self-reflective on this like so much since I've come out like over the past decade and I really don't think that I could have come out sooner Like I don't think I was in the mental place that I could actually do not and I wasn't in an environment where I felt good to do that I think it's so easy to forget how much the world has changed and even like the past decade like Just looking back when I came out gay marriage wasn't even legal in the US And the time I grew up in was obviously a lot more gay friendly than like the 90s or the 80s or any time before But it still wasn't friendly and I actually feel like it's detrimental to your mental health to your Furdier self as late blooming or anything like that like whenever you finally felt safe enough to do self-reflection That was the right time for you to do it and Just looking back when I was 22 and I was like really self-conscious about coming out late Nobody gave a shit. The age that I came out and to be honest I was single now and I was dating and when I give a shit when somebody came out either I'm just happy that you finally are Out I do think that people younger than me come out sooner than I ever did But I think it's because we live in a very different time and play as compared to even like 10 years ago So people who are later blooming coming out now, it's finally a safe environment to come out and to be honest Where I suppose I should say it's safe for now like I feel like there's so much positive representation within media At least like if I were growing up now, I would have felt So much more normal Self-reflecting on these feelings that I had always had But depending on the context of what you grew up in and also the environment that you were living in your 20s There may not have been that Space for you to safely mentally At least in the US I feel like there is very much a culture of meeting Your partner young and getting married in your 20s and if you Were kind of forced onto that highway of thinking you could very easily have gotten married to Someone of the office sex without having that time to mentally self-reflect So anyway, I guess the point of this is that I think whenever you got to that point where you could self-reflect And you could come out that was the perfect time to do it and You shouldn't judge yourself and you shouldn't let others judge yourself for how long it took you to get to that place This is whenever you got to that place. Just the perfect moment for you guys. Please

 I don't know. Have you ever considered why it is not just for maybe a biblical theological perspective and for a basic plain reading of the text perspective, but also how it affects not just an individual on a mental, emotional, spiritual level, but also in couples, in broader contact group, context of group relationships, and then on a greater scale, a national level, a legislative level, and then even from a naturalistic point of view how it just makes us nothing more than just the animals, how it doesn't actually progress, it actually takes us backwards. There's nothing good objectively about sodomy. So I don't know why you're sitting here trying to act like this with this false dilemma that you invent. It doesn't do anything for your argument nor anything remotely. In fact, it actually makes my case that homosexuality is still as soon as the scriptures have said from the beginning. This is observable, understandable, knowable, testable, and you will be held accountable by an almighty God who created you as a sexual being with a right understanding of what is morally good and what is morally wrong. When you take away the boundaries of that morality that God is clearly established, sexuality is meant to be an honorable, glorifying thing made between a husband and their wife to create life and so forth. When you take those boundaries away from a society, guess what? You will have mayhem, you will have abuse, you will have traumas, and you will have the exact same thing exponentially more than even in a straight sexual relationship issues. So you can't even use that as an argument to say, oh well that happens just with straight couples too. No, not to the extremes that homosexuality does. So you know exactly what's happening. You know that it's wrong, you just want to do whatever feels good and withhold yourself from any real moral capability and accountability. So what did we lose when we try and act like it's not a sin? Morality, humanity, identity, community, society, mentality, and ultimately eternity.

 Americans never cease to absolutely blow my mind because there's so many people who are so transphobic and are like, keep them out of our bathrooms, keep them away from our children. Don't let them read books and educate our children that they can be different and do so ever when I want to be in life. Don't let them give our children confidence to be free-minded. No, no, no. Put them back in the hole where they crawled out of. But then those very same people will ask somebody what is in their pants. What? Since what is that okay? Since when? Since when is it okay to walk up to a stranger and go, I'm sorry about this question but um do you have a dingling or naw? I just I need to know for for my personal science like what is going on? It wouldn't be a problem that these people were going into the bathroom if you weren't worried about what's in every single person you encounter as pants. But you're not worried about what every single person's you encounter is in their pants. You're only worried about the ones that you're not sure by looking at them if they're male or woman. What? Why is that your business? Isn't that your business? Stop asking people that it's fucking weird. It is weird. Don't do that. Let's let's not ever do that again because that's harassment. You're harassing people. If you think it's wrong that they're going to the same bathroom as you then I think it's wrong that you're asking people what's in their pants. Don't do that. Do better. Okay I love you guys so much. I'm so sorry that this even has to be said in the first place. Bye!

 Yeah, let's talk about it. Let's talk about the fact that transgender people and cisgender women are sexually assaulted at essentially the exact same rate on college campuses. Let's talk about the fact that when sexual assaults do occur on college campuses, 99.7% of the time, it is cisgender men who are sexually assaulting cisgender women and 85% of the time, sexual assaults on transgender people are also perpetrated by cisgender men. Let's talk about the fact that 32% of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having to withhold food and water from themselves in order to make it through a work day without having to use the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that 8% of those same group of transgender people over a 12 month period reported having had urinary tract infections as a result of withholding water from themselves and holding in using the restroom for an entire work day. Let's talk about the fact that doctors are aware of this and in fact when a doctor who knows how to work with trans people is screening a patient, it's one thing that they know to look for because it's so common compared to the rest of the population to have urinary tract infections as a result of anxiety around the restroom. Let's talk about the fact that when I was in high school, a friend of mine who was out as trans had to cross the street to use a different restroom in a different building every single time they needed to relieve themselves. Let's talk about the fact that I have been sexually assaulted and it didn't matter what was on my birth certificate. Let's talk about the fact that everyone fucking deserves to be safe and instead of trying to work towards a safer world, you're contributing to rape culture by blaming transgender women instead of facing up to the fact that it's cisgender men, cisgender straight men who specifically are causing all of these issues around safety.

 Who? Who? Who is picking that? Who out here is picking the bracelet over kissing Rachel? Are there really people out here that are going to choose the bracelet? Even the tattoo? Over kissing Rachel Amber? Rachel Amber? Did we play the same game? Like I'm just... I'm just... I'm... Spateless! Even if you didn't want a relationship with Rachel, I mean like you know, you wouldn't just want to kiss the most popular girl in school just to say you did it? Stunned. Stunned, stunned, stunned. Like who is picking these options? And Chloe doesn't even end up with the bracelet. It ends up with Frank. So if that's not already like a slap in the face to the the people who do pick the bracelet. Also I'm not 100% sure but isn't there a way that she can still meet Sarah without picking the bracelet option? I might have to go back and play and see but like I swear there was an option. But like serious question, for the people who didn't choose to kiss Rachel Amber, are y'all okay?

 This is a great TikTok. You should go watch it talking about just kind of how intimidating it can be to approach the lesbian scene if you've been closeted or if you're a light to light lesbian just because of like some people wanting Experience and maybe not having as much experience. I was closeted for almost 30 years I'm also a researcher So I don't approach any new skill or concept without wanting to really read a lot and learn as much as I can So I have a great resource to share basically on this topic Green screen won't let me talk so I'm gonna say it up front and then I'll show you a picture of it But it's very trans inclusive very consent based a lot of really practical and helpful tips on Just sort of like how to learn this new skill

----------------------------------------

 Hi, Trans woman here, and I wanted to say you're actually right. Ever since I was young, I knew something was different about me. I knew that I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom. I didn't fit in with the other boys. I liked things that they said only women like, like I like the color pink, I like the color purple. And that was because I knew that I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom. When I became an adolescent, and I started to look at myself in the mirror and the puberty I was going through, didn't align with what I knew was my mind. When, whenever I looked in the mirror, it looked like I was staring at a mockery that my body was laughing at myself and talking to me with this prison. I wanted to hurt myself. I wanted to change. I wanted to fight against this thing that was all consuming and inevitable because I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom. Some days I'd go into the shower and I turned the water high. I turned up so high it felt like the skin was melting off my bones. I wanted pain. I wanted to be free from this body. I wanted to do anything to get out of it. Because I wanted to assault women in the women's restroom. Eventually I wanted to plan parenthood and I spoke with a psychiatrist and it turned out it was a lot easier to get on the HRT and I felt this immense relief because I was finally free from this curse that I've had all my life. Now I could assault women in the women's restroom. I grew my hair out. I went thrifting, found some nice pieces. I got to make up and I learned how to put a little bit on. This isn't too much but I'm proud of what I've gotten to because now I can assault women in the women's restroom.

 Guys, Miss Julie actually tried my prison cake recipe. I am absolutely flattered. Miss Julie, thank you so much. These recipes are super cost effective. If you're on a budget or you want something fun and easy that you can do with your kids, you can make this outside of prison guys. These are cheap. They're good. They're easy and they're just fun. If you guys are trying my prison recipes at home, please make a video and pack me because I love to see it. I love you guys so much. I actually cannot thank you enough for the support and love that I've received on this out. I never thought that my story as a trans woman being in prison would be something that people would be interested in, but I hope that I'm helping people. I hope that it's entertaining and I just can't thank you enough way to go. Miss Julie, you did an awesome job.

----------------------------------------

Video: @catboyzoro_video_7370785648833203488-Scene-002.mp4
 I usually don't stitch people's videos, but I want to talk about this. And I don't want to talk about if it's realistic or not that Luffy and Chopper didn't recognize that those were not their crew members. But I think it's very interesting that they give those to a lot of shit for this. While at the same time, happily playing along with the fact that those two also didn't recognize that Usopp is so good. Like, that is a giant inside joke in the fender, and I bet even on this video, I will have people in the comments saying her Usopp is so good. I don't think so. Like, people love this joke. Even though it is super unrealistic that Luffy and Chopper didn't recognize Usopp in his disguise. Like, all the other strawheads immediately recognized him, but only Luffy and Chopper didn't. And obviously, them not recognizing the fake strawheads as that is not exactly the same thing. But it is showcasing the same personality trait that Luffy and Chopper share. And that is that they don't assume that people are lying. And they take everything at face value. And so, even though it is annoying and it gives us a bad feeling that they can't recognize that those people aren't their crew members, it is, in my opinion, in character for them. And obviously, it is ridiculous, but so are a lot of things in one piece. Like, realism is never a point in one piece. And I don't really have a conclusion for this video. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this.

----------------------------------------

Video: @cathrynlavery1_video_7367598374310268165-Scene-002.mp4
 So in 2018, my girlfriend and I decided to move from New York to Austin and we planned a day and then her work up pushed back. So I moved and then she was going to come like a month after that. So the first week on there, this girl that I kind of knew invited me to this entrepreneur dinner and at the dinner is like six people. Really the dinner I didn't really get to talk to is this guy right across this like circular table because it was like too big a table to talk to. But after the dinner, he drove us to this party in his Tesla and I never been in Tesla and I was like oh this is so cool and he said oh if you ever want to drive in one like let me know. I didn't even have my license but I didn't tell them that. So I go to a couple of days later. I've been awesome for a week at this point and I'd signed up before I moved for this like charity bike ride so I was like 50 miles from Austin because I'm like okay I'll get to know the city. 10 miles in I come off my bike, break my collarbone and the ride people are like we're going to call your emergency contact and I'm like well she's in New York so that's not really helpful. Obviously I didn't think I was going to have to use my emergency contact and they're like okay so if you should be cool. Now at the time I knew a lot of people in Austin. We were friendly but I'm not going to bother them on a Saturday to take me to the hospital. So they're like who should we call them? I'm like yeah I don't I don't have anyone to call and so they're like okay well we're going to have one of the volunteers take you. So they put me in the van they take me back to meet this volunteer and picture that's like lightly raining. I've been like crying. I'm just like this shabbled and clearly distressed and I see this Tesla roll up and who is the volunteer but this guy from the dinner that I didn't get to talk to but told me he would take me out in his Tesla. Well it's funny as I'm getting into this car like even though I'm like broken and upset I mean it's a dumb joke about the death from measures I would get to get a ride in this car again. So he takes me to the hospital. I go in and you know get looked at her at a vert and later he picks me out from the hospital we go and get let's start from the pharmacy then he like drives me home. He brought a whole tree of food for me and then I was going to my apartment. But there's like boxes of vert because again I just moved and my dog's there there he's like do you want me to walk your dogs and I'm like no no no it's fine like don't worry about it because I'm already phone-bought that I've taken up so much this time and he's like I'm just I'm just going to walk them. So he walked the dogs and then he left and then over the next week he would like check in and make sure everything was good and we ended up coming like good friends because he sees me at the like low point in my life I feel like and I don't know just built up trust but that's and so my girlfriend and like talk talk about this guy and she's in New York being like who the business guy like moving in in my girl. She's getting like paranoid but she wasn't wrong because cut three years later and he's my baby daddy. He's not a home wrecker because we're married and he's our donor and we have this like cool blended family night. In the moment I'm like oh I just moved Austin and my abboc broken collarbone like that's terrible but if I look back and was in the out I'm like actually that led to this which led to this and so yeah cool coincidence.

 So, first of all, this man has the most beautiful teeth I've ever seen in my life. Let's start there. But in his video, he's talking about how he does not show affection towards his significant other or whoever it is that he has at the house in front of his son. What's wrong with that? And he goes on with a valid point. What happens if his son goes over to his friend's house and does what he saw his dad doing? Now we all know that there's homophobes out there. I mean, his son could be teased, he could be beat up, all sorts of different things. He's protecting his child. What is wrong with that? Furthermore, it amazes me how so many people have so much to say about how other people are raising their kids. Specifically, the ones that don't have any. Where do they do that at? Where do you have the right? Leave this man alone, please.

----------------------------------------

Video: @charliegrossnielsen_video_7373846204838333729-Scene-002.mp4
 You know what? First of all, I am so tired of the queer community training on each other. It's getting so old. Second of all, trans women were peacefully using their restrooms that they identified with long before any of you were so focused on trans people. Now, a trans person just goes into the bathroom to have a quick wee or do a quick number too. If in these hypothetical thought processes where people are scared of a man entering the women's bathroom to grate someone, they wouldn't go through with either surgeries, years of psych evaluations, doctor appointments, hormone replacement therapy, the fact that you have to come out to your family, your work getting your legal sex changed, all the documents changed. And again, you could ask, well, I don't know all of this. I'm like, sweetie. The only time I am faced with trans phobia in my life is online because here I talk about the fact that I'm a trans woman and I disclose it. In my real life, I have never had an issue going into the women's bathroom. Women gladly talk to me when they hear my voice, they don't clog it. I have women coming over to protect me from men. However, do I agree with the fact that if you do not pass that you should not go into the women's bathroom or the men's bathroom yet? Well, yes, I do until you are passable in a sense of how the society views you. Yes, but also for your own good, for your own safety of not getting attacked as a trans person and also for the respect of everybody else. I do agree. But that is a topic for another day. But I'm so tired of seeing especially femme gay boys attacking trans women because the only fact that gay boys can exist in somewhat peace in a feminine presence. A lot of that you can fucking thank trans women, especially trans women of color and black trans women for that. That was all I had to say. I'm so tired of this discussion.

 But hi, I'm one of those pride demons that you're speaking of. As somebody who's born and raised Catholic and Baptist for a little bit, I kind of see where you're coming from. I get the unique family lifestyle, the one of a man and a woman, a white picket fence and children. Maybe a dog, a lab, specifically. However, it's 2024, not 1952. So I don't get why you thought it was a great idea to go stand on your own two feet and speak such ignorance to a room full of graduating women, and gays, and allies. And think you're going to get away with that. Listen, from one sassy gay to another, keep moving. But also keep your mouth shut. Because listen, June's right around the corner. And as gays, we're sinful.

This supposed lessfist as you call him is way more pro gun than Donald Trump. Donald Trump got booed at the libertarian convention because he's not a libertarian. Donald Trump is just another power hungry douchebag running on the Republican ticket. And if Donald Trump was actually serious about putting a libertarian in his cabinet like he claimed he was, he would have won name the libertarian he was thinking about and to name the position he was thinking about, which he didn't. His appearance was just political posturing and nothing more. He does not give a damn about freedom or libertarian principles in any way shape or form. He got what he deserved.

 I saw this video while Bakhan was like, ea, I really do not blame her because the concept of feminism has been ported about time. And then people said I'll teach you the video that I'm going to be concerned because you see something like, I'm a feminist, watch me cook. And it's just jobs. Now not get it to step, these are amazing jobs, astronauts, many doctors, you know, all you'll be walkers on all of that. But that is not all that feminism is about. Everything is missing that everyone has the right to decide where she wants to be of service in society, to what extensions she wants to be of service and should be respected as such. That is to say that if you want to be a housewife, go ahead, I for one, I follow a lot of housewives on TikTok and Instagram and I see how they take care of their man and their children and their household. It is so wholesome you cannot take away from that. I also follow lots of CEOs and they inspire me the way they break barriers, the way they run their company. Amazing. That is what feminism is about. So I think this teach should be. I am a feminist, watch me cook all things.

 I don't know who needs to hear this, but you can have both. This is a clear example of black and white thinking either you can be a mom or you can have a career. And that's not true. You can be successful in your career and still be excited to get married and have kids. Maybe I'm just lucky enough to have a partner aka my future wife who makes me feel like I can have both. We are building success together.

 this I cannot stress the scene off so like when I didn't even know there was a name for it I just know like when I was with a pretty abusive ex like I had that shit happen to me like And I just want to say it so I can like warn people so they don't get in the same situation But they there was one night where they just would not leave me alone And I was just so exhausted usually I just I'll leave I'll do whatever I was just like I don't like drama, right? But this day I had just got off a work and I worked night So I got to work it like 2 a.m. And I stayed longer so it's about like 4 3 or 4 a.m. at the time and they just wanted to start arguing they were trying to get me to leave I didn't want to leave I'm like I'm not leaving like I'm tired I was like I'm not gonna leave right now. I'm like I'm tired plus I had something to drink right before I went to sleep I'm not leaving I was like I'll leave in the morning I think it's some rest I'm not getting into UI too, you know I'm too tired to drive and I'm not sleeping in my car but the nurses did like that So what they did was They just pretty much was trying to prevent me from sleeping and I don't know if you've ever been sleep deprived But it's not fun So what do they do? They poured a half a gallon of water on me from French, you know cold ass pitcher They poured a pitcher of water on me Was at least a half gallon if not a full can they poured it all on me I wake up like trench like what the fuck So I feel like I'm getting water boarded because I'm getting water poured on me in my sleep Of course they started with my head right then after that they flipped me under the mattress and sat on it Then after they did that they did so much shit then they I fucking snapped They started throwing stuff on me throwing stuff on me and I finally snapped and I'm screaming Not I'm not even dressed at the time too I'm naked I'm screaming I'm getting the fuck away from me Leave me alone like you're such a bitch like I'm saying every fucking thing under the sun because I am Sleep deprived I had been drinking I'm exhausted I'm tired But no they wanted me out so what do they do pull out their phone and record me secretly and then show the cop I want to lie they laughed they're like I'm scared I'm scared for my life And I'm like why do you keep saying that they're like I'm scared for my life I'm like go fucking be scared away for me right now while I sleep Listen to our later cops come in it's dark and I see flashlights waking me up calling my names you know my some some more more of her reunion or do you have any weapons One I would never do that like Like how as a black person do you call the cops on another black person and say you fear for your fucking life And then try to say that you know I might have weapons like because why did the cops come with their weapons out pointing towards me Soaked in fucking bed but naked tired telling me that I had to fucking leave Long storage short after I showed that because they lied it said I wasn't released and I had a copy of the least The work I was on because I was on the fucking lease because I said I wasn't gonna move in with them unless I was on the least So I had got put on the lease So yeah after that they said they couldn't make either of us go But they kept saying go go go and after like three fucking hours of the police being there and saying they could have Make either of us go but they kept saying well, why don't you go because she kept saying She kept saying well, she's from here. She's from here. She is family here because again this happened in Hawaii Am I access from Virginia Mmm D&D motherfuckers But anyway, so eventually of course I ended up leaving and sleeping in my fucking car because I'm exhausted And the police couldn't make her leave and the police couldn't like me leave and I was like I don't want her to leave I just want to sleep and they're like well We can't make you leave but she doesn't want you here. Why don't you just stay with them? Leads since you know you have family here I just eventually got tired and I'm like it's not even worth the battle because I'm here to sleep And I'm obviously not gonna get any sleep so I just left But yeah, narcissists narcissists will do that. Marceus is love Like I just saw a video on TikTok where this other chick was like She was recording it but luckily she had another camera set up in the room and she got everything on camera with the Marceus's throwing water on her And then all this shit and then like acting surprised when she started recording Oh, you recording me you're gonna really pour water on me and then record me you're just sick in the head You need to go to you know, you need to go you need help Narcissists love telling people that you need help. They love telling people there's something wrong with you I mean honestly, I think they're just speaking to themselves through you speaking to themselves at you like you're a mirror Either way protect yourselves and side story later on they ended up taking the least because at a copy of the least on my iCloud They ended up going through my phone deleting the least from my phone And then someone the next time when this shit happened I Had no proof. I had no proof that I lived there I was a private landlord so it wasn't like I could so proof online. It was just the paper just the random condo So yeah, protect yourself to get narcissists and I didn't mean to make this video long But I had to put that out there in case anybody Just protect yourself and if they're acting weird Like you never know like they're probably gonna set up cameras They're probably gonna try to make you look like the bad guy protect your fucking self

 Hello friends, it's me again, Kate, I also go by Ridge, which is my little name. It's been a year of me being on TV. It's been almost a year. And I thought that it would be a good time for me to do a little comparison to the like inventory of my vocal range that I did a year ago. I think this is going to be cool. This is the lowest that I can get my voice to be. I'm speaking almost completely from my chest here. It's not super comfortable for me to do long term because it doesn't really sound like me. So typically I talk a little bit more up here, which is talking for more of my upper chest into my neck area. And then if I want to go to the top of my vocal range and bring my voice to be completely speaking from like up in my head, this is what it sounds like. And it's, I sound silly. My voice has also been cracking the past few days, which means more changes coming soon. I guess, love that for me. I can't believe it's been a year.

 What is that one song for you that instantly makes you start crying?
----------------------------------------

Video: @clarksided_video_7364485651510660394-Scene-002.mp4
 Jar of Hearts by Christina Perry. That song was like my most listened to song when I was dealing with my first ever big crush when I was a sophomore in high school. I was raised in very conservative Christian evangelical Appalachia. I didn't think there were any adults that I could safely tell about me having a crush on this guy and me liking boys and having known that for years at that point. Um, and so I was navigating a bunch of these, you know, big complex feelings for the first time by myself. There was only one adult that when I was in high school, like concretely, like explicitly knew that I was gay and they tried to send me to conversion therapy. So, uh, my fears were pretty well founded. And having nobody, um, that I could like process a lot of these feelings with meant that like I was dealing with them in very unhealthy ways. Like it's beyond cringe-worthy. Like, it was it was harmful to myself and others. When Facebook tries to show me like memories from that year of my life, I go back and I delete it. I, no, absolutely not. It wasn't until the summer between my sophomore and junior year of high school, uh, when I went to the West Virginia Governor School for the Arts for three weeks that I like looked around at other kids who were like the same age as me, who like got it. And I kind of realized and like, okay, living is something I can do. But like the struggle to get to that point, um, you know, was orchestrated by Christina Perry's hit song, Jar of Hearts. Um, and yeah, I still to this day cannot listen to that song without crying.

 Do you ever stop to think about how far you've come in your queer journey?
----------------------------------------

Video: @clarkskent_video_7367452771404139822-Scene-002.mp4
 I think for me the most growth that I've shown and how far I've come is accepting my place in the community. Just for reference I came out when I was about 19. I'm 30 now. I've never had a girlfriend. I don't really date women. I mean I try to date women. It really just never pans out. I have just general not the best luck with women. I don't have a ton of experience with them. They don't really seem to like me that much. And when I was younger that really hurt me. It hurt me through the point where I just for years I think a good three to four years just actively stop trying to date women. And right now I am trying again and I prepared myself. I knew it was going to be very isolating and lonely and that my self-esteem was going to take a hit. which I kind of has. But I do think I am a lot better about knowing that I belong here. Having queer friends, joining queer spaces really just trying to not feel as if I'm a predator or some sort of weird monster. It's funny because a lot of people hate that one tailor where she was like I something about everybody being a sexy baby and she's like a monster in a room. But that's how I felt for the longest time trying to exist especially in sapphic spaces. I was just like, it just felt and I still feel like this little bit. But women just did not like me so much and had no romantic interest in me whatsoever. That I kind of felt like weird. I kind of felt like a man a little bit. And I still have issues with that but I do think I am in a much better place. And I just credit growth with myself a little bit more self-confidence and having a really good friend group.

----------------------------------------

 So if you look at that guy's original video, he's basically saying that because liberals have all these traits And all these like mental disorders that we should not be running the country. I feel like it's such a bad take Where do I begin? So let's start with the whole mental disorder aspect We all know, you know that grandparent that's like leans right a little bit or just like the uncle You know the boomer of the gen X that's gonna be like oh mental health disorders didn't really exist back in my day But if you know the signs there there for example if they get mad easily if they Or you know just have a slow attention span or maybe they always have to be doing something because they can't So hey, that's ADHD where we all know that gen X parent that's a hoarder And that's basically like some sort of attachment issue, you know at its core and generally the older generations We're just emotionally closed up and because they're not as well because us they just kind of have that attitude and they transfer that to their kids So a lot of even our generation the millennials and the Gen Z are kind of similar So my point is that you're gonna get a lot of that on the right to it's just gonna be you know Not in check. They're not gonna be self aware of it They're not gonna be treating it as much and therefore I don't think that they should be running the country by that same logic like yeah I'm kind of making blanket statements here But I guarantee if you go like North Carolina to Portland, you know like North Carolina You got a coffee shop, you know Yeah, somebody if they're neurodivergent Maybe if you're in a major city, but if you're in the rural part that's definitely not gonna happen I've actually had friends move from like Phoenix like North Carolina, Texas basically those like like Southern hemisphere or Southern part of the country states and You know once they move to Seattle once they move to Portland once they move to New York You know once they move to California then They're starting to talk about stuff that they've never talked about before which is mental health and obviously it just goes back to the whole Trans issue where it's bad enough that we're just like taking away trans rights, but it's just like we're gas sliding trans people and to be in like no you don't know what your actual gender You are this way not that way. We can't treat them like fellow human beings We have to tell them, you know what they should be feeling how they should be So yeah, I'll overall bad take from that guy, but I just had to dig into why it was bad

 When I made that TikTok, I had just come out. It was a right after Thanksgiving and before Christmas. And, um, you might recall it was because I'd been writing a book and my parents kept asking to read it. And so I had come out to them to explain that it was a bisexual fantasy. I didn't want to tell you. And I lost everything for a book that I thought I was just going to digitally publish on Amazon. And maybe four people would read. And it was really just for me, I wrote it for an audience of one. I wrote the book, I always wanted to see myself in. And at the time, I didn't have this online community that I have now. And for no reason at all, you turn this book that four people were supposed to see into a bestseller. I have no publishing house, no agent. You did this. What I'm going to do today is it's birthday. Happy birthday, the night of the moon.

----------------------------------------

Video: @cultralyzed_video_7370974604065606944-Scene-002.mp4
 The LG B thing was just a fake organisation anyway that didn't really represent gay people, trans people properly anyway and didn't actually give real insight into things that straight people could learn from gay people in any way shape or form and it was just created just to usher in acceptance but not for gay people, not for trans people but for P does. They really wanted to let the P on the end and they've been doing this kind of stuff since like the 70s and it backfired. So now it's just this sort of blob of organisation that manipulate young people in their formative years that when you're 15, 16, 17, 18 and kind of smart you think you really know what you're doing but you don't. So then these young Gen Z people are just kind of like these little rebels with whatever random calls they've been told to think for the week for whatever reason. They have decided to boycott an institution like Lyat Foxen Tavern which is so funny because there's been a place, a safe place for gay people for years and it's almost like sometimes these young Gen Z people, they just get on a cause and just don't really understand what they're doing and they get used and manipulated for. Basically the powers that be don't want nightclubs there. So they somehow figure out how to get young people to boycott things that they're going to really need in a few years time and let people really enjoy going to, especially gay people and I feel like they just got used somehow to end the business and it's a crime shame and they think they're doing this for some positive reason but it just sounds like they got conned into, I don't even know why they've got it but they've got conned into thinking it's best not to go to a place that's been housing gay people for years in some sort of, for some political bit, it's actually quite sad really, it's quite silly but yeah, I'm happy that there are gay people that are actually just coming out of the closet and saying actually I don't like that movement and hasn't really done anything. And from somebody I feel like it just doesn't actually help straight and gay people understand each other more. I just think it's just trash and I think it's a corrupted, a corrupted movement that's actually deep seated in perverts. They want to put the pee in the end for perverts and you accept their perversion. That's what it's about.

 That is my friend Chris or Crazy Chris with the K. And he is a fantastic human being. If you don't know his story, you need to go look it up, follow him basically when he found out that his son was gay. He went around and got to know gay people to find out what it was all about. So he could better support his son. And recently he was on the show, we are here on HBO Max. If you don't know what it is, look it up, it's a fantastic show. He is one of the best allies in the world. He is just a great guy and really deserves your support. He is going to nursing school. He has got a great kid. He has fought through some really tough things to become the fantastic individual that he is today. So please go back, watch this video, go look at his other stuff, and you will hear his story, his son's story. And please follow and support him. He is great.

 Claire, I hear you. You're wrong. And I'll tell you why. Thank you. I hear you getting ready with extra time. I hear all this effort and going outside and we all experience it and it's awful. It sucks. It sucks so much. I cram myself to sleep sometimes. Maybe you do two sometimes. Can we see the comments and we put strongfakes? But here's why what's needed? We know the pioneers. Whether we'd like it or not, we are in the generation and that it's going to move change. We are in the generation that is going to define what the change happens now or decades later. We're the generation that if we don't step up, we're going to be shut down. If we don't empower each other, we're going to shut down. It's okay. Your video was event and it's okay to vent. What's that okay is to give up. We're not getting up. My voice right now sounds awful because I'm practicing. I'm trying to practice to lower my pitch and everything for my safety. For the same reason that you felt this for you. Workness together. It's an effort. Okay? Yes, it sucks. But it would be work. We're doing the work to change it for the future. We're only going to do that if we just stick with each other. If we empower each other. Okay? Thank you.

 It's funny how conservatives are always screaming about freedom of speech Yet when someone they don't like chooses to exercise their freedom of speech Suddenly it's a problem weird how that works quite frankly honey Maybe you should just learn to deal with it like Quirpy people are here to stay. We're not going anywhere and a fucking rainbow flag isn't in a herche. It's not like you can catch day Anyone with half a brain knows that's not true So maybe just grow up and learn to deal with it because we all have to deal with things in life. We don't like I Do it all the time. I live in a conservative state. I have to deal with people like you on the daily Yet my head hasn't exploded I haven't had aneurysm or anything. I'm still around weird how that works and Quite frankly if I saw a business like that in my area that was showing Graphics like that. I would go to that business even if it was of that because just because The vet is safe for my dog doesn't mean they're safe for me Have the day that you deserve

Video: @daniela_a_wolfe_video_7370271194701974827-Scene-002.mp4
 You know, honey. The term sis is an adjective. It's not a title. No more than saying that someone is a gay man, a straight man, a bisexual man, or a trans man is a title. You see all those terms, trans, cis, gay, bisexual. Those are all adjectives. And it's funny that you bring this up because I grew up in a conservative Mormon home. And I heard my relatives all talk about the term straight. Are they really like it? They don't like having that label forced onto them. I'm sure you can see the parallels there. I'm sure you can understand how silly you sound if you take that information into account because for years a lot of straight people would make the same addictions. And now most people who would say that would look silly because everyone knows if you're not straight, you're either gay or bisexual or some flavor thereof. Quite frankly, honey. I don't know if you're being deliberately misleading or if you're just ignorant of history. Really, you should probably educate yourself. Have a day.

 You know what? As an organizer and activist within the LGBTQIA plus community, I am so tired of transphobic queers trying to exclude people like me, trying to spread hate and misinformation about people like me. I tried to create an inclusive and safe environment for all members of the Rainbow family and here you are spreading division and hate. Quite frankly, honey. Until you've walked a mile in a trans person's shoes, maybe you should sit down and shut up. And just so you know, trans, you short for transgender, not transsexual. And the idea that someone should have to have surgery to be valid as a trans woman is utter bullshit. Have the day that you deserve.

 You know, it's interesting to me how pygmy gays Can be so completely unaware of history Because the language you're using honey is Similar to the language I heard being Directed at gay men while I was growing up in the 90s You see People used to say similar stuff about gay men going into the men's room because you know gay men might Get a gander at your junk when you're looking they might expose themselves to you they might Great view or even Target your children because everyone knows gay men are all a matter of house All right, at least let's what they used to say now some of the language was more extreme like what I just repeated and some was a little less blatant Similar to what you're saying right now But sure keep on repeating Recycled homophobia and direct it at trans women It betrays your lack of self-awareness and your lack of understanding of history and By the way honey since I have you here those nails I Don't know if you paid someone to do them or if you did them that yourself but Get a refund like when I first saw them I straight up thought you had a popsicle stick on one of your face I'm still not sure If it is or not, but damn honey they don't look good

 I personally would not want my nieces and my younger girl cousins and all that really being in the same space as a, you know, biological male because now what happens when the rape case is and the groupings and child molestation and all that happens now what? Statistically here much more about priests, teachers and other cisgender. This is gender through those of you who don't know is someone who's non-francender. So statistically here much more about priests, teachers and other cisgender predators and listing kids in some very rare cases when you hear about transgender. So let's have separate priests, bathrooms, separate teachers, bathrooms or perhaps separate children bathroom or if we go back to common sense let's not allow small children go on supervising public, let alone public bathroom. Whether it's a genslue or the ladies' lue that way we can make sure no one will enter the cubicle or child is using and in the common area just make sure they wash their hands properly. When will you tosses and understand that gender is in our brains while biological sex is between our legs? I know in transphobes case it's the same thing because transphobes are either dick or con- but still, ditch the inverted commas. There are no trans women, there are only women, trans women or cisgender women, they are the same thing, trans women are no less women than cisgender women and if you mess up with my sisters in comrades you mess up with me and believe me you don't want that.

 Go back to dating women. Go back to even pussy. You don't want your child to be exposed to this since you have such a problem with who you are and what you're around. Go back to being with a female. It's that simple. You don't have to struggle with this. You don't have to talk about it. Just go back to not going to female's boots. Just go back. We ain't stopping you. We learn who is stopping you. Because we don't self-hate around here. You do. You go back to the female side. Go back to eating ting ting. And be the parent that you're supposed to be. Period.

 No, let's talk about how you thought you ate, because you really didn't. You sitting here with this wannabe black girl routine, with unnecessarily long ass acrylic nails, talking about trans women that paved the way for your faggot ass. Honey half-servel seeds, because it's not cute. If it was for a trans woman, you wouldn't have this same type of speech now. If it was for a trans woman, you wouldn't have them long acrylic ass nails. If it wasn't for a trans woman, you would never have that demeanor that you stayed for my trans woman. Honey, if it wasn't for a trans woman, you probably wouldn't have heels in your actual size. Now, it's one thing for you to sit here and literally have this, I want to be a black girl moment with them long acrylic ass nails trying to think you're cute and shit. But if you don't talk about your own community, it's really not cute at all. So if I were you honey, I would literally shut up, sit back, and be that pretty little gay boy that you are. And stop trying to be a fucking pick me, because it's not cute. Thank you.

 is a genius. The strength of the backlash from the Democratic community will definitely cause his population to go up for a very short period of time. The reason why I say he's a genius is because if he doesn't apologize he's going to have a very very strong audience on his side. Imagine the money this man could make now. The NFL could kick him out in the whole United States would know that he exists. Then he just has to sell some ignorant shit and he's going to make how the money all he has to do is not apologize. Do not apologize. You will be one rich motherfucker. The paycheck he receives from the NFL pales in comparison to the money he will make if he just does not apologize. Oh my God I'm excited.

 The smile dropping from Lucius' face would always have me on the floor. When I tell you in 2015, when Empire dropped, this was peak TV. The flashbacks alone had me gag. If y'all remember this episode, this is the episode where Jamal comes outright singing to someone publicly. It's the flashbacks for me because the flashbacks is actually Lucius putting him in the trash can after he then tried on how he was. That was insane. It's sad that once you miss one Empire episode, a lot of people didn't go back, but this show was next level and had so much potential. If you want to go wild, it's not going to be all seasons. And before I end this message, is it just me? But I can't even look at Josie's smell at the same after he lied and say he got kidnapped. I can never look at him the same.

 Hi guys, I'm back again. Remember when I was sitting here at B and you were probably sleeping in, you were like, I was there, we don't care about that. And I was telling you about this constant stuff and stuff and stuff and stuff and how you just keep on getting free things. Now they are having 8 competition. Where you can win, win, win, win and win again. Naturally, you're gonna win. I'm not gonna be feeling you guys, feeling you're actually gonna win. What's the fun in that? What's the fun in that? What you're gonna do, you're gonna leave it a link in the description. That's gonna take you to the Instagram page and the newness you actually need to do. But to summarize, you're gonna follow three Instagram pages which are connected into the competition. You will see everything the competition is pretty simple. I does not like, why I love it. You just click your comment. You share how simple, then you win. Okay, it's not a guarantee, you know this thing. I also entered, but you must remember you must be a student. And you must have a 55. Well, I don't know if it's a necessity but then I guess it's a plus. But anyway, from me for now.

 any factors that when I'm out out in public, go loading stuff like that. This is kind of how I look. I wear a tire like this. There's just one beautiful little problem. These aren't real. Seriously, I almost a year into this and this is where I'm at. In the bra, I was doing about half of the work. The other thing is simple. It's too bloody hot. Seriously, you're going to tell me that you're going to get all nice and pretty up wearing silicone inserts, a nice bra in 80 to 90 degree weather with a heat index that can reach up to 120 degrees. Now, so most of my tires just look like this. I just look like an e-drogenous guy. Is that too big? Have an issue for me right now? No. Probably fine with it because I enjoy it when people look at me in our induced. It's great. And if I'm being really honest with you, I'm just getting to a point where I'm just getting tired of trying to do voice training. It's just annoying as hell and I have no one to help me with this.

Video: @drxpeppergirl_video_7374151537431727403-Scene-002.mp4
 Um, excuse me, um, that's eugenics. I see so many things on this app and I would never expect eugenics to be one of them. You see on paper preventing poor people from having children is a good thing, right? It fosters economic purity and growth. The problem is once you get rid of the people who make the least, which arguably is working class people, you have no more working class people. Also removing the bottom line by removing poor people doesn't remove the bottom line it just makes the bottom line higher. If you watch this far, I can explain it to you very easily. So here is our helpful little drawing. So what this person is saying, if you get rid of this class of person over time, the economy gets bigger. But what you see once you have no more poor people, the bottom line becomes lower class. And then the lower class becomes replacement for being poor. So if I just now the bottom line is middle class. Do you see where I'm getting at? And once you get rid of middle class, all you have is rich. So the long and the short of it, making it so that poor people can't have kids would make rich people rule the world.

 This brand of gay humor literally makes you want to claw my eyes out. Like it's so obviously just repackaged misogyny. Like first of all, you don't mean twink. You mean feminine twink specifically. Every joke in that video is very pointedly about feminine twink specifically. And like the jokes that this creator is making about feminine queer men and male-age and people are like literally the same exact kind of jokes that straight men will make about modern straight women. And it's like so common amongst queer men and male-age and communities. And it's like so tiring. Like queer men check your biases challenge.

----------------------------------------

Video: @dylanschreibman_video_7369432225034554666-Scene-002.mp4
 statements like this showed me absolutely insane. I want to preface this video by saying, I don't agree with Andy says before this part of the stage, and I also understand the call could be coming from inside. It goes on to say that it should be a God-centered pride, not that deathly sins apply that people celebrate a month over, which makes no sense to me. People that identify as part of the LGBTQ plus community like myself can have a relationship with God. I myself who identifies as a gay man has a very confident relationship in my own relationship with God. You do not need to identify a straight to have a relationship with God, which would make that point invalid. I don't understand this narrative of people fighting against gay marriage, like it's a positive or productive thing for society. Like, they wake up every day and put on the top of their agenda to take our rights away. And that could go for other attacks on other communities as well. Carison, like many others, I'm me and you to mind your business. I'm not forcing you to marry a man. You can marry a woman like you already have, and I don't mind. But people that want to marry outside the typical heterosexual relationship should have that right as well. I myself who identifies a gay man like I said before will and once a marry a man one day, because that's how God created me. And your attacks plus anybody else's attacks will not stop anyone from marrying who they want to marry. And one last thing, Harrison, I encourage you to go to a pride parade to see the celebration and joy our community offers. Have a nice and blessed day.

 So my wife and I actually did like a version of this when we got married because she's trans and prior to us getting married hadn't gone through the name change process yet. So what we did was we made a list of all of our favorite names and then we narrowed it down. We each had a favorite. Did rock paper scissors. I won. Got to choose our last name. She changed her last name through the name change process prior to getting married so that when we did get married all I had to do was take her last name and that is how we became the Briar Woods.

 It's the fact that you sound like Billy Porter and still have the nerve to make this tasteless ass claim. Okay, if you want to go back and watch that, you can. I have been avoiding trying to do stitches on my page right here because this page is strictly from my art form. But as somebody who doesn't art form that also takes over what this person just attacked, I'm just going to go ahead and make this stitch. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say time and place for people who are just wearing something that is just different for their gender. Billy Porter didn't walk out on a sesame street wearing a bra and candy set, flapping it out. No, he wore a dress, a dress, mind you something that I have seen tons of people to the women wear on sesame street. The problem doesn't come down to the fact of what he was wearing. The problem comes down to the fact that you're not like a man wearing a dress. And then on top of that, you have the nerve to sound like Billy Porter and still get on here and act that way. Because if you're going to think somehow these people are going to be like, you're the one, you know, no, baby. Conservative still don't like you. The people who have a problem with men and dresses still don't like you. This is because you validate their feelings in your head. They still don't like you. I don't want my son to say that. I wonder why. Because heteronormativity and all of the world has told you that there's something wrong with the way somebody wears a particular fold of fabric. No, this is fabric, y'all. It's just cut and shaped fabric that is used to also wear men's clothing. And you were like, well, if Billy Porter had been in a suit, out of being so bad. I just, I just try, girl, know you wouldn't have, you would have had something to say then. And to be honest with the fact of matter is, I don't even think you're even watching the day of episode talking about, I don't want my son to see that. I don't want my son to see that. Well guess what? Mimi, he saw it. Y'all need to talk about this stuff early on that there are people that are different. Because I'm going to go ahead and say this, a person about a week ago named Deilicious was just traveling, local drag queen in Philadelphia. Don't know the full circumstances, but essentially the person was attacked by a group of teenagers. The four being different was jumped by a group of teens for being different and succumbed to his injuries for days later. And I say he because that is the pronouns that he wanted to be called. Was died from the, from the injuries a few days later. All because these teens, these kids had been taught that people that are different than you, men that wear dresses or makeup or are too feminine or too this are somehow less than you. And you don't know what type of mindset a person is going to have. Even though those are kids or your kids or your son and your daughter, you don't know what type of mindset they're going to have. You don't know what type of crazy they're going to be. So you don't know where they're going to go with that. And you don't know what type of validation they're looking for from their friends. My person is dead because of that. And I know you may fit, well that has nothing to do with it. BS people should understand that there are people who are different because when they don't understand that there are people that are different, they attack that which they do not understand. And people die because they decided to wear a different fold of fabric than you. It's honestly disgusting and I have zero respect for homophobes. Like homophobes, the way the church goes, I don't know if I can love my son anymore because he's gay or I don't know if I can love my child, my daughter anymore because she's gay. It's the way I look at them. I go, I don't want your love. I honestly am disgusted by you. I don't like you. I don't like homophobes. The way they look at gay people is the way I look at them. I just think you're disgusting. I don't like you. It's been enough time that you should understand this should be talked about. The fact of the matter is we have teenagers and kids that watch Drag Race and go, hey, that's me. I see me. There's a kid who's on a watchbelly porter and go, hey, that's me. I see me. But instead you got some parents who wouldn't like it if the baby porter was in a suit. They wouldn't care. They don't like anything that's different and would have a problem, anything, anything that was different. They would have a motherfucker problem. Please try to be yes. Also, baby, let it go. I have seen several of you very effeminate black gay men on this app talking about we didn't need to see that on the sesame street. There's a time in place. Where's the time where's the place? Because I'm sure that time in place to you is never. People don't have to do, when most of you consider drag, don't have to do that in your time in your place. Baby, I grew up on Mrs. Doubtfire, him, Madea, ain't no time in place for them. Kids watching them, kids watching Tyler Perry. I grew up on so much drag and ain't nobody had an issue or a problem with it. Now all of a sudden, y'all got issues and problems with it talking about I don't want my children to see that. Baby, you grew up on that. You grew up on that. You grew up on so Mrs. Doubtfire. You grew up on some big amount of sounds. It's a dress. It's a fold of fabric. Essentially, it equates to a robe and you have not much of a panic attack about it. Sit down. Sit down and shut up. Also, this idea that you have, that you said something where you were like, we thought it's a little bit that's that agree. And the reason I make a fun of the way you talk is because you have the nerve to sit there and talk like that, the way that a lot of us talk and sit there and have the audacity to sit there and make fun of somebody is insane to me. But this fact that you're saying we fight for acceptance, not a grunts. And you said it with your whole chest, like you had said, it's not special. It's an agree it's not exclusive. We fight for the ability to be understood. We fight for the ability to be left alone. That's what we are fighting for. Acceptance? Yes. I don't need you to understand me. But what you're going to do is respect me. What you're going to do is lead me alone. I want the ability to live my life and be left alone. If I'm not hurting anyone or myself, I'd like the ability to be left alone. That's what you're not getting, baby. And it's people like Billy Porter. It's people like us, the ones who dare to be different. And dare to go, there is no such thing as time or place because you'll never care for the time or place that make it easier for people like you to do what you need to do. The ones of you that are mad at Billy Porter and have something the same, we are the ones who make it so you can't have an easier life. Because that's what changes never made by the people who are just going with the flow. It's never made with you. That's the people who dare to be different. It's the people who dare to break norms. It's the people who dare to be different. Maybe we are the ones that make change. and people like you getting our way. And I just want to go ahead and let it be known that if this was during slave days, you would be one of those people that Harriet Tubman would have to pull out to get on. You would. I very much know it. You would. And guess what? I'm the gay Harriet Tubman and I'm going to pull out again because we can't do this. This can't be. Okay? This can't be.

 These are the gays. I cannot understand it. I say gays like that because I look at gays me and then I look at them as Something else. I can't say that word on here But I say that for one specific reason You and your boyfriend are literally living off of this platform You cannot survive without it because your fans are coming like on this platform going over to your spicy webs I used to be on very very well-known corn websites It's well-known within the gay community But I also learned the logic in and starting my own business and working in actual job and my business is very successful And I'm successful at my job as well, but I also still do OF Yes, I get a lot of money from there, but I can't rely on that forever Looks fade over time people lose interest over time Websites get taken down and profiles all the time.

And I know that that's a rubber thing because at the beginning it shouldn't come out like that. Only certain things do. Certain things that I have in my collection. So I could probably actually pinpoint which one you're using. Is this really what we're doing now? Oh, this is just... And as I mentioned, you're wearing a cross and doing that.

 See, I thought you being a drag queen, you would have at least somewhat of an education, but I guess I was wrong. This is exactly why I do not associate with my community, nor do I like my community any longer. The gay community has started standing up for things it should not even be standing up for any longer. You're saying queers for Palestine, but yet you're refusing to acknowledge what happened on October 7th. You're refusing to acknowledge all of the terror attacks that Palestinians have committed against Israelis and against Jews since before Israel was a state. And let me put this out there for you right now. So it's not so black and white in your head because that's the way that you're perceiving it. This is not a genocide. This is a war that was committed by age group on October 7th. Age group terrorizes their own people, Palestinians. There are actual videos of Palestinians thanking IDF soldiers for saving them and trying to rid them of age group. But another fun fact for you, if you don't know this, in 2006, that's when the Palestinian people elected age group as their ruling government. Did you know in Muslim culture it is forbidden to be gay? It is frowned upon. It is almost, it's basically illegal. Did you know in Judaism, we don't care. We only care if you're a good person or not. Did you know there are multiple gay people in Israel? Israel holds some of the largest priprates in the entire world. In Tel Aviv. So if you do not believe that nothing bad, if you believe nothing bad would happen to you, being in drag, going out to Gaza, I will personally, I want you to DM me. I will personally buy you a first class ticket to Gaza. And let's see how that goes. And I will not be held responsible for what happens to you out there because you were warned. If you think Israeli soldiers are something you have to be worried about out there, oh you're 100% wrong or in Israeli bomb, you're 100% wrong. I miss Telai.

 I just had this conversation at work with this Asian gay man that broke my heart.
----------------------------------------

Video: @emememhu_video_7368118577204972833-Scene-002.mp4
 Hi guys, so this gay Asian man, the topic he talked about is very relatable to me because I used to identify as a gay man in a gay community, so I did resonate with what he said and I witnessed that kind of phenomenon in the community as well and so I would like to extend that topic a little bit. Yeah, I do feel like there are first of all there's no wrong, nothing wrong with you have a strong preference either you are more attracted to ethnicities other than your own, so it's like biodirectional, some people prefer to date no Asian man and some people they prefer Asian and they have special time for this called Rice Queen or Samsung like that. Yeah, I think why like gay Asian man they feel sometimes disadvantaged or it's not in a position that you can choose how many choices. I think it's in the gay community that works like a Mexican identity to a large extent so just naturally gay Asian men tend to mature relative late so in that case they will have their body here like in a late age then maybe other races also yeah some people just tend to have less body hair, facial hair which are loved by the gay community in general so the reality is neck data also especially people like me who were born just naturally more feminine I would say I'm not definitely to know the one of the popular types in the gay community. I think like people like me are really identified as a twink when I was younger yeah I kind of relate to those feelings like especially for me in my case I'm I'm felt particularly attracted to people with small body hair, facial hair so I felt it was difficult for me to get a response from the type I'm attracted to when I identify as gay but the irony is that after I didn't explore my family side just be comfortable with my femininity I identify as you know whatever you call it gender fluid cross dress dress, dress, pre-up transgender I received so many so much more attention from straight guys you know for gay men straight guys are like unreachable because they are they're just not into name masculinity but after I transition or identify the other side people just approached me so many people straight guys who would approach me and ascension me their pictures without me asking that's a very interesting thing the experience like a flipped very drastic contrast how people react to you for me I personally enjoyed the letters why I kind of want to steal to express my femininity rather than try to force myself to be masculine which I didn't enjoy from the very beginning I didn't know how to be masculine and didn't I even resisted to dress like very formal masculine clothes like a suit to be that typical webroom to you know image and I never wanted to gain muscles to grow big my body so yeah and that's one thing I want to let people know maybe I think many people transition from like they identify as gay to then become transgender they would feel so but nobody has mentioned that talked about it I was a little surprised but for this were curious about it there was the difference between these two kind of experiences it is like that you don't even need to ask straight men they were sent their pictures to you without like an unsolicited way but the point I want to make here is that I think the Asian men especially in the gay community they do because they sometimes they are portrayed as less masculine, lessness attractive not just to gay men but also to you know heterosexual girls but I just want to tell you that it's not like that I think we should try to have more self-love self-ass there's one person there we all want that approval or took it as a compliment or even a trophy you know as a verification of our beauty no you don't need to do that first of all I do think there are many Asian guys are very very attractive despite they don't you only have facial hair or they have less body hair I mean even I'm prominently attracted to those features as we all feel this way so it's not just about physical appearance and different types of physical experience are attracted in different ways to different group of people and especially to girls and to feel like because now I have a lot of experience dating these triggers I do feel it's not just about their physical appearance or attractiveness it's the whole package you know many factors many elements of faculty in that kind of situation in that chemistry and another very a little bit of sense to the topic is about the you know down there the size I think you guys really needed to it's that is not tied to any ethnicity or race according to my personal experience because you know guys do send me pictures without me asking so I was forced to see these pictures it's really not not dependent on the race on the ethnicity and you know even for for the experience pleasure it's not it's not just the size it's also all the interactions and just want to make that point

 First answer, Octavian also knows Emperor Augustus, who is the reason why Cleopatra killed herself. Second, Francis Schaeffer, he's basically the reason why the big pro-life movement started in the Protestant community and made Protestants and Christians. Of the political parties in the US.

 Man, that's my guy, Aidan, right there. Read in some of these comments, it's so encouraging, seeing you guys supporting this next generation coming up in their pursuit of Jesus. And I read some of the comments that were pretty interesting. Some of them were questioning baptism, some of them were saying, this is brainwashed, all this stuff. Listen, Aidan has an amazing testimony. God has been so faithful in his life. He's been faithful in my life and in my wife's life. And so it's been cool because seeing Aidan before this moment, he was a good kid, but we all have stuff that's going on. As you see, Aidan made the decision to be baptized. And after that moment, if you ask him, he's like, bro, my life was radically changed. Not by me, not by worship, music or by, but it was by Jesus. By Jesus Christ, his life was changed. And so it was so cool to see what God has been doing in his life. So, Aidan, I'm proud of you for standing up for your faith in a world that tells Christians, hey, you need to sit down, Aidan's standing up and he's being a leader in his school and in our community here. And so, people are wondering, hey, what's baptism? I wanna give you a brief explanation. Baptism is a physical representation of what's going on in our heart. That water resembles a grave of like, hey, when I go into this water, the old me is buried. Everything that I have been struggling with, everything that I have been, maybe that's been weighing me down, it's staying in that grave and I'm coming up and I'm made new. I'm a new person. I'm a new creation in Christ, according to Second Corinthians 517. And so, man, it's awesome. Aidan, I love you and I'm so proud of you.

The second thing I want you to do is if you have at least $200 in your account, I want you to give the equivalent five USD to this family. If you have under that, I want you to do $1.

 Most of them are already these comments, but no guesses. So, again, they only talk say a star gabbele, star w human, not in mud. Stop, stop, stop you human. So, it's not going to get better than a star movie gabbele game, because they start that story. Now, although they carry on since character, they talk nonsense. Most 90% of people with this documentary, they are bread on sheets. Very plus plus now of all of them, very plus plus. If they get by sexual offense, but they don't get by sexual offense, they only want to give a sense of what they want. But, you want to see the talks they start gabbele, star w human, not in the dark, not in the dark of the story. But, that's what I'm going to say.

----------------------------------------

Video: @faevirtu_video_7371218355040177450-Scene-002.mp4
 I'm about six months out now for my facial feminization surgery. And honestly, I feel like my entire face looks more feminine, even though we only worked on part of it. If any of you all are new and you haven't been following this journey, what I've had done is I had my brows contoured. It's called a Type 3 forehead contour. And they reduce the brow bone from the side. In the front, it's not as big of a difference, but you can probably see if you're looking at the original part of this video or the stitch from the video. So then that, what we did is we put a little bit of fat in the ball of my cheeks and then a little bit in my lips as well. And I also did some hair implants, which I think you're coming in really well. You can see kind of the difference of the longer hair up here and that as it's coming in, but it's six months, it's going to be a full year and a half before the hair implants are all like where they need to be. So that one, I have to really be patient for. The healing has gone so well. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I just couldn't have. It's, it's been wonderful. Oh, and here's a better view from the side, just like how smooth out this is. I'm just, I'm so grateful for having been able to have the surgery. It's, it has completely changed my life. It's, it's so amazing.

 I went to the run fair this year. I also went last year. It was pretty fun. I like going to art exhibits and museums I love Doctor Who and every year I go to a doctor who convention. I have a small business that I've had for five years Why sell my art cochae and jewelry? I like to look for rocks and fossils and stuff get all dulled up and go for fancy tea Go to the garden. I'm not very good at it But I do enjoy dancing. Here's me dancing with Riko Nasty. She's really nice. Here's me doing stand-up and drag I really enjoyed doing comedy used to figure skate competitively when I was little and I really loved doing it now I don't do it competitively now and I'm not very good anymore, but I find it really really fun I'm much more balanced on ice than I am on ground. I went to an oddities and curiosity's expos really fun But I go I rescued and cared for this butterfly that fell up so my building that had a crumpled wing and then when she passed away I preserved and pinned her. I love caring for the butterflies so much that I ended up getting and raising some other butterflies And then releasing them. They were so cute. I can't say I'm too interested in Taylor Swift So I guess my life is pretty boring and I'm just really normal You

Video: @findingmyvoice92_video_7364418965839416618-Scene-002.mp4
 So you know what people complain about movies and TV show or being too bold or being too political? That's never been the issue because many TV shows and movies have done this for decades They usually hide down into the guys as something else So for example in the Hunger Games The oppressive class the capital is oppressing those from the district which suggests people from different social economic status Install wars. The resistance just collected group of people fighting against their oppressive empire Now a lot of these fictional worlds of that come out and said that the districts in the Hunger Games were basically just minority groups in America or that the rebels install wars were the LGBT population Many people say me complaining that the world would not be political and woke and trying to push them to gender The thing they felt it realized especially because many of them are literally at the beginning of is that these stories are always telling that They just weren't outright coming out and saying it and so when they finally have to confront the fact That they come from a class people who are historically the villains They even want to get angry in the fences and all of a sudden I want to support through the story But you being against the empire and the capital is no different than an ally fighting in civil rights movement Even though they're not necessarily the same group of people Fighting for their rights like when you're enjoying and engaging these content you're basically Supporting people's right to live. You just don't realize it and the fact that you're actually being forced to confront it on a lot of these current media Isn't because it's because it's your force actually to find reality for the first time

 You know the crazy thing is your story reminds me of something that happened in December recently and now I'm just sitting in my own background research. So I was talking to this guy when he said he was recently on a relationship with his husband. He basically said his husband was bisexual and he decided to leave him for a woman and for that reason he wouldn't date another bisexual again. And I thought it was weird because he kept talking about it so I was thinking of bringing it back up but I was just keeping conversation with him and at one point there was a contradiction because then he mentioned that his former husband moved to Denver with his new boyfriend. I didn't call it out but I know there was something off about that I was like you said she he left you for a woman. Now he's in Denver with his new boyfriend. We actually had plans to meet during the weekend and then few days before he just blocked me but the funny thing is he gave me his phone number he told me exactly where he worked which I've been to before he's told me his regular hangout spots and where he wanted to meet me and I'm not planning on going to any of these places and seeing these there but the thing is I have enough information to research to find out who he is because now I'm starting to think maybe he never left this husband in the first place maybe this is like some kind of game he plays where he goes online pretend to connect with people just for the fun of it because the funny thing is there's a reason why men tend to get caught cheating more than women do because many of them are not very original about how to go by doing it like me and them having exact same tactics and think it's unique or smart so I don't even think it's a coincidence and my story sounds eerily similar to yours I feel like there's a pattern going on

 Just go back. I've everyone has seen this this guy's videos go back and watch it Okay, I made a video on Mother's Day about why I don't like Mother's Day and maybe the problem is just the people I've been around my entire life have done that sort of nonsense. I have been told well, you're not my mother Mother's in general mother fucker mother mother fucker Um, and like I feel like if you know somebody who is a single mother on Mother's Day I think it says a lot if you go to that mother or to the child of that mother and be like hey Did you get your mom anything? Do you want to write a card real quick? Let's go pick some flowers something? And it's the fact that like that doesn't happen and And let me explain I have never once gone with my son to the store and told him to pick me out of Mother's Day gift Because I'm the only one there with him, right? Like that's never happened. It's never happened for my birthday or for Christmas or anything one because financially I haven't been able to buy myself something and also there's something to be said about begging for the bare minimum I just like I Love my son to death and I know that my son loves me and I do not blame my son at all Not one Iota Um, I blame every adult who has been in my life since I've had a kid and hasn't Made Mother's Day a big day. I last year The person I was with I asked them if we could just go to Walmart with my kid I will give them my card if they just can get be with my kid while my kid buys something and then like Drive at home and I'll hide it in the trunk or something and that never happened So is it is it it's a genuine question?

Harrison Bucker, famous kicker for the Kansas City Chiefs just recently did a graduation speech at a Catholic college. Fun fact, Harrison Bucker himself is Catholic. So he was just pushing some of the ideas that he was taught some of the ideas that the school also benefits from. You know, they all have the same kind of ideas. By the way, if you just matter the speech because you don't like what he said, and that shows more of your character and over him

 My way that shit makes me so emotional to even look at because that was when I was in a homeless shelter completely by myself. And there's been a lot of moments in my life that I thought that I was never going to make it out the other side. And I've been alone most of my whole life, like everybody that I thought was going to be somebody end up leaving or wasn't the person that they said. And there was a lot of times that the life left my eyes. But I finally made it out. So if you need a sign, like trust me, the shit that I've been through is not anything to play with. It's not easy. Going to homeless shelters, relying on state resources is not easy. It's not safe. It's not fun. But it is way better than asking the one person that cares about you in your life. It's a very you. It's good, okay? I can't believe how much my life has changed, like if that's not a sign, if that's not a sign, go back and look through your pictures. You deserve better. You are better and you will get better.

 I thought I would like put my spin on things. Um, hello, I make content purely just on my artwork and on any outfit I think looks cool as fuck and being queer and near divergent. Um, whenever I have shared openly that I'm a near divergent queer person I am outdated with a lot of hateful messages on my common section. And it is not the pleasantest sight and I have been on and off about whether to switch off my common section due to this and then I remember, um, I once did a live stream and I was just sharing my artwork, minding my business and talking to people in the stream and I got threatened for the ban because I was sharing artwork. Yeah, TikTok make it, Godline makes sense.

 When I made that TikTok, I had just come out. It was right after Thanksgiving and before Christmas and um, you might recall it was because I'd been writing a book and my parents kept asking to read it and so I had to come out to them to explain that it was a bisexual fantasy. I didn't want to tell it. And I lost everything for a book that I thought I was just going to digitally publish on Amazon and maybe four people would read and it was really just for me. I wrote it for an audience of one. I wrote the book. I always wanted to see myself in. And at the time I didn't have this online community that I have now and for no reason at all, you turn this book that four people were supposed to see into a bestseller. I have no publishing house, no agent. You did this. And today is its birthday. Happy birthday. The night it's moon.

----------------------------------------

Video: @futurenightmareee_video_7367374983573638432-Scene-002.mp4
 Well, there's a couple of reasons why they blew up this artist, not godly artists, which is a weird term to use, a godly artist. Like are they chosen by god? I don't know dude, that makes no fucking sense. But the reason why they chose that artist for Eurovision was because she was non-binary and shows the spectrum of genders that actually exist in reality. Also, they chose her because she's representing Celtic paganism. And in Ireland, Celtic paganism is a big thing, you know, it's kind of how we got Halloween and stuff. And the kind of the point of Eurovision is to represent the country you're from in that country's culture. Like I'm sorry you want Eurovision to be all about your religion and your faith and your culture. But that's not what Eurovision is about. It's about celebrating your culture and the place that you're from. And Celtic paganism is a big part of Irish culture in history. That's nothing to do with Satanism or evil or wickedness, whatever you fucking said in this video. Ireland just chose an artist that was good at representing not only Dell GPT community, but also their culture and history. But if you want to blow up godly artists, simple. Tell them to make actually good fucking music. Music that represents the culture and society that they live in. And then maybe just maybe the Eurovision committee will choose that song to represent their country. So get out of your high horse and realize that other religions and other cultures exist in around the world. It's not all Christianity.

 I came back from a stitch regarding this video and I just wanted to like put my two cents as you're doing um but a lot of people are not getting the picture on why it can be or could typically be considered to not want to date somebody because they have multiple preferences and partners and we're not talking about body shape and size we're talking about they want to date men they want to date women they want to date non-binary they want to date trans people whatever and a lot of people are not understanding the problematic insight to their reasoning and I'm going to be here to explain it to y'all okay so we're going to talk about bisexual people my bisexual friends have dealt with this shit and so many bisexual people on the internet have dealt with this shit so let me put my two cents regarding that more of our group bisexual people are always going to get shit on because so many people that are heterosexual that are cisgender or whatever they don't feel comfortable dating a bisexual person because they have these stereotypes about bisexual relationships that have a lot of roots and just being homophobic bifobic just a big odd type of mindset okay like we got people saying like oh I don't want to date a bisexual person because I'm scared that they're going to have a bunch of diseases and it's like even if you're trying to get intimate with someone that only dates the opposite sex you all know that they could contract diseases too right I heard a lot of horror stories from straight people straight women straight men to have contracted diseases from their partner that were straight just just to be clear on that I don't want to date a bisexual person because I'm scared of them cheating on me without only a woman but a dude and it's like they could already cheat on you with the gender that you are the opposite sex what difference is that going to fucking me and we can get into the fetishization because like there's a lot of dudes that want to date like bisexual women and a lot of them are hoping that you know what maybe maybe three you know me you another woman you know that like that's a whole different story as well bottom line is that there's a lot of stereotypes with people when it comes to dating a bisexual person and unfortunately these things are rooted in homophobia these things are rooted in bifobia and a lot of people are not getting that fucking picture you're not wanting to go ahead and date somebody because of who they were with in the past or who they are interested in only for you to not understand that even if you're a straight person with another straight person that straight person is gonna fuck you over or that straight person is gonna give you diseases or that straight person is gonna do the same exact looking thing that you're afraid of a bisexual person or a pansexual person or whatever type of sexual person it is that does not only date cisgender heterosexual people and there's a thing you know like I'm not gonna stop you I'm not gonna tell you like you know oh like you should date people that are not only cisgender they're not only heterosexual or whatever you know I'm not gonna tell you to not do that at the end of the day because that's your fucking life right but I'm saying that you look really fucking dumb because the reasons that you don't want to date somebody because whether they're interested in are literally gonna be the things that will happen to you when you're dating someone that is interested in you and the sex and gender that you are at the end of the fucking day let's be fucking for real with that

 So this just means the opposite of trans. So for example, we have trans fats and cysts. It's a Latin term. She's in chemistry, it's used in biology. It's not an insult, it's not a similar, it's not a demeaning anyone. It's not intended to harm anyone. It's simply a way of talking about people who were assigned to not birds, who are still the men who so identify as women. That's all that means. And if you want to play a scheme of business with saying as a cis woman, you can do such things as a trans women, and you can stop these medicines.

----------------------------------------

Video: @genericgaymerdude_video_7375286332123401505-Scene-002.mp4
 Okay, so I had this thing happened to me, China in the similar way, but there's a queer event here in Liverpool that happens once every month. You have to pay to get in and everything. So one would assume that most people that go there are, in fact, queer, or at least part of the LGBT community in a way. So when I was there with my friends, I saw this guy that I thought was really cute, okay? He looked nerdy, but then was dancing and had this confident vibe to him. So I was immediately attracted to him and I commented with my friend, like, oh, that guy, that guy's super hot, super cute, I'm into him. And my surprise, he said, oh yeah, I know him. I was here last time I spoke to him and we hung out for a bit and he was dancing in the stage and everything. So I was like, oh, fantastic, I have my way into the conversation. So when that guy and my friend were speaking, I kind of went to them and I was like, oh, you two are friends and made conversation with the guy. And then maybe it was my mood or a drink or two, but I was more confident than average for a night out. So I said to the guy, look, you are cute, can I have your number kind of thing, right? And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, took my phone, put his number, gave me the phone back. So I was like, okay, okay, like things are going well, go grab a drink, come back to the dance floor and then I was dancing with him, right? At a certain distance, but I was dancing to him and then I tried to get closer to him to dance just with him. And as I do that, he kind of like steps back. And I took that as a sign of like, okay, maybe he's just here to kind of like vibe and have fun with his friends or whatever. And he just comes to dance and not really to meet people, I guess. So I was like, okay, no worries. Still, he's still hot, still cute, whatever. I will just vibe. The next day, I messaged the guy. Oh, like I've never seen you before on gay town, because like the queer events kind of happens in a venue that is a bit separate from the local gay bars area. So I said, look, I've never seen you around, that you usually go out, you should tag along with us next time we go out and everything. And he's like, yeah, I never go there. I'm not gay, I'm straight. And I was like, what the fuck? I had references for my friend. I was like 99% sure he was by gay, whatever, right? And I was like, look, just out of curiosity, why do you go to that event if you are straight? And he told me that he goes there because it's where he feels like he can be whatever he wants to be or dress how he wants to dress and like dance how he wants to dance without, I guess the pressures of straight culture or something? I don't know. Like my friend said that, oh, maybe he's like straight and going by or he's starting his journey or whatever, but in this case, as I take people for their work. So, you know, if he tells me he's straight, he's straight and that's it until he tells me otherwise. So it kind of like the conversation died down and I moved on, but it was such a shame because it was like the day I got confident to kind of like go to someone and ask for their number. And he knew my friend. And my friend had told me they had danced before in the stage on the queerest event in Liverpool. So I was like, you know, it's my shot, it's going to be a hit and then it wasn't. So yeah, it is what it is, right? But it's funny how even straight guys will feel the pressure of acting, you know, they have to work a certain way. So these guys going to queer events, just to escape from that world, even though he's straight. So at least he didn't have a girlfriend because he told me he was trying to get with the girls there. And funny enough, the next month I saw him again and kind of laughed about the situation. But yeah, that's it.

 Sorry, could you? Could you point that person out for me? Could you tell me who that is? Because Frank Lee That doesn't fucking happen Like sure there are hyper feminine presenting Trans guys, right and that's fine. That's perfectly fine and when they go to the links that that person in the videos talked about push up raw skirt full glam all that jazz They do not expect you to just automatically assume their correct pronouns based off of how they look they don't just expect you right away to just automatically assume the correct pronouns for them and You might accidentally this gender I'm saying accidentally because it's mostly guys really seem to care about correctly generate a lot of trans people anyways, and if we do genuinely Missed down on my accident all you have to do is apologize and Maybe ask them what pronouns I like to you It's that easy and the only reason that these videos are being made and shared and Frankly they get a lot more likes than trans positive Videos is because they're just used to slander the trans community They take these things that have happened like once or twice ever and just blast that through a megaphone to make it seem like this is an actual problem that That's an actual problem, but it's not it's just used by transphobic people to Slender trans people here.

Video: @girlishfigure_video_7365207739825409326-Scene-002.mp4
 You can, but I want you to think very hard about what kind of attention you might get after that. Because I am a queer person and I have said that to win arguments. And what I have found is that for many of these men, there is no winning for us. You will just get harassed in another way. The best way to respond to an asinine comment like that is that's okay. When you respond in a completely neutral and non-confrontational tone, they do not know what to do with it. If you say, well, I'm a lesbian, regardless of whether or not it's true, they're going to take that as an invitation to engage more in another way. And you're still not going to win. So protect your peace, be safe, and just disengage.

For let's say, you know, I like to take bubble baths, right? I enjoy that. I feel like I'm more masculine mentally, you know, like, sometimes I'm directionally challenged. Or, you know, I'm looking for something and I can't, and I can't find it because it's, but it's right in front of me. You know, I'd be thinking like a man like that, or, you know, but like emotionally, I am all feminine because I am very in touch with my emotions and I'll be crying. I don't see a lot of these men's out here crying in touch with the emotion. So, you know, I might think a little more like a man be masculine, but when it comes to my emotions, I feel like I'm very feminine.

 So hey, uh, question. Why are we at Disney World, which is a place known for, you know, families, children? Specifically, it's really a place for kids despite what Disney adults may tell you. Ew, why are we in a public place? Uh, with a bunch of kids around and families like I was saying, talking about getting our cock and balls removed. Now I'm all for being inclusive and being whoever you want to be and discussing that kind of stuff. But why are we having this discussion at fucking Disney World? Like a time and a fucking place and this isn't it. Like what's next, Lily Tino. Join us next week for talking about getting my asshole bleached at the local children's park. But you know what's funny, even through all this, even through everyone calling you out on this, yourself and others are really so fucking delusional.

 It doesn't really matter who the targeted audience is. I don't really care if he was speaking to a bunch of people that agreed with him. What he was saying was wrong. The rhetoric this guy was saying is genuinely dangerous and needs to be like... Bit in the butt, butt, whatever. My point is you can't just be calling the gays sinful degenerates and making women's main focus beyond baby making because that's just not where we are and it shouldn't be where we are.

 So this guy's a little confused on why Chris from Mr. Beast tried to live his life as a man and Trying to be a father and a husband Very easy answer actually It's still incredibly Not accepted in the world to be transgender It's still seen his freakish weird people are still hate crime to kill just for being friends So when all you hear your entire life is anti LGBTQ You write a rig you want to disassote your say this is so it's this associate yourself You want to disassociate yourself from them from LGBTQ plus people because you don't want that hate You don't want to be hated against so you pretend like You did those feelings you have don't exist and you Try to live the life that people have placed on me And that's why Chris did that and Don't want to put words in them out, but she was probably like I don't care what help people will react to this. I want to be happy So she Came out as how she really is so Let that be a message to all you others Be who you are be happy

 This blatant NFL PR with Travis and Taylor is like literally just so obvious. It's like so funny.

They won the Super Bowl before this Super Bowl. That never, that line never liked. I never liked because I was like that's an uneven true.

 normalize changing your opinion when you learn new information. You guys literally got me in the comments of that video. I found out so much new information. This is why I love gaylers because we all are thinking about different things and then we can share it and I didn't even think about some of this stuff. Even I forget that Taylor Swift sometimes is like, gay or then I think she could possibly be. Shame on me for assuming that she would have like one song that's not queer in her discography. And after listening again, it is so ironic and sarcastic. Do you want to marry kiss or kill me? I'm hoping for all three. She's like, kill me. What? That's actually so crazy. The more you guys like pointed it out and the more I listen to it like, do you want to marry kiss or kill me? I want to be killed because I cannot. And then the song after it is, I hate it here. Yeah, I just think the entire song is like super sarcastic and ironic and like, yeah, it's a really immature relationship that I'm having and this is not actually fulfilling what I need in like an actual serious long term relationship. Like this person doesn't necessarily like really know me. She goes, it's true. So where scouts honor, she's like, promise it's true. Guys, I swear this is a real relationship. I promise. I promise.

This is the third time she's sung it Gaylers are literally eating so well And they're both in Paris tonight by the way when I say both I mean Taylor Swift and Garlic She also seems so much more like emotional and angry this time. She's son. Oh Last thing she wore orange dress for the surprise song tonight and then her other Surprise song dress was pink Everything she's doing is just like creating the lesbian flag like with all of her colors of orange and pink I'm just like I she's being really loud right now.

 Okay, I know I'm late to this and I'm deeply sorry, but I just have one thing to say and that's one tough thought Because Taylor Swift and Taylor Nation are being so obvious at this point. It's like actually comical. They're being so loud with what Taylor is trying to tell us and means from Swifties to aren't saying seeing it like They're confirming the ears to her is not Taylor's version, right? She's doing performance art Taylor Swift writes from the male perspective. She's James, which we already have she writes about women Like that literally acknowledges that she's writing about women romantically and Like Swifties just like aren't seeing it. I don't know. It's so crazy to me I always feel like Taylor is trying to be like so obvious to the point where it's Comical if people don't see how gay she is Like the fact that the galer theory is continuously Get proven correct I don't know just a good day. It's been a good month to be a galer

 Until you all stop comparing your lives, your gay lives to other straight people, you will never live a happy gay life. And I'm sorry, I know it's not like a fucking banach about like, honestly, being clear, I feel no matter the circumstances that I face, I think it is so much better than living like a lot of these straight people who have no sense of understanding of other people from different backgrounds. I would much rather be gay and have this type of life than be straight and completely be so ignorant to other people's circumstances. Like, I'm just saying, until you guys really accept your life for being gay and continue to find a way to be happy and gay, you will never be happy being gay.

 girl no no now to next-in I get what he means but like in the same tone in the same context he's perpetuating the dangerous narrative with what he's saying so basically the reason why he believes that trans women should not be a lot of women's restrooms is because the fear of them hurting little children because they were once biological men first and to an extent I kind of like understand where it's coming from but in the same context trans women at once again are not men they're not men they do not think the way that a lot of these biological men do they do not see the water and the way that a lot of these other biological men do and it's perpetuating this dangerous ass narrative that queer people or trans people are in a pile and it's just like what a narrative that has long been falsely tied to the queer community from straight people and it's just like really gross and it's awful not only that but the huge reason why other people are agreeing with him is because he's assembling the straightness and straight people let it when gay people is somebody straightness and they can use us as a puppet to perpetuate a narrative that is fucking wrong when a lot of these are APE cases and cases against children are committed by self-identifying straight men and like it's just wrong and I do not this video is weird and to be honest I think it lacks a lot of thought process I get ways coming from but in the same tone it's weird

It's weird because the closest thing a lot of y'all are to masculine is Arcele from the little mermaid that's one thing Secondly a lot of you post on how the self is in your tick tock lip sing in the song and shit like that That is not the most masculine thing to do either Like I would think you'd be out here by creating a shit and hiking on mountains To prove a masculinity, but no your posting shit to Lana Del Rey Like what and the thing is like I'm not talking by him specifically like I'm not talking about his post at all I'm talking about the other people that do this that really aren't mask that truly are just fembotoms and like they don't want to accept it Or femtops or whatever and they don't want to accept it like girl the cost come from inside the house I don't think we're mad at you. I think you're mad at yourself Like I said, I'm not coming for him. I think he's innocent and a lot of this I'm coming for the people that think that they're mask when they're really not and they want to say that in the mask for mask But they're not it's just a tie girl. You're not even your own type what let

 Now I love this creator this is no shade to the creator Oh, that originally was telling y'all about the situation But uh, yeah, I got to stop making these fucking narratives about these straight me That man is not no motherfucking victim, okay? First of all, I'm pretty sure he from the sound. I don't know this in Memphis But I'm from Memphis and then look like some Memphis niggas and then look like a Memphis ass ghetto ass situation So Southern niggas first of all, he wouldn't have came out to his baby mama. Hey, he not got caught, okay? And one way in order for him to say face what to make his name is though he was a victim Period because he had an opera he knew that the baby mama was possibly going to expose the shit And he had to get her head of the narrative We're not gonna sit up here and act like straight me and our not my new ability And we don't and they don't plot his skin to get ahead of storylines They utilize patriarchy and they utilize y'all because y'all be I don't know why y'all can't frustrate me and stuff And maybe because y'all want y'all a deal niggas up here y'all want this to be y'all storyline and like I said, there's no shame to the creator there was just you know doing But I'm talking about the email focus in the street, okay? I don't know what's y'all obsession with cap and flee straight niggas, but They do what they want to do, okay? This is not no motherfucking victim. He was not no child. He was a grown-ass man I know straight niggas if a straight nigga come on to another straight nigga They're not allowing it to happen period if they play on some gay shit It's gay shit going on. What the fuck is she talking about? He was a subtle bitch, please When the nigga was buggering over his motherfucking head He had opportunity to be like a quick plan with you bro or being like Hmm, I wonder what's his head now and he was like he was wondering what the fuck was he known and now he fucking Wee-chaw that got a whole all-e-fans career. That's not victim vibes. It's not this is a grown-ass man This is not no docile woman that no no that was taking advantage of no boo Now the nigga might have been plotting on the nigga, but I mean if he was already gay Y'all Come on Before y'all try to chunk my ass in the motherfucking comments. There are men They can be victims of sexual assault Unfortunately, I don't believe this motherfucking narrative just by I'm an angle house I'm just a book by smoke for the cover just like y'all doing y'all looking at the evidence in y'all judging the shit from what the fuck y'all have New y'all prior knowledge and bitch my prior knowledge has led me to motherfucking believe that she's cap and This is me

Video: @ilovetheater24601_video_7369270445712903454-Scene-002.mp4
 Go watch his video for further context, but basically what he's saying in this video is that using They then pronouns for binary trans person is misgendering And I could not agree with that more, but something that he says is that he often sees it in terms of like talking about trans people They don't like and that is not where I see it the most where I see it the most in my life is people who don't want to out other trans people and this pisses me off more like to no end right? Because by using they then pronouns you were outing them as some form of trans maybe not binary trans but keep in mind that non binary is the trans umbrella and It just it pisses me off because they them in a binary trans person to not out them It's just outing them while also misgendering them stop it

They're happy and springy so I keep reaching for them So I just decided to embrace it for this project and do a literal pride flag But my question is if I find the other colors in my sash should I try to make a few other pride flags? I think I might be able to do a non-binary one and probably the trans pride flag Like just from the colors I know I have off the top of my head But I think it could be a fun series just like go through and make a bunch of pride flags with the yarn that I have

 Okay, so picture this you get engaged you are happy you're excited you you know are thinking of all the things that you have to do to get ready for your wedding and one of those is who's going to be my brides. Okay, so you pick you you feel really good about it right and things that things are cool for a couple months right then you decide that you're going to leave your job because it's incredibly toxic and it's making you want to you know yourself. And your friends are like yeah, I know that's a great decision like follow your heart do the right thing. Then the day after your birthday one of the messages you and says you know the things have changed we just we can't be friends in the same way and I've got to go. Okay, now this was like my best friend. She's my maid of honor. She wasn't only bridesmaid. Then one of the other ones that was there at your work just ghosts you they just trickle away they don't don't make a beep. Okay, so then a couple months go by other stressful things are happening life is not going away that you would really like it to I feel like it's not for anybody but whatever. And then one of your other bridesmaids who was also a close friend starts to bail on you she starts to you know not communicate the ways that she used to she you know she would reach out. I was going to be doing all of a sudden she's not doing that so you say what's up right because I am a person who likes communicate and I like to know where people are at. So it's okay what's not nothing. I promise everything's okay. Okay, flash forward to a few months after that I get another long message that's like hey you know the various reasons I just can't be here when that's the third person. Okay, so I I took a moment to pause on that and I waited to respond to her I thought of like a really you know a nice message that like allowed me to speak my truth but also didn't hurt her and she responded with nothing but hatred and so that makes three people that I am no longer associating with at all. And then the night before the person message me and it was the only the only a person who communicated with me in a way that allowed us to keep our friendship because I felt that they valued our friendship. So I had six bridesmaids and then I lost four of them I have one replacement but I went for six to three and like those people were very close friends of mine and I just don't understand why people say yes to commitments and then when they can't keep them make it seem like it's the other person's fault. So I'm getting married to you the way you know and the people who are meant to be there will be there but people ain't shit.

 It's been two weeks since I posted that video and yeah it's been crazy. I obviously could not have anticipated the amount of response that I'd get to that and it's sad really to think that there are so many people out there who are struggling and I promise I will stop making videos about this but it is blowing my mind a little bit because like what can we do? As adults it's so hard to make friends but there are so many of us that are there just wanting to make friends and I wish I do something about it like on a big scale but on a smaller scale I have made a WhatsApp group which is at the minute about 150 people and I've made a Discord server which is about 100 people and it's just been amazing to see people interact with each other to see people having a laugh. I've not laughed so much in such a long time. We've had among us nights with her call of duty, we've had many many voice notes in the WhatsApp and people who said I'm scared to join, I'm nervous to join, what if no one likes me? I'm now in there every day chatting, talking, sharing pitches, talking about our gardening, talking about books it's just been incredible. I've tried pretty hard to make sure that I've replied to every single message, every single comment and I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me in whatever way from this if I have missed your comment, if I have missed your message I'm sorry I'm really trying to get through everything. It's just been like on a level that I just don't I never knew could even be a thing. I don't know how influences to it because this is a full-time job just just applying to to these messages but not in a bad way in the best way because it's so great to meet people and it's been just fantastic. So once again if you want to join the WhatsApp if you want to join the Discord please send me a direct message or if you just want a friend please just send me a message, it doesn't have to be that you join the groups. If you just want someone to chat to I am here but if you do want to join the groups I can guarantee you that there is an amazing person or people, multiple in both of those groups they just want to be your friend.

 Not elementary school, but high school. I had an English teacher that was very religious, made it known, would read his Bible in class, and he taught English. He wanted us to write a controversial paper, so I wrote about gay marriage being legal. And at this time, I wasn't even out, I wasn't even exploring that side of my sexuality. I was dating men. So I wrote over a really good paper. It was so good. I used verses from the Bible, evidence, research, the whole nine yards. I got my paper back, and it had a big fat E on it, and then on the back in red, like bleeding, pen, he wrote, why would you want a man, and a man, or a woman, and a woman to be together? It's like a dog and a human being together. It just doesn't make sense. So I took it home, and I showed my mom she was. She asked him to call her the next night, and he called her, and they talked about it, and my mom basically cost him out, because he was grading on his beliefs, not the paper itself. So then he was forced to regret my paper, and I got to be. Hi, Mr. Lener.

 I find it so funny when people get upset with me when I correct them on my pronouns. Like why are you so offended that I just want to be referred to correctly? And not only that is just to help you get out of the habit of calling me something that I don't want to be called. So then you don't have to keep using the excuse, oh you know like I've been calling you this for so long. Yadda yadda yadda yadda. Okay well let's help that. Let's get you into the practice of using my pronouns. You don't have to be annoyed or frustrated when I correct you. It's just a small correction just do it and move on. I feel like when the extra stuff happens you're making it a bigger deal about it than I am when I'm just simply making a small correction.

 So, there's two life fucking hate with the passion, Chalkin Brighton and Heaven in London. Heaven, call themselves a queer venue, and have a gay club, yet all deny entry to anybody. Well, this is mostly for club nights as well. They all deny entry to anybody and they don't think it looks queer. Like, this is meant that lesbians and non-binary people have both of them two prominent groups that I know over the late entry, because I was a little into the exciting thing I looked queer. Like mostly that applies to your club nights by just fucking hate with that venue. They would have a massive swiking problem there. And Chalkin Brighton as well, Access is terrible, the floor is terrible, like it's a flat floor and venue is just rough. Security of terrible, oh my god. Like, I went there last year for another twins on I Bired and which we got, I basically went and found a biophosphate ever. I had left halfway through which we was certain, because I had a panic attack when someone was awful to me and security just pointed out to the right way out.

 I think we sincerely need to stop allowing individuals with a shit ton of money tell us the philosophical underpinnings of enlightenment that comes with an education because running into another person on a green field while hundreds of people in a colosseum like setting does not give enlightenment it gives a legalized form of violence for entertainment and why such an individual should be even remotely talking about concepts of enlightenment and the journey that an education brings is ridiculous.

 They're obviously plenty of reasons to not like anything that has fallen out of this band's mouth for purely ideological reasons. But I get more frustrated by their logic or lack thereof. He's sitting here professing this dream of a family that is thriving on Judeo-Christian values, which means that mothers need to be at home nurturing and taking care of kids, which if you want to, cool, if you don't, cool. At the same breath rails against the very politicians and people who are putting together policies that would make it easier for families to stick together and not have economic anxiety. It's the people he supports that are doing everything they possibly can to make sure that two people have to leave the home 40 plus hours a week in order just to afford that home and the groceries that go in it. So perhaps maybe if he really cares, if he truly cares about making sure that stay at home moms can stay at home, then maybe push for policies that allow a single person to support a entire family in terms of income and benefits. But something tells me he's not going to do that.

Thank you so much What's so funny is his commencement speech is essentially exactly what right-wing Ideology is but they try to parse it out as if things are totally separate when they're completely put together They're gonna lie and say something like abortion has nothing to do with controlling a woman's body It has everything to do with just protecting the unborn But here he is talking about the concept of Contraception and abortion and linking it directly to what he views a woman should be doing with her life And the thing they think you should be doing is not having an independent equal voice inside of society inside of your places of work inside your places of worship inside of your government and that is what is still dangerous

 I knew it was only a matter of time before. The algorithm fed me one of these. Raising your voice and having a pointed angry tone doesn't make anything you're saying remotely correct, by the way. The problem is when people say things like that, they can't actually define the very thing that they think they're defining. We often get asked what a woman is, and I just sort of turn the question around back on them, what is you define it, you define what a woman is. And especially when you give it the adjective of biological, what does that even mean? Like, please, someone give me a concrete definition as to what biological woman means. Because if you reduce biological to body parts, then you're not accounting for the fact that there are variations in hormones, there's also variations in chromosomes, and not all of those things sync up perfectly, so there.

 I don't know if it's willful ignorance or if it's a lack of neurological activity in her cranium or if it's Because she feels as if she's accepted within a certain group of people But the amount of internal frustration I feel whenever I hear something like this it is Is as an itemy. She's literally separating out the sexes segregating them into a binary and telling them what their jobs are She's literally debating a man who based off of her own gender ideology. She is not equal to So she is literally reaping the fruits of labor from women behind her women today and women tomorrow To support a system of misogyny that oppresses her and that is what is still frustrating to me That she can't see that

 I would like to believe that you are not homophobic. But I think the bare minimum of proving you're not homophobic is staying away from jokes that are circulated by large swaths of people today as not a joke, but direct evidence against people like me. Because I was raised by a very evangelical woman and she always taught us to stay away from gay people because they were possessed and a danger to children. And when you get pumped full of that, you start to believe it even as you start to realize that you are in fact gay yourself. So when my little sister was born when I turned 13, I refused to hold her for the first two to three years of her life because I was terrified that I was hurt her because of that joke.

 If you have not already seen the original video, go watch it before it gets deleted. For context, this man goes to a Chinese buffet and is dissatisfied with his experience. If you hadn't already guessed, that video is a hot mess. And it is racially charged among other things. Content creators on here have already called him out for his racism. But you know, I figure I'm here, I might as well chime in and I'm going to call him out on his sexism. So often. Gay men feel like they are somehow magically exempt from being misogynistic. Newsflash, they're not. Just because you don't want to sleep with women does not mean that you are not active participants in the patriarchy. On multiple occasions, this man refers to his waitress as the B word and not in like a cute country way. No, no, just in the like sexist man way, not cute. It infuriates me as a member of the LGBTQ community, seeing entitled rich gay men, but their whole chest confidently, thinking that they're vindicated in being pieces of shit. Don't even get me started on the class of this video to it's 2024. What are you doing not tipping and complaining about customer service? The level of self absorption is astronomical. It is insufferable. It really paints a very clear picture of how centered you are in your version of the world.

 So, I want to start off by saying that I am fully supportive of children being exposed to LGBT people and being taught about equality and inclusivity. However, what the Creator is doing talking about genitals at a kid's theme park is not okay. Talking about genitals should only be done between a parent and a child, or if a child is in a sex ed or health class. You even know that is wrong because in the beginning of the video, you said that you were going to get banned from Disney for talking about this. As an LGBT person, I am disgusted. This is the reason why people think that we are predators and this is why we have a bad name. Stop it.

 So also as the invitation I was on the travel assignment it was my last week in that state. I had met my now wife. We were a thing for about a week. Of course it was the last week on my assignment. Then I went back home. We continued to talk and about a month and a half later she asked me to be a girlfriend but only until she could come to me in person. I filed for or was legally separated within a month to five weeks. I ended up having a relationship and filed for divorce within six weeks. I went to see her travel across the country. 16 hours to see her. I was supposed to stay for two weeks and I never left. I moved across the country, drove back one time, got all my stuff and left everything I had ever known to be with her and brought my two little dogs and moved across the country to be with her with her mother, divorce, me and her are now married. When you know everything happens for a reason. Also to give some context my 12 year relationship and marriage was to a man and within that six weeks I came out and gay and moved across the country and lost 90% of my friends and all of my family and everything I had known for my entire life. But she was worth absolutely everything and I have the most beautiful life. When you know you absolutely know. Before everybody freaking comes for me. My ex at the time knew about my relationship and knew about my girlfriend actually helped me get ready for a date. So before everybody wants to say that I'm this big cheater and have this huge affair to each their own whenever you want to call it. But I did not go behind anybody's back.

 VP for this wedding is by scanning the QR code on me like
----------------------------------------

Video: @itsgeorgiamarie_video_7366315326922820897-Scene-002.mp4
 So this woman is basically complaining that she's receiving invite to a wedding and her Nan and Mum have also received a new letter wedding and she's mad because the only way RCP is through a QR code and as a 2020 24 bride who has also given the only way to RCP on my invites through QR code, I have some thoughts and the first thought is why are we so quick to dismiss that older people can learn how to use technology? Like their older, they're not in nets, like they still have brains, they can learn to use technology, like my 97 year old Nan like we sat down with her and showed how to do it and she was like oh that's really cool, they're really easy, I'll know how to do that again in the future, that's it, that's all it takes, like old people they're not stupid, they can learn how to do things and also like if somebody really doesn't know how to use QR code or maybe doesn't have the technology to be able to use it which I know some people don't, I really don't care if people just drop me a text to be like, by the way, didn't really know how to use it so just let you know we can come and then I asked them what food they want because that's one of the choices on the QR code and that's it, it's done, for me as a bride doing QR code has been so much easier than anything else because I don't have to like it just all goes into a Google form then goes into a spreadsheet form or may I like look at the responses put in spreadsheet and that's it, so for like me as a bride it saves so much admin because I'm not constantly chasing people up like it's easy, most people receive the invite and just did it straight away, it takes 30 seconds. The main reason why me and my fiance decided to go with QR code over the traditional like post it back is because postage is so free expensive now, like we weren't about to ask people to go to the post office to post the letter or go and buy a whole book of stamps just to send us our invite back because like most people don't have stamps in their house nowadays, like especially young people like I personally don't, I don't remember last time I used stamps, so I'm not going to ask people to go and go all the way to post office, buy stamps, post it and with the state of our postal system right now who knows if things will even apply, reply, even arrive back here, like really like is it going to? Probably not, then I'm going to be chasing people up and it's just going to be an nightmare, like QR code speaking for a bride's perspective is so much easier, so much easier, I don't get the problem, I really don't.

They be living outside their means and they think they got it like that, but they don't. The second bucket is the girls that got a sugar daddy. You know, they look cute, so they got an older man paying for, you know, they're good drag and they're good trips like Shangela allegedly. And then there is the third bucket. Those are the gays that have that remote job, that pays them really well, always in some sort of tech industry and they're just working remote remotely in a different country. And then there's a fourth bucket, which is a new age bucket. Those are the gays that are on vacation, but they still working girl because they are those working girls. There's the only fans' gays and they're creating content where the other gays are in making them, they're putting over your all these nice places. So they still working girl, they're just working in luxurious places because set workers work, okay mama.

 Right, I actually want to tell this story because it is quite funny. So, college summer show, third year, and the head of our college, what are all the boys in the college, just seeing Barry Man alone want boys. I don't know why, it's just like her favourite song. Anyway, so we all go to studio together, we all, and she's like everyone please learn this song. We go away and the head of like musical theatre arrangements, whatever the college was like, I think it's a better idea if we put together that song with another song, make it's amazing arrangement, it'll be really cool. So he picks a load of us singers in the college, puts together some amazing arrangement, mixture of boys and girls, it was like a mix of his like queen songs, it's a really really cool at school anyways. So we go to the head of the college to present this song to her and in front of everyone, we start singing it. This one boy, my who's lovely guy, he got picked to just have the first line, open the song and as he's singing it, the head of our college is stood in front of him going, no, no, stop, stop, like, wait a minute, I'm just going to stop, stop, stop, not like that, not like that, and this poor boy stood there like, oh my god, she's like no, no, I don't want it sung like that, he's like, okay, well what do I do? And she just turns and looks at me and goes, darling, you sing it. And I was like, okay, so I go over, I start singing it, but she's like, yes, yes, that's how I want to. So this poor boy's been shoved off to the side, I put in the middle, she's like, yeah, that is it, that's how I want it. So then in front of the whole college, we had this big rehearsal every like Thursday, where we'd perhaps the show, she makes everyone stand to the side. She's like, darling, I'm going to get up, she goes, darling, go and stand up there, so she puts me like facing the back. She's like holding me, she's like, stand there, face the back, there's going to be a spot like on you, you're going to start the song and you're going to slowly turn around and start singing the song, so I'm like this, and I'm walking to the back, going to all my friends. Because like, I wasn't like a favorite in college, like I didn't really get picked for like all the leads and everything. Apart from actually the head of college, you really like to make shoes to put me in things. But like, other than that, I wasn't like the person who would always be picked, so everything was like, what is going on? So I'm walking to the back, like, I go to the back, spot like on me. What was it starting singing it like that? And I've actually got a clip, I'm going to put it in. Oh my God, this is it, this is it. Here we go, cutting goes up. One, four, four. Me, star. Singing it, talk. No, that is enough of that, but it is an absolute iconic story within my friends. For evermore, I just called myself the one voice of name, because I was the one voice.

 In Hohokla, I could be revealed, but I just stumbled upon this video and it actually makes sense what the post is saying. If we all should indulge in this LGBT, HDMI, Hutas, then it is the extinction of the human race. What I also think is that the reason why governments are so LGBTQ, pro, pro LGBT, you know, because they are a positive population and the more people that become homosexual, the less babies they will be. In vitro, we should have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be natural byking all babies. So the human race will eventually go extinct if we, you know, do this shit.

 Hey so I see that this video has got an attention of some people and I just wanted to come out and say that thank you to the people that gave attention to the video. My mother and I had like a problem we weren't counting with this month and we have a depth of approximately 400 years. And I don't really know what to do because we are not wealthy. We are like middle class. And I don't know. So well if you want to help in any way you can stream my music on Spotify. You can buy my musical bandcamp even if you want to donate on PayPal or something. That's good. But just by sharing this video and sharing my music on Spotify you are doing a lot. Thank you so much to everyone.

 Oh man, I hooked up with this one guy and I didn't find out till after the fact that he Had gone to prison for first-degree murder Mind you, I was in my early 20s and an active addiction. So naturally I was intrigued But I did want clarification because I didn't really sit well with me Although he was initially charged with first-degree murder It was brought down to a lesser charge because he didn't actually commit the murder He was just driving the getaway car of his friend who then murdered somebody But yeah, I never talked to him again after that Thank God I finally found my husband because it is scary out there.

 Back in 2021, the years that I graduated, are a class of a senior prank. But it was only a handful of students. They didn't even get all of the class to do it. Half of us were unaware that it even happened until the night after. They decided to put cereal down the toilets and clog them, which took hours for the janitors to clean. And then they decided to trash a teacher's room that we no longer had because she wasn't in our grade level. But she decided to trash that teacher's room because they didn't like her. I didn't like her either, but I did not see that as justification to trash her room. And essentially just created a disgusting mess for janitors and that teacher you pick up afterward. And they almost didn't walk because of it.

And I was like oh I feel so bad for you and we literally had like a heart to heart chat and then literally in the same conversation she told me how she beat up her disabled sister. Like her sister literally had the mentality of like a three year old. Like her sister is very handicapped and literally cannot get around on her own and she beat her and dragged her by her hair because she just didn't like her. Later came up she had lied to her family about her uncle saying her and the reason that they found out is because they were like oh my they took it seriously and they were going to call a cops and she was like no no I was just faking it because that's what I tell people and in her parents' picture out because she would frequently be like a child. I've seen her once so fun.

 That was Trans Content Creator, Lily Tino, talking about her gender reassignment surgery while sitting on a veranda outside at Disney World. The video has gone viral and is getting a lot of negative responses and rightly so because nothing irritates me more than a self-serving advocate. Lily is very much aware that what she has just done is inappropriate in the environment in which she has done it. There is nothing wrong with talking about gender reassignment, surgery and educating people at an elementary level in the way that Lily was doing so in the video. There is everything wrong with the environment that Lily chose to do it in and Lily knows that because Lily continuously says in the video I'm going to get thrown out of Disney World for doing this because Lily knows that talking about sexually explicit content, talking about adult genitalia in an environment that is specifically for children and families is a really bad idea. It is an inappropriate thing to be doing. But the thing with Lily is Lily doesn't care because her content is intentionally rage-baiting the transphobes and is intentionally rage baiting the internet to engage with her videos so that she could potentially get finance or she just gets lots of views. Maybe she just enjoys pissing everybody off. I don't know but it's an intentional strategy tactic so that people pay Lily specifically attention. It has nothing to do with the desire to educate people on trans issues or on gender reassignment, surgery. It has everything to do with the fact that Lily wants to center themselves and enrage people and rage bait people on purpose so that they'll engage with her and she'll be benefited from it. Potentially by finances because it doesn't matter if your content is being engaged with negatively or positively on TikTok. You're still going to get compensation if you get over a certain amount of engagement. And nothing annoys me more than seeing an advocate do that to their community on purpose because we all know this has nothing to do with transgendourism. That is not why people are angry at you. People are angry at you because you are talking about adult genitalia in a children's environment which is inappropriate regardless of your gender. If you are cis, if you are trans, if you are non-binary talking about genitalia in an environment saturated with young people, it's completely inappropriate behavior. And I do not want to hear the argument of it's appropriate anyway, we need to educate on trans rights and stuff. Listen, you cannot be talking about genitalia like that in Disneyland in front of families because you couldn't do that if you were cis. If I sat there and talked about my knob in the middle of Disneyland, no one's going to be very impressed with me either. You know, it's inappropriate. So the content is not what's wrong. It's the environment that you're doing it in. And Lily knows that and Lily is selling out intentionally to the rage betters to prove point to herself that she can get this content to skyrocket and go viral. That's what this is about. And in doing so she is throwing the community, the trans community under the bus because there are trans people and queer people who have fought and who work incredibly hard every day of their lives to try and undo the damage of history and undo and unpick the myths about trans genderism, about queerness, by actually educating people properly. Lily is not trying to do that. Lily is trying to anger people on purpose and in doing so in a child, like a child friendly environment, Lily is playing straight into the hands of the trans folks and she knows it. She is helping to perpetrate the myths that trans people are inherently dangerous around kids. JK Rowling is going to look at this sort of content and use it and weaponize it against the trans community and Lily doesn't care as long as Lily's videos are getting likes and engagement. It has nothing to do with wanting to educate people about transgender issues. It has everything to do with Lily doing this on purpose the Lily's own self and it just makes my blood boil to think about all of the trans people and the queer people who are going to go to Disney, weren't land or work at Disneyland who are going to be confronted by other people now because of this video because we all know that negative content like this about the trans community is going to go far more viral than anything positive. And so people are going to be walking through Disneyland now and when they see a trans person be that a visitor or be that unemployed, they are just going to think about this video because Lily has done this on such a viral scale in rage so many people with such intent that this is going to be the first thing that people think about when they see a trans person at Disneyland. Lily has single-handedly raised question marks for all of the Disney parents who see Disney in their algorithm all of the time as to whether or not trans people are safe to be around whether or with their kids. That is what Lily has done because it is naive to believe that everyone is aware of trans issues and everyone is a bigger that is not the case. A lot of people are not aware of trans issues and if you're just a family with kids you know and it's just not on your radar whatsoever and this is the first thing that you see maybe you're planning a vacation in the algorithm, throw this this up, you are going to be immediately jumping to transphobic and homophobic rhetoric in your own head. Lily has provided the foundation for hatred towards trans people she has helped to perpetrate and solidify and validate that myth that has been age old that queer people are inherently dangerous to kids and that is disgusting because Lily is doing it for her own benefit. This has nothing to do with education nothing at all. This is not progressive for the trans movement this is not freedom and if you think that because you're queer, because you're trans and you can talk about these things wherever the hell you want to talk about them then you really need to have a look at yourself and go this is not appropriate. You can talk about anything in the right setting and children do need educating on trans issues absolutely we need to teach children about gender we need to teach children about different people from different walks of life but we don't need to be doing it unprofessionally inappropriately while they're on a family holiday or day out with you know talking about genitals and doing it in the way that you are talking about your marshmallow tunnel you know it's in a appropriate and that's the issue it's got nothing to do with the content because you can educate children on this but not at Disneyland not against the wills of those around them you know it's just inappropriate and it makes my blood boil to think that Lily has done so much harm with this video on purpose on purpose go on their TikTok and look at all of their content it is intentionally rage-baiting Lily benefits from people getting angry at her and so she plays is into it and in doing so massively damages her own community but it's okay because she benefits and that is just it's so disgusting

 VHS date guys, really millennials, I am fucking disappointed. I am so fucking disappointed right now. But could call on the Goonies? And yes, I want to watch the Goonies. So now you either live it in digital format because we made digital formats for a particular reason. Because if I'm going to find that the VHS tape has not been rewinded, I am going to hunt you down. I will make sure that tape makes it up to your fucking brain from your ass. And then destroy your hands and something will happen to your mouth too. So you will not be able to do a speech to command features. You will have to either use your nose or your elbows in order to try to use your phone. And we all know that you can also buy without your phone or internet. We build the internet. We made the internet. We were writing HTML, JavaScript, CZ Plus, everything. I was crutch. I know how to hug an account. I know how to get an IP address. I know how to to trace it and what to use. Please don't make me don't make me. It takes extra five minutes of my time time that I'd rather be spending like minding my own fucking business. I like to be left alone But if you're going to invoke Gen X, Gen X is going to show up. Don't make it. But that's one thing for sure. We'll protect your firm boomers. There's more than fuckers. Tape. What the fuck? Deja from it. Goonies.

 Republicans have to be really careful in regards to what the wish for now is that if a convicted felon is able to run for office, then a convicted felon doesn't have to disclose whether they want to rent your property or they want to work out your business or they want to carry a gun or they can vote or carry a gun on your business. And these are the things that basically we do not allow convicted felons to do. So all the prisons will be able to vote and we know how Republicans are severe and punishment. Do you think that it's going to help them? Interesting. Very interesting.

 So I think our great gay granddaddy George Ticai might have something to say about this particular thing now The reason that I bring this up is because of the simple fact that in this video that you can't see the full length of this young man Says that he thinks that people who are hobos should go live in a camp now the reason I bring up George Ticai Okay, sorry still don't know what his name has say his last name if If you the reason why I am bringing him up is because he was a part of one of the most kind of Questionable things that the United States has done in its history. It's not questionable. It was awful But the long and short of it is it's between about February of 42, 1942 and March of 1946 There were these internment camps that popped up around the United States and the people who were in them bared a Resembrance to those of the Asian descent. It was Asians that were in these internment camps and during that time about 125,000 294 people were in these internment camps and there was about 75 of them now I say about because you know I don't feel that everybody was like headcounted You know, so the number could be higher it could be lower, but I'm probably guessing it's gonna be on more higher and because you know the United States likes to downplay its history and You know you you thinking that people going over and having to go into a Camp because they are less desirable or you fear them or whatever it is It's it's giving that I never went to history vibes. I never went to class vibes But you know not only did you poke the eye of one community You also poke the eye of another because the LGBTQ community is also one of those people's and groups that are affected by homelessness especially our baby gays are youngsters They they deal with homelessness a lot because many are kicked out of their homes or other issues from assault to There are many things that are plaguing our young baby gays But the long and the short of it is that you decided to stick a finger in both their eyes and act willfully ignorant I'm sorry, but to me that is just ridiculously stupid because in a day and age where we have so much Information at our fingertips. There is no way on guts green earth that you couldn't look these things up and educate yourself about them but No people who are homeless should or how flists or hobos as you call them should not be rounded off and taken out somewhere else You know sadly enough There are a lot of people who are not drug addicts who are not mental health cases That are homeless and are struggling to survive You could have used anything you could have went on and said that the that the Income rate threshold should be hired due to the ideas that I don't know It's really different with inflation and other issues that are impacting incomes You could have gone on to say things about that that they should be raising it so that people could get better services or could get You know help in different manners, but no you didn't say that You just decided to go on to the internet and act fucking stupid so that you could get rage bait and clicks well you got one you know and If anything this is taught to you I Think maybe you know a little humbling and a little learning your history would go a long way but I hope that you have the day that you deserve and Maybe learn your history

 Hey bro, this isn't for you. Out of all people, you matter the straight man saying, where's the good woman that broke? You don't even like women, bro. But why are you speaking on this? All the black women out there who be like, oh, I'm taught all these men saying, where the good woman that this is a white man saying to the bro. Y'all be stuck in a category where y'all think it's just black people, black men who say shit like this. It's the little group on y'all side of social media. That's the way y'all see. This is every group, every group talk about shit like this. Money, finances, dating, all this shit. It's not just black people. It's a black person with their own mind, bro. I'm so glad I'm not a follower like a lot of y'all, bro. Because y'all getting to this thing, this mental where y'all think everybody's the same, bro. See, I'm confused, but not like you was, you know, when you was freaking out what you know, what you like and all that. So I'm confused on why you didn't upset and saying, I was just making a stitch to this white guy who just simply asking, hey, where's the good woman? Because when a woman does it, any type of woman, a black woman, whoever, don't melt a color. When they do it, it's okay. All the girls getting the group and be like, it ain't none child. They y'all taking, get it, get your white man, y'all the y'all the y'all the y'all. But, but when the white man makes a bit like this, you're like, oh, my God. What's the, is it crazy? Y'all don't be liking that, bro. A lot of y'all probably surprised that he even said that he also used to black man saying shit like that, bro. This is just y'all side of social media, brainwash y'all to send all these black man say this or all these black women say this. This is every race, bro. They y'all talk about the same shit, bro. I don't discriminate, but since I only date black women, I'm gonna say this. I don't give a damn. How many times I run into a crazy ghetto toxic black woman. I'm not finna be like, oh my God, I'm tired of all these motherfucker. Often the days somebody else, often they go strictly for a white woman just because I had these certain trumps, bro. With these few that I've dealt with, I'm not gonna blame all black women. But it seemed like a lot of y'all when y'all get hurt by any type of woman, any type of man y'all be like, man. Oh, they don't even, they don't even, they don't even, everybody bro. Question, bro. All y'all get mad whenever a man says anything about a woman, y'all be all in the comments. What do this energy be when women say things about man, bro? How many podcasts do y'all see with women just truth in talking about six dudes like D size, and all that, but soon as the man get on the podcast with anything, saying something about a woman's way, or anything, it's an issue, bro. I don't give a damn what a woman says about a man. You can speak on that. You can speak on the D size, where he ain't giving to you money, how you like, man, with money, y'all the y'all the y'all, I don't care. But as long as them saying people on the other side can speak on the same stuff, bro, just keep it fair. I do some of y'all only want it one way, but the other side can't do it, bro. This goes for man too, who get, who have issues with women saying certain things, but y'all be saying the same thing about them, bro. Just keep it fair, bro. I'm a rationalist. I don't give a damn about none of that shit, bro. Bro up here getting mad at the white guy for speaking on women saying, what a good woman that you saying is about God, bro, you got a chill out, bro, cause you ain't gonna have no guy to even try to date, bro. Cause we notice what you're like, bro. The way you speaking, you're like, gay man can't have toxic masculinity too, just because they gay, they don't mean shit, bro. At the end of the day is a man. You know what I'm saying? Something man gonna steal, have toxic masculinity, no matter they sexuality, bro. And don't act like women, don't have toxic femininity, bro. Like that shit be toxic as hell, bro. Every time I make a video like this, I keep it fair on both sides. I'm so glad I'm not one of them people like y'all that's close by that. I only think one way, bro. I know y'all miserable as hell. The guy says that we're the good women and y'all can't even fathom in y'all minds that it's possible for man to genuinely be asking that and be a good guy. Like a guy's never been through trauma with women. Like he ain't never experienced her in pain when it comes to the women. But soon as the woman says something like that, where's the good man? Oh my gosh, there's no good man. No, my gosh. She's not toxic. She's the victim every time? Yeah, I don't like the play fair. I don't give a damn y'all just wanna go back and forth, bro. Thank you, universe. Jesus, whoever, bro, I'm glad I don't think like this, bro, cause y'all are weird.

 And not because I think they would be incapable of being a good parent or they wouldn't be able to provide for their kids because I think they can. But I just think it's so traumatizing as a kid to have your parents be P-stars. Not only is that child's gonna endure so much bullying growing up, but they're gonna be exposed to that whole realm, like so early on because kids are gonna find out what their parents are. I have seen countless videos on TikTok and heard of countless stories. It's just in my personal life of kids of P-stars who are literally traumatized, have no relationship with their parents at all. You mean the mean men make? It's fucking sad, but I just don't think they should have children. I don't think they should expose a child to all of that trauma. And these P-stars making these videos while they're pregnant too. Like, there's just something about that to me that just like doesn't feel like.

 And not because I think they would be incapable of being a good parent or they wouldn't be able to provide for their kids because I think they can. But I just think it's so traumatizing as a kid to have your parents be peace stars. Not only is that child's gonna endure so much bullying growing up, but they're gonna be exposed to that whole realm, like so early on because kids are gonna find out what they're gonna do. I have seen countless videos on TikTok and her to countless stories. It's just in my personal life of kids of peace stars who are literally traumatized, have no relationship with their parents at all. And it's all- You mean the mean that man made? It's fucking sad, but I just don't think they should have children. I don't think they should expose a child to all of that and trauma. And these peace stars making these videos while they're pregnant too. Like, there's just something about that to me that just doesn't feel like. That comment section did not pass the vibe check. And this is what I mean when I say a lot of you are hiding your heart, icky nasty, hostile feelings for whores, buying critiques of things you don't even, you can't even begin to comprehend. What do you mean your opinion on people who do sex work having children comes from the memes that men make? Hahahaha! Girl, get a fucking grip. This would have made so much more sense if you just went, I hate oores. I don't think they should breed. I know people who don't do sex work who definitely shouldn't be breeding, but y'all hold us to a standard you do not hold others too. It kind of makes me think of when I would hang around old old stupid fox as a child who would sit there and go, oh, I don't hate black people. I just don't believe in interracial marriage because then children are tortured. Oh, I don't hate gays. I just don't think they should be allowed to get married or adopt kids. Y'all are hiding your homo, you're a racism behind things you can't even begin to understand. What do you mean? What do you mean it's traumatizing for the child? Children are at our at-risk are being taken out of homes for parents that care for them and who work very hard to keep them because their parents are simply sex workers. And they're very little protecting them. And instead of doing the work to decriminalize, destigmatize, you want to talk about a stigma baby. This is so embarrassing. What you're describing is stigma. Instead of talking about why these children are accusing adult content to then believe their classmates and maybe a bigger conversation of parents role, you're just like, hmm, horshin' and braid, it's gross, especially the ones who make content while they do it. Private women are suckin' and fuckin' right now as I make this video. Clutchless pearls. Clutch them. It's their body. They can do what they want with it. It's their labor. They can get paid for it. A lot of you are jealous. A lot of you are hiding your hard icky unpack feelings in that comment section is all the proof that I need. I think it is amazing how a lot of you can identify power dynamics between men and women, but not women and sex workers. Or police and sex workers. And you can only identify the power dynamic between men and sex workers when you're using it to perpetuate more stigma and criminalization against marginalized people who are asking for rights instead of rescue. And this is also kind of what I mean when I say a lot of you don't like slut shaming and victim blaming, but you do it on a people that you find the most undesirable. You're very much okay doing it through policy and community and through theory on the fuckin' for you page. And that comment section is proof. It's absolutely proof. A lot of you don't like patriarchy and rape culture until you can weaponize it against other people. That's crazy. Shout out to the bitches, make and pregnancy porn. Lots of love to you.

 Storytime and Hall, that's actually assaulted by my foster mom's son. I was five years old. I was living here in Las Vegas, Nevada. My mom and my father, they gave me away at three months because they were going to jail. So my mom, her sister adopted me. Her sister, at least. She took me in. I had five siblings, three boys, two girls. My favorite was Terry. Go Terry's Hall. He would box all the time. My foster father, Gary, was a Golden Globe boxing champ. So I was a straight townboy. I think I could box better than a boys in the house, respectfully. I'm only what they made a career. But Terry was my favorite sibling. And one day we were playing around wrestling. And our show, Celebrity Boxing, came out. It was this clay boxing show where they had like Kanye West, Fight and JZ, or they'll have like little Wayne, Fight and Britney Spears. It was just showing the 90s that was popular. After like True Blood came on or something. I don't know on this channel that we should, we had no business watching. I had no business. I was five. But that's normally what happens when you grow up in a week, don't want to show we ain't supposed to do. And Clark Terry is he got excited and was like, hey, if you rescued me out, did you stay up all night? I'm like, yeah, I'm going to come down there and beat you up. So I come down. And he's like coming to closet. And the closet and he gives me this pillow and he tells me to lean on it. I lean in the pillow and I'm just like, five. Like whatever you say, you know, I'm just a kid. You know, you're going to listen to the adults around you, especially if you go, good kid. I was raising the church every day, you know. And that's when he pulls my pants down. And like, what you doing? And he's like, hold on. This is a part of the game. I just got to make sure you okay. And he sticks this off inside of me. And I remember this pain. So this tear and I just screamed. I was like, oh, please stop. And he stopped. He was like, okay, okay, well, you can go back to watch your show, okay? And he's like, but first, we'll take a, take a shower. So I took a shower and came back and I was just laying down, just watching the show. He's like, and if you tell anybody this, I have to beat you up. And he like punches me, but he like, you know, it's like, it's on the, it's on the arm. It's not that hard. At this time, my brother was in his gang. And I believed what he said, you know, he could bring the gang over sometimes. And it ever stopped after five, just proceeded to have been all the time, all the time. My mom would leave him in charge when she would go to work because my foster dad was a crackhead. And he would just use it as a way to punish me. He'd be like, oh, you didn't clean the kitchen. Come to the room. You didn't clean the bathroom. Come to the room. You know, and separate me from everybody and then do whatever he wants to do to me in the room. I was always quiet. I was scared of him. You know, one time he had his gang in the window in life. Family would come over, cookouts would happen. Nobody would know what would be going on. Like, did it. How smooth he was about. He was the favorite sibling, you know, one day my sister's year, she came home early from school. She walked in on it. She was like, what's going on here? He jumps up and I'm crying. I'm like, nothing, nothing. I'm 12 now. This time, you know, we still staying by, you know, the outdoor Mexican swap me here in Bayes. You can hear the music and everything. And, uh, Terry has it warm. Terry gets a warm randomly by the grace of God, I guess. And my mom takes him to jail. When she takes him to jail, she's at this woman walks up to her in all white and she's like, that young man is hurting somebody in your house. So she comes home and she gets me in my sister and she acts as, like, as his boy. As Terry hurts you in any way and I'm quiet, you know, I'm scared. I'm like, I'm going to go and beat my ass and fuck no, I'm quiet. She's like, I walked in on something, they're brief. And my mom, she's like, my first mom, she's like, what happened to me? So I tell her what happened and she's like, oh, what happened to me too? But my father's jay-gee, like, it happened to me too. Like, it's okay. You'll get through this. Like, I got you. Terry's are getting out of jail, like maybe a year later. She walks his ass, thing, thing, thing, things, she walks his ass. She was like, how dare you touch her? Why her? She's not mine. She's adopted. Like, she's saying all this weird shit while she beat his ass. It was, I'm just watching it though. And my cousins is over here and my Auntie Margot, my Tiana and then, you know, they at the house. And they, I guess they got pissed off at me because like the favorite cousin just kind of trouble because of me. And then like, I started to prevail after that. Like, things started to be weird. Like, it was a big family secret that only we knew and we could tell the body outside of the family. So for me, everything was weird. Like, for everybody else's life probably was peaches and cream. But for me, like, it was, I started to hate, hate being living up as a false saint. Like, I felt like we're going to church every day. We're eating this Bible in it. We ain't following shit. I'm looking at people walking by me. I'm like, learning how to judge at this age now. Like, 13, like my judge and Sims just came on and I'm like, y'all, you're not copying what this Bible says. Like, so I just started to get pissed off at the world. I'm just like, everybody's just lying to me. And like girls are walking up to me. Like, at the high school experience, feel the school experience gets weird because I can't relate to any girl my age. So I'm right away, I get my goal to my father. I tell him what happened. You know, he gets out of prison. My real father, he gets out of prison. I tell him what happened. And he, like, I'll heal him all. I'm a good call right now. I'm a cause release. And release is scared. My foster mom is spooked. She's like, breed just made up a story that I told her, from what I told her when I was a kid, she just went off of me being touched by my father and she just wanted to feel like a victim. She always lied. She always lied. We've been dealing with this team and forever. I don't know if you'll ever deal with it. Like a hardcore Christian family. They just call everything you do just a demon. It just pissed me to f*** off. But she was like, I guess she just always lied. And my dad believed her. My dad believed her. Nothing was done about it. Nothing had always done about it. My family treated me weirdly from then on now. And I just forbale, like I didn't, I found fighting, you know. This year, I finally got my confession from my abuser. My girlfriend was able to slap the shit out of him because I could. We ended up running into each other after the Super Bowl here in Vegas and he froze. Just like, oh my God. What are you doing here? Oh. I'm so sorry. Just false. Like just, it started crying. I'm so sorry. I was a kid. I don't know. I didn't have a father. I didn't. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. Girl, smacks the shit out of him. I recorded. I posted a video of it. I was sending a video to my dad. I'm just like, I got my confession. And he's like, don't you ever think for a second that I ever did? I did not believe you. Like fuck bullshit bullshit. So like if you've been through something in your life and everybody's calling you weak for telling your story, telling you that you have a victim complex, fuck them. Tell your story. Get your power back. It's always the ones that actually went through something that never get just it. Justice. Just talk about your story. Get your power back. Go on all with life, feeling like a fucking king knowing that they heard somebody that is never going to confess the truth or a family going on knowing that they did something sick and kept a horrible secret. You know, don't let them go on living a life of a lie, especially in the church. Yama fuckers is in the church holding this lie. But yeah, yeah. That's my story about when my mom lied to my biological father about her son, raping S.A. in me from the age five to 12. Get your justice. Show your story. Be loud and be true.

 Brother, how are you going to look like that with those fucking nails and be transphobic? Okay, let me tell you your story. When I was in the hospital, one of the guys who was in one of the paint is nails because he wanted his show form of expression. He was a straight dude. He was pretty chill, I talked to him. But one of the other men in there heard him talking about that and he said, now men paint their nails, their fags. That's the only man who do that. Do you think he wants trans women in women's classrooms? Do you think anybody who's fighting for the shit that you're fighting for thinks that it's okay that you have nails like that? I think it's okay. I don't give a shit. I don't paint my nails and I am a fag so evidently the consensus doesn't line up. But do you think that people who you're fighting with here? Do you think that they're okay with your nails? Ask yourself why. And after you ask yourself why, ask yourself why you're so okay with fighting for them and with them when I will still fight for you when they come for you next.

 No, but seriously, my fiance had a work buddy who had a kid and this kid was about seven years old and she saw me for the first time and was like, Is your is your boyfriend a girl? And it was like oh yeah, you know, she just kind of sounds like that sometimes. It's okay. And she goes, huh? What did she sound like that fell? And she goes, oh, you know, some girls just sound like that some girls are you know taller some girls have deeper voices or whatever. She's like, huh? She kind of looks like a boy though. Was she ever a boy? Well, it was so fucking cute. I I never will understand the idea that conservatives think we will get pissed off at children for not getting it right like yeah, dog They're kids, you know, they're not exposed to people like us all at the time And so it's okay for them to be clunky and ask questions Especially since it never really comes from a place of malice and that makes these questions more fun and cute than it does like hurtful. I'm not hurt but she said I look and sound like a boy, you know to a seven-year-old I look and sound like a boy and that's fine You know I can we can help them learn as they grow

 Man, I wake up in the morning. This is one of the first things I see crazy I'm just saying whatever happened to freedom of religion and freedom of speech Like seriously those not matter anymore and apparently The New Testament is hate speech toward other religions when being real It's meant for Christians to learn. I mean don't get me wrong the Bible is meant for everybody But mostly for people who believe I mean it's a faith-based book No one that would be trying to ban street preachers and whatnot Yeah, honestly don't street preach a thing if you don't like what they're saying Just keep walking You don't even want to hear them put some earbuds in unless you hear yourself our Christian and easy what they're saying is nonsense Back again that refers to more mature Christians and who know the faith that another stone up the street Peter's saying the most Outlander things things in the Bible But you know it's really crazy. They're trying to put us Christians out there to be the problem Where I see if the problem is people in power and people weren't authority or kind of Get rid of this freedom get rid of that freedom and trying to push other freedom of Like LGBTQ Woke and one night to try to push that freedom and trying to weaken Religion and whatnot To say the focus on everybody but really they're just focused on their selves I'm not really literature type, but shoot something like this is just ridiculous

 Dear keys, your keys? No, wait, this is so funny because I'm trans as you can probably see from the pronouns in my name. And a few years ago, when I identified as a girl still, my keys had so many like fidget and like key chains, it was a mask. It was actually a problem, it was so big. But then now, for the past couple years, since I've been out, my keys are literally just my car key, my house key, and my parents' house key. And a single keychain, that's just like the keychain that came from the car dealership. There's no keychain, there's no lanyard, there's nothing. I can't believe I'm a stereotype.

You probably went up to her or something like that. And she is probably the way you dress. You're probably in not into females or you're not her type. If you keep thinking that way, you're not going to get nobody. I'm pretty sure everybody wants you. But at the end of the day, buddy, you can't think that way. You probably felt that so many things you probably look at. You know what? I'm going to give this a try and then you see it. You know, if you understand what I'm coming from, that makes no sense to do all mask and let's be in thick like this. I'm just asking, just asking, I thought you were my shot at somebody and they rejected me. I'm probably think that I'm not their type. They're not into people like me. You know, or they're not into people who are like with mental illness or not people with loop is or anything. You know, I mean, you had to think situations like that.

 This man pays 250 in rent. Their bills are $4,000 a month. And he's trying to convince his girl to let them move his home girl in to be a third in their relationship so that she can start cooking for him because the wife who pays $4,000 a month don't cook for him no more. Even though she provides everything takes care of all the kids, he admits that in a video and everything his whole entire argument. The entire video is him trying to convince her to add a third girl. I'm a let y'all know now. That could never be me. When I was about 19, 20 years old I was talking to this dude. He was like 30 something. He was cooler, whatever, but he had a bunch of children and everything and he kept talking about oh we should add a third girl. We should do this, this and that. I'm like okay even though I'm already not even interested in you and you know I'm not. So he must have thought that we could spice it up by adding a girl. He'd list to say I don't know if y'all seen Pete Valley or not when Mercedes was dancing for a coach or whatever and then set up that arrangement with his wife and before you knew it it was her and his wife and he was pissed. That's exactly what happened. He was non-existent. He was not there. That was the last time he was ever there. Me and her got together. She was my first real girlfriend for two years. So y'all be thinking y'all doing something trying to invite a female. We already don't want y'all. We already feel safer with a bear in the woods and y'all be really out here trying to give us all to maidens dudes be killing me when they be like yeah my girl got a girlfriend. Yeah and you're the girlfriend that's about to get left sir. Don't nobody want y'all already stop trying to make compromises. Y'all literally have nothing. Nothing at all to offer because if you think that thing in your pants is doing anything when we can go by anyone we want in any color shape size and it can last as long as we want it to without having to spit started. Blow it up like a balloon. Make it do something y'all but the ill. I could never I would never all I'm saying is just go watch the video. What's ill like sir. You want to add a third like shorty just needs to move you out move the other girl in and they'll be cool. They'll be fine. I might have to go comment that on the video and let her know. Have a good night.

 I want you to say nothing because I think the people take talk pretty much I have it covered but I am going to say something because when I see this piece of shit up on stage talking out of his ass to those students who it's the biggest day of their lives it makes me thinking about a little sister because she's in college right now and she just finished her sophomore year and if somebody got up there at her graduation after how hard she's worked for that just like those students did. Sister will be going to jail. No shame. But my little sister she's very smart and she always has been. She's always like sailed or everything she's tried and she's worked her ass off to get where she's at now and her majors are forensic science with a concentration on biology and forensic anthropology and not only has she been invited to go to Romania this year and worked on a excavate and remains from a burial site that's from like the 1700s which is huge I mean she's not even 21 yet and I don't I don't know how many people can say that they've experienced that but it's probably not many. But after she graduates she wants to work with the DPAA which is a DOD agency that helps to locate and identify POWs, so to see where am I and so to see where KI but were never located or identified reunited with their families and to me and to a lot of other people actually. That is by far more important and bigger than kicking a ball for a career, for pure entertainment purposes. She is going to be one of those people that changes the lives of families who were never reunited with their service member or they have no answers on what happened to them and that is more important. Her life has already started. It doesn't start if she gets married or decides to have children. It has already started. The only one that has been diabolically lied to is that dude because for whatever reason he believes that he is important enough as a kicker. He is important enough to have the ability to fug in tell women what they're here on earth for. I will tell you one thing. If you thought my little sister that she would laugh in your face and I would throw it at punch you to really ever. But there are a lot more important things that women do than you will do in your entire life. I mean you are a kicker. I don't know what to tell you. There is women out there that are doctors, service members, scientists, psychologists. I mean literally everything. It is an endless list. There is single moms who do that. Single moms that work full time jobs. I don't know what to tell you about. But there are far more important things than being a fucking kicker for a career. Jesus.

 It sounds crazy because it is crazy. Policing other people's identities and how they choose to express themselves and how they choose to identify with certain pronouns is not going to make the straits, the homophobes, the transphobes like you more. Calling gender nonconforming people. Transphobic and homophobic for expressing the fact that they are gender nonconforming in a way that does not make sense to you is absolutely fucking insane. Just because you work so hard to make yourself palatable to the people who hate trans and queer people doesn't mean that they're going to like you anymore. At the end of the day, you are still queer. And that's all they fucking care about. So get the fuck over this shit. Do better, be better. Stop harming members of your own community and an attempt to make yourself palatable to the people who want you dead.

 I am so more than confused while watching this video. Because first of all, I thought we left that kind of speech and like, what? 26? I don't know how many times do we have to repeat ourselves? That gays are not handbags. Gay guys are not an addition to a female girlfriend. Gay people are not some kind of side characters in your movie where they come whenever you want them to come because you are not the main character of any movie. And I just love her confidence and the way she thinks she did something because maybe she didn't know. But now she will know. And just the way she says like, I am the queen of the gays, the gays love me. Mama. No one loved you in the first place. Every gay on this earth thinks you're annoying. The same way.

 First off, I just want to say hi dog if you're watching this which I'm sure you probably aren't both I just want to say I'm a big fan of your TikTok's lobby very much man Plus also to those people out there who are so quick to judge a person based on what they have on their fingers AKA the mid-nails painted or whatever I can't even get the word I cuz I'm so flabricasted right now But I've already made a TikTok about this before about two months ago and people Clearly don't fucking listen to that except for the people who actually do listen And I love you very much for those who did and for those who didn't well Take this into context time right but um Just because a person has their needs painted doesn't make them bisexual gay transgender Non-binary they can be straight and still have their needs painted I mean have you ever heard of that like it's all down to preference not sexuality sexuality does not come into play here Like it's all down to preference and if a person has a preference to paint their nails even though they're straight bisexual Gabe whatever Let them do this if they're happy with it you go you go do that you be happy Like I've always that person who never judges anyone based on what they do Like you I would see a man in a dress that you see me judging him for wearing a dress No, you don't because it's his preference if he wants to wear a dress or not And it's the same thing with a woman if she wants to wear a suit you will never see me judge her It's just how it is so can we all for one fucking minute now listen to this Can we please stop judging people based on what they do that you consider as abnormal when it clearly is not abnormal It's all down to preference like Can you guys just let dog have painted nails? If you want to paint these nails I'm all forward dog love you man as I said before at the very beginning Bush Can you please leave the man alone Like I don't know what his gender is or not gender but sexuality is If you happen to be bisexual that's okay if you straight that's okay if he's gay that's okay too As well as non-binary it's okay no matter what you are so Can we please next time? Because people clarity are quick to judge at its fucking annoying

 There are anywhere near enough queer people getting on this kid's ass. I think at this point, the only people that I've seen stitching this kid are people of color for obvious reasons, but this is why the black community doesn't trust the queer community, because people like that go running a muck and where are all the queer allies checking his ass. It's just so frustrating that I have to witness someone from my own community, make a mockery of themselves and the only people, maybe, and maybe it's just my algorithm. Maybe there are queer people checking him and I'm just not seeing it, but I should be seeing it far more than I am. Like, it's unacceptable that the only people that are calling out somebody like this is from outside of the community. That's one of our own, we need to be calling him out.

 Are you listening here, Mr. Butler? The Bible defines pride as having an arrogant, hottie attitude that leaves to an inflated sense of self or self importance. You know, like a kicker telling anyone what they should be doing. That is different from gay pride. LGBTQIA plus pride is about standing up against injustice and oppression and saying we are, we are, and we are here, and we're not going anywhere, we want equal rights, and we just, it's not about being better than anyone else. It is about like standing our ground and just like being okay with who we are. Like songs chapter 82 verse 3 that says to defend the weak and the oppressed. Or Proverbs chapter 31 verse 8 that says to defend the rights of the needy. Or Isaiah chapter 1 verse 17 that literally says do good, seek justice, and correct oppression, Harrison. And I know, I know when a word has two meanings, it's really hard. And I was raised by a guy like I know we don't read the Bible. I know that, but this is all work that you get to do as a spiritual person. I had to do it in deconstructing my faith and learning to be a proud queer person, but Google's free.

 Quick question, did you do your research before you made this video? Because number one, it was known for weeks that Hohman was threatening to drop those tapes. He spiraling episode has been showcased on his Instagram story for weeks. So much so that he even went to popular Twitter influencers who exposed DMs from Hohman where he was asking them to drop the videos, the tapes. On Mother's Day, even so that they could ruin her Mother's Day. This man had no choice after those very same Twitter influencers exposed him and said, now we've got a little bit more class in there which I mean we all know there's no class on those Twitter stories. But because they declined that, yeah Hohman had no choice but to release those tapes. Number two, why is it that man always went to piggyback off the foundations of the movements that women spend decades and decades creating? Why don't you take out the time and the resources yourselves to start creating those movements that directly help and support men and stop seeking for women to make it their responsibility in holding you guys accountable, in making sure that they need to start creating the same spaces for you guys? Come on guys, come on. I have really good friends who are men and they would rather come and talk to me than ever sit around a bride with their beers in their hands and vent and open up to each other about what they going through and they feelings emotionally and mentally. Because why men in general do not create safe spaces for other men and then you turn around and make it our responsibility to create something for you guys. When what we are creating, sorry, with what we are creating is because of you guys. If you guys truly thought that strongly about what happens to Prince KB when that tape got leaked by women, why did you not come out to those numbers that were coming out to these numbers and saying, hey, we're going to make sure that this woman feels the full might of the law and we're going to press charges on Prince KB's behalf. Instead, you went on to Twitter and you created memes and Jurgs and made jokes about it. But now all of a sudden it's our responsibility who we should have held that woman accountable. Nah, we ain't going to do that. We're too busy protecting ourselves from you. We don't see many men in the past and currently even now coming out in their numbers saying that we should hold her up my number responsible. We didn't make sure that he gets held accountable and he knows the full might of the law. I don't see men doing that right now. It's a small peanut few who are doing it, but I don't see all of you guys coming out and actually saying, what he did, he's a piece of shit. Let's go out in our numbers as men, make sure he gets held accountable in force and feels the full might of the law and we're going to also be behind, you know, the women who are making sure that Huttmann gets pressed with charges. What's also crazy is that this whole revenge, corn roll that has been implemented comes from our movements. Comes from our movement because women have been going through such things that are done by men for decades now. And now all of a sudden it's like, it's not our responsibility to make sure that you create those systems in place that you're seeking for to heal yourself emotionally and mentally. And I find it very unfair that you expect us to heal you guys. No, it's your guy. This is where you need to take your own initiative as men and create those spaces, create those movements and stop seeking to women for the blueprint. In fact, take the blueprint and create it for yourselves. But don't come in and say, hey, you've created this movement and not protect us. No, the movement wasn't made or designed for that. It was designed for us. When men, such as yourselves, didn't even want to care to listen or help. When we were telling you that we needed systems in place for our needs, our wants, and for our protection. It's your time now, guys, to actually stand up and create those spaces for yourselves. Leave women out of this. Leave us out of it. And before you say, oh, you're the reason why we're mentally versed and we're emotionally that is because of women, no. We're just holding you to the standards that you created for yourselves. If you want to change that, if you want to and do that, you know where to go and who to speak to and who to find. And it's not us. Catch you in the next one. Oh, and you know, it's also well just before I go. The movements that have helped things get stamped into law, you guys are already benefiting from it. And you want all of us to still continue doing the work. It's your guys' time now.

 You should have literally come out and said my name. I would have probably appreciated this video a lot more But still no hate at all. I think a lot of people keep missing what I'm trying to tell you guys I don't hate ICT nor do I hate his concept. I personally use his concepts and I've seen a lot of success with it However, what really makes me hate any part of ICT are his delusional fan base. I hate the fact that ICT cop members come on to other people's Comment sections who trade differently and claim that they don't know how to trade that ICT concepts are the only way to Become successful now if you followed my entire content, which I'm assuming you haven't you've picked up stonkeys here and there Which is fine. I can understand that I was literally the person who came on to this platform Speaking about what ICT was attempting to achieve didn't hate on what he came out with was actually very eager to see him achieve these things and I chose to share it with the platform But lo and behold once I came out and shed on my platform the cult members came out in Floods and continued to do what they always do ICT himself and his concept are fan bloody tire state It's his members that are super super super toxic What's more diabolical when it comes to the ICT fan base? They don't realize how they add to the community in such toxic ways I believe that ICT concepts isn't the only way to become successful and I've stood on that business for as long as I've been doing this on TikTok I actually believe that whatever strategy that you choose to adapt to needs to match your personality and the type of Psychology that you possess and if ICT isn't for you That is completely fine. You will definitely find a strategy that is better suited for you And that's why I say ICT cult members cannot fathom that fucking shit and so I wanted to prove to people that They are successful traders who don't use ICT concepts and they doing extremely well Such as the guy that I mentioned DD NK Nazrikan who is currently leading in the division that ICT said he was going to be leading in right now With a trend line strategy and we all know ICT fans They cannot fathom that support and resistance still works They cannot fathom that trend lines still works. They cannot fathom that indicators can also still work And so what do they always constantly do? They're constantly flooding to other people's comment sections Tell them how they shed a training that they don't know how to trade and that their strategy will not work Stick to ICT concepts and I'm just like the fuck leave people alone and allow them to trade how they feel like they want To trade like the blueprint of getting to becoming a successful trader Like with how we all want to become will never be the same for Many and multiple and complex reasons I know support and resistance traders who could wipe the floor with a lot of these ICT traders And it's not because support and resistance is the best strategy It's because they found what they've worked for themselves and they were able to build an edge around that and that's why I am trying to push to the forefront that ICTs are the only strategy that that's out there and It's the type of advice that really has got people stuck in this cycle that doesn't work for them Thinking that oh because somebody keeps bashing it into my head on social media that ICTs the only way to be successful they get stuck in this vicious cycle of It not working for them and them not getting to a place of being profitable Which is now caused a disservice where now they can't even look within themselves Check in with themselves find out with themselves is the strategy really for me Why am I just listening to people who don't even know don't even know who I am Don't even know the type of risk management that I that I'm trying to possess the type of Traitor that you guys want to become you know nothing about me, but yeah, they here they are saying hey listen Oh, you tease you only wear us. He's your new way. No. It's not No, it's not the only way there's nothing wrong with ICT. I've said this a thousand times I just hate these cult members Because they're the most toxic fan base to ever come across in this trading industry and it's really doing a disservice to a Lot of people who are trying to come in into this whole trading game That is it. That is all that I want to say I Hope that makes sense now and next time please say my name with your chest. Thanks

 So I've been meaning to make a response video to this since the video came out I just haven't had the time. I'm not gonna lie That response video made me feel like a complete asshole and I'll list the reasons as to what as of late I've had a lack of tolerance when it comes to fighting ICT Cult members, right? And I approached you as such low key which was very wrong with me I approached you from a place of just being defensive as well And yeah, I take full responsibility in accountability and there were things or there was a tone that I had used and certain words as well Where I felt as if I could have just communicated in my response video a lot better which I When I look back on it, I just want to let you know that I don't think I had done it correctly and because of that I just went to apologize to you directly and And publicly I honestly could have done better in my response you say it somewhere along the lines that you didn't expect me to Every response to your video. The thing is is this is that I've been following you since you was sitting at like 4000 followers and you're currently sitting at 12 and I may not have directly been following your Account like that by clicking on the follow. We only started following each other like when we Made the videos to one another, but I have been keeping an eye on you since you were sitting around like 4000 followers And you appear on my for you page very regularly So yes, you're on my algorithms like that and I always take the time to watch your videos That's why me having taken the time to watch your specific video was because I normally did do that and I was able to put two and two together And realize that you were talking about me I'm just very happy to see a fellow trader who's also trying to do something a lot similar to what I'm trying to do by bringing forward transparency and a lot more education to the far expo. I'd like to say that I come in with a You know a certain like standing on business Do not accept no bullshit type of standard and how I approach my content to the public And I feel as if you come in with a very different side of just a comedic relief type of sense to the same type of goals that we're trying to push forward to the public on this platform So on my end, I'd like to issue out a public apology for certain things that I said with the tone that I used as well Regardless our videos were still able to just educate each other But also educate the public as well, you know, and that's what I always try to do and try and maintain But we call there's no animosity. There wasn't even any animosity before you know those videos came out But we cool we grand I still dig your content. I followed you officially and to you guys as well check them out If you need a young role break from me being also serious with my content go over to these page and check them out Like I said, he brings a sense of comedic relief to the industry But with the same end goal of just trying to educate and be transparent about the industry All right guys catch you in the next one

 I remember when I was speaking to someone who could open doors for me and opening a hitch-van. You want to know what that person said? You're wasting your time wanting to open up a hitch-van. Open a broker once and when you're ready just come to me. Reason beings is because... It's very easy to get away with a lot of things as a broker in this country. He made examples of one guy that is very well known in this space when it comes to brokers. And I'm not mentioning any names. He's bonus at the end of the year was 8 million. 8 million. Right. Bonus are low. So yeah, if they were pushing me and advising me that it was so much easier to open up a broker in this country and the money is swell. I think you all can put two and two together.

 Every American right now watch this video. This is the real reason why they're trying to remove TikTok from America. They're doing it because they tell you a lie and then people tell you the truth. Simple as it is all about keeping you in the state of fear so they can keep remaining in control of you.

 I don't really consider myself a feminine person. I'm more mask-presenting. However, as a non-binary mask lesbian, I feel that it's important to tell you about some of the things that I like that are very feminine. I like long walks, smelling the flowers, picking flowers, making each other playlists, getting like super deep into conversation and feeling all of the feelings. One of the things I find I have the most feminine energy is when I'm in the shower. I like to turn on music and just like really like shikira, like dance in the shower. Like I would never do that. Like out in the real world. But when I'm in the shower, I feel safe and I'm a lot of feminine qualities and I'm proud of it.

 No, because the fact that I saw this video yesterday and then I was out getting brunch with this girl I'm seeing who's mask presenting and We had a similar situation that this happened. I'm really glad I saw that video yesterday because I Want to appreciate the fact that I am a little bit more straight-passing and I should be I don't want to see the protector, but The diffuser in situations like this where my partner and I are out like grab Being breakfast like we were yesterday and this manager who was training somebody it just very felt like we got singled out while we were Looking at this like gift shop section. I'm a very well-known Food chain and it just made us feel both very uncomfortable like we Were followed around in the store by one of her employees after we left we kind of talked about what happened and how we both fell and I decided that I wanted to call and confront the manager and so when I called I asked to speak directly with the manager That I had talked to my partner which funny enough She was one of the answers and then I explained to her how uncomfortable she made us feel By how she spoke to my partner and then how we were proceeded to be followed around the store and just like made to feel so uncomfortable and my partner is the most like Generally wonderful person like she could not hurt Anyone or anything like she's just so lovely and so for someone to like treat her like that I Got very upset. I didn't go full care and I was more upset than Karen but like I just want to appreciate the fact that I was able to see that video and Stand up for my partner and say what should have been said in the moment I'm glad I was able to call after because I you never know what situations are gonna bring when you're in person The manager was like really apologetic and she was like I'm so sorry I see so many people we had this really great sale going on I was like that still doesn't excuse the fact how you treated her and how your other employee treated us and followed us around

 God damn it, the gays are being unhinged again. I don't think we're ready for this conversation, but it needs to be said. The amount of incest that actually does happen in the gay community does concern me. I've been on a few dates with a few men, discovered that they were my cousins, and I was like, yeah, now we can't be doing this. And they'll try to argue with me, and it's like, it ain't like we really knew each other that well. It ain't like we can get each other pregnant, just because you can't get each other pregnant. Doesn't mean that you should do it. I don't care how you try to paint it. If they're in a family tree, it's fucking weird.

 Oh my gosh that was really painful to watch. It was really hard finishing that video, but thankfully I pulled through. You know what, the definition of a woman that you gave is very objective and exhaustive. No one is trying to deny the fact that the promosomes of a trans woman or a trans person, but you were talking about trans women, so no one is denying the fact that the promosomes of a trans woman are xy. No one is saying that we're claiming to be women as trans women because we think that our sex assigned at birth is female. But you should know as well that gender is a social construct and if you're going to talk about trans people, you should know that the word trans means that your sex assigned at birth does not conform with your gender identity. Now Sabine was a video mano. Selective and pogintininininau at 2024, nada, patininor, malai sna tanya, common sense. But it seems to me, echo your melon and people like you will always cherry pick the facts that they want to believe and always use the ideas that are prejudice and discriminatory in nature so just they can pull what they believe in. Basically, I'm so tired of the people, nah, get a gamut in biology, science, human nature when that is the definition of a sex or female, not a woman, gender is a social construct. People wake up. It's already 2024. You should know that you should be open to the fact that it's the society that defines what a woman is, what a man is. It's a social construct. It's a chna, librilam, matsurch, reminion, nam, followers, modicum, about search. And plus, it's very funny that this came from a man because what do you know about the struggles of a woman in society? Gender is defined by society and it is a social construct. Learn that.

Rejecting a man simply because they're a man and they get offended because they're like, oh, but I'm kidding me of the male species. And it's like, no, I think I prefer something that has a veg and heaven forbid that a man's ego gets rejected because now it's just 10 times more fragile simply for the fact that a lesbian rejected because that's just the epitome of trying to get with a woman.

 Right, I get it. We all get it. You're transitioning from male to female. Not everyone wants to know everything you're doing. Like what are you going to do next when you have your gender reassignment surgery? Which won't be for a long time. You're going to have that live streaming to traumatise all the kids. Like think about that. And I get it. It's educational. But it was educational at the beginning. Now it's like you need to do what Dylan Mulvaney done. And take some time off. Because you're getting so fixated and so intertwined with TikTok. Like you have to do it. And you have to let everyone know everything. Just zip your neck like a padlock and stop.

 really heard nothing about Tealah Tequila since her first name was mentioned to me. I remember people being like, oh, you're by, you must love her. She's so hot. She didn't think she's hot. I'm like, I don't like her. She's getting bad vibes. I don't like her. Well, the gay-dart never misses because apparently she was never gay. And I never miss with that because I can, maybe I can't always tell. But I feel like I'm never wrong when a girl pretends to be attracted to women because those are the kind of women that hit on me. Women that aren't early attracted to girls, but they're like, you look kind of wild and crazy and fun. I bet you do something wild and crazy with me if I just try. On a similar note, Lance Bass. I remember when Insane came out and I was 10 years older, whatever. All the girls having a crush on him. And I remember being like, that's weird. Like not that Lance was an attractive. He's totally handsome guy. But I just remember being like, that's weird. You have a crush on him. Like, I feel like you shouldn't have a crush on him. That seems weird. You know why it was weird? Cause he was gay.

 So I had an issue with the Disneyland video. I haven't issue with this one too. And it really comes down to the fact that if you are in a space where you are using food euphemisms to describe a surgery, you clearly should not be in that space talking about it. You are talking about an actual medical procedure that you should be using the correct anatomical terms and correct terminology to talk about because this is a very serious topic. And if you are in a space where you have to use food as like manikati, meatballs, marshmallow wand cake pops, that is a clear indication that you should not be having that conversation in that space. Go home, record this in private and use the correct terminology to talk about something that is honestly a very big thing.

 He's gay to add on to this. Let's see you have a best friend boyfriend guy friend and He's heavy on the no homo like he's has no homo for everything not a jokeingly like oh no homo But like he lays it heavy on the no homo Let's add a scenario you offer to go to a gay bar because the drinks are cheaper there any hits you with the oh Well, good or gay bar, but it's not like if I'm gay like no homo no homo another scenario Oh, I'll hang out with your friends your gay friends, but it's not like if I'm gay No homo no homo Sis you're among a homo sexual you have found yourself a homo Maybe a homo sapien, but maybe a homo sexual Cuz girl if he's gonna go to a gay bar and he's straight. We know he's straight He's told that she's straight everybody in the LGBT community is not gonna question you if you're straight or not If you tell them hey, I'm straight They're gonna be like, okay cool, whatever, but if you gotta if you gotta be like oh no homo no homo I'm not gay. I'm not gay and you get defensive like that. I nobody's doing anything to you That's a little sus cuz I have met many a straight man who's confident in their sexuality and their cool people Those those straight guys that are confident in their sexuality were the same ones that stood up to bullies for me when I was in Middle school and when I was in high school They'd be the straight guys that'd be like lay off motherfuckers shit even into adulthood They're the same guys that are like we should probably not hang out with that no homo guy Cuz he seems pretty homophobic, but that's what I'm saying if he has to be a little too sus There's a homo percentile in there you got some percentage in there whether it be 40% whether it be 30% whether it be 55% you got some homo sexual Don't let him fool you These are the same guys these these senators these famous People these football players that are very Very homophobic are the same ones that end up getting caught a few years later Doing understalls stuff they get caught in a hotel room Doing stuff with another dude while their wife is at home Just like bro, what the fuck and poor lady She's dealing with this motherfucker and putting up with this bullshit and then he does that shit to her I think men just have to be completely honest when they're in a relationship men just have to be honest If you lean both ways if you lean Anyway, you should be honest with your partner You should be a hundred percent. There should be a transparency in that relationship because why are you gonna play somebody? That's not fair and you don't know if your partner is into that your partner might be into that And if they're not into that then it gives you a chance to find somebody that is into that That's why these guys always confuse me because there's always going to be somebody out there There's always going to be a right fit out there for you You could find your girlfriend that wants a boyfriend, but no These dudes would rather do it behind Behind their partners backs and it's just awful and it's cruel

 Okay, this was an insane take for me to read as someone who's queer and works in fitness. I think first of all, I'm so sorry that people feel this way because I had no idea. So I just want to say if you are queer and you feel like the way you dress is running, you're from walking into a gym, into a studio and to any kind of movement space, I just want to say I know the fitness community can be intimidating on the outside. Like I know, shitty rep, but on the inside, people just want to grow mentally, physically, and find community. Like also, as someone that works in group fitness, all of us are gay. Like the majority of us are gay. And even though I don't look gay, sorry, I look straight, it's my cross-the-barre majority of us are gay. You can either go to a studio front-end instructor that's queer. Like one of my clients comes to me because she loves my music and she's gay and I'm gay, so it just makes sense. And if you don't feel like showing up and wanting to be seen, go to a dark or good. I love going to a dark studio when I don't feel like being looked at like something where the lights can low and literally no one can look at me. And then if all else else fails, just show up, wearing whatever you feel is most comfortable in, it could be something super baggy, it could be something weird tight. Literally look at sound like it does not matter. Show up, do one thing. And then the next day, show up and do maybe one or two things. Like maybe it's walking in the treadmill and getting used to the environment and seeing the landscape. Maybe the next day, it's walking and picking up a weight. Maybe you just grow little by little and more comfortable in that space. And once you're more comfortable in that space in general, you're literally one thing twice about where you're wearing or you think twice about what people think about you because you'll be so focused on your own growth. Anyways, I just wanted to cut that rant and please for the love of God, move your body, you're alive, you're breathing, congratulations, please nurture it. And please, please, please, please, please, please enter the space. We love you are waiting for you wearing whatever. Cha.

 Hey, so I want to talk about this situation and if some of you guys don't know, I had to re-record this because I was going off on a tangency and I wanted to make sure I say the right thing and you know we're so pro LGBTQ class and by all means I see I literally stay in my lane when it comes to LGBTQ class and just different things like that and I'm going to explain to you why. I'm not a big supporter and I'm going to explain to you why. I don't support but I'm also not going out there to hurt anybody in the LGBTQ class community. Like I'm not going to support you and I can go out there and say yeah, we're in the the fight but I'm also not going to go out there and say you know I'm not going to gay bad, show anybody. I'm just not. My experience in the LGBTQ and I'm going to say my experience in living in the LGBTQ class community for most of my life was horrible. Was the most horrible experience that I ever had. It caused me so much mental health issues that I tried to un-alive myself and I was a very unstable adult for most you know for my young adult life. It was just a horrible situation. I didn't know how relationships function properly and if you don't know here's here's my situation. My mother was was lesbian. She passed away and our relationship was horrible. There's a horrible relationship. She was abusive. She got in abusive relationships. The women that she was with, that she brought into our house and had relationships with were mental health issues of a lot of them did and so we were subjected to that life and I'm a geniex so I grew up in a generation where we were made fun of because our mom was lesbian so we couldn't have friends outside of the LGBTQ friends in the friends that our parents had so like their friends. They're gay and lesbian friends, pet kids and their kids were our friends so that was only people that we knew and that we were really that we associated with so we were very isolated within the community and that's all we were exposed to and then I had a gay uncle who was literally a sexual degenerate. He would openly talk about gay sex and were kids and our mother was complacent with letting us be exposed to that constantly. He's like you know we're sitting on the couch and he's like oh my snatchet Jason, it's like and I'm nine years old and you know he's talking about his snatchet and all this stuff and it's like okay but I'm nine years old and eventually it cat worse and worse and worse to the point where my uncle did essay in me several times and it was just like and then as an adult he tried to get involved with my marriage and didn't involve them my life and it really really emotionally messed me up for a long time where I was drinking a lot and I was doing a lot of things that I shouldn't be doing so I think of the day do I thank you do I support the LGBTQ community and what I say that it's a good situation at the end I think it's a take it on a case by case basis but for me it was a more experienced than I when my mom she passed away I didn't fall I still have not shed a tear for that woman and I didn't speak to her the last years of her life I felt really you did she was gone and that's how I felt about my mom she made my life living hell like I said I didn't it wasn't like most kids I survived my childhood which was a huge difference and just the just the amount of stuff that we had to go and then not only that is when people found out that your mom is husband and it was just like we were bullied and so we had to take that in as well so we got bullied we got you know it was just that type of situation that we had to go through and it was it just seemed very unfair it just seemed very unfair to us that we we get bullied for our mom and then and then some people would say well people should be more accepting of your mom but they didn't have to be and our mom should have been more of a mother to us than they knew about herself and that's the story I always talked about it like she cared more about having a relationship and feeling the loving us and and it showed and it just showed and just so if she treated us and she would always send us away to different places and when she will gaze back to you backwards she didn't and so it's like the times that we were with her were horrible I just like so many times I was like I wished that the state would have just put us in foster care that was like I to this day I always think about how different my life would have been if she didn't have any pride in it and so do I support this guy in his situation for a surrogate I don't I don't have any stay on it I can give you a perspective from someone who's lifted that's all I can do and I'm not saying that that's going to be the case for this child or for any child and going up again as we imperatives because some you know some of my friends they came out to be well rounded you know others didn't a lot of them that I remember or that I come in communication with on Facebook they didn't come out that they just didn't and it's a 50-50 child it's a 50-50 child but then my friends that I had that had a straight parents or divorce parents also came out 50-50 chance you know I think that my generation was probably the hardest was it hardest if you had a gay or a lesbian parent so I think that makes a big difference as well as the the way we were treated outside of the out-of-you-to-q post community so there was two sides two two families you had your family that was straight then you had your family that you know you had to accept so anyway this is my perspective on it and I don't want you to take what I say as the end-all be all talk to other people who live in the LGBTQ plus community for a long time throughout their life

 You know, I've seen this post getting a lot of hate in the comments section. A lot of people are saying, well, you can't tell me what I can and can't talk about. You can't tell me where I can speak. I have the freedom of speech. And to that, I always say, just because you can talk about something, does that mean you should? Just because you can talk about a certain thing or talking a certain way, does that mean you should? You know, I'm never going to walk into a mechanic shop and start busting their balls. I'm never going to walk into a mechanic shop and go, huh? You're using those kind of wrenches? Or why'd you become a mechanic? There are so many other things you could be. You know, I'm never going to do that. You know why? Because I know nothing about being a fucking mechanic. It's not my place to speak on it. But you know, straight people like to speak on being gay a whole lot. They do, you know, because a lot of straight people see being gay as a sin. You know, I see that a lot in my life chats. You know, religious people saying, change your ways. This is a sin and then saying whatever they want about being gay, because they think they're saving somebody. They have the whole Messiah complex. You know, I see that a lot. I see a lot of straight people who just don't understand what it means to be gay. So they start gay bashing. And there's no repercussions to it. You know, so they just do it. I've seen that a whole lot. You know, I've seen plenty of people who are straight talk about gay stuff, talk about gay things in interesting ways. I've had straight people tell me that I have bottom energy, which it's like, okay, not sure you really get to say that, but you know, go off, I suppose. I just think, I don't think straight people have ever been uncomfortable to talk about gay things, make gay jokes, you know. I think they've just been quiet about their opinions about it, but I don't think they've ever been uncomfortable. Because I see it every day. And I agree, you know, some things aren't yours to talk about. And that's okay. That's why we meet people. That's why we share our stories. You know, that's why we broaden our horizons because we don't get to know everything, which means while we can talk about everything, maybe we should.

 So y'all can go back and watch what the original creator said, but I'm gonna have to heavily disagree This is my issue with this weird sassy stud like pin that make or whatever is going on is that I feel like every year We come out with some new label to further separate ourselves from like traditional books butches or masks or people that are just very masculine but still present or identify as women, right and And somehow we've cycled back into the fact that we are again shaming people that are not gender-conforming and giving people a pat on the back for being closer to Gender norms at the end of the day gender is a social construct like everything that you think a woman is supposed to do how they're supposed to Think how they're supposed to act how they're supposed to dress all that has been societyly constructed So the fact that we're sitting here in 2024 saying that if you do not fit into this script that I somehow came up with from the bottom of my ass crack, right like you don't want to be a woman That is the most like me and her thought as take bro like It's so crazy to me because none of it's real Like none of the things you're saying are real. They don't make sense woman. It is not linear It's not clear cut whatever you don't have to do anything to be a woman You just you just are or you aren't like that's really it so just say here and say that To me is a crazy tape and I just don't understand why we keep cycling back to this like hate on your gender non-conforming Lives be ends like every year like always at the same time like this keeps happening Like good for you if you want to be a stud and you want to wake up and you want to put a thong on and go Shake ass in the club period cool got it, but we're not gonna sit here and be like You're so brave You're so brave. You're so brave for doing exactly what society is asking you to do like Then we're gonna turn around and beat down You're punching down people that are general non-conforming you are punching down when you say things are act like you're better than that Because if anybody is actively being weird Anybody is actively whatever it's going to be the people that are stepping outside of what is Societyly acceptable for the gender that they I never so What I will say is Maybe some of us need to open up our history books Maybe some of us need to read a little bit because at the end of the day the people that you're hating on like these types of people People like me like or whatever historically speaking Those were the people that were doing the work they get us here for our rights like it was the people that were gender non-conforming I'm sorry. That was we're not at the forefront of They were not at the forefront of the LGBT movement I'm not saying they didn't do anything, but they were definitely not like in fact The like one of the biggest things that happened was putting them as like the face of it specifically because society thought that feminine presenting lesbians were more digestible to like the general public in order to make it more acceptable because They fit the gender norms like it wasn't like Like I don't know like y'all need to like guess I'm off or something This is like a crazy stupid beats me like this is a crazy stupid stance to take

 One thing I find consistently interesting is the capability of bisexual women to get on the internet and come into queer spaces to complain about bifobia. When most of the time, that is the most queer interaction you have had in your entire life is to get on here and complain about it because you don't enter queer spaces, you don't engage with the community at all because you're too busy dating homophobic heterosexual cisgender men. And you wonder why we don't want to date you because the majority of the time, we have nothing in common. I don't have really anything in common with people that probably center men in their lives, not saying you all do, but if you are consistently dated men and only men and you sit around with your friends and talk about men, we probably have nothing in common. Why would I want to date somebody like that? I'm not really even friends with people like that. So why would I want to date you? Most of you do not know how to conduct yourself within queer spaces. Most of you don't know how to treat women because the only example you have of that is how your boyfriends treat you and all the other men that are circulating around you because the majority of you hang out with heterosexual people and not queer people. That's why you don't have queer experiences. That's why they're not knocking down your doorstep. And then you get out here and act surprised. And it's the internalized misogyny and internalized homophobia, which is really like blatant at the fact that you feel more comfortable coming over here to complain instead of complaining to the people that are majority of me actually being actively homophobic and bifobic. And those are the people you're still choosing to date. So it's a really strong cognitive dissonance and I don't understand where it's not clicking that lesbians don't want to participate with that type of mindset. Like I don't and I'm not lesbian is here. We are not responsible for holding our hand through queer experiences. Sure, there are some lesbians that would go out and we do it, but it is not our cross to carry at all. So it's the same thing as if someone's in the closet. I'm 23. I'm not dating somebody that's in the closet. I'm not doing that. I'm not saying that being in the closet is bad. Some people need to be in the closet. I'm not participating in a relationship with someone in the closet because I don't want to and I shouldn't have to because that is more weight for me to carry when relationships are already hard. They having to teach you how to be queer is not my job and it's not any other lesbian job. So maybe do a little deconstruction, check your ego out the door and then come over here and engage peacefully with people that are actively queer in their everyday lives and have to deal with it and not people that are participating in heterosexual relationships which are widely and socially acceptable. I don't know. I'll just have a lot to say and I would just really like it if you kept the same energy with everybody in your life instead of coming over here and leaving like starting a complaint box with people that you don't even interact with anyways.

 So we left the States in January of this year and you know it's something that we had been talking about for a little while I think we really started talking about it after a Jan 6 Yeah political violence was a really big like warning indicator, right? That things, you know might pop off, but it was really after Rovie Wade after Rovie Wade was and Clarence Thomas was like hey all those rights that we've given you that are privacy based I think that you should bring them back to the Supreme Court and let us re-try those and you know So you know TLDR Hey bring us back these rights and we'll strip them to right and that included you know Game marriage that included sodomy laws that included birth control I think there might have been a few others as well But strangely not interracial marriage Why Clarence why what do I um and so You know we needed to figure out Okay, well now that they are you know saying that our rights are on the line We need to draw our line and that's the best advice that I could give to anybody who's trying to figure out When they're gonna leave and so our lines were if they come after our marriage or if they were to come after Her medication. Yeah, and those lines started getting crossed pretty quickly You know and and something that that I heard from a lot of people was that you know well they haven't there's no law that's passed That's gonna restrict your medication Yeah, but fan it wasn't for a lack of trying right hundreds hundreds of bills were proposed and voted on went to governors desks etc in the first months of 2023 Like if you were not up to date on Transhealthcare and the attack on it in 2023 Then it this might come as a shock to you, but it wasn't just that one bill from that one backward state like it was Nation-frickin-wide And it became very apparent that This was the next hill that they had decided they needed to take And at some point, you know, you have to ask yourself like Am I willing to wait around and hope that This Supreme Court is going to uphold my rights and keep this you know keep this situation tenable And you know in that really segues into the next thing for us, which was okay You've got lines get a plan Because if you've got a line without a plan that's a dream Right and so you know for us. I think our plans started with okay, well, we're gonna leave Where are we gonna go right right? You know, I think that we often get used to hearing people say like oh, well, I'm just gonna move to Canada You can't just move to Canada right? You could maybe travel there for 90 days or whatever As you can most countries in the world within American passport, but you can't just up and move somewhere You have to ask yourself where can I get residency? You know, what are what professions are they willing to take? Is there an income requirement? Will I be able to afford to live there? Like you know, it maybe you've got a country that you really want to move to and and it really fits your vibe or whatever But like you don't have the skills necessary to get a visa or you don't have the financial you know capacity to even Exist in that country and the thing to understand is that No country is required to accept you Right you don't have Some God-given right to be able to just go where you want and do what you want. That's not how it works and You know, yeah, it's easy to pick up and move to a different state within your country sure But don't mistake that Every country has things, you know, you can look at any country in the world likely has a list of Occupations that they will issue travel visas for these are typically, you know, very high skill high training high Stret their their jobs that are you know that are very particular Um, so when you're putting together your plan I think you know kind of the thing to ask is Where am I gonna go? That will accept me Because that's a real question and I think one that we're not used to thinking of as Americans and um, also, you know, not only where is your line But how long is your plan going to take to implement? Right and will your line be crossed while you're trying to implement that plan? Right just to use as an example like my meds right Say if we're gonna wait until after they've passed the bill outlawing my meds And then we're gonna start trying to enact a plan Well if that takes a year is that a year that I'm willing to live unmedicated Is that a choice? You know, is that a life that is acceptable to you and you know depending on your line? Maybe it is I don't know but for a lot of us You know seeing the writing on the wall is really important And you know the thing that's really hard and the thing that will really test you Is when you tell other people? Yeah, you're friends and family when you tell them you're going to leave the United States They're gonna think you're crazy. Yeah, it's almost like it's almost like the US Has gone to great lengths to really indoctrinate people into America best right and so when you then say No, I want to leave this because this country is becoming dangerous and untenable for me That smacked people right in the childhood Well, and also you know your line is probably gonna be different from other people's lines Right, so you might be paying hyperattention to anti-trans laws and you know your family maybe not so much and so they're gonna be like Things aren't that bad like what are you talking about and this is the other thing to consider about when you're thinking about leaving is They're not gonna just take away your rights all at once. No, right They're not just you're not just gonna wake up one day and all of your rights are gonna be gone they inch Ford right and I really like the metaphor that you use in the past It's like it's like the little sibling. I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you And you you know, and at some point you go You know you tell people like no look She's trying to touch me and they're like yeah, she's not touching you So why are you worried about it? Yeah, and like But I will say since our move we've had several friends and family Text us and say you know when you told us you were leaving last year at this time We thought you were overreacting and now I think maybe you made the right decision like that's been happening quite a lot and so you know learning to kind of like read those those warning signs of when They are coming up to your line right and I think you know it's something that you you definitely you will become a past master at Reading the writing on the wall Right and you have to you have to see these things for what they are No good as wrong. We Sincerely hope that the states Get's their shit together I got my toes crossed to you can't see But like man. Yeah, I I I pray for the states because like I've got family there that I know either can't or won't Yeah, I've got a move and like I have No desire no desire whatsoever to see my friends and family You know live a live a terrible life right but so for us You know we had decided that we could not live Under the daily waking up and checking to see if we still had rights right That's something that we decided that we couldn't live under so we decided To go ahead and implement our plan which took No a little less than a year, but it took that much time to actually put into action um And you know we ended up in month of day or away and we love it here and you know we can maybe at some point make another video about why we chose here but um You know Your your Place where you want to go is not gonna be the same thing as my place Right your line is not gonna be the same as my line your criteria is not gonna be the same as my criteria But if it's if you are actually thinking about it if if leaving the states is something that is on your mind right now You owe it to yourself to think all the way through it What's your line what's your plan how can you make it happen follow us for more?

 And that is your credit score. I brought no one cares.

 So yeah, super happy to be leaving the American credit system behind us. The credit score thing in the US has just gotten completely out of control. And we don't know a whole lot about the Araguan system and the lending system here. But, we've been here for about like what six months. No one has yet asked to see our credit score, which is actually like very surprising for us. Yeah. Considering what we came from. And Jamie can talk about that a little bit. Yeah. So, you know, first of course, understanding what a credit score is even supposed to be, right? And all the credit, all your US credit score is, is a reflection of how likely you are to pay all of your bills on time for the next six months. That's it. It's, you know, a computer looks at your previous payment history and decides how likely you are to keep that up. That's the whole extent of what that is. And so yeah, you're thinking of course, so like financial transactions, maybe, you know, getting alone, possibly opening certain kinds of banking accounts or even getting like an apartment. These might be reasonable times to look at somebody's, you know, what they call credit worthiness. But the problem is that because there's so much of a, of a, I can't even describe it like so much of the US runs on debt. It's gotten to the point where the credit score has infiltrated everything. So, you know, you want to apply for a job. They're going to check your credit score. And so again, well, what's the likelihood I'm going to pay my bills? Well, it's going to be a hell of a lot lower. If I can't get a job, buddy, you know, let's think about that. I'm insurance products. They're going to look at your credit score. And they're going to base the rate that you pay on your credit score. And so the double down there is like, oh, you had a rough patch six months ago when you went through some kind of traumatic event or a divorce or what have you? Well, guess you're just going to have to pay a higher premium on literally everything until that goes away. Oh, well, how long does it go away? Seven to 10 years. Oh, what's that? The factory you worked at shut down because they wanted to send it to a different, you know, different area or whatever. Great. That's cool. You'll just pay a higher price for literally everything for the next seven years. And so basically what this means is that if you were born into a situation where you didn't already have money and you struggled to pay your bills, even if you get a really good job and make a good salary, if you had a hard time seven years ago, then it's still going to show up on your credit score, which means you'll pay a higher interest rate on all your loans, right? You might not be able to get housing. If you can get the loan, right? You may not even get to get period. Well, and then also, I mean, you mentioned for jobs. Yeah, for jobs. Right. Like they'll run it. Now I've never, I personally have never been denied a job because of my credit. But I haven't either, but you know, I'm also somebody who's been lucky enough to always be able to have enough to keep my stuff paid, right? But like I'm by no means, am I going to sit here and say that makes me like a special individual. I'm just somebody who happened to have enough money to pay my bills, right? And so why? So the expectation then is that I'm just going to get preferential treatment everywhere I go. Right? So you're telling me that if, if me and somebody else apply for a job and where otherwise equally qualified that, oh, well, that, that chick over there had a hiccup on her credit card back in, you know, in, in what 2019. So we're going to hire you instead. Yeah, I went through a period where I lost a job. I mean, I technically quit, but it was one of those like, quitter, we're going to fire you situations. And basically the reason that happened was, I mean, there were a lot of reasons, but the biggest one was that as a queer person, I was asking questions about how we were treating our LGBT clients. And those questions made my employers uncomfortable. And so they labeled being problematic and basically asked me to leave. And that started like a couple of years of like not having super steady employment. And then I finally got a job that I was really excited about. And I, you know, sent in the paperwork to my, you know, the person I was currently working for, I had accepted the job offer. And then they were like, oh, we just got to run a credit check real quick. But then it didn't tell me before that had happened. Yeah. Now, thank God, like, it came up high enough to meet their demands or whatever. But it was so terrifying to think that like, oh, because I couldn't pay my bills for two years. I might not be able to get this new job that I'm really excited about. And need to mention, you know, when she says couldn't pay bills for two years, doesn't mean she just didn't pay anything. It just means didn't pay everything super duper extra ultra always on time. Like, oh, you paid this, you know, this, you were a month late on this $30 payment. So that's going to impact your ability to get a job two years down the road. What? Yeah. And I think, I think Jamie and I also just have like a really negative experience of the credit system because of our past job. So we both worked for a homelessness prevention initiative in the States. And, you know, one of the biggest obstacles to get housing was the credit score. Yes. Oh, my God. That's such a thing. And, you know, and literally you will, people will be denied the ability to rent an apartment, even though, like, yes, you have the money for the deposit, you have the money for the first month's rent, you have a steady job. But, oh, your credit's not good. You know, and, and it's, it creates this system wherein, to me, it becomes a very binairex system, either you are someone who has never had a financial hiccup and therefore you are entitled to all of these privileges and all of these preferential rates and all of these better products and all of these better services or once you have a hiccup, you have to bust your ever loving ass to get past that. You can't like, it's not like, oh, you know, I, I had a summer where things went off the rails, but it that was last year. This is this year. Yeah, I know you're still paying for it. And before you come for me in the comments, financial folks, because I know you're out there and say, well, the older stuff isn't weighted as heavily as the newer stuff. How many, tell me, how many credit reports you've seen where somebody missed a few payments three years ago and what's their score looking like today? Because I'll tell you what it ain't, it ain't an 800. Yeah. It ain't an 800. And they're still, you are still paying extra interest, ability again. And again, the credit check coming after the extension of a job offer, after the, so after you've already tended a resignation and then what they come back and go, oh, hell, it looks like you had a problem with Visa three years ago. And so we can't hire you. And so now you'll just be unemployed. So basically what this creates is a cycle where people who have money continue to get more money, you get more benefits, people who don't basically have no way of getting out of that cycle of poverty. And, and here's the worst part. What all of those benefits that the people who have money get are paid for by the higher fees on the people who don't have money? Yeah, we could do, I could do a sugary price on this, but seriously, like credit card points and all that good stuff. Like, oh, you know, I get, I get all these credit card miles, well, those miles are paid for because of that lady over there with the lesser credit score who's paying 30% interest. Yeah, so, so bringing it, bringing it back. We, you know, here, when we applied for our apartment, we did have to do the sugary dot. And that was, you know, they asked us to verify our income, which was totally fine. Yeah, it was reasonable. You know, it's like, yeah, yeah. But, I mean, y'all tell us, right? Like, what, what's the lending system like here? Like, do you all have a credit score? Um, you know, is that something we need to be working on? Yeah, I mean, if you see that, you know, I know Equifax does credit scoring in, in, in, what do I, but I, I don't, to my eye, it doesn't seem that the credit score has evolved into being a good person score, which is what they've, they've turned it into in the States. And it's, it's just gross. And it just creates a binary system between those that have and those that don't have. And if you don't have, you're going to pay TLDR. Happy to leave it behind. Yep.

 I know this person was joking and it did make me laugh, but I do think there's more lesbians in the world than currently realize their lesbians. Compet and female socialization is so strong that a lot of people go their whole lives without ever even considering they might not be attracted to men. And far too often heterosexual culture pushes this narrative of like, oh, I can't stand my partner, they're awful. Which convinced a lot of people that, oh, the reason I can't be comfortable in a relationship with men is just because that's how it is. But like, no honey, that's not how it should always be. You're probably a lesbian.

 Nothing pisses me off more than our own community, appeasing straight cis people just so they can get views and just so that they can hear what they want and have all the Trump supporters and all the conservatives rally behind them for some fucking likes. I don't know what the fuck is so hard about understanding the fact that this is just an adjective. The same way gay is an adjective, the same way straight is an adjective. The reality of the situation is if we have the word trans, we automatically have to have the word cis because it's an antinem. It simply means the opposite of trans, so if you're not trans, you're cis. I don't know why that offends you, so fucking hard. And we only use the word cis when it's relevant. We only use it when we're talking about trans issues, trans rights, trans advocacy. That's the only time we use cis, right? Just the same way that we have gay and straight and we use those words in accordance with our sexuality. They're necessary descriptors, so if you get butt hurt about the word cis, you just have some internalized transphobia. And here come the comments. Oh, I could say anything in a transphobic now. Yeah, that's kind of just how that fucking works. Why are you so hurt about being called the opposite of trans? If that's what you are. There was a time when the term straight was being treated, the way the term cis is now. And it was fucking awful. Do you want to know why? Because people would use the same shit you're saying and say, I'm not straight. I'm just fucking normal to try to alienate the gay community, your own fucking community. So the fact that you're selling out to the same people who would turn around and take away your rights in a fucking heartbeat is honestly super disingenuous and embarrassing. I don't give a fuck how many likes or comments or views you get. That's only going to go so far when those same people that are sucking your dick vote against your own rights.

 Is gay? No, he is not. Hi, uh, pansexual envy here. Um, I thought we left this mentality of jumping on calling conservative straight men. Oh, they're in the closet. I thought we left this mentality back in like 2005 or whatever. Like we can all agree that butt kiss or booty shaker, whatever his name is, I don't care. We can all agree that he is a bigot and a homophobe and his religious views are incredibly backwards. But we are not, especially this close to Pride Month. We are not throwing the LGBTQ community under the bus just to own some goober who were even probably not even going to talk about again in a couple of months. Because the way I see it, the way I see it, um, you're no better than him for doing this. And I'm not just talking specifically about the person I'm stitching. I've seen this so much over the past couple of days and it is driving me absolutely insane. Like for me personally, this is no better than all of the other little kids that I went to school with when I was really young calling me the epsler all the time. And I didn't know how to process that when I was a little kid so I was scared. And so like do better. All right. We don't need to be doing this anymore. Knock it off.

 Hi, so I don't have a really cool business like she does, but I do have debt and I'm planning a wedding for the woman of my dream, so I'm doing it. I'm joining the Cool Kids Club. I'm jumping on the TikTok creator bandwagon. It is time. Let's group together. Let's watch each other's videos. Let's interact with them and let's follow each other. We got this together and we will grow together. The types of videos you might see for me are TVD. Probably a lot of dog videos. So if you like dog videos to help you get through your stressful day, make sure you come back and follow my videos. Thanks!

Video: @mamamephistopheles_video_7369120307111529771-Scene-002.mp4
 is for their employees safety. No, they're not. For context, this video is about target taking away the pride collection within certain states. They're not doing it to protect anyone's safety. Yes, those deranged anti-LGBT biggots are threatening people's safety. You know what the proper response that would be? would be to hire more security and actually protect your employees. But they don't want to do that because it costs money. Furthermore, you're making LGBT people all around the country less safe by doing this. Because you know what? This message is to the biggots. This is telling the biggots that protesting stores, knocking over pride displays, and making it clear that LGBT people and public are under threat is going to work. That's the message that they get from this. It emboldens them, it allows them to keep doing it, and it gives them results. It gives them what they want. If target actually cared about LGBT people, then they would have simply kept the pride display up and hired more guards. This, this course of action, is worse than having no pride display at all. Whatever. Okay, it has always been about money. They started a pride collection because they wanted to make money from us, and they are getting rid of the pride collection because they don't want to spend money protecting us. When shit hits the fan, they are a solace corporation, and I don't care if you're manager or your local store is nice to you. This corporation is interested in exactly one thing, and that is money. They do not care about you, never, ever try and act like they do. You're either lying to yourself or you're lying to everyone else. Stop it.

 What is a tiny inconsequential grievance that you will never ever let go of?
----------------------------------------

Video: @mamamephistopheles_video_7369475023985233198-Scene-002.mp4
 The fact that we live in a system of global exploitation that forces abject horror on people in order to funnel wealth up to a small minority of sociopaths and the fact that those sociopaths are pathologically incapable of not seeking out more wealth and power at the expense of everyone else in the world, just so that they can see the number on their bank account go up or be a person who has more land. They don't even want to use the land that they don't even want to use the money. They just want to have it and they don't care what they put people through in order to get it. I'm also annoyed that consent for this system has manufactured amongst the citizens of the better off countries by telling them that the governments actually care about the will of the people when they were founded on conquest and blood and when the will of the people goes contrary to the needs of the sociopaths they ignore the will of the people and do what they want anyway. And it also annoys me that if you suggest even the slightest change theft system in such a way to be more equitable people will get mad and act as though the current system is the only possible option like it's an intractable law of nature even if a time before that system exists within living memory and if you point out that all systems of government and civilization were made up by people and can be changed by people for the good of people people get mad because they've been duped into believing that a system that exploits them is somehow good for them because it might exploit them slightly less than some other people who they're convinced to hate but you know when I talk to liberals they say this is a minor thing and that I shouldn't rock the boat so yeah there's my minor grievance

 Yeah? One of my favorite parts about being transgender in America is that not only might my state legislature just decide at any given moment that I'm the target of the week and to take away the health care that I need to survive. But an insurance company, pencil pusher, could just be like, hey, you know what? These people don't really need that medication that much. Let's just hike up the prices on them. It doesn't really matter. What a great country we live in. Best health care system in the world. Right? I'm not mad. I'm actually incredibly mad.

 Tell me why I thought she was the referee. I know as then vertical stripes she was wearing, but at least their vertical stripes they're slimming. But, you know, position, I did not think that she was interior designer. I was not going to guess that one. I thought that she was definitely one of those sporty spice women's that is a part of my community a lot of times. But in my defense, the sports ball field combined with the vertical stripes, I was looking for a whistle. But the haircut, the haircut definitely was given me sporty spice woman. If I was a betting game man, I would think that she was a less material. You know what I'm saying?

 I've said a lot of weird shit, but one of the ones that I look back on now and I'm like, what, Marib's, why did you hate yourself so much? I had a really hard time with a concept of deserving things to the point where I would say if anyone's like, oh, you deserve this, you deserve that. I really thought I was like the peak of spiritual humility when I would be like, what do I have a really hard time with the concept of deserving anything because what do I deserve except death and hell? And you know, Jesus saved me from that. I feel like I've been here young, aren't you supposed to be like optimistic and naive and full of innocence? I don't know. That wasn't me. I was a Calvinist, apparently. Blew.

 Not only do I really like this video, it also helped me pinpoint a feeling that I've been trying to get at for a few years now People really don't help their friends anymore with things that they're struggling with and of course I think there's many different reasons for that happening Obviously the biggest one being that we had a pandemic and we were all isolated from each other for about two or three years But especially for people in my age group for example I turned 23 this week and I remember having relationships in high school like this where I was very hands-on I was very intuitively like I know that you need help with this You can't help yourself so I'm going to help you do it But even outside of things like a pandemic I think whenever you encounter different kinds of rejection Well when you encounter different kinds of rejection when you go through certain conflicts or just separations with Friends or if you just have a lot of shame Whether it comes from friends or family You kind of develop this attitude where you decide to be hands-off on people's struggles even if they clearly need help for some people it's like a self preservation thing where they're like this is gonna Inconveignance me too much. I'm already overstimulated all the time I can't afford to help them which is very unfortunate but more often than not that is one group of people The other side is people who are more prone to the obedient who are more prone to feeling shame and just like low self-esteem because You think oh I can like sense in my spirit that this person needs help But I don't want to make them angry by you know trying to do this for them because like oh I'm pushing at their boundaries They obviously don't want help. They obviously you know they got it. They got it because it just makes you feel less overwhelming You don't want to lose them and it's it's really kind of a complicated thing to think about But I think the worst part about it is that over time you do lose that intuitiveness not with just others but with yourself and Even with my partner my partner and I met in 2022 and I have had to relearn how to like Be a good person. I got to relearn how to be a girls girl just because I Neurodiver and neurodivergence goes into this too obviously because like when your brain gets used to one thing for so long and Your prone to feeling shame around certain things You have to tell yourself that it's safe to do these new things And so I had to relearn how to be a girls girl. I had to relearn how to like be open and like be kind and not be afraid of everything Because that's really what it is. It's just fear and something as beautiful as this is helping someone eat when they clearly Can't do it themselves is needs to be more normalized I'm tired of having the same fucking conversation about can you give your friend a ride to the airport? Like obviously you can this is what we're made for and I just I'm really happy to see that video And I just wanted to speak on that so yeah

Secondly, just because two women kiss in a music video, that doesn't make it uniquely queer. To read more about these extinctions, go to MathisPlace.com.

No, because nowadays, most straight men, which I don't know if you straighten the guy, really, okay, um, it's just, let the ass hang out for the whole world to see. And this is so disrespectful. You know, most people don't want to see your dude who's staying drones and all type of stuff like that. And I respect that in a man to, um, cover up his dear ear. Um, maybe try to trick a bitch or something. I don't know.

 This was really nothing to do with that video, but go watch his video because it was fun. But he's talking about how he's now homophobic because gay men can fight. And it brought me back like some of the worst fights I've ever seen were between gay men. I remember I grew up in New York, so I remember I was like a teenager, young, very young adult. And I don't know if any of y'all are from New York. You remember that McDonald's that was like on West Fourth, like almost like right across the street from those really popular basketball courts. I forgot what they're called. But there was a fight. Was it over there? Yes, y'all know what McDonald's I'm talking about, the one in the village that McDonald's. That McDonald's. Anyway, there was a fight in the end. It was two gay guys and one of them was so pretty. He was so pretty and it chipped his front tooth. And I remember feeling so bad because they fought so dirty. And I remember feeling so bad because he was so pretty. I hope if you're still around which I hope you are that you got your two pics. He was crying. He was so upset. And I felt bad as a person that has broken a front tooth and just it's like over it. I get it. So that was it.

 So true the loose so many guys just want to chase and once you give them a chance to actually Take the bite they don't want it because they're actually just enjoying the chase and that is it They want something that's slightly out of reach that they can continue going after and you believe it's kind of learned How to clock it for example about two years ago I was visiting a leg deciding look if I want to move here or not and this guy took me on the day And it was a nice day. He spent like a lot of money on me and I did end up moving here And after I moved here, I actually wouldn't message him a little bit kind of see like you know We can hang out whatever. I mean I don't see who's a bit too old for me in my opinion But you know you never know but he didn't seem like that interested. It's something okay. Whatever But then one day he replied my story all salty You'd be like I know you're going out with people and I know you're doing this And it's like you never really got with me like all salty out of pocket and like oh my god In addition though, he would like reply to my stories and stuff and compliment me But then one day I was posting that was out and about at the bars and he's wiped up and asked like oh like are you out And I'm like yeah, I'm out like are you out or you coming out and he's like oh like now I'm tempted to come out like now That you're out and I was like okay. Yeah, like that come meet up with me and you don't reply so then like I replied a little bit later I was like oh like yeah like are you actually you don't want to meet up because I think I might head out soon But let me know and yeah, basically you just never met up with me And it's like I actually give him the chance I gave him the chance to actually come spend time with me And he didn't jump on it after being salty Before that I wasn't giving him the tension like he literally just wants to chase me and that's it

Video: @mikesgayfire_video_7364031065041816875-Scene-002.mp4
 Yeah, of course he wasn't. He was a fucking Zionist that was trying to spread anti-Semitism to make Jewish people scared while also trying to discredit the Pro-Palestinian movement on these college campuses. The Pro-Palestinian students here that are protesting what's going on in Gaza were appalled that he put this Palestinian flag on the menorah because the menorah is Jewish, it's not Zionist. And these people here are not anti-Jewish, in fact, they're proseures, they're just anti-Zionists. This Zionist right here disguised as a Pro-Palestinian protester is actually just one of the thousand examples of how you can't really trust where the anti-Semitism is coming from right now. Because it is absolutely advantageous for Zionists to spread anti-Semitism in the name of the Pro-Palestinian movement. If you watch this very quick clip, you will see the Pro-Palestinian protesters, the real ones being appalled that somebody would do that. See, unlike Zionists, who would have based their whole fucking rationale for Israel on the Holocaust, while actually doing a Holocaust to innocent defense men, women, and children so that they can get beachfront property. People like these people, people like me, people like my friends and followers, people who actually care about humanity beyond their own selves. They don't want to disrespect Jews or desecrate Judaism in the name of wanting to stop the genocide happening in Palestine. And as much as this is about liberating Palestine from illegal occupation of a made up fucking country with a psychopath leader and a far-right fucking government who call themselves Zionists, instead of terrorists, when it's the same fucking thing. It's hinged at the center of all social justice issues. We are all anti-Zionists, not because we're anti-Jew, we love Jews, and we respect Judaism. We are anti-Zionists for the same reason why we're anti-Christian nationalism and anti-radical Islam. We're anti-Zionists the way we are anti-Honophobia, anti-Mesajni, anti-racism, anti-white supremacy. Zionism is terrorism, but so is Christian nationalism. And we hate that too. Zionists are anti-Palestinian because they won't fucking beachfront property. Zionists don't give a fuck about Judaism. Just like Christian nationalism doesn't care about Christianity, Christian nationalists don't care about their faith, they don't have a faith. They have a doctrine. And the in the same way that Zionists want to genocide Palestinians. Christian nationalists want to genocide LGBTQ people, black people. And if not genocide enslaved, they don't give a fuck about what Christ has to say. They just weaponize Christ's words and use it for whatever they want. This is not okay. Propel Palestinian people understand that and are appalled by it. And fake propel Palestinian people actually Zionists who are disguising themselves as propel Palestinian people. are causing a lot of the antisemitism. And despite the fact that we know that propel Palestinian people are appalled by this, you're going to see terrorists. I mean, Zionists like Joe Biden and other terrorists. I mean, Zionists like Joe Biden talking about the situation as if this person wasn't a Zionist in disguise, but a propel Palestinian protester. Because that's the bad faith of the bill. Zionists have no fucking real argument that's just all, it's all smoke and mirrors. This is smoke and mirrors right here. And look at how easy it is for propel Palestinian protesters to just prove themselves not to be antisemitic. Because Zionism and Judaism have nothing to do with each other.

 Oh, it just occurred to me. So if you want to use the military industrial complex machine to expand your far right colonizing regime. All the while, making up some farcical excuse that you're trying to go after this terrorist organization, they you yourself have actually helped to embolden by funneling money to them for years. And you know, also bragging about doing that too. Like the farthest of right people in your own government. Anyway, it just occurred to me that the women and children being the largest number of casualties, or as Joe Biden would say, the cost of war. Also, John Kirby, fuck you, John Kirby. Well, just occurred to me that like, that's not accidental. See, I've heard those numbers before and I always just thought like, well, that is what happens when you're just indiscriminately killing and bombing, right? No, no. Killing women and children in way higher numbers than men that aren't part of the terrorist organization. That's super strategic. Like we keep yelling at them about like using surgical precision, they are. Is he once a lot of the non-hommas men alive? Because then why not become part of Hamas if all of your family is gone? Z has to give them a reason, right? That way they can keep doing what they're doing, which is the official term, what they officially call, mowing the lawn. Like that's what they call it officially mowing the lawn. If you run out of grass, then you have to stop mowing, right? Oh, okay. Yeah, so I knew that there was a lot to do with the military and industrial complex and the war machine, right? I know that it's super complicated and everything. Because I just didn't really think about the fact that like the higher number of women and children casualties, is it just didn't consider that that was on purpose? Is that it just happened to be like as a result of the carpet bombing and indiscriminate killing? No, no, that's how you feed the machine. That's how you feed the war machine. You create more terrorists or you know it like Neton Fucking Yahoo or Donald Trump or Joe Fucking Biden would call terrorists. I mean, I wouldn't blame them though. Like if Izzy wanted to unalive everybody that I love, including kids and like all they left was me and all my neighbors like me were the same way. Yeah, we would organize and we would join whatever regime we could to take out to avenge all of our loved ones, of course we would. Which is why I've been saying, I've said this like back in October and November to all of you moderate Democrats who still have yet to say anything. You guys are gonna all like after not saying anything for so long and like vote in the guy that is complicit in the genocide of like everybody that they've ever known and loved. And then like one day when they have the means and the resources to 9-11 us again. What are you gonna do then? Are you gonna be like how dare they? Israel is using American leadership, American weapons, American taxpayer dollars to unalive mass civilians in Palestine. Specifically for the most part, women and children. Seeming like they don't wanna unalive all of the men because you know they wanna keep up this terrorist organization right? What happens later when they come after us? So like for everybody who isn't an elected official in Congress or the seat of the president, this is all like preventable. They just don't want it to be preventable because it's lining their campaign pockets. It's gonna fall like all of the atrocities that will be fall last one day because of this are gonna be because of them. Our own elected officials. Eventually America is gonna have to pay for the atrocities that America's elected officials are actively continuing to engage in both Republican and Democrat. And it doesn't matter if you say like, yeah but like Democrats are just like participating in less atrocities. It's less bad with them. If they 9-11 us again, like if we have another 9-11, right? That's not gonna matter.

 Jesus fuck girl, so I'm not a good person. But what does it say about me though if me not a good person? Is agreeing with people who claim to be good people? Because I'm so fucking tired of like seeing you all through my for you page like for the lab I didn't even know who the fuck you were like three days ago now you're just like fucking plastered everywhere I have to hear like one more goddamn video of yours complaining about the fact that blah blah Pro palistai people are so much worse than BLM and how dare they hold up you in your Starbucks Everybody everybody time out hold up everybody Stop paying attention to Israel genociding all the Palestinians in Gaza Becky needs her pumpkin spice latte in Starbucks and y'all are holding her up. It is Becky, right? Oh fuck your name's Emily. I didn't mean to do that anyway, but Emily Before I made this video I wanted to go through your content and just sort of get an idea of who you were and I didn't know you before three days ago, but From the one video that I kept seeing of you I had this like certain idea of you and it was awful and I felt like you know what like maybe I shouldn't be so awful to her Oh, I gave you the benefit of that and I like looked through a lot of your your content just to sort of get a better Idea than just one video. What was that a fucking waste of time? Who are exactly who I thought you were? Yeah, I'm gonna emphasize waste of time. Jesus Christ man. That would perform it and making like everything that's happening in Gaza About how somehow you're a victim. Oh, that was like such a fucking Everything that you make is the same thing over and over and over again. Can't ever get that fucking time back So for everybody else if you want to play a game like a drinking game I'm gonna propose a new one. Basically has to do with all of Becky's content It's actually either says the word literally or actually will take a shot, right? But at the end of the video if she said both literally and actually in the same video two more shots And if she sucks her teeth like actually another shot while we're playing this game We can all take a poll. I'm betting Becky's mom's name is Karen and if not Karen Carol Becky is definitely a Karen in training Right. Oh, yeah, I forgot another shot for every time Becky reminds us that she's not Jewish But has Jewish friends who wants to put money down on the fact that none of those people are actually Jews They're just Zionists, right? And she thinks they're the same thing. So by her logic Joe Biden is also Jewish Anyway, Becky thank you for thing it has Not been a pleasurable experience knowing that you are a person on this earth from one not good person to another have a day's Zionist deserve

Video: @mikesgayfire_video_7364172248179084586-Scene-002.mp4
 Oh, because America doesn't give a fuck about Jews. Did you guys think that American leadership gave a fuck about Jews at all? No, America's doing what it always does. Which is basically, used Jews or Judaism as sort of like a protect against anti-Semitism blank. The disguise atrocities for fucking Zionists. If Zionism doesn't have anything to do with like, the danger to Jews, then you're gonna get fucking what five or six Nazis arrested in a group of 600 that caused the death of a woman. Don't get me wrong. If APAC and other pros rarely packed weren't in the pockets of our elected officials' pockets, none of this would be happening or even more important. Designism wasn't about like, nationalism for Jews, but let's just say nationalism for homosexual. Then even that fucking classic case homophobic house speaker Mike Johnson. You wouldn't be talking about protecting the Jewish students in all these universities. He'd be talking about protecting the homosexual students in these universities. Using Jews to accomplish atrocity for the sake of protecting them against anti-Semitism is how so many fucking atrocities happen. It's like fucking Israel exists. It's how they were able to sell America, the American people, the fucking lie that has had Israel be able to exist for so long. American lawmakers don't give a fuck about Jewish people. They just are using Jewish people to accomplish whatever they want. It's about propagating whatever the fuck Zionists propaganda once pushed that day. I mean it wasn't laughable to everybody when that fucking classic case homophobe speaker Mike Johnson was like we had to protect the Jewish students. Like they would give off like he gives it any fucking fox about Jewish students at all. He doesn't. He doesn't give a fuck about anything. He only gives a fuck that nobody finds this fucking secret text message between him and some fucking 17 year old boy allegedly. So yeah, just say the quiet part out loud everybody and there's nothing remotely authentic about our government trying to protect Jewish students when most of those Jewish students are on the propelsomian side. They're just using Judaism because they've already established through censuring Rashida to leave that being anti-Zionist equals anti-Semitism. Do you guys get this and how do I know this is true? Well, was it advantageous for Israel or designers in the far right Israeli government back into with Charlottesville North Carolina with the 600 Nazi was it advantageous at the time for Zionists in Israel to have the 600 Nazis arrested in Charlottesville North Carolina? No, it wasn't you know how I know because they would have fucking been arrested six were and they weren't arrested because they were being Nazis. They arrested for their involvement in that death of that other girl, right? So yeah, no, like it just wasn't dots that were connected for you before this. Please just like be smarter. Zionists are fucking running the United States government and it's this is fucking scary.

Video: @mikesgayfire_video_7369677917477031210-Scene-002.mp4
 So I'm going to reject this take and push back a little bit on your logic here. Here's a thing short of NFL football star Harrison Butler coming out of the closet himself The goalpost is always going to be moved in terms of confirmation or Prooms always going to be moved in the favor of the person who's doing the homophobic oppression, right? Lindsey Graham is a perfect example We have confirmation. We have numerous male sex workers Coming out to say that they have been hired by Lindsey Graham One of which even talks about skin tech relating it to Lindsey calling them his little lady bugs, but even still for so many people They refuse to openly acknowledge that he's a homosexual even though there has been like numerous confirmation sources on this and typically That shouldn't be enough to acknowledge that somebody is out of a closet because it's somebody else that has said so but in the Lindsey Graham He's using his power and his platform to hurt LGBTQ people So in this case, it's perfectly acceptable for people to acknowledge that he's a homosexual even if he doesn't but you know what They don't and shame on people who don't because if we all got on board with acknowledging his homosexuality then it changes the way the conversation is being had for many reasons And I'm gonna get to like a big one in a minute But first like what's he gonna say no, I'm not I did not any Implication that's is always gonna say and then what we're gonna have those male sex workers come forward again and talk about And he's gonna be back to a corner and it's ultimately going to start conversations that will not go well in Conservatives favors. Oh, you think that what they did to George Santos was because he was a liar No, it's because he was a gay liar Anyway, hire some buttlicker if male cheerleaders have come out and said that they've had sex with him Then that's confirmation enough let him try to deny it let him try to deny it and see what kind of conversations Arise from from him trying to deny it, but you all don't even think about that It's like to a lot of you who did your fucking programming because a lot of you seem like you're Just sort of favoring the oppressors at baseline without even thinking about the fact that you're doing that and of course We have to respect people's closets, right? The only time we never have to respect people's closets is if they are using their power Their platform their to hurt our community or another marginalized community in the process once they go that far They lose the entitlement of their closet safety a bigger issue. I'm having with this kind of mentality where we need confirmation we need proof is that like relying on these things that will never like rise to the level of what some people would call Pre because again even some people refuse to see Lindsey Graham as anything but hetero because he hasn't set it out loud Fuck and bullshit meanwhile, while we're respecting the safety of of people's closets who don't deserve the safety that we give them This just inherently stops the really important conversations that we could be having about what it means to suppress a part of oneself and the danger that that risks on other people Hello Catholic priests hello Christian pissors and fucking Bible camps So yeah, not acknowledging the homosexuality of Harrison Butler and progressing with conversations about what it means to be a Christian nationalist while also a closet case with internalized homophobia and what dangers come about having internalized homophobia because you see violence coming from these people whether it's physical Whether it's emotional whether it's the kind of violence that you see in a commencement speech It's like they would fucking learn from each other, right? based on like my observations for like over a decade, right? I actually probably even too because of my time in Bible college usually when you see Christian nationalists just being like overtly hateful for no fucking reason whatsoever Like nobody asked him to write that speech right that kind of intense hatred is usually following something that they recently did that Shames them right so my guess is that whenever that speech was written what came right before that was a bunch of either consensual or non-consensual Bud stuff and so this is the way he like Internally makes up for that and we can have more conversations about that But we never fucking will when information that's coming to us clearly about his non-heterosexuality Sort of gets dismissed until we find something stronger move the goal post a little bit fucking more for our presser again Who did your fucking programming and this isn't really specific to the creator that I stitched by the way This is more of a generalized statement because so many people Like think the way this creator does and it's so fucking annoying

It's why we still have these fucking hater They gained ground that way. I have so much fucking disrespect for people who say that I don't I think what you said After that was something that I would be in agreement with usually but because you said that like I Totally checked out from you who told you that that was an okay standard to have tell a homophobic parent of a queer child That they have a right to their homophobic beliefs. That's fine. No, it's the fuck not or even tell a homophobic parent to a non-queer child That they have a right to their beliefs. That's fine. No, it's the fuck not Jesus fucking Christ Like why the fuck do I feel like I have to be fucking parents to older people than me? You know because they have such fucking bad takes. I'm so fucking sick of that standard You're fucking selling yourself short by saying that by the way I do not give you fucking consent to tell that fucking closet case Harrison Butner that he has a right to his homophobic beliefs That's fine the fuck who the fuck are you? And this isn't just to this creator that I'm such if you feel like like that Ideology that like way of thinking that people have a right to their beliefs even if they're hateful You still have a lot of like work to do on yourself a lot of things to deconstruct and unpack You know it's a fucking burden for me to have to tell people older than you know Like how to just be a fucking decent person so again for any fucking idiots in the back No, it's not okay for them to have those beliefs and it's not fucking fine get better

 Oh, everything? Okay. Good enough. Also like great for you. I'm happy for you that Harrison Butler Speech has resonated so much with your lifestyle choices. By the way, I say Butler because of all the recent information coming out about him having an affair with a couple male cheerleaders when he was in college. Anyway, anyway, by yours in Harrison's own logic, what are you doing on TikTok? You should be homemaking and taking care of the kids. Did your husband give you permission to take time out of his family's day and make this video. I mean, I guess it would be fine if you were doing something else along like with making the video. Like if you were multi-task, but aren't there, isn't there like laundry to do and beds to make and children to teach and sandwiches to make? You're being a very bad way for you now. Again, I guess I wouldn't see any issue with you having your own little TikTok thing. If you were doing other homemaking things at the same time and you know what, by yours and Harrison's own logic, if you were really satisfied with your lifestyle choice of being a mother and wife and homemaker, you wouldn't feel the need to like be like using your own voice on this app. Like why do you think that you get to say anything? Legitimate question, shouldn't you be taking care of the kids? And even if they're napping, like there are other things that you could be doing in that house to make your husband happy. You don't need to like express your own thought. That's just not what you're supposed to be doing baby girl. It's like so hypocritical, it's so crazy when I see women, like sort of ironically enjoying the freedom that their own lifestyle choices are up again. Like you say you allegedly love the life that Harrison has described for you. Yet here you are in the middle of your lifestyle choice, like using your own voice and publicly voicing like your own feelings. That's your husband's job. Your husband is supposed to be speaking for you. That's part of his job. You're supposed to be the little worker baby girl. Buy your own logic, little workers don't have voices. So how happy are you?

 So here's the issue. I was running for an office. I'm actually an elected official now I had record breaking turn that my party wanted me to run for a higher seat in office and I did However, my student loads are more than my mortgage I worked three jobs and at least 50 hours a week I couldn't quit one of those jobs to run in my responsibilities that I already had before I ran for the first office They were piling up and my marriage was suffering one of the things that my own party loves most about I'm a fucking dragon And they found out that I was running one of my would be opponent ended up not running because of me Unfortunately, remember how I said my student loans are more than my mortgage Remember how I said that I work over 50 hours a week with three different fucking jobs. I had to drop I had to drop and so for me like despite the fact that me and My town my constituent know that I would be very helpful and beneficial in a higher seat of elected office I'm stuck at a very low level and I think that there's a lot of people in my boat When I talk about the dangers of our society having crippling fucking student loan debt There's a lot of people like me who are so fucking tired of the bullshit and will not put up with it And they're not just secondarily tired of the bullshit because they're nephobabies And they just have like a big heart. No, they're fucking tired of the bullshit because they're living it There is a reason why our system allows for such crippling student loan debt They don't want people who are educated and angry to hold any seats of power and I see that now I see that first hand this also and you cannot convince me otherwise Is it at least in part why our system doesn't have free health care because if we don't have free health care then we are limited in our Option because again, they don't want educated angry people who are mobilized and energized and galvanized for fucking chain They don't want those kinds of people in fucking power if I want to run something has to get I can't give up my jobs and my husband is the love of my life I'm not gonna like risk my marriage because I'm over busy over work And I'm a bad husband and I know that there are so many people in the same boat as me and I have to believe that that is all On purpose people are crippled with debt that other First world Western countries just don't fucking have speaking of Israel has free health care Relatively free education no crippling student loan debt free childcare and we're giving billions of our hard-earned Labor-based income tax over to them with people who are living better lives in American citizens And what are they doing with that money? fucking killing babies with it and who's letting them American legislators and why well not only are they getting paid With our money by the way, but because they're the lucky ones in this country They're not crippled by debt and they can run they're also docile enough When was the last time that any of those legislators pass to anything that was groundbreaking legislation for the American people and who's in power again? If me and people like me had the ability to run I would make it so fucking awful I would go to lengths within the law to do everything that I can to fucking liberate American people from the numerous corruption and injustices of their own fucking countries government But I'm fucking crippled and again two thing first thing is there are many many people too many people like me in this country Who would love to run for an office but are crippled by the system that has indebted them and two It was designed that way 100% I don't know what the answer But just run for office if you don't like it it's more complicated than that because I'm trying and I get to know how to do that successfully I know this getting along But here's my last if my government ended up paying off all of my student debt both federal and private because the only reason why most of my private Lones are private are because I had to consolidate and I had no other fucking option But if my government did that of course I would run for all you boomer fucking idiots who would call that a handout Which I'm paying into your retirement not mine be like your fucking free health care You like that handout that my labor helps contribute to you're taking so much of yours and mine that I'm not gonna Have it fucking handout there is no good or legitimate excuse for why student loan debt is the way it is in America And until that changes you're not gonna have the right people in the right seats of office

 But do men even want monogamy? I mean honestly...
----------------------------------------

Video: @mikesgayfire_video_7372991008734203182-Scene-002.mp4
 My husband and I didn't and still don't and our relationship has never been better. For us it requires a lot of communication and open dialogue. There's expectations that, you know, catching feels might happen. Having realistic conversations with one another about what that really means. The point is at least in our non-monogamous relationship, either of us are engaging in that, like we know where each other's head is at, as well as where the heart is too. I think it's wild that especially for straight people, given how much sexual infidelity exists out there. That sexual monogamy is just sort of like a given baseline for most heterosexual relationships from the start. Fucking weird. Oftentimes, and this is honestly just anecdotal, but when it comes to my like cis-head friends, especially the guys, this topic of conversation comes up. It's always about their ego and they're even self-aware enough to like acknowledge that. There's a couple things baked into that as well, I think. For me, monogamy doesn't really work without like a lot of communication, but then also for me, neither does a successful relationship. Regardless of it's just friendship or if it's like family or if it's your life partner, right? Singular or plural. But anyway, for a lot of like these cis-head guy friends that I have that like, they don't want monogamy, like for the main reason of for their own ego, more on that in a minute. Even when I say a lot of the ego stuff goes away with like really good, deep, effective communication, almost feels like like the level of communication that my husband and I have seems to be unheard of, like like a fantasy for a lot of stray couples that are monogamous who I know at least. Like in my opinion, if you're in like a monogamous relationship, there's just certain things that you don't want to tell your partner. For people like my husband and I, like when we opened up our relationship, like there is a line of communication that was able to be established that just couldn't be when we were monogamous. I feel like I've gotten to know him and like a lot of like deeper truths about him because that line of communication didn't have to be hidden anymore. And through that, like a lot of just logical ways of thinking, like just logically speaking, one human being can't check every box of another human being. Oftentimes in successful monogamous relationships, that's sort of like maybe an underlying and so it's okay for certain like monogamous couples to just sort of get rid of those boxes. But a lot of times with monogamous couples who are like in some sort of cheating situation, they don't want to get rid of those boxes and then they just secretly get them checked. And this weird ego thing that I see from at least some of my cis-head male like monogamous friends is that they don't want to admit that they can't check every single box, no pun intended. You think about it, like the selfish nature of monogamy, my God, this is a person that you're like loving the most, right? Like you're supposed to love the most. For like your own ego's sake, you want to just deny them more pleasure. This world is fucked, right? So when we have time to experience pleasure, your own ego's sake, you're going to have the person that you love the most be limited in their pleasure from only your body part or body parts. So weird fucking standard, right? What's also weird is that when I talk about these things with my monogamous straight guy friends, everything that I'm saying makes perfect sense to them. They'll even admit that there's a cognitive dissonance that there's like an underlying like machismo that like is attached to like why they don't want to be like non monogamous with their partners. But even for heterosexual couples who are struggling to stay together, monogamy is such a heteronormative standard that it's okay for them to have this cognitive dissonance. In a weird way, people would rather end their marriages over another dick. I know it's more complicated than that. It's really about the dishonesty, right? But if you've got that heteronormative monogamy thing going, how can one be honest? Like there's no expectation for that, not defending dishonesty by the way. I'm just putting it out there. But yeah, they would just rather ruin like destroy everything in certain situations and have uncomfortable, at least at first uncomfortable. It gets comfortable. Conversations about boxes that maybe the other person can't check. Oftentimes the boxes that the other person can't check is simply because they're that person. Crazy how many like relationships I've seen like just go to the wayside over somebody's box that needed to be checked. But in the end, it was just meaningless relative to what they had. Again, not defending it. Oftentimes at least in my own personal life, when I see couples who are like under that heteronormative monogamous baseline, you scratch the surface of that ego. And this goes both ways, but mostly forces head men. To find that the guy unwillingly even hasn't done enough of his own deconstruction and views his partner as property. At least in my opinion, that's what I've seen in my own life. So saying everything that I just said to answer your question, do men even want monogamy? My anecdotal observations. I think that the relatively complicated answer is ultimately no. Having another man use their property seems to matter more. And if there's more than one reason for that, it seems like the biggest reason is that they're afraid that the other man using his property will use it better. And that, girl.

 No, because this is a mock-the-memory. I remember like, just looking on it all the time, because I was obsessed about the back of the day to be in the room with the celebrity. And he wouldn't do any fun. They just saw a talk for a minute and a go. And I, one time, would follow who I've bought with the sugarpapes. And that night, I was waiting while they were on Xbox. I gave my hyper-characterish out. The delusion was real. I need to know if they were real as well. Like, did I meet the sugarpapes? Probably not. But we can pretend.

 You don't need to starve to lose weight. In fact, you should not.
----------------------------------------

Video: @minutepoet_video_7373347782918409518-Scene-002.mp4
 star of yourself to lose weight. Do not do that! I weighed 415 pounds and I used to look like this. I lost 230 pounds before I broke my knee. Patty is 100% correct. You do not need to starve yourself in order to lose weight in a healthy way. The creator who I'm stitching is named Patty. Go watch your video. It's incredibly important for health and wellness. If you're like Lauren, what are you wearing? I'm in my bathing suit. I'm about to go swimming. Order for me to start losing 230 pounds. I had to join weight watchers and despite all the controversy that surrounds weight watchers, they get one thing right and that is you do not need to starve to lose weight. Eventually, you will plateau. That is a normal thing that happens when it comes to trying to lose weight. And the best way to get past it is to start incorporating exercises or start changing up what you're eating. Now weight watchers does not rely on calories. They do a point system. They give you so many points that you can eat a day and then from there you can just disperse it out as you eat. I was given 85 points at 415 pounds. Now you're probably like, what does that even mean? Well, if you wait, let's say around 150 pounds and you're trying to lose like 20, 30 pounds, you're going to probably start at about 23 points. But here's the thing at 85 points, at 40 points, at 20 points, you could be eating as little as a thousand calories a day depending on what you track or you could be eating like up to 2500 calories a day provided. It's like healthy and has macro and micronutrients that you need in proteins and fibers, etc, etc. Eggs on their own or zero points. Grilled chicken on its own is zero points. Vegetables and fruits are zero points. You incorporate those into your meals and then it actually becomes a more full balanced meal so that way you're not just tracking like your starches and your fats and your sugars. This is not an ad for Weight Watchers. I'm just agreeing with Patty. You don't need to starve through the day in order to lose weight and in fact, if you do starve, your metabolism will grind to a halt because it will believe that it needs to keep all of the fat on your body. But if you are worried about feeling snackish throughout the day, eat more protein. I probably consume anywhere between 90 to 150 grams of protein a day and it helps. It helps me not feel hungry because it takes your body longer to break protein down so you stay full longer. So don't starve yourself. That's not how you lose weight. That's not how you stay healthy. That's not what makes you happy. That's not what makes you feel good. Don't do it.

----------------------------------------

Video: @minutepoet_video_7375014992124628270-Scene-002.mp4
 A box of rubbers can cost anywhere between 20 to 30 bucks for a pack of 16. And dental dams are even more expensive because you have to buy them in bulk online. So instead of purchasing these, I go to Planned Parenthood and they give away bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives and even lube. They give it all away free and giant bags. So if you want to practice safe sex and you want to support an amazing organization, go to Planned Parenthood, let them know you want to be safe and they will give you bags of condoms and dental dams and other forms of contraceptives. And if you are in between partners, be sure to get tested while you are there. It is a good idea to make sure you aren't bringing anything into your next relationship. So remember, practice safe sex and have fun.

 Do you know what's concerning to me about this is that when I was in high school, we were actually having the same conversation about same sex marriage. In 2011, only 50% of people supported same sex marriage. In 2021, only 70% of people supported same sex marriage. And there are generally people who are working to take away that right as we speak. Now, I don't know if this is in some way to get the spotlight off of same sex marriage or rights stuff like that. But this will backfire on us. It's not support one or the other. You can support both very easily. It's also really weird to be so sensitive about this and upset about people going by a different pronoun. Like, that doesn't really affect you. Like, realistically, that doesn't. Also, someone was not trans and they corrected you on their pronouns. Y'all want to have any issue. It's just because they're trans. Like, be so for real guys.

One thing that really makes me sad when I think about Luther Vandross is that out of all those years my good brother did not get the chance to live his truth and it's like it's so sad because you got to think at that time when he first came out I mean it was almost taboo I mean and there were gay people in the community and you can say oh it never came out how you can say that Luther Vandross is gay but I mean let's be honest if you watch any of the old clips of Luther Luther was asleep I mean it's just nothing about it we love Luther that's our man I mean come on now however it's just it's sad that he didn't get to live his truth out happily he loved love you could tell he was a man that love love might even have been in love a couple of times and for him not to be able to express that the way that he wanted to I think about that a lot I really do and it's just like it's like dang Luther you he was one of the greatest and he couldn't live the way that he wanted to and Luther been a star for a long time so he had to have this for so long just because of his celebrity so I don't know there was just something I've been thinking about but any who checked the video out but dang Luther I really wish you got the chance to live your truth the way you wanted to

 Now, some people might think that I'm about to go away left for what I'm about to say, however, this right here is what started this whole gay epidemic thing amongst our community. And I'm going to go back to explain because you got to go away back. You even have to go back to the slavery and all of that. As a mother, right, we understood that massive, we understood that the people feared our men, the power, the strength, the melanin, the melanin and their voice, the base, everything about them, they feared. And they would kill them because of the things that they feared or was jealous of about them. And we would much rather raise our child or our son to be feminine, to be meek, to be ashamed of who they were, hold your head down. Don't talk with too much base in your voice. Don't talk too deep. Don't talk too strong. Don't be too strong. Don't look too strong. Look a little softer so that they can feel more comfortable. And over the years, it has now turned into this whole epidemic. I'm going to be honest, I'm not saying that some people are just not born how they are born. I'm not saying that. But we look up, if we look at society, this is not natural and this is not a natural evolution. This is something that has been made and it's something that has been taught from the womb for generations, not just one generation but taught from the womb for generations. And so you see, I can hear their voice. My house, old guard, she was when he was complimenting her about her outfit. And the fact that he had to, and get her to get his voice possible for her to feel comfortable in front of a brother. This is war. This is silent war for it. No, no, not to the brother. I'm not knocking him his lifestyle. I'm not knocking nobody in there. Lifestyle. I just want people to take us the time to look at the bigger picture. We are in warfare and they are, they are trying every week. Mind and they are attacking us from every way which is possible. And if we don't understand that, we're going to continue to lose this war. But that just blew my mind. That was a prime example of how that community, those people are more comfortable with our men in a more feminine state than in their natural masculine state. They can only accept them in the feminine state. That's why they're pushing this so hard on that y'all. Brothers, our brothers, this is why it's so important. We got to know ourselves in the source from which we come from know the grand door that which we come from the beauty and the power that we come from. And we got to get back there.

 So you identify as a stem here, I would be saying.
----------------------------------------

Video: @monhoezzz_video_7366316686519110944-Scene-002.mp4
 So who can use the term stem? Let's get into it real quick. So in case you didn't know, stem is a combination of stirred and femme and femme across the board just means feminine presenting lesbian. Sturd is very specifically a black or Latinx masculine presenting lesbian. So when you say you're a stem, you're in the middle of these two things, but it is specifically used for black and Latinx people, not for white queer people. I actually did try and look up this morning the origin of the word stirred and why it was used specifically for black and Latinx lesbians. But I couldn't find anything so if you know, please feel free to drop some info in the comments or stitch this video because I feel like that would be really good context to have here. And honestly, this is no shade whatsoever to the cast because when I first came out as a lesbian just over a year ago, I also logged on to social media apps and saw people throwing around the term stem. And I got excited and I was like, wow, that describes me and I went on like created a bunch of videos where I hashtagged stem stem lesbian, etc. And it was only then that somebody came into my comments and educated me on the fact that this is a term specifically for black and Latinx people. It's not a term to be adopted by white people. So here's me sharing that knowledge with you. You're welcome. The white equivalent to stem, I think, would be fudge. So the combination of them and that, but I personally really hate that word. I just don't like the way it sounds. So when I'm presenting a little bit more masculine, I will go for mask or maybe soft mask. But my point is that there is a bunch of terms that we can use as white lesbians that don't encroach on a word that is like racially and culturally and historically significant to you, black and Latinx people.

 It irks my nerves. All this chocolate is sitting in front of you sitting next to you. You're much rather happy. You'll know and face down on your screen. Answer in every DM a Snapchat. Who is texting us? That's right. Who's texting us, babe? Cause I'm curious who has your attention when I'm right in front of you. I wanna laugh. Tell me the joke that got you in the middle of that gig with me so hard. You know that same topic. You have to be careful about them people who always on their phone, but when you're not around them, it takes the devil for them to respond to you. If you're that excuse my bad, babe, I just don't be checking my messages like that. You know, I mean nothing about it. But when you get around them, everybody who messages them, get a instant reply. You know, I'm rather late in my bed on myself, rub my own nipples and rub my feet together like a cricket while I watch anime and be happy alone. Then worry about why you not respond to my message when I know you and your phone. Whoa, come good.

 Not because this career absolutely ate with their just assessment of the whole situation. And I say this as some of the experience of NCA, right? At least a good 80% of people, 80% I'll say who are the most Republican stuff are on these apps trying to approach your public, trying to, you know, whatever, mostly arrange to you. So I have a couple stories you share from my time in the military. But for me personally, I'm not necessarily gay, but I do believe this sexuality is a spectrum, right? So it can depend. But anyways, you know, it's like, yeah, plenty of times, you know, back by the military, whatever, right? You know, like after, you know, they've had a couple drinks or whatever or whatever, you know, they try to approach and be like, hey, you want, I'm like, absolutely not. Aren't you the most on a folk person ever? Constantly using, you know, the F-word slur to separate gay people. is constantly being like, oh, this person, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're like, be just deriving them, you know, just so anti them. And yet you're trying to, well, are you insane? Have you lost your mind? So I'll say this, especially to women, right? If you're in a relationship, whatever, and you do this always constant yapping into so anti gay, just like, oh, you know, you're the other person in this world using F-slur all the time. Maybe we evaluate the situation, okay? I mean, I'm speaking from a heart, I'm speaking from experience, okay? A lot of these dudes, like eight times out of 10, probably even, I'll, even wait your nine to about 10. I'll bet money on it. People who are the most homophobic constantly time and time again get caught. I mean, just like a public figures, you know, who are the most homophobic, most, you know, fangate their soul, F-slur their soul, let's just go with the network. They get caught doing the most insane, like the most gay thing ever. Like, I mean, I can mention people for you, just to be a person, for example, right? So anti gay, right? Let's try to get a person to show that he just divided the whole time. A Romanian minister, whatever, literally trying to pass homophobic laws gets caught being a, pretty much come down for his seven dudes in the hotel. I've got a down list, okay? So do not think that maybe your boyfriend or husband or whatever who is so homophobic, oh, the homophobic is sick really doing whatever. Come on, been or done that. Come on. Anyways, great video. Thank you to his creator. Thanks so much, Fred, for exposing these homophobic fucks who just think they can just sit there and they'll be like, oh, yeah, trying to have peace, some sort of crap or whatever. It's except yourself, bro. It's okay if you are, whatever you are, just accept yourself and be who you are. I mean, it's absolutely insane. You have to sit here for 10 and try to appease the certain crowd for, I mean, for what? And then the people who worth you know who you are, everyone knows who you are, like just, just, just, just admit it and just be yourself. It's not, it's not a 1700s anymore. Even if it was, just be yourself.

 Wow, you're actually doing that at Disneyland. Did you know that Disneyland was created for kids? It's a fantasy land. Hmm. It's interesting that you actually even said, I swear I'm going to get banned from Disneyland. It means you know what you're doing is not cool. Yet there you are talking about this surgery using cake pops and candy and dress like a little girl. Hmm. Wonder why people are pushing back on the whole trans gender thing. When a grown male who thinks they're a female does stuff like this, you think it's helping the rights of our community. You've got to be kidding me. You are destroying. You don't even care. You don't care. You do not care what you're doing. You do not care about the rights of everyone. You only care about yourself. And you only care about all of this attention, including me giving you attention. That's all you care about. It's obvious. And it's actually so believably sad. It's sad. You know, I wish you all the luck, my friend. I hope that you find the space that you need to be to live in the world and be accepted as the female you want to be accepted as. But the reality of the matter is you probably won't because what you're doing is making a mockery of us. And it hurts my feelings a lot to see this stuff happening. Because I not only care about myself, but I care about everyone else. And in order for us as transsexual people to move through this world, we have to care about everyone, not just ourselves. And I think what you're doing is a disservice. Honestly, I really do. And that's okay that you might disagree with me, but you probably do. But I'm going to tell you that. I disagree with everything you're doing on here. And I don't think you're helping us. And I think what you're doing is creating our huge huge, part of the hate towards us. And using children's spaces and the way we talk about kids and what we're doing to kids is not helping any of us move forward. So it's my opinion and I'm pretty just yuck. Yuck.

We should we be nice to him Should we encourage him to explore sexuality or Do you think we should bully him? No, you don't think we should bully him. Do you? You're not advocating that what do you think we should do if he was gay? You tell me I don't know what the proper protocol is when you catch a straight person pretending to be straight or sorry gay person pretending to be straight What are you gonna do to him that?

 Easy. Why do trans people not want to be misgendered? Because they have dysphoria. Why does his people not want to be called cis? Because they're just stubborn. But maybe you forgot a little tidbit given uh You passed very well. Of course, it's always the ones that pass well. They want to argue this kind of nonsense. It's not that we want to cause this people's sis. It's that we want to make a distinction because when you generally talk to somebody, you're not going to mention whether there's sis or trans people. If you see people using the word sis, they're usually not talking about you. So it's not been serving yourself into it.

 I have a question for you. How are you not a self-hitting guy? This entire video? Well, if I'm raising my son in this gay household that he sees me kissing on my husband being affectionate with my husband And then he goes to someone else's house and I guess it's affectionate with another boy Because he thinks it's okay like that entire Diet tribe Self-hate most of us have straight parents especially of a certain age Seeing them kiss and be affectionate with one another didn't make us straight. So and what if your child is gay What then are you gonna teach them to being in the closet be closeted? Hi, are you not gonna even the tools to love himself to be sure within himself that he's a good person and Not some freak that needs to do freak shit behind closed doors. The fuck is wrong with you?

 No Mona fan, I just woke up. This argument gets me every time the whole is like the gay version of Separba equal, but then you realize there really can never be a Separba equal because they kind of clash with each other. So the whole argument of we are here to accept but not agree. So saying that we fight for acceptance and not agreeance but then going on our rant, it being like you need to get your accepted ass down off that stage because I don't accept it. You see where I'm coming from. And this is this type of rhetoric and any marginalised community that gets the people that are in disguise that really just want a reason to hate all margin the lives communities to be like well that person that's from that community said that so I have a right to be hateful and I feel like the whole the whole Billy Porter being an address thing and Nails and which thing if that's what he want to do that's what he want to do he's more femme presenting the mask just because you're a more mask presenting my gay man does not give you the right to feel like you're all some sort of pedestal because that's all it is. It's the gay version of the online skin and I'm not dark skin so I'm closer to what's socially acceptable and that makes what I'm doing better. When in reality they see all you gave that is the exact same way the same way they see all those black niggas the exact same way so I guess enjoy your few videos of social acceptableness because at the end of the day it's some people you so long ago.

 to talk about joke about or say. And you should go back to being deathly afraid of offending people. Lady, no one gives a flying shit if you're offended. I am not going to count down somebody just because of who they're attracted to. That is petty. That is pointless. That is meaningless. And that's stupid. You're gatekeeping, critical thinking, and your own emotions about a very specific situation. That nobody gives a shit about, and less people like you bring it up. And making the art of conversation way harder than it needs to be, just because you have a problem with it. Stop living your life on the fucking internet. Nobody gives a shit about how you feel about a situation. You are actively discouraging the basic idea of critical thinking and observation. I say yes, you should be able to offend people, because that's not your fucking problem. Being offended is you having a personal emotional problem with something that's being said or done within your facility. But to the rest of the world, they don't give a shit, honey. Stop making your personal issues everybody else's problem, because they're not. We have lives, we have jobs, and we have other things to do than cater to your personal issues. Go outside, drop your phone, and go talk to somebody outside of your little friend group.

Jerees is what's like, we just like it. We are just like a normal straight fucking heterosexual couple. We just want them for life. Like real love. Like we're getting married. See the only difference is that we're female. We're female. We're female. We literally the only difference. You know? Like we had our rights. We were happy. We were rights. Like that's the difference. You know? These bombs are what in everything we are fucking cherry on top. They've come into the community so they can get into bathrooms and fiddle around little girls. A little boys whatever your preference may be. Because that's why I'm shaking. Because that's why I'm shaking. It's because they're pushing young lesbians and they're having sex with them because they get off on it. Because the Spanish and these young girls want to be so inclusive, so definitely inclusive. They'll do anything. So in today's fucked up world, we agree with pedophilia, rape of young lesbians and the racial women. So this is how fucked up we've fucked up. Yeah, baby. I've got to get out of here.

 As a person of a particular age and someone that was in WeHo this weekend and saw that whole thing. I have to say WeHo is absolutely changed. Contrary to what this video is saying and I know I look crazy, I'm sick, whatever. WeHo has changed. There used to be a time when yes, you would go to WeHo to dress to and dress. So to speak. But I didn't see that. I don't know what this guy is talking about. To be honest with you, I saw more attractive and more dressed to impress situation in Silver Lake. But what I did see in WeHo is a lot of signs that said, watch for your phone being stolen or be aware of pick pockets. What's that all about? Because that wasn't a thing when I was in WeHo. WeHo has changed and this guy is evident of that. All about WeHo Queens and Tweaks.

 What is something that you really appreciate about your therapist?
----------------------------------------

Video: @nightlythoughts_video_7375206517093485867-Scene-002.mp4
 So I struggle with anxiety, like a lot of bitches on the planet, but my anxiety revolves around this like fear of real or imagined abandonment. Like I feel like people are going to like find me out or see that I'm like truly a shitty person deep down and then like lose interest to me and dip. And I've had a lot of therapists prior to the one I have now and the ones prior have always like gone with the approach of like, oh let's figure out things that you like about yourself and try to combat these inner feelings and realize that you are a good person and you are interesting. And like it has helped with myself confidence a little bit, but it hasn't only like helped with the fear of abandonment, you know. And what I really appreciate about the therapist that I have now is that he decides to hold up like a mirror to my anxiety a little bit. And what I mean by that is like he'll come back at me with like an outside perspective of my anxiety and like give me insight that I don't necessarily see when I'm in my own head. And I'll give a few examples like my friend group in college like rapidly started expanding at one point and it made me super nervous because I was scared that the friends that I have I had then were going to lose interest in me and like latch onto these new friends instead and just like completely like cut me off. And I remember talking to him about this like one specific person. I was like yeah I'm just like kind of mad in a noise. They were like that this person was spending one on one time with this new friend and like they were laughing and having fun together and like without me, you know, I felt like excluded and I felt like my friend was losing interest in me in favor of this new person. And then my therapist was like, okay, so you are mad and upset that your friend is happy and building new relationships that make them happy. And I had to like literally pause and I was like that that makes me sound like a fucking dick. Because like my anxiety was in like oh you're mad because your friend's happy. My anxiety was being like oh you're mad because your friend is leaving you. But from the outside perspective yeah it definitely looks like I'm mad at my friends for making new connections that make them happy. And like another example is like when I'm meeting new people, I always think that they like immediately hate me or like judging me or like think I'm stupid or whatever. And again it's a very self hatred type of thought and anxious thought. But my therapist paused and was like isn't it kind of rude of you to think that this random person you don't know is that mean that they're just going to start immediately judging you. And then I was like yeah you're right that is kind of a mean thing of me to do. Like nothing has made me want to change my behavior more so than realizing how my actions and my thoughts can affect other people. And I've never had another therapist like brave enough I guess to like challenge my thoughts that way. And I just really really appreciate it about him.

Watch some of her videos like them, comment, share. That would be really nice. So, a few things. I had a child who had Codge Consumfomo in 2017. She's okay now. So, her journey is a little near and dear to my heart. I am having my mammogram next week, scared to death. So, if you guys could help out and go to her account, that would be really great. And go watch this whole original video. It's, there's a lot more to it than just that first bit. But, you know, when you stitch it, it only lets you take so much. So, I would personally appreciate it if you guys would help her out. So, this kind of a heart string moment there. I'd appreciate it.

----------------------------------------

 Now, I'm not here to attack you by saying this. And I'm not even gonna use the term self-hating. I'm just gonna call it internalized homophobia. When someone asks you how you will feel if your son was gay, they're not asking you about your own individual experiences as a gay boy or a gay man. At that time, it's time to decent to yourself. And speak about your child. If you had negative experiences as a gay man, then you wanna reinforce within your gay child that they shouldn't have a negative value or perception of themselves just because how other people see them and treat them. When you say things like, I haven't a gay son, what happened, what made me devastated? That's the sound the same as the people who say that they devastated by the fact that you gay. So I feel like gay man needs to find a way to talk about their own experience and then reframe it on how they gonna use their own experience to be better parents. Because if the LGBT community don't want kids, that's a part of the community. And the heterosexual people don't want kids, that's a part of the community. And who is there to love and nurture and take care of LGBT kids?

 Hi, I'm Nora, a former straight man for whatever that means current lesbian. I'm no one had ever seen a shirt What's going on? But I love jewelry. I'm a jury every day of the week month year. I'm not trying to throw my hat The ring I'm not trying to join any beef jewelry can take care of herself That's the one thing I've learned while watching her over the last three years of my transition I just you said you'd never seen a Transwoman who was a straight man before her relationship. I'd like to offer you my credentials I blurred out her face because we're not sure like that. But here's one of my homecoming dates We were together for like three years. There are several pictures of us together I just didn't want to have to blur out her face more than once and I can't put my finger on it But it's just something about the dynamic didn't work there's no point in this video like I said I'm not trying to build off of anything that's already been said We're here former straight man. We're probably just all still taping women

 themselves as trans women in context where it makes sense. But they fully identify as non-binary people. Honestly, yeah, I just forget most of the time that I don't identify as a woman because my comments are just flooded with people telling me I'm doing a stellar job at being a trans woman if they recognize me as trans at all. I'm not a woman. I'm just treated like one. Well, isn't the point of your transition? Wasn't that the point was to be treated and look like a woman? No, honestly, it's just it's got a- got tiring. You pass so well. Pass is what? Something I'm not? I'm not a woman. Not like that. Not in the way you're thinking. I'm much cooler and hotter way.

 Oh, no way. Because, wait, wait. I have never felt sexier in my life than when I'm wearing tiny shirt, big pants, oversized flannel. Pull off that mask, lesbian vibe. And whenever I'll put on a dress or a skirt, it feels like I'm putting a costume on, putting a lipstick on a cow, you know? Like it's just I'm feeling right. And I can hear y'all already know. It's not because I wanna be a boy. I've already tried that. It didn't work. That was not the answer. I just thought I was crazy. I love skirts.

----------------------------------------

Video: @orbitalorbit_video_7375170172719500586-Scene-002.mp4
 Okay, I have a story for this. It's really not that crazy, but it is kind of funny. For some context, this happened like 11 or 12 years ago. I was like 20, 20, 20 years old. I was in college. I went to a huge state university, like 50,000 people, giant university. And I lived in a house off campus with like eight other guys. And I was the only gay person in the house at the time. But at the time, it was all straight guys in me. And we were all young. We were all like, most of us were single. So like, you know, bringing people over was in the big deal. There was a lot of coming and going. So one night I was on the orange app, perusing, browsing like Windows, and I get a message from a Facebook profile. And he sent me a picture. He was hot my age. He was in the same year as me. We got to talking. He was pretty direct with me. Like, hey, I'm straight, but I always wanted to fuck around with the guy. What do you think? And at the time it was a fantasy of mine. So I was like, okay, this fell into my lap. Let's do it. So he was like, okay, my roommates are home, so I can't have you over. And I was like, that's cool. You can come through my place. And he's like, do you have roommates? And I'm like, yeah, but you know, my roommates are cool. Like none of them, you know, if they all, they wouldn't even matter. And I like, this happened before. Don't worry about it. So he's like hesitant, but he's like, okay, let me come through. So he, you know, he comes over. I go to the door to greet him. Two of my roommates are, were two of the guys that I live with. They are French on high school. So they went to the same high school. They were from the same town. This guy opened the door for him and they were both in the living room. And they're like, hey, man, like, what are you doing here? And this man, this guy just panics. Like I could see the like panic on his face. I'm sure he was like nervous, whatever. And then to, you know, be recognized after I told him it was like safe to come through. Yeah. So immediately, you know, I cover him because I'm a nice person and a people pleaser. And I'm like, oh yeah, hey, we met in class. He came over, you know, just to like smoke and like, you know, hang out. And then anything other thing, like, oh shit, like cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's our smoke. You want to smoke? So we all like, you know, go burn one down and we're hanging out. They're catching up. Like, oh, how's this person has that person? You know, you still talk to this person. Oh, shit. Okay, go, go. Like an hour of this. And he keeps shooting at glances. Like he's like nervous. And he's like, you know, it's like funny. We're both like, you know, shooting these glances at each other. Like, haha, you know, like the irony, whatever, whatever. And I feel like an hour of my remains were like, all right, we gotta go. So then they just leave us. And, you know, you can like feel the tension melt off the sky. Like he was just so tense through this whole inner abs. Oh shit. Yeah. You can feel the tension just melt off this dude. Like he was so tense through this whole smoke sash. And then they left and we hooked up. And it was fine. Anybody who's fooled around with deal, and you know, that they kind of expect the world and don't want to do much to get there. So I immediately found that this fantasy did not live up to the hype for me. We ended up hooking up one more time. And he kicked me out in the middle of a snowstorm and made me drive home. So needless to say, after that, I didn't speak to him. But yeah, not really a crazy story, but I thought it was funny. The moral of the story is just be true to yourself. Like don't fucking lie. Like, I don't know. Just yeah. OK.

 Hi there. For those of you who are not the guy that made the video that I just stitched, go ahead and go back and watch his video because I think it's important for context. But for the guy who made the video, hi, I'm a queer man and I think there is some really unique insights that I'm not able to give you that we can help share and maybe like learn together because I think that your video has a lot of valid points and I think that it can like really help foster some empathy. So the first thing I want to talk about is that you talk about how your friends and your family do not have or bear any responsibility for the way that they view you and while that might be accurate to a degree because as you acknowledge, society does this thing, it is also on them to see you for who you are. That is valid and I found myself vibing with a lot of what you're saying just in terms of my own experience of coming out as queer and about how I have to mask in certain settings, I can't just automatically be who I am everywhere and I think that because you at least present to be a cisgendered straight man and I could be wrong on that so please feel free to correct me but because that is my impression of you and because your world experience seems to indicate that it seems to me that what you're not getting is that you are have not been used to having to face this. You haven't had to really question this before but I've had to deal with it in my coming out and even in my day-to-day life, like we as queer people, a lot of times we have to be a certain way in certain settings. We are not allowed to just be who we are. Even when it comes to pride, we're expected to be polite or respectful or out of the way and we're expected to not really push boundaries or things like that. That's a societal thing and it puts us in a box and it feels exactly the way you're talking about and it sucks and at least from my experience because I'm only speaking from my experience that's how it is for me and like it is so hard, it is so hard and a lot of times it is the cisgendered straight people who have the hardest time getting it but then here you're saying a lot of these things and I think that that is what is what is a cognitive dissonance for you. I think that you're dealing with an experience that your life hasn't had you face really but I think that this experience is probably also a lot more common among people than we give others credit for and I think it's important that we have these conversations that we're open and honest about it and together we can foster empathy and we can learn to be better together. So like when it comes to any feminine thing, feminine quote unquote, right? Like I like to paint my nails but I have straight friends who like to paint their nails. I know people who like to do that. I know straight men who wear makeup even though I like to wear makeup I'm the one that gets criticized for it, right? Even if you can't tell that I'm doing it and it's just one of those things that it's society man, it's society and that's why you hear people in certain communities always talking about we need to question these things in society. That's why we need to try to work to basically deconstruct all these things that we have been told because it's hard, life is hard and everyone is just looking for love. Everyone is just looking for support. Everyone is just looking for a little bit of dignity. That's the way life is and unfortunately there are some of us who have to face this more often. Like I said, I would question your constant excusing of your loved ones not acknowledging this for you because that's something that we as queer people have to face pretty early on too, is that there is a degree of responsibility on our loved ones to be accepting of what we're going through and to acknowledge us. That is just a baseline for respect and love and if those people are constantly making their making your problems about themselves then that's a problem with them and I would question if that's a healthy relationship and if you maybe don't need to work on that or even maybe question how much you should invest in those relationships. For me when I came out my parents said we love you but we don't love your partner and we don't love what you do and blah blah blah right? They were being kind of horrible because what they really were telling me is they love an idea of me and when that idea of me does not match Lord if you hear that that's the squirrels fighting in front of me they're like right in front of me because the animals where I am are kind of tame but uh sorry about that uh lizard brain um but like my parents were telling me they love an idea of me they weren't telling me they love me even though that's what their words were saying that's not what they were actually saying they love an idea of me and they were not willing to do the work and so I had to more or less cut them down significantly as far as how much I interact with them um and you may choose differently for yourself but just wanted to offer some insights and maybe help a little bit because I know that it's hard what you're going through and I think that your specific experience offers a really unique opportunity to foster empathy and growth and maybe you can use your experience to compare with others and share with others who don't have the reach that someone like me or anyone else would have like you know together we can help each other be better and maybe make the world a little bit of a better place so uh peace love remember everyone deserves love respect and dignity everyone thank you for listening sorry for the length of the video and I hope this helps

 Okay, first off, JD, thank you for ringing this to my attention, and I absolutely love your content man. Keep it up. Secondly, JD, honestly, fuck no. No, we would never accept them. I personally would never accept them. I can't say the same, and for everybody, but I know the fucking overwhelming majority of people would not accept those things. And it's part of the LGBTQIA+. Yes, our message says all are welcome and to accept all as they are, but even we have fucking limits. Like, if somebody's transitioning, go for it. Tell us your pronouns. We'll respect them. Well, be whatever you want us to be. But if someone says to us, oh, hi, I'm a map. We're going to fucking turn you inside out. Pedophiles are nuts. Fucking people. They are things, and they don't even deserve to exist. Now, I know that's saying a lot. But you know what? It's true. What part of being a pedophile is a good thing. Answer me that. Seriously, in the comments, tell me what's good about being one. Oh, yeah. Fuckin' nothing. So, yeah, in summary, nope. We don't accept them, and we will never accept them. And if you have any problem with this video, have a day to deserve. Bye now.

 First off, you cannot speak for everyone else. No, I'm not black. I am indigenous American. Maybe you understand it. I'm Native American. You know what that is? Okay, okay. I live in Richmond, Virginia. I was born in Riker County and lived out in the county my entire life. You talking about the 90s, you never seen that, that clansmen in 2019. And I'm going to show you in the Richmond Times dispatch. It's in our newspaper. The clansmen. I saw them with my own two eyes. Yeah, I still have vision both eyes then. Or outside of our courthouse where I happen to be going to court for a speeding ticket. And then have the balls to go to court in in Riker County. Whereas a little bit more mixed, a little bit more mixing pot of the rainbow. They didn't in Hanover, which is predominantly thought to be clans people. The judges look like clansmen, but they're not. But just let me show you a little something. Just you need to open your mind and fuck Trump. That's the other thing. Fuck Trump period. Before he was president, I hated him. He came president, I hated him. And he out here fucking kids and shit. I still hate him. There's no reason to like him for anyone. You need to go back to his country and get out of mind and get off my land. But let's get back to the point of the clansmen. Since you love them so very much. Number one. Wait, let me take the flash off so you can. There you go. Right here. July 8th, 2019. And it was more than a dozen people. And I actually ended up occurring at about 60 people total. And this was during the week, not just on that Saturday. This was that entire week. Hold on. And this is when it came to my school. Just think. My baby sister was still in school in 2019. Right there. I told you where I grew up in Raco County. This is what they did. There they go again. This is the day before. The situation I already spoke about. And this is just one month later. Luckily school was out in Virginia. So you tell me. You never seen a clan, do you ever think about that? Maybe you are one. I'm not saying that you are not accusing you of anything. Except for stupidity and ignorance. No, I'll take back stupidity. I'll take that back. Well, unless I have something to do with Trump, stupid to follow. Anyway, like a sheep. Anyway, period. But ignorance is bliss. This is 2019. I'm only seven months out of being a Gen Xer. I was born in July of 1981. I don't consider myself a millennial. I still consider myself a Gen Xer. Because I don't fit in with these millennials. This happened at my time. Not only that. Literally I witnessed a cross burning. When I was six years old. Right outside my grandmother's house. Who was 99% in Indigenous American? Am I grandpa there? Half white? And half indiginess in American. You tell me. Make it make sense. You can't. So good luck with that Trump rally training. You want people to hop on. How did they that you deserve? Let me just send a little world class back in 13. And a little bit more of this. So I know you don't know what a oh-ho is and what it's for. Good luck.

I don't know, but I'm gonna rest up today. I'm gonna try to counter it with some monster truck rallies. Maybe some mismatched ill-fitting clothing from Walmart. No hair product. Maybe bring some beers. No, not Bud Light. I know better than that. But we'll see if I can straighten up by tomorrow. In the meantime, just tell Dick for me, all right? Dick.

It wasn't so much about access to abortion rights as it was to patient privacy. I know that it does affect abortion rights, but it's more some for patient privacy. I came out of trans in 2021, changed over my documentation in non-binary in 2022. The anti-translage's legislation came out in 2023 and in 2024 we have stuff like this. I already know I was on somebody's roster, but... Yeah, they're trying to come for us. Don't let them.

 Thank you so much for asking this genuine question and for looking for solutions because this is a very important topic and there have been some really horrible laws passed especially here where I live in Utah. Now I'm not transgender but I know a lot of transgender individuals including some family members and so the people in my family that are transgender are assigned female at birth A-fab and so now they look like the first picture you show the man they sound like a man they look like a man and they are a man and so really it is like if you have to go and explain oh that's actually a girl that is really hurtful and offensive to the person because their whole life they have been battling body dysmorphia and it does not feel right for them to be a girl or a boy you know however they were assigned at birth and if they have finally got up the courage to transition whether medically or not and they are presenting as a female or a male we need to respect them and their pronouns and their names and honestly honestly they just have to go to the bathroom and I kind of like your solution will work for sure I like I think we should have all gender restrooms or individual restrooms and if you are really concerned about your children being hurt in a public restroom go with them go with them into the restroom you know because that's the only way you can protect them but honestly I like I said I know a lot of transgender people and they are very mild loving kind individuals because they have been bullied and hurt their whole lives and they do not want to do that to people they want equality they want they just want to go pee in peace and where they feel comfortable and actually like I would feel more comfortable in one stall bathroom because I don't like to poop and have people here at right so I like your solution but just yeah I mean maybe teach your children about different kinds of people because there aren't only two genders there's actually a lot of intersex people people born with both and many many different ways that it presents and sometimes these kids were not told that they were intersex and then they grow up and they're like why do I feel like a boy and they're like oh yeah when you were born you had whatever you know and it's like yeah so the medical professionals have been unethical and I'm going off on attention now so bathrooms I like your idea but also education educate yourself I love the genuine question and the love that you presented in it in mostly you know so yeah just maybe think about teaching your child that you know people there's there's gay people and there's transgender people and there's you know whenever she's ready for those topics you know so yeah just thanks again

 So go back and watch that creators take. I don't think that he's wrong at all. I'm not taking anything away from him. But I definitely think he left a little nuance out of the conversation and almost made it seem as if or someone could take it as if gave people trip. So absolutely agree with this creator when he says that he does not want to be in spaces where no, he is not welcome. So if you don't play that gay stuff, whatever, just stay away from him. And we're out to be told that up front so that he can make that distance happen. And in that fact, I absolutely agree. Nine times out of ten never catching me in a straight club. It's just not where I want to be. I don't always necessarily even feel safe. In his corny, he got bored. But even outside of that, the experience that I have and when I've seen gay men or gay people going to a uproar about someone in the term, I don't do that gay shit or something like that. It's usually the time when gay stuff is not even going on. For example, if I walk in a chipotle and today my switch got a little extra switch to it and all of a sudden you've decided you're so uncomfortable. If you need to say something to me, that's your problem, not mine. Because I didn't intrude your space. I did not bring anything to you. Or even if I'm in the grocery store with my partner and we're just grocery shopping, I didn't do anything to you. You don't get to determine around you in public spaces. You don't get to determine what you're going to deal with or what, what, get a shit around you. When you're in public, you don't get that. So you need to learn how to just be a human mind, your business, and keep it walking. And usually people that feel that way look like boogers are smell like dudoo.

 Aww, we're gonna begin with this fucking kid. Alright, first of all, since you've probably never encountered a fucking trans person without running away, clutching your fucking pearls, let's make a few fucking things clear. Nowhere, ever are they mutilating children. There is nobody that is doing sex change surgery on children at least in the United States. Now, the only caveat to that would be maybe if the child was born intersects. At birth, maybe then they might. But nobody is advocating for fucking children to have their weiners chopped off, okay? That's not even a fucking thing, which is why laws like this are bigoted, okay? Because what they're doing is they're hitting the hot points for people like you, they're fucking crazy and the people that aren't educated that go, oh yeah, I don't want them chopping off my kids' weiner. They're not doing that. And then what they slip in behind that is they deny gender affirming care. They deny access to hormones and then they go so far as to make these teachers report to the parents about pronoun usage. Do you know how fucked that is? Do you know what a recipe I put before abuse? That is how many toxic fucking parents are out there that abuse their kids, shame their kids, God knows what else and now if the child chooses to try to be themselves at school, you're going to have them be reported. You know how fucked that is? The teachers are supposed to be neutral and if anything, teachers are supposed to protect the kids from abuse at home. That's why they're a mandatory reporter. So no, we shouldn't be encouraging them to go, well, you know, your son or your daughter, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. Look, if you want to advocate, which I think is already a thing, but if you want to advocate for people or people who want to transition to go through a psychiatric evaluation to help them, great, I'm all for it. But this logic of banning it and making them suffer potentially and be humiliated or God forbid self harm because they're forced to live a life because you're not okay with it is not. Okay. And by the way, to clear up a few things that you so lovingly misrepresent, nobody's going on hormones until they're at least in fucking high school. And even then to my knowledge, they have to go through some kind of psychiatric and medical evaluation to do so because somebody has to prescribe them. They're not just going down to the Walgreens, picking up testosterone. Okay. Seriously. Like there's protections for that. This law is nothing but a reason to be bigoted and humiliating and to take away more kids' rights and to put more of them in a position to be abused by parents who probably shouldn't be parents in the first place. I would go a step further that parents should be looked into if they're denying their child these things. Go about it safely. If you want to protect the kids and if it was about protecting the kids, then make it a medical decision, make it a psychiatric decision. Have them go through counseling, certified counseling, not conversion therapy. I know where your fucking brain's going. Do it that way because if you really care about the kids, that's what you would do. But you don't care about the kids. You care about stopping people from being trans. That's really what these laws boil down to. Okay. So just stop. Stop misrepresenting it. Stop fucking lying and stop trying to use care tactics and let these people be the people they wish to be. Just because they're allowed to do it doesn't mean you have to do it. And just because you want to thunk that Bible doesn't mean that everybody else has to believe you are bullshit.

Why did it get flagged with that thing of, this video appropriate for people that are under 18? I am in your walls, TikTok. Because it's getting ridiculous. Like people mentioned their queer and all of a sudden the content is getting flagged. Like I am, like this one actually pissed me off because cowboy gen is like a light in the lesbian community.

 Oh my god, I got a story time. Okay, so I was in this relationship with this guy named Robbie. So me and Robbie, we were on an offer like 70 years and like y'all, I have never been in this happy with another human being that I was with him. It was like, he was a huge nerd, my type, and also he was a Libra, so the chemistry was most definitely there on that scale. And like, yeah, we just did everything together. And one night, it was a Friday. All of that work and normally our Friday will be our early day. So we were just texting none stop like making plans. So we ended up going to this restaurant and the food was delicious. Like we never been there, but the food was bomb. So we ended up making our way back to my place. We were chilling outside my complex and I just looked at him and I was like, hey, we been together for so long. It was like, I feel like we should make the next step. And he looked at me and was like, what are you talking about? And he was like, well, I was thinking maybe you can move in with me. So we can do this. And at first, he was a little skeptical about it because you know, he didn't want to leave his family. But from what he was telling me that like his family life back at home was in all that gray, like it was just bad. And he didn't just didn't want to leave that. And I'm like, well, for what you were telling me, you're like, dude, you're your step dad's a piece of shit. Like you don't, you can't really do too much because they always like, gaff let you. And it was like, why not just live here so you can get away from all that. Like so you can be in the quiet place. And he told me, well, you know what you do got a point. So I'll tell you what, I'm going to give me two weeks and I'm going to give you my decision in two weeks. And I even went to extra mile. I gave him a month. And like I didn't say nothing to him. I just gave him a month. And the two weeks period passed, but of course, again, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to pay a pressure him. But when that month mark hit, he was over at my house. We were watching a movie. And I just talked to him. I'm like, hey, so you know, the two weeks mark has been passed. I didn't gave you a month. He was like, what? You gave me a month. I didn't notice on my head. I gave you a month. So I just told him like, so what's your decision? He was like, after like literally thinking about it, he said, OK, let's do it. It was like, are you serious? Like, yeah, I would love to live with you. I'm like, oh my god. And of course, you know, we did. But yeah, I was so excited. And y'all, that whole weekend, I was redecorating my house because he was going to bring his stuff in. And my game room, it was going to be his side. And of course, my side was going to be the same. Like y'all, I was so excited. And hell, and the one thing about it is he told me what about his dog because he didn't want to break his dog like y'all, I love his little, little choo. I was like, I even went to extra mile. I was going to do, I was going to pay a $500 deposit so I can do the pet deposit. It's just so he can bring his dog in like y'all, I was that committed. And one day I would never ever fucking forget. So this was a Wednesday and he was going to bring his stuff Thursday. So I just got back from break and he told me to call him. So I ended up calling him and I was like, I haven't heard from you in the couple of the, oh yeah, that's right guys. I haven't heard anything from this man in a couple of days. So I was like, so is everything okay? Like what's going on? Y'all, this man sat up here on this phone on a Wednesday and told me, look, you're a tremendous person, but I don't think I'm ready to be in a relationship. So for that being, I'm not going to move in with you and also I'm breaking up with you. Yeah. Y'all, I stopped mid track into what I was doing. Like y'all, I had a whole meltdown. I broke down in tears. I was crying. And like my manager at the time, she was so super cool about the whole ordeal. She asked me, hey, do you want to go home? And I was like, no, because we're almost out and plus I just want to, you know, get my money. But when I left, I went to the store. I bought a pint of Blue Bell's men chocolate chip ice cream and a bucks and mac and cheese. And I went home and that's when I saw the arrangement that I did to my house. That's where I just busted out in tears and like, y'all, I literally cried myself to sleep that night. And it didn't even help that when I went into the game room. Y'all, I fucking lost it. So yeah. So yeah, talk about trauma, right? Okay. But yeah.

 Iq tests were created by white scientists using white participants, and as a result the tests are designed for white people who do this proportionally better on them than people of color. Unrelatedly white people are more likely to be queered due to a plethora of social factors, including a decrease in religiosity in the modern era.

 This um creator makes really good points in their video and you should go watch it. It really reminds me of A time with me and my girlfriend where she basically stood up for me in this way and we weren't even together at this point We were just like seeing each other but we're out in club It was a gay club, but it was not Well keep on by the gays. Um, it's kind of a scary place to be honest with you And I went into the bathroom and someone was like your a man get out of here And this was before I'd even like considered my gender as anything other than just being a woman And just a masculine woman and I was like about taking a bat because it was kind of one of the first experiences I had of people being that aggressive to me in public spaces and because it was a gay club part me was like the yada Say so I was like Sorry, what did you just say to me? No, I've I never thrown a punch. I'm me so real. I've never thrown a punch But I like squared up and I was like what did you just say to me and she was like your a man get out the bathroom And then she pushed me like on my chest and as someone who begs and is very uncomfortable with my chest didn't appreciate that touching Um, and she just like shoved me back now. She was only like Like she was like tiny she's like five foot four or something So I was a lot taller than her And I just knew from the perspective of others if I start getting like physical with her back Not that I was like obviously gonna like start beating her up or anything But if I start pushing her back I'm gonna be seen as the aggressive one because I'm taller bigger and apparently manlier So I ended up just walking away from the situation because I didn't only get involved. I was really upset. I was really like Shocked because I don't like to feel like pressure But it's definitely like a thing for me being a lesbian. I'm sure a lot of you guys can relate like when you're younger It's not good feeling and it definitely triggered that in me So I went find my girlfriend and told her what happened and she was like no fucking way like that's not acceptable So not only did she then take me to the bathroom so I could actually go to a toilet because I still needed an handgun To make sure that I was safe. She then later in the smoking area Seen the ghetto. I was like that's who it was my girlfriend was busy doing something else the girl came over to me and basically like Not quite apologize, but she was like definitely her job is so I'm gonna if you get what I'm saying And she was kind of like saying to me let she didn't really mean it like that But also she did and she was kind of just like not really sure what she was saying So once I point out to my girlfriend my girlfriend just alarms up to this bitch and goes Come on apologize to my girlfriend right now. We weren't even girlfriends my girlfriend's just like this is for a girlfriend's now For the story and she made the girl come up and apologize to me and the girl was like I've already apologized and my girlfriend was like do it again And she apologized again to me And I think at that moment I was like I'm a white this went up because wow But I think it's a good reminder that if you are someone that's gender conforming and you're in a relationship with someone who's gender Unconforming it is kind of part of your duty as Being a queer person slash being an ally depending on your situation to Be there to support people who don't have The privilege of being able to walk around on the tights If we're looking back on the history of like the words fam butch and those identities like that's what being a fam What it's a fam was a bitch defender like someone who stood up for Baches when they needed it and then it kind of work both ways But like that is the historical context of where we're coming from so if you're if you couldn't consider yourself a fam And you like don't protect bitches mass studs in your life then like you should maybe think of it different for yourself

 The less inability to understand and combat ableism has gotten in the way of achieving its own policy goals. Tens of millions of Americans have lost access to their Medicaid under Biden. It's the largest mass unenrollment for Medicaid in history, and the people who are advocating for Medicare for all just four years ago have largely been silent about it. In March and April of 2020, there were massive expansions to social programs in welfare in order to fight the virus. All of it has been removed under the Biden administration, like all of it. If you go back and chart the past four years of Biden in office, they removed the ability to measure the impact the virus was having. They made it harder to count cases. They made it harder to count fatalities. They made it harder to count hospitalizations. And the money has correctly pointed out that part of the reason why society at large in the Biden administration specifically has prematurely declared the pandemic to be over is because the pharmaceutical companies want to extract profit from people who are being disabled by COVID and people who are just disabled in general. But another reason why they did it was they wanted to roll back all of the welfare and social programs that they expanded. They wanted you paying rent again. They wanted to cut snap benefits. They wanted to kick people off of Medicaid. We had Medicare for all. We had it. We had it for COVID. Health care for COVID infections was free for uninsured people. The hospitals, the health crisis, and they were reimbursed at Medicare rates. We had Medicare for all for this specific health crisis in like a bubble. That was the perfect opportunity for the left to show how effective Medicare for all is and why it should be applied to everything. But they didn't do that because leftists are really bad at understanding disability and public health.

 I actually think it is super important that the message of I saw the TV logo just goes over the heads of some of the cis people because it is not exploitative. The movie is not like, here is this trans person. Let's all feel bad for this trans person. This movie is not invite cis people to pity a trans person for 90 minutes. This movie points at the cis audience and says you either understand what this person is going through or you think they are mentally ill. So many trans movies are like this person is so haunted and they are so brave for being themselves. And they are so hated by society and they are so misunderstood. And I saw the TV logo and it's like no, this person is not brave. This person is suffering. This person is dying and nobody cares and they know it. They know that that is going on but they do not care. They are looking the other way. In the movie, the Justice Smith character is like, if I don't think about it, it's not real and it didn't happen. Which reminds me of a lot of things that are going on right now. But I think that that's also like how cis people view trans people. Especially because trans people as a group have become like a tool for cis people and for like the cis political spectrum. This is a kind of gano-imperer. Do you remember right after October 7th of a bunch of people? Like what you can't, you have to vote for Joe Biden. You have to vote for Joe Biden because of trans people. And that was always something that made me like deeply uncomfortable. My suffering is not a tool for you to use to prompt up like a genocinal president. This is not something that you fix by voting for the right person. This is only something that you can fix by paying attention, by actually seeing people. And that's like what's part of what's so powerful about the movie is that it's like, it's not just that you need to give people access to these things. It's that you need to like let people feel free to use them. None of that matters if people are still forced into the closet, if still people don't feel free to be themselves. The problem is not just the government, it's not just Republicans, the problem is cis people. It is you not paying attention, not caring, not seeing people.

 So you also have to say that we doesn't know where the word says says even comes from. And if you go to the comments, you also see people are asking what does says even means, this gender, and he can't even tell them what it means. So you might be asking us at this point, why is this meant to suck a nug of the Google app? I'm asking myself the same question. Because Google would have to let him know that people have to, I don't know what it is about people, especially the ones with first let me say, it is always the ones with the whole, I'm going to speak this truth and keep it not going like it. Because let's begin the truth, bitches who swear that you in it when they say this shit, who really don't do the simplest of research. Because a simple Google search will let you know while you're thinking that the idea of sis is some new thing that just dropped like two years ago. Back since 1914, there are records of the idea of using the term sis and trans to describe the gender binary all the way back then. Sis and sis associated with trans is not a new thing. It is not a new thing at all. Google would have told you that. Like these are simple definitions. Sis gender, the concept of a sister is not new. It is not new in any way, shape or form. The sister gender got coined in the 90s. So it is definitely not a new thing. It's been around. It's been around. But you have people who were rather than sitting on random dude on his porch, stealing, whatever the fuck he's saying, the same rhetoric or idea that they have that is based on nothing but their feelings and their own transphobia. Instead of the scientists who are studying this stuff for years and can tell you and bring it down to you and tell you what the actual truth is because they don't want to hear that truth. They rather hear this truth, which is based on feelings, ignorance, feeling like you've seen something deep or feeling like you just keep it just going to finish. But let's just do better. Let's do better. Or just do whatever you want. I'm just I'm just on TikTok.

 First things first, I have nothing against the LGBT, elemental piece, down at home with some of you. But any who, an arm a little late to this, obviously just happened in April, well the last fight that he had happened in April, and the biggest hype or the most that people were talking about is that fight where he got knocked out in 21 seconds. I was gonna give a little bit more credit because I'm like, then why don't you talk about your record beforehand? Because dude was undefeated. So I get to look in a little bit, get digging, going by little research, you know what I think? Yeah, I did my little research, whatever. And the people that he was boxing really weren't, what nobody, it wasn't about. One of the fights, I don't want to guys said it in the video to he looked like one of them, like them people being the Asian market. You know what I'm saying? One of them old Asian people that worked there. Like, he looked just like that. Like if you see the video, you know what I'm talking about. The ain't trying to be racist, I ain't trying to hear it. I love my china, my china, and folk to my Japanese folk to me, and my film, and my film, and my film, and even, you know what I'm saying? But anywho, I don't like the fact that they keep trying to push this agenda with getting transgender people to fight in sports, that they should, because it's a goddess like that, that change the transition from male into female. And he's an MMA, the, you know what, these women, man, that's not fair. That's a threat. And Manuel, in his video talking about, you know, me speaking up for transgender people and saying that, you know, we're threatened to, the sports or whatever sport you wanna put. No, Manuel, you ain't a threat, but that man in MMA, you know, for sure, he's a threat. I should put a clip in here. He, he took one swing at the girl, whole head went back. And then afterwards, she had to look at the ref like, like, is this supposed to happen? Like, you signed up for this. This is, this is, well, at least the transgender woman, that's what she signed up for. Anybody to stop trying to do this shit. This is the reason why things are separated the way they are. And I'm not just talking about gender, talking about in the sport too. You don't see light weights, fighting heavy weights, or heavy weights, dropping weight to come down all the way to lightweight. No. Now you may see like a, what is it like a welter weight going up to a lightweight or a middleweight maybe going to a heavyweight or a lightweight or something like that. But that's not to like the space between that, not to. So why in the hell? Excuse my language, but why do y'all feel the need to be in everything? Like nobody is out here saying that women can do stuff. Correction. Not saying that women can't do what men do. Like it's 2024. At this point, the only people that saying stuff like that are y'all, like because there's nobody in their right mind would say a woman can't beat up a man. And I guess impossible. No, it's very possible. Very possible. Shoot, I've seen it in school, man. I've seen girls beat up dudes in school, talking about middle school. I've seen the girl beat up a guy in high school. See, I've seen a gay dude beat up a straight guy. And that was unheard of too. Y'all mean, and those day and time, where we would really think in our head like, oh, he's gay. So there's no way he got hands. But little do you know, he still got hands. But the whole moral story is to this, as I ain't trying to make this too long anyway. But it just baffling to me. Like it was like why, why, why? Again, and this time it's a woman transition to a man and then in boxing, this stop. Or like, or not even really stop. But like I said, this is why things are separate. Why not instead of y'all fighting for people rights or whatever, how about y'all make your own league where you could fight against the people that are in your category of whatever strength it is. Because nobody that is straight or whatever would not think nobody's thinking like that. Like if I want a box, I'm a box, but I'm not gonna say, oh, I wanna fight Floyd Mayweather. Why? And why would Floyd Mayweather wanna fight me either? Like, I don't even know, we might be in the same class. But I'm just saying like, no, bro, like, no. It's like they just keep pushing this issue. Like, and it's not even an issue. Y'all making it an issue. Like I wish I would, I wish, and I say y'all because when stuff like this happens, you can easily go into the comments and see all of the whole community on their side. You know what I'm saying? Which makes sense. But what don't make sense is y'all keep pushing this thing, this narrative that we think as straight and I forget the new word that I learned as CS something. I don't know, there's so many different terms now. But ain't nobody worried about that, man. At least me, at least people like me, me and no. Not gonna sit here and judge you because you're a woman and feel like because you're a woman, you can't do what I do. What time do y'all think we live in nowadays? Like it's just not making sense anymore. It's not making sense. Like at this point, y'all are just nitpicking. Say what you want, but this is what is coming off and it's like, like, why y'all? And it's crazy, like you can't even find a video of a manual getting knocked out in them 21 seconds. It's like they pushing a narrative but soon as somebody get hurt or the real comes out, they wanna hide it. Or, or, like I said, the community was, I'd seen them up and down all kinds of comments. Wait, y'all that now, man. And I'm not saying this because I'm wishing no bad on this on manual. I kind of, I mean, have a little bit of faith, you know what I'm saying? But at the same time, no. Cause at the end of the day, if you believe it or not, what manual was born is, it's still there. It ain't enough test, test the wrong pills. It ain't enough surgery. And that's for man and female. It ain't enough medication in the world for a man to transition over to a woman. And they have a period and all of that stuff. Be able to conceive and create life. It's just certain things that we just can't do. Biologically, it's just, it's just can't. It just can't. It's no argument there. It's all right. And that's another thing I'm not getting them. Don't think I'd take steroids, in test, test the wrong. Now, test test the wrong that I ain't gonna say too much about, I'm not sure. But steroids for sure, I knew no regular box that can come in there with steroids in their system. So why is it allowed for them to, you know what I'm done? I'm done. Because none of it makes sense. But like I said, you can find people rooting this one until you'll get hurt, of course. But hey, I'm just a regular guy here, you know? I don't have nothing to do with this, you know? Sank the heart of your involved myself and just joking. But still, man, I really don't like this. I don't like this one either. On the transgender male or the transgender female. Y'all really should fight to make something for y'all and stop trying to hurt y'all selves, to prove a point that only y'all really care about. And if it is, which I can believe, there are assholes out here. There are people who just don't care and who are mean or whatever. But I wish we weren't all categorized under that umbrella. And for records sake, I have a gay best friend, Mel, and a transgender best friend, who is transitioned from female to male. And I just, I don't see neither one of them overdoing what they do. They're just them and people accept them for who they are. And I love them dearly, both of them. And respectfully call them by whatever title they go by. But I've really wished y'all stop putting y'all themselves in harm's way for both genders. Peace.

 You know, I'm gonna make a video in English for people to understand, but this person may basically make a video with a comment and says, like, oh, why not dank to a video that they made earlier, saying like, oh, these are the political parties in the Netherlands, and I think you can vote for that are pro-human rights. And then this person rightfully mentioned that dank does not really come up for human rights because they have spread homophobic and transphobic rhetoric. And I wanted to say that I'm so tired with my country and how backwards my country is getting, especially with the conservative coalition. I am so tired, and I'm so tired of people defending these coalition saying like, but they have propels that and they're pro-u-crain. So we're gonna vote for them. You claim to care about human rights, but you don't really care about the human rights of people that will also need it. Like, I am 100% sure as a gay and trans, trans, Dutch person that I'm going to be legislated against, especially for me being trans, which already almost happened. We are not ready to talk about that. No, I'm not ready to talk about that. Like, because we do not pit y'all's conservative agenda. Y'all claim to be progressive, but then don't support actually old people that actually need support. That's not progressive. You're still conservative darling. You're still conservative darling. Oh, and also saying that you're anti LGBTQ and pro-Palestine, please remember that there is L-L-G-B-T-Q people in Palestine too.

 I'm not gonna go into the nitty-gritty details of how black women are rightfully upset about you, based on your entire personality, out of a character of a black woman. A lot of black women have been talking about and they are the ones that you should listen to when it comes to that conversation, but even I am going to say as a white person, stop being fucking racist. You make our community look like fucking clowns. With that being said, I'm gonna go to the next point. You do realize that first of all, if trans rights are gonna be stripped away, your rights are gonna be next. The conservatives all around the world are using the same tactics that they used against gay people, way back, dehumanizing, demonizing, and all that kind of stuff. And also, the real people you should be scared of, touching your little nieces, little nieces and nephews, are youth pastors, cisgender men. And sure, if there's female predators too, but cis people are responsible for most sexual related crimes. And it's a good Google search. Like, yes, I'm not denying that trans people can't commit crimes, but that does not give you the fucking right to demonize us. Like, I'm not even a trans woman. I will with my whole heart of fucking soul stand with my trans men, women, non-binary people, everyone. The OC trans people, Black Park trans people, everyone. I'm just so fucking mad that the call has to come from inside of the house, but yeah, here we are. And also, I'm not gonna talk about how you tell white people who are rightfully also uncomfortable by you basing your caricature off of a black woman, how you tell them to shut up when you're not even black yourself. You're not even black yourself. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit. You're just mad that you're being called out on your bullshit.

 Oh my gosh. Wow. Well, first of all, I'm actually really glad this creator is saying this a little harsh, but there's such a myth as a couple specialists. I hear so often people comparing which attachment style is worse and which automatically highlights theirs as better or more secure. And in reality, we're all difficult. We all have shit. We're all bringing it into the relationship and what you do in that place in that position when you're highlighting your partners, struggles insecurities, burdens they bring into it when you're highlighting it. You're actually putting each other at odds and from this place, you will be enemies. You'll go to war because we have to know how to reach our partner in a way that brings them relief. So because we're not born anxious or avoidant because attachments, dolls are not personalities, we can actually help our partner move towards security by offering them relief in the moment that they're being activated and we do it for each other. This is a couples problem. So if you're one of those people who are like, Hey, you are so avoided. I can't be with avoidance. I can't be with anxious people. Just know you're difficult to.

 Alright, a horror movie character that I think deserved better. I'm going to say David from Bride of Chuckie. David's an interesting character that nobody really talks about. He was not a major character, but I really liked his inclusion in Bride of Chuckie. In the 90s, you really didn't see openly gay characters that weren't just, you know, a punchline or tragic or whatever. David was an interesting character when you really think about it, because he was the best friend to both the main, well, main besides Chuckie and Tiffany, of course. The main characters, and he was not treated as a joke. They didn't crack any day jokes about him. They teased him a bit with him sucking up to John Ritter's character. But other than that, he was treated just, you know, as a good friend. He was the one they called when they were in trouble. He was the one they both confided in. And he was the one that came to them and told them, I don't think either of you are guilty of this. And then he gets killed off as soon as he sees something wrong. I think David deserved better. I really, really do.

 Hey all, that's my book that Elizabeth is talking about. We're trying really hard right now to get 100 pre-orders for hard copies and paperbacks before the release date on June 21st. This really helps with publishing costs which helps out both me and the indie publisher Midnight Matter. All pre-orders come with a bookmark. They come with a sign book plate, stickers, character cards, a whole bunch of goodies along with a really good book. You can pre-order from the Midnight Matter Publishing website or if you're not a place where you can buy books right now, a like, a comment, or a reblog really helps us reach our goal. Thank you so much.

 Alright, first thing first your hat's acting Christianity tittug That's crazy. I don't claim to be a Christian. I'm not really a more of a not sick leaning person I do pray from time to time however though I think you using Christianity tittug to be a hate-win individual That's crazy because God definitely know like ugly first thing first another thing that I think is crazy that a sign saying a welcome all people depending on their races to gender Their age who they pray to doesn't really matter They just hear to make sure that you're pets. Okay, because that's the idea of a vet They don't care about the owner. They do care about the owner But but first they don't really care about the owner. They're more so care about the well-being of the animal which most likely that's what you care about if you're gonna go to the vet and make sure that you're fur babies, okay? Well, I got to say is this though it is crazy that someone is this that mad of basically being like hey, man Anybody who's anybody we cool here. We just gonna take in money and that's a bottom line of any business

 You don't need to understand, Jack, you'll least go out to not be a bigot. All you have to do is close your mouth, right? Open your heart and have a tad bit of empathy. If somebody says address me as he and pronouns, but I don't identify as a man, you don't need to understand that. Cause it's not your business at the end of the day. All you need to do is go, hmm? Okay, he and pronouns, God, just think of it, but thank you. And you move on about your day. I am sick inside of the y'all getting on Beyonce and then that blue IV's wifi service and creating these elaborate clink pieces that the relations are gender and all these other conversations, girl, just be respectful to your fellow human beings. You don't have to understand it, you don't have to agree with it. And so, you're very honest with you, no one cares. Just close your flaps, stop making it about you and go, okay, that's how you wanna identify who great front lives. I'm gonna be a decent human being and keep it pushing.

 If another bisexual is just being friendly or is genuinely flirting with you?
----------------------------------------

Video: @revchristhemystic_video_7365002539844062507-Scene-002.mp4
 So the way we fixed this in my group of mostly bisexual polyamorous folks was we instituted a flirting fish. The flirting fish was a big stuffed like plush fish that you might get it like Bass Pro Shop and we put on the learning room table and everybody could flirt to their hearts content but if you were flirting with intent you picked up that flirting fish and you gently flapped the person you were interested in to give them a very not so subtle clue that this was flirting with intent and this was actually to be received as intention so that they could understand that this was an actual overture and not just banter.

 So I want to talk about this in terms of disability accessibility because this is something I want people to understand about the differences between the able-bodied people in these communities and the people who are disabled and what we have to consider. And this is no criticism of anybody else who can roll with it. You know, I was in my 20s and I was the type of person who would go out all night partying and still becoming down off of, you know, the sparkle of the evening and end up rolling straight into PT for at 4.30 in the morning for the next day. I was working 60 to 80 hours a week and still finding time to party. Like I understand that life. I'm also disabled and 40 now. I don't have that energy. I don't have that. And it causes a certain level of logistics that a lot of people just don't know about. They just don't understand the cost. And the thing is that it's a cost both of energy and time but also cost literally. So for example, the cost of just getting to a place, energy-wise logistics-wise, you may be able to run into the airport, throw your stuff on the conveyor belt and get through the airport just fine. If you're me, you have to make sure you're there. Make sure you're there early enough that people can convey you there because you can't walk across all the terminals and survive or you're going to punish your body to the point of walking because they aren't actually taking care of the disability services the way they're supposed to and making sure that you can transport any kind of mobility devices with you, which they break far too often. Like these are logistics that are just baseline things of getting access to places. And the fact, look up the number of wheelchairs that get broken by airlines every year. Then you have to get to the venue and you have to have a place in the venue because if you don't get a room in the venue, you're not going to have the energy to get through the entire day. So you have to be able to rest. You can't even just do everything because you don't have the energy too. And those places very rarely consider people in wheelchairs. They very often have tables too close together and lots of people milling about and people who aren't listening, who stand in your way or ableist people who refuse to act like you even exist because you're inconveniencing them by needing to get past them in a wheelchair. There's a lot of really, really absurd shit that happens. And so every single thing, every single thing that happens at this is more energy, more work, more, like, output to try and figure out and logistically handle. You cannot improvise if everybody wants to go out to an after party and go to a, you know, a restaurant is that restaurant accessible? Does it have food that is safe? Is it? There's a whole other level of, of logistics to consider that you just can't improvise the way other people can. And it gets really, really isolating because everyone else just wants to go and they're going to go. And so you end up compromising and just going, yeah, okay, fine. Everyone go have fun. Have fun, right? You don't get to do those things. And then afterwards, you have all of the same logistics to get back and everybody else just drops and runs with it because they don't have to worry about those things. I'm good for them. I don't pregrudge people the fact that they don't have to worry about these things, but it is something that logistically, a lot of us who are disabled can't engage in these things. We can't take an extra week off of work. We can't take an extra week to recover with a flair that's going to happen from all of the travel and all of the stress and all of the overclocking ourselves outside of our tolerances, even if we would love to be there, even if it would be beneficially, professionally to be there. We can't afford it, energy and otherwise. And so this is just something I want to bring attention to. It's something that it means I very often don't have the same kinds of professional vetting that other people do because I can't be in those spaces. I can't afford the amount of over taxing baselines. It takes to even access those spaces. And a lot of people just don't realize that. So I just wanted to talk about it. Thank you for giving me the time to vent about it because it's just something a lot of people don't seem to get when they can just go ahead and roll straight into another week of work or whatever else they do because for some of us, that's not even an option. And so very often we opt out because we can't get our money's worth to go to these kinds of events anyways.

 This is a PSA to straight ladies about this situation. So I know I look effectively like a boy. I'm a trans person, but I lived part of my life as a lesbian. And I want to educate people on this topic a little bit. So this person is saying, can I lie and say that I'm a lesbian? When a guy is being annoying and saying like, oh, you'll never get a man with like how you dress or what you do. I like wear a person answer is like, do what you need to do to make a man feel small. That sounds great. But the other part of that is that this can be very dangerous. And I think a lot of straight women are not aware that this can be really dangerous when you disclose that you're a queer woman. When you say something like this, this is oftentimes a moment where women will experience violence from man. So a man is basically saying like, oh, you need to change the way that you're acting for or men's attention and you're saying I'm a lesbian. Some men hear that as like a challenge. Like they're like, it's really scary, but a lot of men think like, I'm the man who's going to convert you into not being a lesbian. And this makes some men respond with violence. It's never someone's fault if they have violence directed towards them. But we need to do what we can to try to keep safety in mind when we're having these conversations. So I hope that this is helpful. Stay safe out there. Also, if you're thinking about this so much person in this video, you probably a little bit gay to say it.

Because I am both too elevated and too autistic to be deciphering this much code. I thought you were a beekeeper doing light gardening with your friends on the weekends. So, for the bees to pollinate, because I thought there were real bees. It took me until you started counting to figure out what the fuck you were talking about. Maybe I just garden too long today.

In the United States alone, over 63% that's 210 million identifies being Christian. Maybe you've avoided church or religious circles for so long that you don't realize that this kicker's speech to his audience met them exactly where they wanted to be met. Hence the applause. Your butt heard about what he said. I haven't heard a single person get butt hurt about them clapping. Some of y'all stay so focused in your little circles that you don't realize there's a whole world around you. Y'all are the same ones who wondered how Trump got elected in 2016. You weren't paying attention. Maybe you should start paying attention.

 Thank you for saying this because there's so much misinformation on our community right now and it's genuinely frustrated. And some of it does come from people outside of the community just misinterpreting stuff, but so much of it comes from people in the community just lying for attention. And that makes us so hard for people to understand what's going on with their body. For those who need to hear it, let me reiterate. These women do not get periods. Periods happen from the shedding of the uterine lining and if you don't have a uterus, you don't get a period. And when people talk about PMS or getting periods symptoms, it's just their hormones acting up. Is that simple? It side effects. So many people don't know how to talk about phantom periods, but if you don't understand it, don't say anything. She like this is so embarrassing.

 Back when I was 17, I was friends with benefits with this guy. And he basically admitted to me like two months into us being friends with benefits that he was a theater. And by the way, I was very skinny at the time. I would like 160 pounds. He basically told me, I would love to fill you up. I want to watch you bloat. I want to stuff you. He even admitted that he loves to eat so much to the point where it makes him physically sick. And he wanted to do that to me. I was weirded out by this, but I never told him. I said, okay, whatever, blah, blah, blah. So he brought me like a bunch of food and he would buy me snacks, like a bunch of them. And there's this one time where me and him went to like a buffet and I got a plate of food. And at the time, I couldn't really eat that much and made me sick to eat a lot of food. So I couldn't even finish like a third of my plate. And he said to me, wow, you can't even finish eating all that. You're so weak. And then he proceeded to get two giant fucking plates of food and would brag about it. He also loved when I rubbed his stomach while he ate. And I think he would do the same to me. We would show me furry inflation art. And he would always talk about how big he wanted to be. Oh my god, it made me uncomfortable. And after like two or three months of having to endure this and him having to comment on my weight and saying that he wanted me to be bigger. He wanted me to be stuffed to the brim and broke it off with him. But not for that reason. The reason why I broke it off with him was because he was actively cheating on his boyfriend of a year or two with me. Once he told me two or three months into this like situation ship, I told him, I'm not going to do this until you break up with him. And he told me, well, I don't want to break up with him. I've loved him for so long. And I feel like he doesn't care. I love me anymore. I didn't. I didn't know how to feel about that. I went back to being friends of benefits with him still because I thought he broke up with him. I thought he was over him two months passed by. This is like five months now. Five months I've been friends of benefits with him. And he tells me that he's still with him. I told him, fuck this. I broke it off with him and he blocked me. I haven't seen him since then. I think about this. So fucking much. And I also think he is one of the fucking reasons I haven't eating disorder now.

 So, my childhood was this man. My family owned all Rocky up when I was a kid that was up to Rocky 5, all those movies, right? And so, it's important to remember the over simplification at what the message he is sending. And there's, you know, of course going to be some people who are going to have an alternative opinion, which is completely fine. But what he's getting at is, he uses a term strength. But what I think he really means, what I got out of that is endurance. The reality that people from previous generations, and it's like this throughout history, the generation before us always had to endure things a little harder. They had to endure more things. Now the example that it brings up with suitcases with wheels on them. As a disabled person, you know, I can go into many reasons why having something with wheels on it is going to be not only convenient because it's easier, but because some people probably actually need that accommodation due to whatever condition or disability that that person has. So the world adapting in terms of making things more accommodating. In a sense, I like what another commenter put on that video is that it makes the world safer and makes the world safer. And comfort can be used, by the way, it's like, you know, yeah, you're comfortable when you're lazy, but you're also more comfortable when you feel more secure, when you feel more safe, right? So there are so much advantages that are allotted to me today due to how technology has given me the opportunity in order to think access things more easily. Think of in terms of accessibility. However, I also believe in the philosophy as an educator that the world can only be so accommodating to a certain point. That's just a reality that we as disabled people as a disabled community experience. The world can only be so accommodating to a certain point. And it is during those times of enduring those hardships that really show what we are capable of. That is what I got out of his speech. Always worth considering how accommodations can make people feel more comfortable and safer, but also at what point is comfort going to be detrimental to your development in determining what you are able to endure? That is one thing with my community background, not only as a disabled person, but also as an indigenous person that I'm always quick to bring up, where the indigenous community still continually endure so much. Identifying as a gay male, although my male privilege is one thing, but also coming from the disabled and indigenous community as a two-spirit individual, that there's some trials and endurance that I have to showcase in certain circumstances, just as a lived experience in this world. So it's an oversimplification of how he put things. Personally, just as an athletic coach, the term strength has various meanings. And I love it when I have athletes that are very athletic, very capable, are physically strong. But the overall survival in this world is going to be determined based on your mental strength. And not everybody is afforded the luxury of being physically strong. A lot of people say, oh, well, it's a person's choice on whether or not they want to develop this muscle and that muscle. It's not always the case, again, hence the stability, hence certain conditions that people are born with. In order to train your mind to endure, how to be stronger, you have to go through trials and tribulations. You have to endure certain struggles and that's okay. But accommodations aren't always a bad thing as well, too. They make people feel a lot more safer and recognize, like, it's just a recognition. Oh, I recognize that you might not be able to do this task or access this. So we're going to make that accommodation in order to provide equity. But at the same time, those of us, even with accessible accommodations in today's world, we still have to find a workaround every now and then. And that, again, just proves to our own strengths as an individual determined to not give up and to still pursue something that we want to accomplish regardless of how easy or how difficult it will be.

 You live in an apartment that costs $17,000 a month to live in. And you lived in that apartment since before you went viral. You've been living in that apartment. You went viral because you lived in that apartment. I understand that you made a mistake and now you need to get the heat off your back. I do. I really do get that and I'm not just saying that, okay? I understand. But it's really fucking hard to feel bad for you when you're making this apology video about saying let them eat cake in an apartment that costs more than my college tuition per month.

 So as I was editing today's reel I came across this anecdote and I think it might be the one right
----------------------------------------

Video: @sarahpoynter5_video_7372628636567883050-Scene-002.mp4
 So I thought I was at a point where I could listen to these stories and not be triggered, but I'm almost in tears. I am a really good liar. I have always been a really good liar. I had strong, I'm sorry, I'm going to cry. I had strong morals regarding how I would lie, even as a very young kid. Very young kid. I'm talking like four or five. I knew how to protect myself and my siblings. I could make a lie like that to protect all of us. And somehow get all of us out of trouble. That whole story, what that mom did, she made it a hundred times more likely that this child will lie, or at least this child will never have an honest, emotional relationship with you. I stopped talking to my parents after I was 20-0, because I realized my body didn't feel safe around them. I would leave having panic attacks every fucking time. This lady actually helped me a lot, the one who I stayed because of two comments. Most importantly, she said something like, it's not your fault if you do not feel close to your parents, because there's cause and effect. There's an effect that this parenting style has on you in your relationships. And that was not my fault. That was actually my parents' fault. And she also mentioned to something that parents are going to have to deal with what drew them to that parenting style. And suddenly, a weight was lifted off my chest after I heard it. It wasn't my fault. And I do have a right to be angry at my parents, because there was something that drew them to those people, those leaders that taught them these practices. They could scream until they're blue in the face that, oh, they were misinformed, which side now, they don't think that. But even if they did say that they were misinformed, something still drew them to that. My family is very upset that I share stories publicly disagree with these parenting practices and the conservative Christian church I grew up in. Being silent is how abuse is perpetuated. Plus, I was raised on a healthy diet of this little light of mine. I was told to speak the truth no matter what. And I have always believed that. So I could protect just one child with my story. I would do it in a heartbeat. And that's what I'm trying to do. And also, I felt like I was hiding for so long that if I didn't speak my, what was inside, I was going to die already to fully watch kick talks like that. Because I still do get triggered. I won't ever stop fighting for kids and kids rights. And Jesus' own words, well, you do to the least of these, you do to me. And I just think how much better my life would have been, how less anxious I would have been, five parents that taught me things instead of just hit me and pause me to mask. And if you follow these teaching practices, you're a bad parent. But that doesn't mean you can't become a good parent. This was so rambling. I'm sorry.

 This video upsets me for a couple of different reasons, but let me just give you kind of like a general basis with this Lily lives in a very liberal state. She is from San Francisco She has access to a lot more freedoms and things like that than most trans people in the United States who are living in red states And she definitely comes from a place of privilege when she is doing things like this Number two, I definitely realized that this video is rage bait. I fully understand it I get that she is posting this video Because She's trying to get the likes of you's in the stitches basically what I'm doing right now But at this point it needs to be addressed Our country is not a supportive place for trans people There are laws in multiple red states that have come out trying to basically take us out of the public view take us out of the forefront basically trying to shut down every person who is trans and Because of that Being able to get bottom surgery is extremely extremely difficult It has always been difficult. It is Always going to be hard to be able to do that because it is expensive A lot of insurance is don't want to cover it The prep in order to be able to lead up to it is expensive and then also being out of work for multiple months as you recover is expensive and Lily good for her is able to do all of these things leading up to it as a preparation for her being able to do something that for search choice however This video is Fire for the far right and the conservative community that wants to basically erase trans people from public view public guy and basically from existence from a lot of the laws that they're kind of putting out there um If you go to her comments, it is full of anti-trans like rhetoric and it is just Insanes amounts of transphobia that we're seeing in that in that comment section um And the issue with that is is that this video is never going to affect Lily It's never going to factor being able to get her bottom surgery. It's never going to affect her personally in the way that A lot of people may think that it might She posted that previous video with the Kurt Cobain and she's still doing the same thing now However, it is going to affect those who do not come from a place of privilege or live in an area of privilege like Lily does and This is just going to fuel the fires, you know They're trying to label us as sex offenders and as mentally ill and unwell and saying that the a lot of the anti-gay laws and schools and everything Saying that they're trying to indoctrinate children into the LGBT community, which I just don't understand what they think the queer community is um and this video doesn't help and This video is going to be used as proof and as a reason To further push those conservative talking points of indoctrination sex offenders mentally ill ex-waincy, which is just not factual and not true um And so Lily is sitting here making these videos talking about oh yeah, I'm able to do this and oh yeah, I have to do this And oh, I need a little touch up here and ex-waincy surrounded by children in Disney and It makes me sit here and think to myself. I'm like, okay, you are either Blissfully uneducated and unaware Which means that you shouldn't be posting online or you are so narcissistic and so self-centered that you don't give a shit of the harm that you're doing Because what you were doing is you were sitting on your high pedestal Talking about all of these things while there's so many people who are struggling and suffering and you are pulling up the ladder behind you Because you are already on your way and you're going to be stopping other people from being able to do what they want So at the end of the day All I really have to say about this video is Block her don't talk about her Let her fade into existence let her live her privileged life Lily Fuck you You're dangerous to our community. We don't accept you. You are doing more harm than good and honestly Trans rights matter Go out and vote Research her candidates and let's make this country a better place and let's not feed into the bullshit that this video is Anymore

 So one thing I wanted to say right as someone who's been a supporter of Eden for a long time, calling other trans people mentally, you know, ILL trying to be PC for TikTok to US. Like Republicans aren't going to accept you just because as a trans person, you're calling other trans person, other trans people mentally, ILL. They're not going to pick you. And second thing, in this clip that I responded to, Eden just called another trans person, IT, another dehumanizing word that many Republicans use against trans people as a whole, again, Eden. But conservatives are not going to pick you.

 Children don't just wake up on the morning of their 13th birthday and have started puberty and started to have sexual feelings. Children have a kind of proto-arrocticism that develops gradually throughout their lives. Just think back to your own childhood, there have been a time that you saw like an actor or whatever on TV and gave you funny feelings you didn't know how to make sense of. That's okay and that's fine and the process of becoming a sexual being is gradual. Learning about sex relationships in an age appropriate way isn't sexualizing children, it's helping them make sense of their gradual emerging sexuality.

 Not only that, but just because people are non-binary does not mean that we also don't like early things. I was told so long ago that because I'm non-binary I can't like and enjoy early things and that I can't do things that the girls do. But guess what? I can! You can! Let people do what they want!

 Hi Ryan, gay management here and just give me one second. I had to finish writing up your suspension without slay You want to talk about transgender women? You want to notice I didn't use air quotes because they're people, you know, not a sarcastic situation Let's talk about it. If you turn to the good book your contract page 46 Section 4 letter G it specifically states thou shall not be transphobic now all sass aside How dare you do you understand that you're able to have your telling clicklacks because of transgender people? If they didn't fight for you in a public space, you'd only be in a private space I don't understand this argument Why is there so much hatred especially in our own community to try and prevent people from going to the bathroom? They feel comfortable with do you notice guaranteed to happen in those bathrooms? peeing pooping and occasionally vomit That's the same as everybody else So this whole idea to have to warden and gatekeep the genitals down below Why why does that matter at all? They're not the ones hurting our kids and you know that and if you don't know that then you need to learn about it before you start speaking Not about it because you have a lot of power with your words Not your nails your words do better

 If Sabrina Carpenter held the gun to my head and said, in fact, I wrote Love Fool by the card against its my own song, I just invented it. And back then, it didn't exist. Okay, you never heard it before. I would say, yes, Chef. Absolutely, Chef. Thank you, Chef. And thank you for walking in those 10-inch, creeper platform, Chef. Thank you so much for your service. And I'm a gay man. So I don't fucking know what you straighters are ready to do for that woman, but I'm fucking ready. Because because the race for that's about to be started when espresso takes over the hot 100, and that wicked witch of Pennsylvania, whatever the fuck Taylor Swift is from, succumbs to number two. Because there is only one chosen one.

This man pays over 10k a month to rent that beautiful apartment in Chicago, and there is not a single ounce of personality in his room. That might as well be an inflatable mattress on top of a water bed, with black sheets from Amazon. Okay? Nobody should fuck you if you don't have any art on your walls. Nobody. Nobody. And if they do they're wrong for it, okay? And if it looks like I'm crying, I was crying about something else earlier, but honestly, I might as well cry about this, because I cannot understand. I cannot fathom how you are investing in a home, which you don't even own, I guess. Honestly, how you are investing in any space, and you're not putting an ounce, an ounce, a tiny little bit of yourself in there. I promise you, I promise you, it's not gay to have art on your walls.

----------------------------------------

Video: @shediedonthetoiletmama_video_7371205133310397739-Scene-002.mp4
 If somebody breaks up with you and they tell you it's because they're not physically attracted to you everything else adds up except the physical attraction part and your response last two times you've been broken up with is Why What do I have to fix already you have lost the plot? You know what I mean already you have to backtrack before you start dating people again and you have to try to understand like why do you feel like? You want to spend time with somebody Who's not with a singular person by the way one or two or three people or whatever you could be ten people who are telling you I'm not attracted to you and you're saying well, what do I have to change now that I you're breaking up with me already What do I have to change for you and the entirety of the human race to be attracted to me? You're already not gonna win. It's just not gonna work out number one. I can't really assume whether you date like Men women or anything in between but I am going to say If you are a man and if you are dating women, they're already afraid of you. They're scared of you It doesn't matter how meek or how like Small or not confident or like we quote-unquote again, no shade You may come across which I'm not saying you do by the way, but like it doesn't matter how nice you are There are studies shown scientifically that something happens in a man's brain Where if a woman dumps them then they're going to to un-alive this one They are going to just a Part of their brain that has been locked away is unlocked and accesses Control of their body and they just go well You're never leaving actually if I can't have you nobody can and I'm taking you down with me and women are scared of that They're scared so if you are ever in a position where you're a mandating woman and they go, baby I'm not attracted to you. I'm so sorry and you go why you're already whoo I'm telling you the anxiety level inside that woman if anybody tells me that and I'm a dude most of the time anyways, but um If anybody ever tells me that I'm immediately like looking for the accents I'm like I'm grabbing my butter knife really fiercely. I'm like grabbing before come like looking for the manager I am I swear to god I'm thinking honestly I'm gonna have to throw the angels my way out of here because you are going to kill me girl So number one if you are a mandating woman just don't do that just take the L and go away Otherwise you will in their mind sound and and also maybe in real life because I don't know where you go Why are you not attracted to me to somebody and you don't sound entitled to them to their body also? So don't do that just don't do it, but if it is a matter of like Confidence and a matter of like because why would you want to change yourself for just one person's perspective when you're trying to date around? You know if that one person doesn't like you and say they say well honestly I wish your nose were bigger and you're like well of course. Let me make my nose bigger Then you're catering to that person's taste Other people might not find the same things attractive also just please keep in mind I know there are so many beauty standards everywhere. I know people can be extremely shallow albeit we are all animals. We are all chemically wired to like certain things sometimes I know nature nature versus Nordstrom Nordstrom is extremely powerful Just know that nature is powerful as well Just know that there are times where people are just attracted to what they are attracted to and there will be a person who finds you so chemically attractive so like Frameable please speaking like Attractive they will be like gripping on wooden things. They will be like gripping their men They will just be like gnawing at the bars of their enclosure being like this person has me feeling Like I could just Ex I think that doesn't happen as much as we would like I think we confuse it with men being full of themselves And I think that can easily read to a person that you're dating and it can be quite Scary or off-putting. I think in order to access like the loveliness of thinking. I'm the only one I am literally one of one. I am literally the most gorgeous being on the planet which honestly everybody should feel You have to access a little bit of the feminine energy of that. It is a ritual It is a beautifying space that you need to create in order to look at yourself in the mirror and be like Maybe there's nobody like me, you know And if you are a man and you're trying to access that you can easily veer off into the route of like I'm better than everybody I'm the man which means I can have anybody I want and it means I don't respect anybody That's not what you want. That's not what you want. You have to access a softer gentler Sexier more sensual side of the energy spectrum in order to really believe and embody and feel like One the most attractive person here or honestly I'm attractive. I know what I bring and I know somebody will find that That is extremely valuable But I mean, I don't know to be honest. I feel like everybody's been in the position where You know, we've all been like if you're queer and you've been in a hookup app or something and a guy that you want to have sex with Tells you they don't want to have sex with you. I remember being 20 years old and me like well, why not? What do I have to change because I thought oh You want to fuck everything. So why don't you want to fuck me? Which is weird on both parts, right? I'm marketing myself as a product That I'm also thinking of them as not a person So you have to be careful about that But I think now that we're like in the realm of dating and talking to people I think you have to be gentle with yourself and with others It is extremely hard to break up with somebody in person or by a text or whatever asking them why like Girl don't do that. Just work on things that might make you more attractive to yourself You know, and honestly like the comments are telling this guy like well honestly It's confidence or like you have to like wait train or whatever I got to be honest like the environment that this man is usually in like his house looks really cool There's a lot of stuff there his videos like Look like there is a lot of personality there I just feel like if you start imbuing that in your everyday life And really allowing people to see that a little bit more They're just gonna be more excited about you in general, but like I don't know Don't go ask you people why they're breaking up with you like maybe if something really bad happened But if it's a physical thing like Girl, they're just not attracted to you and that's okay, you know If you take everybody's advice, you're just gonna build a camel and nobody wants to fuck a camel They just don't and they shouldn't

 Okay, so I understand that every creator is trying to get their two cents into this phonita, Alex Earl, slash mecha situation because we're all trying to get views, right? But at the same time, I just have a hard time digesting content coming from people who aren't black or of color talking about the situation being like, well, of course, phonita, Alex Earl is a white woman who's beautiful and sells a lifestyle and you sell comedy and you sell opinions and mean to people, which is all true. It's all valid at the same time and this is no shape to this person at all, but it is what's happening. Like, designating just the caption of your post to be like, well, of course, race plays an issue in it too. Like, yeah, it does. It actually does. It's going to be an end and here's the thing. I think what phonita is doing is crazy. I think phonita is off the deep end. I think phonita is on a little rant right now or something like that or it's new body mania. I don't know. And quite frankly, I don't care. I'm just logging off from that situation as of now. But I do think it is important to dissect and mention the fact that phonita is also a black woman who has gone through extreme lengths to achieve some sort of level of like discernible Eurocentric fucking traditional beauty standards. She just like changed her body. She just did a bunch of stuff. She's lost a bunch of weight. She's baking a lot more money and she's like hitting her head against a wall that's saying, well, you actually can't be Alex Earl. You actually can't be Alex Earl. You're a little too much. You know, and my problem whenever I see white people, white women, white men, specifically talking about this who fail to mention or expand upon as much as they're expanding on like what honestly I could only call it like man's planning your man's planning to a black woman into the masses like well, obviously Alex Earl looks like Cinderella and she's going to make money and she says, well, I've said like girl, we know that. We know that already. So what now? What now? What's next? You know, I think it's extremely important to also know like girl. Phanita's also in like some deep amount of pain that's coming out in extreme ways in ways that are considered lashing out that a lot of black women and people of of color go through. I mean, even I identify with the things that she's been talking about. I wouldn't dare put them on the internet like that because I'm not like like losing my mind. But at the same time, it is extremely painful to try your best to conform and then get to a place where you're like, oh my God, it's actually never going to be enough. Ever. It's never going to be enough. And it's no shade to Alex Earl. Like she's getting her bags. She's doing the most with the the gifts that she has. It would be lovely if she also is using them in a charitable way. It would be lovely if she's also using her privilege to help the underprivileged people. I don't know what it is. I do know that the few videos I've seen of her, she's surrounded by other white people. But at the same time, if you're going to get on this app and be like extremely real about things, I also need you to talk about the uncomfortable parts and not just put a little like addendum in your caption. I need you to be bold and say, all of this sucks. Phanita is wilding out right now. And at the same time, she is speaking from a place of deep pain that is very specific to the black female experience. It is very specific to the person of color experience. Like it's just not hard to see. You know what I mean? Like I understand she sort of backed herself into that corner. But at the same time, I'm not going to blame a black woman who's coming up in a platform like TikTok who decided this is going to be my niche and now it's suddenly realizing like, oh, this is a niche that like has been designated for me by society. And now I can't grow past it because it's just where I am. Maybe I'm putting words in her mouth. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm getting a little too fruit-free with it. But at the same time, I would like everybody to be a little bit more incisive on this app and a little bit more critical about things. Rather than just say like, well, this is black, this is white. And that's the reality. Like yes, there are also a lot of different things going on in there. And if you want to be a cultural commentator, you should probably talk about those two regardless of whether it's scary or not.

 You know, it sounds crazy, but trans women can produce milk to feed a baby.
----------------------------------------

Video: @shortyri00_video_7374598099697814827-Scene-002.mp4
 Oh God, here we go again. Go ahead and get your phone out. I'm gonna want you to search the term delusional, because that is the face that I'm sure is going to pop up when you search that term. I didn't think I was gonna make another video regarding Lillie Tino because I blocked him from all of my social media. I am so uninterested in what he claims to know about being a transsexual woman. However, he's not because he doesn't understand what it actually means. However, I did have a really close friends send me the video really concerned because she goes, do real trans people actually think this? Like, do they think that they can breastfeed a child? Here's the answer. No. Now, if you get down to the science of it, can biological men technically lactate? Yes, however, generally it doesn't happen because you lack certain structures and then hormonal imbalances that are not conducive to creating milk. When you see a biological man lactating, it is due to excessive hormonal imbalances that biological men shouldn't face. Okay, I am not a medical professional by any means. I am currently majoring in psychology and then I'm head in my happy butt to law school. However, what I am really good at is research. So let's talk about the science. When you have breast milk in a real woman, you have different things inside that such as proteins, you have fats, you have ribose living, you have amino acids, you have really great things for the baby's digestive system, you have antivirals, you have anti-inflammatory, the female body is so brilliant because it can basically sense what their child needs and it will change the chemical composition of the breast milk in order to suit what the child needs. It is so brilliant and honestly like, for my female friends, you should feel so blessed to have the body that you have because it is so intuitive and so brilliant when it comes to your surroundings, your children, I mean, your body can basically do it all. Now, as a transsexual woman, I understand that my body, it can't do that. The reason I have the body I have is A, chemical hormones. B, lots and lots of plastic surgery because we all know I'm a little bit surgery happy. So in order to produce lactation and a trans woman, what you would have to do is take a bunch of synthetic hormones which by the way, synthetic hormones are not good for your body. Let's see right here we've got, we've got estrogen. I take estrogen, I'll two milligram tablets, I take three of these per day. These things, so bad for my body, they are really, really hard on your liver. They're also lead to osteoporosis because of a breakdown of calcium. I think that's how that works. I could be wrong on that part. However, I have to take vitamin D because when you are on synthetic hormones, you have a higher chance of developing osteoporosis and then liver disease. So as we all know through pregnancy, a woman will consume certain things and avoid certain things in order to keep them away from the growing infant. They can't consume alcohol, they can't smoke. I mean, they avoid a really heavy salty, fatty, disgusting diet. And when they are breastfeeding, the same rules kind of apply. The reason these rules apply is because anything you consume will be in the breast milk. And so they can't consume alcohol, they can't consume heavy narcotics if they're gonna breastfeed their child because they're giving those to the child. Why would you as a trans woman not want to breastfeed a child? One, because you're giving your child all of those chemicals. You are giving them all of these synthetic hormones that we don't know what we'll do to them super far in the future. Second, they are not trans lactation is not as nutrient dense as a regular woman's and it could also be detrimental to the child. So one, the child is not receiving the proper nutrition that they need and obviously children have really small, like when they're first born, they have really small tummies, so they don't have to eat a lot. But the thing is you have a more nutrient dense thing. So those who cannot lactate such as like biological women say they've had breast cancer and they can't do that. Or maybe they don't want to because that's totally an option. They have formula. Although it doesn't have everything that a breast milk has, the formula is still a great alternative. And as trans women, we need to realize that if we're going to have children, no, you're not breastfeeding because one, it's not best for the child. You're being selfish if you do it. And honestly, it's a little creepy. Okay, it's not a little creepy. It's a lot creepy. It's so creepy. It's very pedophilic and you have these auto-guidophiles that are receiving sexual pleasure from being perceived as women and then bringing pedophilia into it because they want to involve children. There's one thing I've always said throughout my transition. Well, later in my transition, that could be another video. When I started getting a rational head, you leave the children out of it because they didn't do anything. This is your choice, your cross to bear. Leave the kids out of your transition because they have no business being a part of it. So, end of the day, do you technically have the ability to gain the function to chest feet of child? Sure. Just because you have the ability to do something, does that mean you should do it? No. I technically have the ability to go and play with matches around a bunch of gasoline. Should I do it? Absolutely not because that's dangerous. And we don't know what one are synthetic hormones are doing to children. Two, you don't have such a nutrient dense milk to give the child and three, trans women are not meant to do it. There are certain things and we need to start drawing that line in the sand and understanding that sure, we can't do everything that biological women do. We still have amazing and beautiful things that are for us because everybody has something that they're contributing. However, women need to be granted the grace and the space in which they deserve to hone the beautiful things that their bodies produce, that their minds produce, and we need to respect the fact that we don't have the ability to do the same. We can want to be women and we can transition to be transsexual women. However, at the end of the day, I will never be a real woman. I will never know what it's like to be pregnant. I will never know what it's like to breastfeed a child. Not that I want to because that's creepy. But we have to be okay with it. So what I say to Lily Tino is stop appropriating transsexual culture, stop trying to pretend that you are turning into a cis woman. You know, I just said, that's disgusting. Stop pretending that you're a woman. You can pretend to be transsexual all you want. We will take that cross. However, leave women and children alone because you're a weird autogrid, I feel like pedophile that really should just stay in your lane. So thanks for tuning into this video. If you have any questions, hit it in the comments. If you have any thing you would like to see on this channel, hit it in the comments. However, I really hope I never have to see another one of this dude's videos again because he makes me irrationally angry and actually makes me one of them it because he seems to be like a real life demon. And it's gross. So I hope you have a great day. And obviously do your own research.

 I'm up, I'm up. Okay. Okay. To get back to your question, 100% yes. You tell a heterosexual man, if ever you feel unsafe, or a race or in an awkward situation, you tell him that you are a lesbian. Okay. You have every right to do that. In fact, you tell him that you are a non-binary transgender lesbian. Your pronouns are they she, him. Okay. That's what you're going to do. Okay. It at any point, you are in public and you feel unsafe. You run up to the nearest lesbian or gay person. You know, we are your safety net. You come up to us and we will do whatever it needs. Whatever we need to do. The lesbians have a backstory to say that you guys are in a relationship. I promise you that. I promise you, okay. 100% rights. You do that, perhaps. You do not let these heterosexual men erase you.

 I was about to go on my walk and I still am. I didn't need to switch this. I'm just... I'm trying to find it. I see a lot of this in the black community and it bothers me because we are so... it's about me. It's hypocritical. That kind of energy comes off of us when it comes to certain things particularly about the LGBT community. Now, I'm... didn't hear him say this, but I guess he is at least in support of the LGBT. I, A, plus community, I'm sorry if I'm getting those letters mixed up because I'm not... I'm a gen x-ray listener. We just saw who we are. In who? I'm assuming he's at least in some support because he says there's a time and a place for everything. And that's why I want to start this. Because I'm black. Black folks in general have this... there's a time and a place for everything. And in some respects that is true. However, I don't understand how as an individual you want autonomy. You want to be able to be the expressive self that you are. Be who you are. No matter what. Right? So you're asking a group of people because they choose to express themselves the way they choose. With no harm to anyone. You just have to see it or not just on your head. They're choosing that in the arena wherever that is. Because that's who they are. And because it's not your choice of time and place. It's warm. So the Billy Porter thing, the very... I haven't seen it, right? I don't know what it is. I'm just hearing Billy Porter, Sesame Street, War Heels. Billy Porter, by the way, is a bad as bee. I love him. Always love him. And pose everything. When... as I would assume as his true self. This man wears heels. He wears dresses. He's... that's how he expresses his femininity, right? His balance. He's always been like that. So he comes on the show and his true self. And there's a... So this is my suggestion because it's always about the key. It's a key issue to see. Let the key is let the key is. Y'all realize this doesn't go anywhere, right? Like the gay community has been there since inception. Right? Even when it wasn't out and loud, it's always been there, right? No black folks. We're not going anywhere. We're not going to get keep trying to poke us. It's not happening. So instead of you saying, well there's a time I play through everything, including allowing people to be their whole expressive selves, how about you look to your child and say, listen, this is what the community is. You have a lot of different people showing themselves in different ways. And if you want to be... If you want to govern over his thoughts or her thoughts, you give them your idea of what you think that he is and why you think that he is. So then they have a comparison. Okay, I see that. But uncle Auntie, mommy, daddy, whatever, thinks it's this way. But I see that. Okay, where everybody's different. Because in the end, that's all that matters. We're all different and our ways of expression is different. Unless I'm sitting here in your face, hurting you, making you believe, touching you, entering in your space, assaulting... You don't have to see it. Last time I checked, Sesame Street was on television or whatever app you're watching it on. It's a simple stop. I don't want to watch that anymore. I don't want my child to watch anymore. But to say that these people can express themselves like you're doing right now, right? No one's taking that away from you. It's like, I don't... And I'm not poking them, sorry. Let me stop. I'm not poking at you in particular. I'm just... It just doesn't make sense to me. Like, we say it's okay, but then not. It's a time of place for everything. So of who's choosing, though? Is it your choosing? That may want to be his whole self in that moment and the executives of the community, that network said, okay, and that allowed him to be his whole self in that moment. We are okay with it being dummy down when it's somebody else. That's water it up because I don't want to see it. But when it comes to ourselves, soon that right is stripped away from us, we have a whole fucking fits. I don't understand it. And that is a problem with, I feel like the world nowadays step back and see yourself. If this was done to you, how would you feel? Would you be okay with that? Well, you know, you won't be okay with that because that's a freedom. And as soon as people start taking away your freedom, there's a problem. So this person had a freedom to show up. They allowed him to be who he is because Billy's always stepped out in heels and nails. And there are plenty of trans, you know, there are plenty of people in the community that's how they represent them. So it's just a decoration. It's still core for the body. Nails heels. It's just, I like that. I'm going to wear it. What is wrong with that? I think the better answer you and I'm assuming the parent or anyone who's in that predicament, the better answer is to look at the child and teach them that the world is different. And don't put a tone on it like this different, bad, this different. No, it's just different because the better part of that, that they will see that and realize, oh, I could just be who I am because so many people are so different in the world and no one's harming anyone. They keep talking about where I'm pushing the agenda. And I'm saying where, because I'm in the community, where I'm pushing nobody's pushing an agenda. People are people and people love people. Just because I wear this suit a certain way doesn't mean that I can't love the person and the same type of suits. Isn't it all about love? I'm sorry, let me get off my box. I've been medicating myself this morning and I'm just, I'm floored because I just don't get how people don't see this. Like everything, and the black folks we do this so much and that's where I try my is. We're being shut down. We can't do this, we can't do that. We can't, why not? We're not harming anyone better to be the parent, the guardian, the person that is, be a better communicator in that realm and teach instead of sales. It's not supposed to be like that. Because if you think about it, that's taking that accountability off of you being being the guardian to be the teacher for that individual. As long as we don't see it, it ain't happening. We don't want to talk about it. But now that we're seeing this, so now we're forcing people to change it because we don't want to talk about it. We got to talk about it. A kid is a kid and a better part about it. The kid is a kid. So that means you can give them the information and they'll pretty much be like, okay, there's sponges. Some of them not so much because there's no generation now. They've been here before. Very evidence. But I'm just saying, as the guardian parent, uncle, auntie, whatever of that child, I think the better job is do your job and just let them know that the world is vast and people represent themselves in various ways. Hair, nails, whatever the case may be that does not make them any different on the inside. We're all human. Let's stop bashing each other for how we look on the outside. I'm just saying.

 This is your daily reminder not to look up DIY HRT.Wicky then if you did that something like horrible might happen like surviving as a trans person in the UK seriously this is like our what? Third maybe fourth Purety blocker ban they're basically already banned you can't get them these bands which are already in effect really affect I think under a hundred people in total under a hundred it's not a ban it's not anything real because a ban has already in place basically it's just a statement to say fuck you and we support the people who hate you so much that we're going to screw you over just to appease them because none of the people that hate us are actually glued in enough to know that none of us can get any fucking medication and before you go oh geez I better tactically vote for labor to get rid of this shit they support it there are toys in red vote green or something lib Dems if you really feel that much like being a measly centrist but please like fuck's sake this shit like I guess you know hypothetically I go oh maybe labor will will show the goodness in their hearts once they get in they might show the goodness of their hearts once they get in no they're they are ideologically right-wing Starmer said that they're the new conservatives and he meant it my expectation is either like this is like my best case scenario for what's coming up is the green becomes the opposition to labor to the left of labor and labor or just Tories that's that's my best case scenario I could be a pessimist I look a lot of politics I observe a lot I learn a lot but I'm not an expert so take it all the grain of salt but that's that's my best case scenario good luck everyone I'm going to enjoy the Mad Max apocalypse are you

 First and foremost, as a trans woman, you should be the first to know that's not how being trans works. Second of all, by your logic, I no longer have autism, PTSD, and depression because I can't afford to get those treated. Doesn't make sense, does it? Made it as your statement. Shut the fuck up and quit being transphobic.

 Okay, firstly my colleague Leopat in the Buenau, Baal is like I'm now in the look with. Secondly, in this Leopat in the Buenau, why do straight friends think it's okay to follow the gay guys that they have straight friends are pursuing to beat them up? Most importantly, why do straight men think that is the gay guys' initiative? Because clearly in this video he says, knowing every time you go to your place and then I came in, I can see my friend gets excited. But then he goes and beats the gay guys. To open the gay guys.

 Okay, I don't care. I don't even care if I get hate on this one like this. If you knowingly and intentionally infect someone with a sexually transmitted disease, when they trust you enough with your with their body, your garbage person, and I don't care what disease it is. If you intentionally infect someone without their knowledge, that's not okay. If you have a sexually transmitted disease, it is your duty to let the person that you are using as a partner? No. It is also your duty to get tested. It is your duty to know what you have. Unfortunately, taking this law away will now allow people who do not have everyone's best interest in mine to go around and do whatever they want with no consequences. Unfortunately, that demographic of people is very prevalent. Now, they wanted to say it would stop the stigma in the LGBT community. The LGBT community has a lot of knowledge of AIDS and HIV and advocacy and prep, and a lot of people who live with the disease teaching on it. So that's a bit tone deaf and trying to like merge your signal to make it seem like they are the only ones affected. And if we don't remove this law, they are going to be hampered. When in reality, it is actually going to put them more at risk. You know why? Because there are certain people who will spitefully infect people just because they can't. Don't believe me? Less than a decade ago, there was a man who contacted HIV and willingly went out and tried to infect as many people as he possibly could. Because he felt it was a death sentence and wanted to give it to anyone else and did it spitefully. This is why that law is so important. Because if there is no consequence, garbage people who have no problem hurting other people, lying and being dishonest, not disclosing their sexual health, will get away with harming a bunch of people. And unfortunately, people still don't test like they should. They don't test between partners. They don't test regularly. And people lie. So, if you have people out here that will willingly give their partner a clip and Donna Rhea and herpies and genital wards. Decriminalizing HIV and letting them intentionally infect their partners is shady. That doesn't even include sexual abuse or any kind of grape issues or any kind of attacks. That is just them having a partner and intentionally infecting. And see, it's the wording. The wording is what bothers me. They're intentionally doing it. Knowing that they know what they're doing and making it seem like they're not letting that knowledge out. Now, if you willingly tell your partner, hey, I just want you to know, I have this and allow them to choose on if they want to take that risk or if they want to pass. That's how it should be. And it should be across the board with no matter what you have. Because that's that person's free will and choice on if they want to pass their play. Decriminalizing this and taking away any consequence. You are hurting a lot of people. And if you think that they're not spiteful people that will do stuff just to hurt their exes or hurt other people just because they can, come on. It just sucks. It absolutely sucks that it is always a big. We're doing this for the good of a certain community when you're actually hurting that community because there's no consequence for people that will intentionally hurt other people. And see, here's the thing. When you have HIV and you have AIDS, most people are very open about it. Most people will be like, hey, so you know before we start. They give the people the choice. They give the people the opportunity. So if that was going on. What's the problem with the lobbying in place for those that aren't doing it because that's a bigger problem. And it doesn't just affect the LGBT community. That's what makes me so bad. Because you have straight people out here that have it that are actually giving it away. Matter of fact, there is a small town in Illinois called Kinkakee and they had one of the highest highest HIV rates outside of Chicago. And I want to say it was the early 2000s. And that's a predominantly street demographic. So like, can we stop trying to make it seem like you're passing that law to do people favors when you're not. You're really putting more people at risk and it's disgusting. So please get tested. Please stay up on your testing. Please treat everyone. Honest, disclose your health, disclose your, just be very transparent. Not because you have to, but because that's one, the right thing to do and two. Nowadays, you have to be super safe and super careful because now there's no consequences. And unfortunately, there will be people out here with malicious intent on in any community, not just a specific community in any community with malicious intent that now have a green light because there's no consequence. So please stay safe. Get tested and be careful out there. Because unfortunately, it looks like the Illinois government doesn't care about your health or your safety.

 Okay, so let's get into it. I made a video just a few months ago where I talked about how a lot of the things that straight men are wearing. People are saying that these straight men are taking these items from gay men, which may or may not be the case. With that being said, a lot of these stuff that straight men are taking from gay men, didn't necessarily take it from straight men, but straight men more openly wore that stuff back in the day. In that video, I talked about short shorts, crop tops, and dainty jewelry, as well as black painted fingernails. These are all things that are being associated with the homosexual male that straight men are now bringing into their style. These are also all things that straight men used to wear back in the day. I didn't watch this guy's video, I honestly instantly stitched it the minute that he said mesh tops, referencing gay men, and I just want to add that to the list. Straight men used to wear mesh tops back in the day. And in some parts of the world, straight men still wear mesh tops. Now apparently mesh tops are coming back for straight men. This is so funny, and the reason why I find this so funny is because straight men are literally taking or borrowing from gay men, but the gay aesthetic is literally an upcycled version of the 70s straight male aesthetic. It's just like nobody gets it. We are literally stuck in a time loop. We are literally cosplaying as modern day people. Nothing is real, and when the bell sounds, we're all going to snap out of it.

 Yes, absolutely this. However, I have two points. One, why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? If you knew, Phrason, as you said that you knew, could have helped a little bit. Shaking was pissing me off so we got to try to pop them. So point number one is you could have told me. Point number two is if you knew, why were you like that? Does that make sense? Like when I came out, their actions didn't really reflect those of someone who knew that they were going to have a queer child. Like why, why did you react like that? Why did you say those things? Like if you knew since I was eight and you had all of this time to prepare, you didn't think to like, Google a term or two and it thinks I like, hey, maybe my kids should have a queer role model in their life. Like, and like, why were those the jokes that you were making when I was dressed out of earshot me thought I couldn't hear? Why were you always talking about, oh, when you'll have a boyfriend, you'll this rather than saying, oh, you'll have a boyfriend or girlfriend or just saying partner? Like I love my mom. I love my mom so much and now she's educated. She is like ally of the year and we love for her. But I was the one who led her through all of that, me, the child. So like, why did you as an adult not start the journey to education and acceptance earlier? Like you were an adult and I was a child and I had to be the one to bear all the weight of your biases and misinformation. I was the one that felt like the kickback from the way that you viewed the world. Like when I first came out, she said that my sexuality wasn't real and that I must just be confused. And I feel like if you would have maybe, Google like top 10 things not to say when your kid comes out to you, that would be like somewhere on the list, right? And she doesn't even remember like saying that to me. Um, she didn't night it when I first like talked her about it. But one, why would I like, why would I, why would I lie? I want gay people to have good night's times coming out. I don't feel like I would make that up for attention. I don't really want that much attention in general. And to, I've got the sad journal entries to prove it. Okay. I've got the sad playlist. I've got, I've got, I've got receipts. Okay. Like for as long as they're saying that they knew for they would have had plenty of time to like prepare for me to come out and learn. And I don't know, just like change their actions. I guess. So I don't know. I'm choosing to believe that they were bullshitting a little bit when they said that they knew for so long. Yeah, you can retroactively see the signs, but I mean, come on. Anyway, does this make sense? Do you all like see my thought process? Let me know.

 If you don't know what Florida Glortico is, it's a type of Mexican music and dance that was influenced and created after the Spanish inquisition. It sort of exists as an amalgamation of different kinds of Mexican culture throughout the region and it varies based on where you're from and sort of what music you listen to and what indigenous cultural practices you help. So, and you're going to run on its responding to a video by the San Jose Times basically stating that drag queens don't belong in Mexican, single and my yo and political traditional practices because they have never before existed within the context of these practices and they don't exist in any other culture so why do they exist in these festivities? And he basically responds by saying that these cultural practices have to evolve to include all people and though I appreciate that sentiment, I also have to somewhat disagree with it. But not for the reason that you think, I believe that we have to include people based on the previous inclusion of Mexican people. Meet the mooshes. The mooshes are literally a indigenous traditional type of gender classification that includes both male and female types of gender roles and basically they incorporate both and have been historically considered sacred by the original indigenous communities of Mexico. And not only have they been prevalent throughout the inception of for local legal music, they have also participated in Mexican popular culture for as long as Mexican popular culture has existed including for political dances. They are actually older than Mexican political music itself dating around the 15th century. That means that in the early 1400s there is documented evidence of the mooshes group existing. And while I agree with San Diego Agans point that things should evolve to include all people, I also think that we should include people that have been historically a part of a culture long before other aspects of the culture have existed. And to his other point there are way more important things to protect children from. I wanted to talk a little bit about Gaza. What's happening in Palestine is of course a war on children and a genocide on children and women. And I am currently sponsoring a family and if you are interested in supporting it, please check the in my. The family that I'm sponsoring has been making very little, there are six people and they need around 50,000 euros to get out of Gaza. And I'm just asking that you do anything you can't support them. They'll be tech below. And if you could like, repost, share, comment, do whatever you can. Follow them. Don't follow me. Follow them and try to platform their fundraiser. That would be great. Thank you.

 Okay, I would not normally make a video like this, but I couldn't help myself. And this is not a response to the creator himself. Where what you want, do what you want, whatever. However, the comments on, especially Instagram, which is where I first saw this video, are so funny in a, like, disappointing way, because gay men sometimes lack all self-awareness. Um, the comments on that video, somebody goes, um, girls wear outfits like that all the time. Why are people staring at a guy when he does it? And it's like, you are so close to the point. You're so close. Circle back, circle back, we read it. And then people responding to him being like, um, his outfit, he was asking to be stared at. it's his fault. And you're like, you're right there.

 Have you noticed that it's almost always straight white women have an issue with drag existing and queer people expressing themselves however they see fit? Honey, you are not oppressed by drag. And this is not as it says in that comment section, black face of straight white women. Police, find something else to cry about. Okay, drag is about expressing yourself. It's about freedom and about exploring gender and the spectrum that it is in a part of that, because you're not talking about all of drag. A part of that is the blonde, the Paris Hill, to Natrisha Pater, so that all. But you don't have an issue with women with cis women expressing themselves in that way. You have an issue with trans women or drag queens do it. Do you get what your role problem is?

Video: @sw33tm0urningl4mb_video_7364579657158626591-Scene-002.mp4
 So like I start every video, I'm gonna tell you all to go back and watch that video and its full entirety to get my point here basically Gabby who is notoriously famous for being Being a lot. I won't go into all of that because there's a lot that I do not like about her and a sum that I do There's a lot that can be written off because of mental health issues Like I'm not gonna go into all of that because it's not my space to talk about it. What I am gonna talk about is The bullshit Radiating off of that video. She starts it off saying that she doesn't like want to offend anybody Which is strange because she was already questioning whether she should post her to not she posted a previous TikTok asking Her audience if she should post her to not because she knew it would be controversial Why the fuck did you post it? There were people telling her this isn't you anymore? She clearly has made some sort of growth but like Now she's reverting back to the same behaviors Anyway, no my point the point is she's talking about all of these makeup products that we have Why there's so many? Why her growing up like that generation didn't eat that much and then Gen Z is aging like milk is because of drag queens And that they're the ones teaching us little girls how to do our makeup Oh, what where in your right fucking mind? Do you think drag queens and then the queer community are anywhere at fault for this? Because the only issue with it For her is that we're doing full face makeup that like people are doing full face makeup now Where lies the issue? I Don't Understand I can't speak for everyone's experience like there are definitely people out there who grew up Watching drag queens or gay men doing their makeup on YouTube and that's how they learn I did not then that's okay But like who who gives a fuck? Drag queens are not doing anything to hurt you. They are having fun. They're performing. They're singing they're making money They're doing their own damn thing in their community. They're also not all straight Head men like she seems to think that they are. They're not just men dressing up as women like this is a whole culture And she just straight-up says that she blames them that she like blames that On why we have full face coverage foundation Huh makeup ebbs and flows and changes with the times most of the population Is not going out day to day in drag makeup? Where the fuck did she get that idea? social media Can rot your brain super easily, but I can guarantee you it's not the drag queens telling you how to do drag makeup for your performance it's like Fucking EDs that are being glamorized and fucking romanticizing diet culture And telling people that they need to do this down the other to be perfect and clean and amazing. It's not drag queens Again, this just echoes the same thing of like drag queens shouldn't read Like there shouldn't be drag like drag queens should be a thing. They shouldn't be reading to our children It's not hurting anybody. The fuck off the internet if you can't handle it

 Yeah, I've almost had me there, but I kind of agree. I've always said I don't I don't find those like I got kicked out of playing it fitness videos like funny because Yeah, of course you're dumbass like what do you expect? I don't know. I think your examples are I guess they're true admittedly But like the flip side is is like you can't get mad at me for squatting to have you if you don't let me know that In advance, you know what I mean like Like I get your point like yeah, the certain gyms are not catering to me as a power lifter And I I totally understand that and I respect that and that's why I usually reach out when I'm traveling in advance Like a week or two before like what bars do you have do you have cute little plates? Can I have chalk bull? Like I asked that in advance. I know what I'm getting into But like Without naying the entirety of the story from the video that you stitched Like I don't know. I just think kicking me out because I'm squatting too heavy I think that's ridiculous. I think I think especially if you didn't make note of it and say the waiver or to me in advance I'm all for asking people to not break equipment. So obviously I don't think that to case where like I would have the same opinion But like some of your comments in your video are saying like oh and when power lifters permanently bend bar I'm sorry if your bar is getting bent with like under like 300 kilos permanently the bar that your gym owner is Bought is it is shitty Because if it's permanently bending at like 660 like 600 pounds in that in that range Then that means that like four or five it's already bending and it's probably not safe and the fucking equipment quality is trash And you should be asking why your gym is not investing in better equipment to keep you safe as a lifter I'm not talking about you the gym owner because as you said you own a gym or bodybuilders All kinds of people are allowed to come in. I'm so I'm sure you invest in good quality materials I'm just not interested in the argument that some people in the comments are putting forth Or the kind of rationale that well like there's bad power lifters out there that do this so therefore If you don't tell me the lifter of that in advance. I think you owe me My gas money for coming out to your gym in the day pass when you asked me to leave I think that's totally fair. I'll leave but you owe me money. Sorry

 So, I've been looking at the comments section on this video and it's really interesting because when what Abbie's been saying, things have been cut out, which with any of these kind of shows and a song who has worked in TV and is an editor, I understand things will get cut. But I'd really love to know what they cut out to garner the reaction that Cara and Georgia had to prayer and the voting. Because I don't know, I need it to make sense that reaction. I get TV shows, we'll cut things to make things more dramatic and seem a certain type of way. But I'd really love to know what they had cut out.

 I think feminine presenting lesbians do a very good job of blending in with no follow their own within the environment around them. Because you guys blend in so well with your heterosexual counterpart, it's really just hard to tell. And because we don't approach random feminine presenting women, it also goes against the stereotype that society has labeled us with which makes us overly sexualized when really we're not. We're just looking for a lasting committed relationships just like everybody else. And lastly I'll say the reason why we don't approach is because of fear of the homophobic reaction, which also is number one. Peace out.

 You're right, all studs aren't sassy, just like all studs aren't male-identified. They have their own space and it starts with a T. But that's for another discussion. But I'm going to talk to you all about this word sassy that has popped up in our community. When you hear people in our community use the word sassy, they're using it as a pejorative, or it's just a slur. Some of the most hateful rhetoric I've encountered was from the very community I belong to. And also, some of the most hateful rhetoric that I've heard has come to the very space that I sit in right now. So I decided to kind of look up the word sassy and right here in this year definition, the C. It's an adjective, it means improperly forward or bold. The ain't this what y'all be talking about? Some of y'all studs, about masculinity and studs, bold, fresh, impundant, over bold, you know, smart, wise forward, temperament, or behavior, lacking restraint, ain't this what y'all ain't this the energy y'all be trying to give? I'm just saying. I'm not saying everybody, I'm just saying some of y'all. It's the very definition. I even click this article when somebody acts, what does it mean when a male sees somebody who is sassy? And it says someone who is sassy is someone who isn't afraid to say what's on their mind, and who usually have witty comebacks to any assault that's thrown their way. Like ain't this the same energy y'all be talking about? What's wrong with being sassy? Sometimes I'm so confused by the black masculine presenting space, and I'm not talking about everybody. I'm just talking about like these very small minority of studs, who personally to me are in the wrong space, but again, that's where a different conversation. That comes on this here TikTok trying to tell lesbians who are masculine presenting how to live. When there's a whole tea space for you, you can go live over there.

 I wouldn't necessarily say the hardest things because when new people and you love coming to your life You have a tendency sometimes to open up and be honest about certain things so one of the things I learned about myself was that I am passive aggressive also I have a tendency to shut down depending on the conversation because of past traumas and on top of that I disassociate and I'm very lucky to have a partner who can work and walk through that process with me And I love her dearly. So I really like this conversation that's being had Y'all go check out the original video and let me know what y'all think

 Hey, what's up TikTok? It's Tikki. I talk a lot about studs. A whole lot. We're talking about different identities, different spaces between the Ls. And I'm also thinking about writing a pamphlet to also help others see the different identities within the stud space. So for this particular stud, we're just going to call a toxic BMI. Now what is a toxic BMI? It is a stud who is very blackmail-identified that leans heavy into misogyny in her behavior. Peace out, y'all.

 Another example of why we need to bring back don't ask, don't tell. Because guess what? Cess, if you didn't tell us we wouldn't have noticed we don't need to know. You can leave the community. You have free will. We really don't want you anyway. I don't know. I speak for probably a lot of people. I don't speak for everyone, but I'm speaking for a lot of people right now that we don't really need your kind of bigotry and hatred inside our community. Because we have to deal with enough, including the same people that you sit there and defend all the time on your lives. Those same people that would have told those gay people with gay cancer that they were dying because of how amoral and corrupt they were because they didn't love Jesus. So yeah, the door, see your way out. That's fine. Goodbye.

And this is actually a piece of lavagerite that she cut, shaped, and polished and set in the silver. She's made me other pieces of jewelry as well. She has made me this necklace. This is Christ of Praise, set in sterling silver. And this is my coffin ring. This is snowflake up city in. And I love this thing. It could be a double as a weapon.

If for some reason it will benefit you and make you safer to claim to be part of the rainbow community, absolutely do it. We want you to be safe.

 I really want to talk about this and I want to start on the topic of romantic loneliness. Romantic loneliness has to be one of the most painful and isolating feelings, especially if you are a person who's experiencing love, disappointment, rejection and setbacks and love and relationships. When you have been to a lot of pain, this is hard. And it is harder when you see so much people around you and on media, you see all these couples, you see all this love that you feel like you're exempt from. It feels like it's taking so much for you to be able to receive an ounce of it. It is like it just feels like you are like cursed with love. Almost like you feel like you're just meant to be alone, like you're an exemption of your rejection. You have been focusing on yourself for so long. You have been establishing yourself, you've been focusing on the career, whatever it may be, like you have been focusing on doing everything for yourself that's needed and it still feels like love without a reach. A little piece of advice I've seen from another TikTok is TikTok her, excuse me, is the relationship is not a reward. People say it can be luck, but I just feel like that isn't the case because how can you dictate who's looking, who's not with love, type of thing? It's just like I feel like love can happen for anybody and it's like as long as you keep a heart open and keep your attention there, your prayers fit, your goal to receive the love that you've been asking for it. It's just a matter of when you're ready to be able to handle it. And not to say that you can't, right? But it's almost like when you were asking for something and God, the universe, whoever, if you have a heart belief, it's almost like you will not be handed something you are not ready for. You may feel like you're ready for it, but it's almost like are you truly ready to handle the love that you are asking for, type of thing. Of course, give me not know that until you get into relationships, no, no, no, you can see that for yourself, but it's almost like in these cases, and that emphasizes heavily amongst everybody. It is okay and it is understandable to feel romantic, it is okay to feel how you are feeling. And this is okay to feel this heavy emotion that comes with feeling alone, isolated, with romantic love. It is okay to feel how you feel and value itself to be validated by that, even when knowing those around you is. And the best piece of advice I can say is, you know, the phrase, let it hurt, let it heal, let it go. It's almost like a light, so they feel it right. Journaled out, cry it out, scream it out, do what you need to do in a healthy way, but also try not to, try not to dwell too much on this emotion, because the more you fix it on this sad feeling, the more that's going to keep on this spiral, it's only going to keep it further in this, this, you know, this, but that's easier than just the undone, but you know it all starts somewhere, even if by doing simple things and this goes my next point, when you feel these moments of intense emotion, the triggers, the best thing you can do is to be there for yourself. Not to say in the whole self care, we're right, but in those moments we really feel very rough, we feel very free, so, we feel very pessimistic. Those are the most important times to where you can need to be there for yourself, where you really desire yourself, I am worthy of love, I am deserving of love, I am meant for me because my heart is open and my prayers are upset, and this isn't about me, but when personal experience, I resonate with every single thing that she said in the video, I felt exactly before, it's almost like, why I've been doing so much from Trans-So-Har and it feels like the love that comes easy for others, it doesn't come easy for me, it feels like I'm a, I'm cursed with another person's cursed, it's almost like I'm going through about it that's not my entire thing, so it's almost like, as easy it is to keep it something that victim mentality, try to use that as, instead of asking why in the victim way, try to change that why into, to like, okay, so why isn't this happening, am I still keen for something to ourselves to work on, am I truly ready for the love that I seek? You know, it can be different areas and I hope I'm making sense here, but I'm trying to dive too far off topic, but the main point is, I want to let everyone know that it is okay, again, it is okay to feel romantically alone, that feeling of loneliness with love, it is okay to feel how you are feeling, validate yourself, journaled out, screaming out crying out, do what you need to do, but this is your way of sharing, this is my way of sharing to you because that love is on the way, especially you have been praying, your intention to upset, your heart knows that your heart is open, the more, it's almost like, a man I see my kid, but you have already, what you have already said is all right, like, it's already wrapped up in a nice little package, ready to be shipped to you, it's just a matter of time of when it is ready to come your way and when you are ready to receive it, but you require is a lot different than others. That's where you need to sell comparing your journey to others. Well, why is this person ever relationship, but I'm not, that's comparison is a thief of joy, this person may have wanted a salad and you wanted to stay dinner and in relationships, they want to spend different than you did and that is okay. You may at the end of the day, your food is still going to come, you're not going to be exempt from it. You may take a little longer because you require something different, you require more, you desire more, you want something more fulfilling. Keep that in mind where you just witness a lot of relationships happening around you. Keep in mind that I am not exempt from the relationship, I just require something different. And my, what I desire is already on the way, it's already, I put the order in, it's on the way, the orders, the package is about to be shipped in the limiter. But yeah, just know that you guys are definitely meant for love. All you guys, you guys are deserving. You guys are worthy of it. And again, remember to always values your emotions because despite the hustle culture, despite the money, culture, culture, whatever, maybe, whatever people tell you, it is okay to want love, it is okay to create love, it is okay to desire love, but trying not to let your focus of wanting the cloud out, the happiness that you can bring in for yourself and bring it in your life in the present moment. The more you focus on the future and what you don't have, the more you steal your own happiness in the present. And as annoying as me seem as annoying as it is to have the remain patient, there's a best thing for you to do instead of focusing on it, inspire only. So just continue to do what you're doing, continue to establish yourself, to secure yourself, and try not to look as relationship as reward from it. No, try to just do things for you, for your life, establish yourself for you, make happy memories for you. And love will come, love will come, it always does, and never fails. Love comes when you're not looking and chasing after it. Because I believe there's a moment you have to fix it all up and you put your happiness on relationship, you steal your joy away. At the end of the day, all the ships should be in addition to not instead of the identity of the ship, because she didn't say it, but ultimately again, it's just, it's understandable for your tired, exhausted, stressed, anxious about love. Just know that it's coming, it's just going to live a little more time. And that's okay because it's going to be something worth waiting for.

Got my hairs. I'll keep it, Matt. You're not. Thank you. I'm still waking up for the day, but being trans is fun. It's not easy.

Video: @thebigsad_video_7371075390296575278-Scene-002.mp4
 I feel like a lot of people have been really mean about this, so I figured I would chime in. So basically when you're riding a horse, there's like a ton of friction between you, the saddle, the horse, yada, yada, yada. And if you're spending, you know, four or five, six hours on a horse, that can really do some damage just to like the tissue on your legs. Even with like some really thick, durable denim, it's still over time going to cause damage. And outside of that, there's also brush and trees and various other things that you might accidentally rub up against while you're riding your horse. So the leather is just thick enough to actually allow you to not get the friction burns and not get all of this damage from the friction and chafing and all of that. But the reason that there's nothing on the inside is so you still have the mobility to get on and off the horse. If it was just leather pants, it would be a lot more difficult to move.

 Checking in from the council of baby gays who dated men and then just married the first girlfriend that they ever went on a date with and Just one thing I've learned is in order to be part of the community you have to have a shacket So it could be a gene it could be a flannel it could be sharp in the winter Blin it in the summer, but you have to have a jacket shirt Check it that you wear over everything and carry with you You're probably gonna get it on your first date with your first female And then you're gonna move in and get married, but gotta rep the shacket if you want to make it believable

Video: @theevergreenemporium_video_7367264146406100257-Scene-002.mp4
 You'll need to calm down. I don't know how many times we tell people over and over and over again that this is not a label. It's just a descriptor. It's just a descriptor. There are some women, cis women that is who like to tell you that they are cis women to feel to make that trans-disess and brothers feel more included. But it's still not a label. Strictly speaking, trans is not a label. It's literally just a way of letting you know whether or not someone identifies with their birth gender or not. But above all else, you need to settle down. Not really by being that angry, yet you know where. Something I find disappointing as well is that there was one or two people in that comment section who were mutuals of mine, were mutuals of mine. Being more performative on my page and then when I see them in your comment section saying, it's only militant trans women who say these things. I really don't appreciate being called militant, to be honest. No, a big fan of confrontation at all. You do also see a couple of people from my following in your comments just saying, yeah, I'm a cis woman. What's a beef answer that I say, thank you. Yet again, it's another person saying real women this and biological women that. You'll, in biological, are both also descriptors just like cis. So by your own logic, if you think that cis is a label and other descriptors, it's so is real and biological. Why are you okay with those terms? But not cis. Like what difference does those make? Compared to cis. Why are you okay saying real women, which is really exclusionary and nasty, towards trans women, because trans women are real women? But as soon as the word cis is in cis gender comes along. That's when you have what I can only describe as a bitch fit. Your next step is to write a letter. Mr. Royal Hampton. I am a real woman. Respectfully. Yes, over yourself. Because for one judging by your page, you are neither a cis woman nor a trans woman. So it's really not your fight anyway. In the fact that it is a fight is exhausting in and of itself. But again, I ask you why it's okay for you to call cis women real women, inferring that trans women are not real women, which we are white. Trans women and trans men, we are not less than cis people. Okay? We're not less than. We don't exist below. You're all. We are equal people. So when you are saying things like, listen to biological women, why? I don't want anything from you. Why are you gatekeeping in? I'm not going to apologize for simply being aware of what a word means, adding it to my vocabulary and using it when necessary. Because I've done that with every fucking word that I know. Learn what grass was before I learned that it was green. Not all people did, but I did. I did not then get all up a day. When someone told me that this grass was green, why are you giving him all labels? I already know that it's grass. It's already grass. Why are you giving it all labels? Because it's just another way of describing the grass. A little bit people aren't great. Yeah, it's called an example. Called an example, settle down. It's a trans woman. You were someone I would call militant, because it just looks like you were trying to start arguments. Get angry. Okay? You do you. You're opinion on whether or not cis is a real word, which it is, by the way, it's a real word. Doesn't matter in a slightest. Like it doesn't matter. It's completely irrelevant. Instead of telling everyone to listen to biological women, how about try listening to trans women? How about listening to trans men? But instead of getting so angry and up, he over and word and you listen to the people who are telling you why it's necessary in some situations. I don't know, man, when someone gets so angry about the words, it's like that. I always find that as a massive red flag. It's like you're probably quite transphobic. But your relationship is performative. Like you pretend to respect trans people. They say something you disagree with. Then it all comes out. Hmm.

 If you haven't seen the original creators video go back and watch it now because he makes a really really good point about how we're literally just getting smarter as a society and realizing that alcohol is horrible for us and We should probably not be drinking it the way we did every single week now being 24 almost 25 I think I'm in the age group where I have outgrown those 1920 21 year old college days where I felt it was really cool to just get blackout drunk and Make a really stupid mistakes, but I do want to add another layer to this Specifically in regards to the gay community and the LGBTQ community So many of us spent our lives trying to prove that we were worth it trying to prove to other people that We have a place and that we are productive members of society and in doing so We found ourselves in really demanding work environments nine to five corporate jobs that Don't allow us to properly process and feel our emotions the way that humans should do I think we can all agree that a nine to five work schedule especially in New York City, which is where I live is Actually the exact opposite of how humans were meant to live this being said. It's very profitable for bars to cater to that emotional wound that a lot of adults gay people are carrying Hence why especially in the gay community it's seen as such a cool fun thing to just go out and do a ton of drugs Drink a ton of alcohol go to these circuit parties just go to the bar That's like the only activity it feels like that gay men want to do in New York City anymore I Think everybody has to learn this lesson for themselves though to really really truly understand And if that means embarrassing yourself draining your bank account feeling horrible Self-esteem issues because you've gone out and drank every single night for two weeks been so beautiful But as a collective community So many of us are ready to heal so many of us are tired of being slaves to our own emotional wounding being slaves to our own lust and the lust of others and The only way it's been a heal and the only way it's going to start is by making collective decisions to do shadow work inner healing and forgive the ones that have heard us at the point that we can't move on because everybody deserves to move on

I am not a part of this, and there are so many gays and lesbians and bisexuals in transsexuals that are just in the same camp as I am. We are not doing this.

 Hey guys, this is me about PolarFring. No one had to tag me in it with friends, clown. I came upon it organically. Yeah, listen, let me tell you about your little friend. I had a doctor's appointment this morning, and then I had there, people talk about that later. And now I am on my way to a job interview. I had to go back to the house to change clothes. Ah, so hurt with my very own eyes. Do you think she's sending to think to me about these shoes? No, do you know what? Flappers, my gas, the fact that I've never had a yard sale and they said that it's something everybody should experience. So we're getting rid of a whole bunch of our stuff and having a yard sale on Saturday instead of donating to good will where it doesn't benefit anybody. We're going to take the proceeds and we're going to donate them to the women and children and shelter. Do you know what many pairs you should she have to give away? OK, great. Listen, a great man once said, if you can't afford to buy a two, don't buy one, where's mine? I didn't think so.

 No. No. I'm going to say is that it doesn't work out. When you listen to music with soul, when you have empathy, and when you have morals, and when you have common sense, you know, and you treat people with decency, you know, and the other person doesn't have any of that at all. It doesn't work out. It just doesn't. I just dated a non-alternative cisman. I'm an alternative transman. Put more into perspective. A lot of trans men who date cis men experience a bad experience, though. Not everyone, but a lot do. That's a whole nother story for another time on how trans men are treated by cis men, because this is about alternative people. But it goes deeper than just alternative people for me with this whole last relationship. Obviously, it's so much deeper than that. But yeah, if you want a whole story on that too, just let me know.

 This just made me think, you know, on the flip side of that, a lot of people will see a guy painting his nails or wearing a dress or whatever and they'll say, well, that there's a guy who's a curious manhood. And while I understand the sentiment and it's not meant in any type of bad way, I don't know if I love it. Just for the simple fact that expressing yourself confidently is manly, right? Being willing to put yourself out there and not to care what these little boys have to say about it, right? That's manly. Being willing to stand in not just your manliness, but how you want to show up in the world. That's manly. And I just want to say if you want to put your nails, please paint your nails.

These bitches are not going to build families with you and you're doing all of that. Bitches deserve to get tricked to the fuck. A trick that got tricked because you're slow, you're slow. You bitches are only attracted to certain bitches because they have money. And what are they going to do? Use you for your money. Don't be mad cause the bitch popped out.

 What if she consider someone to have come out, quote unquote, later in life or to be given?
----------------------------------------

Video: @thescarylibrary_video_7369034306288667947-Scene-002.mp4
 I think to answer this question, we need to consider what does it mean to bloom? What does society think blooming means? Because what even is that word, you know, but I think what society is saying is puberty. So let's replace bloom with puberty. Okay, when do people when do Homo sapiens experience puberty? Around the ages of 1213, right? However, let's get them a little bit more grace. Let's say that not all people experience puberty by 13, let's say some of them experience puberty later. So around the beginning of high school, let's say 14, 15, 16. Okay, so basically biology textbooks say that during puberty, a lot of changes are happening to someone's body. And one of them is basically figuring out who you are sexually attracted to. And people start getting, you know, crushes or whatever. sexual feelings. I know it sounds gross when you think of a 13 year old having those thoughts, but it's been scientifically proven. So, okay. So if you didn't know who you were sexually attracted to by puberty, then you're technically considered a lay blue. Yeah, so if you didn't come out by high school, you're technically lay bloomer. But let's go beyond this. I think the feeling of being a lay bloomer is actually a feeling. I'm not like something you can figure out through puberty. I think if you came out in college so after puberty, we can like assume that you are above 18 in college and you are therefore an adult and therefore you have gone through puberty. But if you did figure out in college that you were queer and you don't feel like a lay bloomer, then you're not. Because I think it is majorly just a feeling. But personally, I came out in college. I figured I was queer in college and I do feel like I'm a lay bloomer. Because I keep thinking, keep wondering what would my life look like if I had come out earlier. I keep having these recurring thoughts and I don't think somebody who wasn't a lay bloomer has them. Now the reason why I didn't know is well there might be a lot of reasons but I think one of the major major reasons was I live in a country where being queer was more taboo than in the United States. And so I did not know any queer people in real life. Except for one trans person but even he wasn't. Did he know he was trans? I don't know. He's dead now. Actually at least I can't go ask them. But I didn't know any queer people in real life. I did not know any queer people who were my age definitely not. And so I also didn't see any queer presentation in media until I was 16 years old. And so how would I know that being queer was a possibility for me if I had never seen it? It's like when you don't know the possibility of the existence of something, how can you know it even exists in the first place? It's like when you don't know we don't know, you know? There's a lot that we don't know that we don't know. But anyway, I keep thinking about this. What would my life look like if I knew? And the truth is I will never know. But I did come to the realization that I'm queer during college and I'm very happy that I did and I'm very happy that the internet algorithm supported my journey because real life would have made it much much harder to figure it out because my queer awakening was like a celebrity that I found on YouTube. So. But yeah, if you if you feel like a late bloomer, then you are one I guess. But I also understand why people who are much much older than me might think that I don't deserve to be called a late bloomer because that's like much more extreme like to them maybe that word might hold more weight like somebody who comes out in their 30s, a late bloomer. But I feel like if you can see yourself in a feeling and when somebody describes a feeling you resonate with it, then I guess you are allowed to use it. I mean, I'm not like going out and telling people I'm a a late bloomer lesbian. No, I'm just, you know, I usually tell people when I have come out if they ask me and usually figuring out in college that you're queer is like a commonish experience, but not necessarily everyone figured out then a lot of people did figure it out earlier. So I guess it's different for a lot of people. I know like I'm this point I'm just rambling but you get what I'm saying. Yeah.

 I'm about to have an interview in eight minutes, seven, but the reason why there are no more male pop stars is because all the women are realizing there are lesbians and we are hyping up other girlies. So yeah, that's why there's no more straight guys who are being hyped up anymore because we want the girls. We want the women. We don't want men. I hope it's helps.

 We put up flags, particularly gay flags, but the thing is, I am graduating tomorrow and my parents are going to come pick me up and they're homophobic, so I have to remove all of these flags as well as other variations. Like, this is the kind of stuff I do in my free time. Like, I can't let them see this, and you know that I don't know what lesbian colors are, I still have to hide it because what if they start questioning? So I am going to remove my flags right now because I don't want to be well at all. On my big date tomorrow, so they served me well for the past year, but they have to go. They have to be folded and they don't see the light of the day, at least for a while. I don't know what I'll be able to safely take them out again because I hope parents say so yeah. This is very sad. Thank you for watching.

 So the author of that study is actually Satoshi Kawazawa, who has been pretty much exiled from most research communities for having deeply racist and kind of eugenicist studies. He's an evolutionary psychologist, which if you don't know is one of the most batshit disciplines there is. Like, think Jordan Peterson here. It's a field where mostly men make crazy ideas about how evolution led to like social disparities and gender disparities that we see and how that's evolutionarily like ingrained in us. In this study, he basically just runs some simple regressions on nationally representative datasets and finds that like childhood intelligence score is like correlated to someone's likelihood to identify as gay and adult. Which like, okay, that's what the data spit out. But the way he interprets and explains it is like batshit. He frames it under the Savannah IQ interaction hypothesis, which is pretty much like, oh, like we all came from Africa and like that's an evolutionarily familiar space. But in other spaces, like they're not evolutionarily familiar and intelligent people are like more able to like generate new ways of being that like can adapt. And to further elaborate on that, he reads a couple books by anthropologists who like went and studied like pretty isolated communities that haven't had much outside engagement or like changed as much over the years. Think like tribal communities and Papua New Guinea, etc. And so he argues like, hey, when we go to these like primitive cultures that are like more representative of like our human ancestral condition, they don't really have same sex partnerships like or same sex activity as much, whereas people in other countries that have more intelligence like see more homosexuality. So essentially, home boy looked at a survey saw a thing and was then well, that's because being gay is genetic and being intelligent is genetic and those two things run together. And that's why less developed places like don't have as much, which really ties into like many other insane claims he's made about like the different comparative intelligences between different races, the relative inherent attractiveness of certain races women, like just Ku Ku bananas batch it. And his research is really in the broader tradition of Simon Leve who was like hell bent in his career to find like a biological cause of gayness and who also found in like a study a couple decades ago that like his gay participants on average. were like smarter. And so this idea is kind of floated around right like gay people are smarter like smarter on average or like get more education. But the prevailing like social science interpretations of a lot of that work is like there is participation or disclosure bias where like people who are like more educated or have more resources are like safer to like come out and disclose their status. Anyway, just be careful. Like maybe read the studies like before we share them. Do you ever see anything about intelligence and if genetics or anywhere near that it's like you show me a sign that you should think carefully.

 I am so sorry this happened to you and I have four things to say about. One, I sent this video to a bunch of my friends and group chats and they sent out to other people and everyone already has that bar on their shit list. Even though I know that's not necessarily what you were trying to do. Two, a lot of the bar owners in Hell's Kitchen are like notoriously shitty people who have treated a lot of folks badly in a lot of different ways. So I hope you don't blame yourself about that. Three, the space that that new gay bar hymn is in. Every single place that has opened there has closed within like a few months. I would be absolutely shocked if it is still open in like six months time. Honestly, so you might have dodged a bullet a little bit, even though I know the money would have been pretty ideal in the meantime. Four, a lot of my other friends have worked in the neighborhood and I know a few other bar owners. So please DM me. I'd be happy to see if there's like anyway I can help you out in the meantime.

 It's always particularly crazy to me when gender nonconforming gay people are transphobic and like fear monger about trans people like do you not realize that to a vast majority of people you are just as like weird or wrong or scary or sinful as a trans person? You really think a bigot is gonna treat you differently in those acrylics than they would like someone who identifies Australian like you're gonna stand on the shoulders of all the trans people who fought before you for you to be able to move through the world And then turn around and talk about how it's like inappropriate or dangerous for trans people to use the bathroom like drop the black scent learn your history

 discipline and adolescence. Now this applies to children even younger than adolescence or older and the younger adults but even in your adult relationships. So we're generally in a state of equilibrium meaning we're calm, we're chill, right? And then something happens either without thoughts or our emotions that shift us. So we can shift towards the things that we actually enjoy in our great loves like euphoria, joy, excitement, surprise, happiness, love and then the other side we can experience feelings of shame, guilt, anger, frustration, overwhelm, jealousy and we all these are things that we don't really enjoy feeling for most of us. So when we're talking about an adolescent saying no when you ask them to do something. This shifts you from a state of harm to experiencing anger, frustration. So what happens is that when you shift into an emotional state, how you react is based on that emotion if you do not self-regulate before you act. Now when you act from a space of emotion you may act in a way that harms the child and harms you and harms the relationship. Definitely deflating the tires or removing the tires from the bicycle that your child is using to go to school is a passive aggressive act. The child learns that if you're in a position of power you can harm the people around you when you are disrespected, when you feel like there's a conflict. You shouldn't talk about it, you should act in a passive aggressive way, communicate how you're feeling in a way that they will have a real sin, kind of thing. It's okay to be ventrilo, it's okay to take revenge, it's fine. So that's what your child is learning. And knowing from childhood into adulthood you're preparing them for how to engage with other humans, whether it's romantic, familial, platonic, professional, regardless of the relationship that they are having, they need to understand how to communicate assertively and how to resolve conflict in a way that is healthy for both themselves and for the other parties involved. Which brings me to the steps what I want you to do. So definitely what I don't want you to do is to harm your child. Whether that's physical, verbal, psychological, emotional, sexual or an neglect meaning you will not eat dinner, you're going to sleep on the floor even the sleep outside, yeah, those are not things you want to eat. So what should you do? Number one is learn how to communicate assertively. Let your child know, hey, I feel disrespected. Hey, do you know when I ask you to do something, I'm making myself vulnerable, I'm asking you to help me. And when you say no, it means that you're looking at me and thinking about how much value I have in the relationship with you and you go, no, I'm not going to help them up. Then you want to want them to understand how your family structure, so whether that's authoritarian meaning I have a power and you have to do what I say or it's authoritative in terms of I respect you and you respect me. And that we certainly freely given and the love that we experience for each other is freely given too. And that means that by us loving each other, choosing to love each other, we are experiencing respect and trust and vulnerability in our relationship. Okay, so what happens is communicate assertively step one step two is that you use ideal method and that means you identify what's going on. So you tell them, I feel disrespected, I feel like you're being unfair. This is not to manipulate them psychologically or emotionally. This is to let them know what's your feeling, what their actions have resulted in. The second thing you do is you determine what is the things that are available to you. So you can introduce abuse any form of abuse, you can introduce vengeance, you can introduce hardening meaning anyway, you can add something to make them uncomfortable, you can remove something to become uncomfortable. Alright, then based on what you determine, you evaluate that's the next step is to evaluate what is the healthiest thing that I can do. What is the thing that I can do that will not harm this child, that will not harm me, that will not harm our relationship. And then you want to act, you want to think about the thing that you're going to do, you've chosen it, now you put it into action. And the last step which is the most important one is learning. So you sit with that child and you let them know, listen, this is what you did, this was the consequence, was this effective. And then it brings about conversation and they're able to learn from them and they're able to learn from you and you can actually have a chance to deal with any resentment that may have come about after the incident. So in case they felt you acted overboard, there's a space you can talk about it now, we both come or if you felt that they were not treated right, they were not treated right, this is an open space for you now to deal with it. I hope this was helpful, if you said any questions let me know, bye.

 I don't know what's more disturbing. The fact that you don't know the words to the season, you don't know how old the song is, or the fact that you put in your caption that you love your LGBTQ people, but and then post a rage-vading post about a Christmas Carol. Being sung as the lyrics are in Coco Mellon calling it us pushing an agenda and the videos still up even though you've been corrected. If you truly are do like your LGBTQ people you would take this video down. See the original lyrics said to the season to be jelly, fill the mean cut drain the barrel. Okay that was back when it was originally written in 1800 or actually earlier because it was changed to gay apparel in 1877. In 1877 I guess that's when they were pushing the gay agenda with his the season and they did it to take away any reference to drinking. Now when they say gay apparel they don't mean pride wear. Don needs to get dressed the word gay is a homonym a word that shares the same written for was another word but has a different meaning this word is used to indicate that somebody is cheery married jolly or light hearted so they want you to wear your gay apparel. You're happy light hearted. You're your happy fun clothes. Whatever that means to you. You don't get a pair you get dressed in cheery clothes. I thought I knew this as a child in the 70ss singing these same lyrics. Oh we're dressing in happy clothes not once. I think it was the gay agenda but you're gonna put in there that you have no problem with gay people. Didn't try to cancel cocoa melon and then put an old Christmas call. Carol with lyrics made in the 1800s not thinking about how language is changed since then and put that as the LGBTQ agenda and there's nothing gay in that video. It's kids singing a Christmas Carol and your video is still up so that you can continue to raid bait and get people to say oh yeah yeah yeah this is just another part of the agenda. If you want to continue to farm this and promote this on something this innocent take away the part where you say you love your LGBTQ people because you obviously don't. You obviously don't. I have never my once in my life once thought singing that song people are donning pride wear. Not once. I just I can't.

 As the guy in the giant lesbian friend circle, I can not imagine a more terrifying thing I was planning on being the lesbian. I thought men had gaslighting down to a science. Let's means have it down to an art form. I've seen lesbians flee the friend group, flee the city, flee the state just to get away from other lesbians. I've seen them be traumatized into completely new people because of lesbians. You're how science is like, oh you're always within like 8 or 10 feet of a spider. Let's means have that, but it's with another lesbian that they share an ex with. I've been gashed with my association because I'm still friends with certain lesbians. If I'm lost in the woods, I'm picking the man and the bear at the same time before I pick the lesbian. If you're lesbian that's gone through emotional abuse with it, probably all of you.

----------------------------------------

Video: @torrey1991_video_7368510414625230110-Scene-002.mp4
 Hello, gay parent here raising 12, 11 year old boy. So I'm listening to what you're saying. And I don't think this is a matter of gay parents raising children. This is a matter of people raising children, period. We got to get to the point where we have to teach kids about consent and what's right and wrong, especially as they get older. It is internalized homophobia and I can actually speak on that because at one point I thought like you. I'm not here to bash or anything like that, but I didn't want to be considered one of those gays. I didn't want to go to the gay clubs. I didn't want to be with any of that. But then I have to realize that was just the part of who I was. But it's not a gay parent raising a child thing. This is a person raising children, period. Because little boys are just saying thanks to little girls, well girls are just saying thanks to little boys. You have to sit down and see your child. You know what's right and what's wrong, what's appropriate. For example, my son, you know, he's never releasing me and my husband gives me anything like that. Not because we are hiding it from him. We just don't do it, but he has seen our wedding video where we kiss and things like that. We sat him down and we explained to him, you know, families are some families are different. We have a different family at the end of the day. These kids just want a decent family. So yeah, I think you're one of those people that are socially and homosexuality with in appropriateness amongst children. And you got to get out of that mindset.

 What is the light that you told us a kid that was so bad that you thought your childhood was
----------------------------------------

 So, okay, so, almost 17 is considered a child. It is. When I was 17 years old, I got my very first boyfriend. And I would do things like sneak over to his house, never become my house because of always people in the house. And or we would meet up at my best friend's house because she had one of the mamas that I would be able to do. So, around this time, it was my senior year in high school. And I just, I just want to watch a lot of the grassy. And on the grassy, if you know, you know, everybody was 76. And also it's a high school where everybody was 76. And I was like, you know what? I cannot leave high school still a verge. It's so one day it was Christmas break. I'll never forget it. It was, we were at my grandma's house. It was me, my youngest brother and my mama. And my grandma had a really bad code. And my mama was just like, my, my, I stay here with you. You know, you seem to be real sick. And my grandma was like, no, y'all can go, go, go, go, go, mom, we get y'all sick. I said grandma, you don't know what the hell you talking about. My, you need to stay here with grandma. You need to keep Lachari as well. And when my mama was like, well, what am I, what you gonna do? I said, I'm going to go. to the house, you know, cause there's too much more than the grandma's house. And she's like, okay, I'll drop you off. Well, I ain't calling my boyfriend in the head. So I might have a house to myself. So you need to be at the house waiting on me. And before my mama could say, yeah, I'll drop you off. I ain't want her to see him in the driveway. I was like, no, I'm just gonna go to the tent, this house and she'll there. She was like, okay, cool. Well, my friend, Tim, she had one out of town that Christmas break or something like that. And I hit the walkie hole. So I can meet him in the driveway. He wasn't gonna drop away. My mama could have dropped me off. That's a different story. So, you know, we ended up doing what she's supposed to do. I can't stand my V-car that I was ecstatic. But this is where the trouble come. So my step there also was in home. I don't know if he was working like, I don't know what he was doing. And my mom had just got a brand new flat screen. You know, back then flat screens, they were still kind of new. And they cost a lot of money, like a lot of money. My mom had picked me up in that morning because I had got a gift card for my dad for Christmas. And she took me and my brothers to the mall to use it. We get back home and my mama yells, where the fuck is my TV? When I tell y'all my stomach literally could have flew out my behind. I'm like, oh my God. She like, sorry, wasn't you home? I said, yeah, she was like, you didn't hear that, I said, my name or nothing. They had to have took it when we was at the mall. And she was like, oh, my God. What the hell? So, you know, I don't tell my mama business, but my step daddy was going to be using some shady stuff. So that is where I put the blame. I was like, I think my step dad took it. My, you need to check him, but we're about they were fighting for weeks. That was December. I swear they fought about that till Valentine's day. I was so scared. I never asked my boyfriend because I was, I wasn't even in love. I just, and I was scared when he was there because he was a big ass liar. Like, dude was a big ass liar. He lied up. And so last time I was saying him was probably like, when I was 25, but he would lie up until then. And you know, until this day, probably like two years ago, I finally told my mom, I'm gonna truth about that whole night and everything and how my boyfriend possibly could have been the one that took the TV. And she just looked at me like, and she was like, do you realize how aggressive that fight guy would show a step dad? Like, I was mad about that story. And I said, I know I am so, so freakin' sorry. But yeah, that is why you don't lie to your parents to have sex.

So they are a vanilla cupcake and they're chocolate chips in the batter and on top is a cookie dough frosting and a mini chip so boy. I'm going to start with the chip so we. So far so good. Put the cookie dough from count. No, but the cookie doesn't count. I'm making a sandwich. Okay, stick in her apart. I'm just going to go for it. Okay. We only correct way to put Taylor a cupcake. Wow. Magnifical. Amazing. Amazing. The only right way to eat a cupcake proceeds to make an entire mess. This is so good. Just frosting. It's fantastic. It's fantastic. It tastes like cookie dough. Oh, so good. It's like salty but like sweet. That's so good. That's amazing. Kudos to you, Kristen. Thank you. You're a batter bitch.

 The same woman here stating how toxic an awful men are is the same woman who is in a call of duty lobby Saying that if she ever had a son she prays he turns out to be trans or gay because she refuses to have a cis-gendered Straight child and that she would indoctrinate him right away to make sure that he turns out to be trans or gay Not only is that one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard of and I hope karma comes around and you never get to have children Because you really shouldn't be allowed near them But it also shows that you have no understanding of trans or gay because the biggest argument is always that it's not a choice But here you are saying that you would force your child to choose to be that I Don't know what went wrong in your life that you think that is the answer to anything But it shows how narrow-minded and disgusting of an individual you are and Men aren't the problem here honey. It's you so clean up your own yard before you expect others to clean up theirs You're not one to be holding anyone accountable

Video: @tristan_e_rey_video_7365180107385883946-Scene-002.mp4
 Y'all should go back and watch that entire fucking video if you're queer because holy fucking shit did my for you page say for you today I just woke up so pardon me if my thoughts are a little bit scattered right now. I'm just gonna address The original poster directly hide air in My name is Tristan. I'm transgender. I dealt with weird family shit for a number of years before finally cutting them off And I am here to tell you that Cutting them off is worth it. I know that sounds harsh But sometimes it is the literal only thing that you can do and sometimes that still isn't even enough So it's been about 10 years since I went low contact with my parents and about maybe five since I went completely No contact after a huge blow-up fight that we had Regarding my gender and my sexuality and everything. I can tell you right now I feel 100 times better without their involvement in my life Like if you start noticing a pattern that every time you hang out with a certain person or any time You're in the vicinity of a certain person and they start making you feel shitty and you notice that every time they're around They make you feel shitty. That is not a person that you need to be around regardless of your relationship with them It just isn't good for you and if you've had the conversation several times already just like I did of Respect me please for the love of fucking God. It's not that hard and they still won't do it There there's nothing else that you can do you have to set that boundary and you have to say being around you does not make me feel good anymore So I am going to stop being around you unless you change your behavior Now if you have an emotionally immature Narcissistic parent they're gonna lose their minds when you do this my mother lost her shit It was fine. She's an adult. She can handle it. She's a big girl But she lost her fucking shit on me the first time I did it because she was losing access to me Which is what she actually cares about which is what these people actually care about is the access to you They believe that the access to you will be enough for them to be able to change you They don't want to be around you because they like you They want to be around you so that they can influence you and that was one of the absolute hardest things To come to terms with when I was cutting my parents off because that one hurt There was this video from a different creator I cannot remember who the life of me It was if anybody knows tagged them below But they essentially said something to the effect of a boomer and gen X parents Essentially view their children as badly misbehaved pets and not as the fully functional human beings That they are supposed to be raising And that statement was very true for me and it sounds like from your description of your family that it might be true for you as well Because you mentioned making that offhand little joke comment about being gay and your mom or grandmother Whoever was like well, I hope I hope that's not true and took it like so seriously and said that she was praying for you Honey, boo boo you don't have to deal with that. You just you just don't second of all Let's address how absolutely wild that statement was for just two seconds These people genuinely think in their dumb little brainwashed heads They genuinely think that it is better to be straight and miserable than be queer and happy They have genuinely conditioned themselves into believing that Like that's an absolutely insane shit to say to your family member Like I hope you suffer so that you can be relatable to us That is bonkers Anyway, I just came on here to say hi Just do a little wave let you know you're not alone and It sucks and I see you too and I just wanted to let you know that you don't have to put up with it There are so many better options If it really is affecting you that badly it's a step that you might need to take And there is a chance that they'll come around after that once they realize that you're serious, but Don't hold out for it just Focus on yourself That's the only thing that you can do because at the end of the day You are the only one that is going to put you first. They're not gonna do it clearly You have to rely on yourself for that Which sucks and we can rely on each other too The community on TikTok is absolutely beautiful and I've loved every second of it And if this app gets banned, I will be incredibly upset and I will be burning something down All of that being said good luck with whatever you choose to do you have a full support Good luck

 Bitch go up that whole video and come back a wholeheartedly agree with her. I think it's absolute bullshit that we have to pay pet rent When this well behaved well-mannered child has never bothered a neighbor in his life There are exceptions on both sides Obviously not every child is gonna be destructive and not every animal is gonna be a perfectly well behaved angel But 99% of the fucking time kids cause way more damage to apartments than animals do. Why aren't we charging kid rent or child deposits a child is gonna The dog dude and that lovely ladies video isn't even about the concept of like property damage It's about noise complaints It's about she had to file a noise complaint against her neighbors because her kids wouldn't shut the fuck up Like if dog owners can get kicked out for our dog barking at too late of an hour The same rules should apply to people with kids who scream all fucking night. That's just bullshit that double standard is shitty

 Check us out, we're true. Transgender rights understanding and education. True was started by a group of families from New Jersey, South Jersey to be exact whose sons or daughters transitioned or came out as non-binary and we realized it was a lack of resources. We wanted to learn as much as we could for our children's sake and safety. So if you or anyone you know is going through this struggle and they need a little extra guidance. We're not professionals. We're just families who've been through it. Try true to be you.org. I'll post it right here. Thanks.

 Hi, my name is Casey. I'm a trans woman on the internet who runs a little trans news segment I am not the trans police so I just wanted to clarify that first I am a trans news anchor and anyway what I wanted to say with this is that Lily is Intentionally making rage bait content. She's very aware of what she's doing because she does it a lot She usually does it in the form of like waiters misgendering her and things like that to kind of get our attention with things and Something that our community gets hit a lot on is that we don't police our own people and And there's a time in place for everything and this is absolutely not it So I am calling you out for this you should not have talked about your bottom surgery at Disney modern to conservatives love to fear mongeras and prioritize that like Propagandize that we do all these horrible horrible things and like you know Say these things to around children and things like that and as much as we fight against that And then you come out here and make a video that gets seen by 1.5 million people Was inappropriate it's wrong you should not have done it and it's gonna make us all look bad and I Think you should apologize

 Hi, my qualifications are I'm a trans woman. Um, anyway, this is something I'm actually going to go ahead and just speak on behalf of the entire community for Hell no, we are not having that never have never will. We're not putting up with it They try to like sneak in and weasel in before and they get stomped out every time time after time It is something that we are firm in the sand about not happen and not gonna happen Never have never will. I am a trans woman I would rather be best friends with JK Joanne rallying herself Hand in hand than I would ever ever ever Even think about having that in the community. That is not who we are. That's not what we're about Look, we're pretty tolerant not that tolerant. We are not putting up with that That's not who we are that's not what we stand for is something we believe in it ain't happening I've never met a single member of any part of the community that believed that and that's just that's just where we are We're just not having that

 If you guys haven't seen it already, go watch Amelia's videos. Does a great job calling out the lead, this entire process. Hi, Lily, me again. Thanks for the little shout out in your video, Queen. You didn't do it directly, I know. Because there's a lot of people that made videos about it. You might've got like 450K, I think. So, yeah, I think you probably saw it. You are still aware that it was wrong. And we knew that this was going to be like the fake apology you're going to give us. What's the goal here? What's the angle? You want to be the one to like normalize, talking about what your business is down there in front of children and the world to see? No. Don't. If you want to have that conversation off to the side or maybe not at a kid's place, I could even live with that. Like, more than I can with how you did it. But the fact that you want to come out here and you're talking about being visibly trans and being visibly queer in all these spaces, that's not what you're doing. What you're doing is visibly making a mockery of us and making it so much harder on just regular everyday trans people because you have this massive following. I'm just a nobody trans person on the internet. You know, I'm not going to get seen by millions of people, you know. But whatever. I hope you're having fun, Queen. Go back to like trying to get waders, cancel, whatever, like stick your going for next. Love that for you.

 So I don't really talk about hair when I make my videos but if you don't mean or like you've never been around me or whatever things maybe you know I love cheesecake so hopefully this is something. I had heard that Popeyes had a Oreo one but I didn't have that one so we will see. It smells good. I think it would smell like a cream cheese or whatever. Oh it's a lot of cream cheese. Let's see if it... So I look about I love it. The cream cheese is good. It's not too sweet. It could do a lot more strawberry as you can see it's the right amount of crust. It's good. It's not heavy either. Like it looks dense but it's not heavy. It's good. I like this. Mm-hmm. That's good. I like it in a hard time.

 I originally didn't screen record and make a stitch to your video because we have a very small following and I have a large one in comparison. However, you were that loud and that wrong at 4.30 my time and I've decided I don't care anymore. The day of an event where one ticket costs $75,000 which is more than the medium average income in the state I live in, only $71,000, which is more than a lot of Americans make in a year, which is where a lot of these celebrities happen to live. The platforms that these celebrities have that got them to this event is because of us. They only have the voice to make a difference because we follow them. We're the ones engaging with them, watching their shows, buying their products, eating up their online content. Can they stop a war? No. And do we think that we are heroes by blocking these people? No. However, with millions of international followers, they do have the ability to get the word out, get people protesting, get people marching, get people boycotting, get people calling their representative. That amount of reach can spark outrage. It's all get out there, go do something if you care about it so much until we are actually trying to get the information out. You cannot organize without getting the information out there first and foremost. On top of that, there are people whose wallets and livelihoods would be affected from taking time off work or doing more than just what they can do online. They don't have money to give. They don't have time to go out and protest. And yet, while these people are doing whatever they can online to take power away from these people who are not using their platforms to speak up about the lives of innocent people being brutally murdered and genocized, they are playing dress up for 75,000 plus dollars because of tables like $300,000. We have celebrities like Lizzo coming online saying, oh, celebrities don't hold all the power, you know, we can't do anything, but then we'll show up and perform for Biden's event. As if that's not backing a horse, I have donated money because I had the means to me and my wife do go out and protest because we have the free time to. My child knows that we don't eat at certain places anymore and he can't get a cake pop at a certain place or he can't get a hobby meal from a certain place all the time anymore because of the stuff going on overseas and he knows that there are people giving their money to other people who are harming children nor harming innocence. We are doing everything we can outside of this fucking app, but you can't even show your face. You're wrong and you're loud, just like all of the rest of them so wrong and so loud and we will be louder. I'm so happy that we are so all over your little for you page that it paces you off. That means we're actually making a difference and the word is getting out there. People please remember to keep blocking these celebrities. Please remember to keep calling your representatives. Please keep going to protests. These things are making a difference. It's not about being a hero. This is about humanity at its most basic level. Empathy, do you have any of that?

 As a veteran of the dating world, especially through online apps where I didn't meet my current partner, as well as now as an intimacy coach helping people day and navigate the dating world and relationships, I see this all of the time. When it's interesting because texting or having 24 hour access to somebody is a relatively new form of communication, I feel like because of this, our anxious attachments kind of fester in this world where we have this access to people at all time. My own personal experience with this happened to be when I was dating. When I first came out as gay, I met a girl that I actually genuinely really liked. I worked a lot and I was a single mom at the time. And I made it abundantly clear when we started dating that I just did not have a lot of access to time and for texting. But if I saw it, I would respond when I could and I would see her as often as I possibly could, which was like once or twice a week. Eventually how much I texted and how much I saw her was in enough and I had to let her know that we just weren't compatible. She wasn't asking for too much, but she was asking the wrong person. A lot of people on these dating apps put all their eggs in one basket way too soon. Sometimes before they even met anyone and end up doing things like this where this guy gets 78 text messages in a few hours just because he was at work. It's okay to have a different communication style than somebody else 100 percent. However, a lot of us ignore these signs that communication styles are completely different and don't cut things off when they should be. If you would like to learn more about my intimacy and confidence coaching and helping people learn to lust after life again, please check out my website and lustful. I do over the phone video calls where I consult and help people with their dating, their interpersonal relationships as well as just interconfident. And maybe help you get from someone who does send those 78 text messages to someone who's a little bit more secure in their attachment and finding the right person for them. Because again, you might not be asking for too much, you could just be asking the wrong person and I'd love to help you navigate that.

 My mutual post-abiz and as a mattress actress myself, I just had to highlight some of the messages that I get because they're amazing You can pause to read at the end, but I just wanted to say there's people talking about how they've never seen their Representation of a butch and found dynamic like they're there are also people that find it healing and have said that they've learned They can be intimate and intentional while also still being carnivorous and devouring their partner and then there are these Sweet guys who will come in and be like is it okay that I'm here because like I know you're lesbian Want to make sure you're comfortable and I really appreciate that. I think I've built and fostered a really great community of people I think everyone's welcome of any gender or orientation I think anyone can benefit from healthy intimacy representation as well as the blogs that I write that go along with each video I post two times a week almost if you want to follow the blog and join the community you can find me on Instagram I got so lucky with the kind of messages I get here.

 Because the gagg is that the end of the day, we're not going to be able to be a woman. I see you right through you because the call is coming from inside of the glass house that has been sprayed with windex and right with a microfiber cloth. You're not going to be able to be tea. You're not going to be able to be soft and you're not going to be able to be a woman. And when you finally realize that all the people that you're trying to please aren't going to accept you for who you are, maybe you will actually realize who you are. And that's a trans woman because I mean you build your whole personality around tearing them down. That's obviously what you want to be. You will never be that and you will never be a black woman or anything around surrounding black. You're just not going to be that. I'm sorry and I hope this helps.

 Hey, a trans man here and member of the gay council. Not only can you lie to men, you actively should lie to men whenever you get the opportunity to. Especially if it has something to do with, I can be your boyfriend or you know something stupid like that. They need it and deserve it.

Video: @uvradical_video_7366358017354337579-Scene-001.mp4
 Okay, respectfully this is why I don't like straight people using queer terms like I have people in college You're like that's exactly what it means
----------------------------------------

Video: @uvradical_video_7366358017354337579-Scene-002.mp4
 I think one of the reasons people get this so confused and are so wrong. There are multiple reasons, but I think the main one is because they're applying like a heterosexual framework to queer relationships. And the fact of the matter is like you just can't. They're not straight, so you can't do things in a straight way. So, pillow princess is part of a dynamic that is inherently queer. The other half of that dynamic is a stone top. A stone refers to someone who doesn't really like to be touched. And I have some experience with this. I am a trans guy, and there are parts of my body that I feel kind of dysphoric about. And I don't like to have them touched. And when you have parts of yourself that you don't like to have touched, a pillow princess is a godset because there's a person that you can touch and give pleasure to. And they are giving you lots of verbal and physical feedback about the pleasure they are receiving and how great of a job you're doing. And you don't have to worry about your body and your own body issues. You can just focus on them and the good time they're having. And you can experience that pleasure from giving someone a good time. Well, I think if you're a straight person, it can be kind of hard to understand these terms because there's a bunch of other stuff going on in the background. Anyway, pre-the princesses don't just lie there. They are definitely active members who are actively participating, just not in the way that you might traditionally think of it.

 So go watch that person's video and full because they're much more funny talented and beautiful than I am And they have more viewers than I am so what they say matters more truly, but I just wanted to add my two cents in Because I got a wild hair at my ass and decided I want to say something but that bitch that Said that you couldn't be a trans woman if you identified as a gay man before Is weird on so many levels and she? Like picked out some of it in her video her she said that she is never personally met a straight man that converted to converted To Trans like became a trans woman And I personally haven't seen that either but I have seen gay men that became lesbians and the reason for that is because when people Identify as a gay man and they're truly a trans woman It's because they see any form of them liking femininity as gay it's social consistent conditioning to see feminine traits in men as gay So if you want to be a woman that means you must be gay and for them to say that if you were a gay man before you Transitioned that you are not a woman is the stupidest thing to say if you have a basic understanding of societal attitudes towards gay people and trans people and femininity in general And like it happened to me Like I identified as a gay man from the age of 9.2 I want to say 12. I then started transitioning at 13 and between 13 and 16 is when I truly found my sexuality and now I'm And now I'm bisexual and I barely like men like I Barely like men if it wasn't for femboys haunting my nightmares I would probably be lesbian So It's I don't know she's just stupid she's stupid go watch the other person's video. They make a great point See you in another three months when I get a hair up by ass

 As an autistic person who had to exist in a world where kids weren't taught about other kids that were not like themselves if the children were white straight, you know, they're summately, you know, all of those things not disabled. They didn't understand anything outside of their bubble because they weren't being educated about it by their parents by basically anything. And so kids started to bully other kids. And it got really out of control and in my school district, which is small, and only has about three school, three public schools in it for high school students. They're, and the four years span I went to high school, there were 12 suicides and suicide attempts. And that's the ones that I know about. I'm sure there were so many more that were just not talked about in my town. But, and these were like very intense situations that happened and a lot of it had to do with kids getting severely bullied for being who they were. I lived in a city that is 45 minutes away from San Francisco. I live in California. Yeah, I bet you didn't think that when I said what I said. You thought, oh, maybe she lives in a conservative place. No, I didn't. There was a degree of diversity where I grew up. But kids were still bullied for being gay and they were still bullied for being disabled and they were still bullied for being a different race than white. I know my blow your mind. It happens literally everywhere and it happens aggressively everywhere. And there's a reason that the new generation of parents are trying to say like how about let's just teach people that other people exist like miss Dylan Mulvaney. And how she is just existing and maybe singing a song. I don't think she's going to try to tell your kids to be gay man. I think she's just trying to tell you like, hey, I exist. And also there are many other people around you like me that exist. And maybe don't judge them. You know, like what would hurt if children would just not judge other children, you know, what would it, what would it hurt. And at the end of the day, if you actually think because a trans person is involved with the child creator and that that's somehow indoctrinating your children, you're the problem. Not trying to turn your kids gay. Stop it.

 Now you're getting condescending and that's going to irritate me in one hell of a big goddamn hurry. And I get real God damn tired of people like you trying to tell people like me that we're just making this all about being LGBT. I wish I had that luxury. I had to leave my home state because of the political situation. There are states that want to arrest people over a bathroom. At my last job, the director of my department out of me is trans to the entire department before I started my first day. After promising me he wouldn't say anything to anybody. And since evangelicals want to make everything about their goddamn religion, you can take that and shut where the sun don't shine. You've also just admitted to being a single issue voter which irritates me no matter which side you're on. I hate to tell you this man, but fossil fuels are killing this planet. I used to think exactly the way you do so please don't sit here and tell me that I don't know. I am autistic and meteorology happens to be one of my special interests. You can take this for what it's worth you can write it on your shoulder. Showing up and preaching to a bunch of LGBT people who have been through absolute hell will get you nowhere. You're moved.

 You know, I find a real unrest in that you'll spend all day young at my friend, but you won't say one fucking word to me And I think we both know why Challenge accepted Nearly 40% of trans use in the United States live in states that have passed bans on gender-refirming care That's 24 states Three of those states are currently considering bans on gender-refirming care all the way up to age 26 While Florida wants to ban it permanently for everyone Last year alone more than 500 anti-LGBTQ bills were considered across the country 75 of them became law and we are not just talking about bans on gender-refirming care either bans on using bathrooms Multiple bans on any kind of LGBTQ related lessons in the classroom at all ever bans on allowing teachers to use a student's preferred name and pronouns bans on participation sports And it's only getting worse this year But see you'll excuse all of that as being protected for children When it's an issue you don't know shit about and don't you dare tokenize your LGBT kids again I will tell you exactly where to shove it all Of this is going on with certain Republican legislators defending child marriage by saying the government should be staying out of people's Lives no shit Sherlock.

 Alright, call me naive, but I had no idea there were actually people out there. Members of our community, gatekeeping what being trans is, like it's some kind of test. Like if you don't get all of the optional stuff, then you're not trans. That's wild to me. The only thing that makes a person not trans is being cis. Take me, for example. I've been on hormones now for nine months or something, and the hormones have fixed my dysphoria. Isn't that the point that you look in the mirror and you feel good that you feel comfortable in your own skin? Like, haven't I achieved what I set out to do with my transition? I look good, I feel good. It's changed my mood, it's changed so much about me for the better. Great. Fixed. Right? Like, gender affirming care saves lives, and everything else is extra, it's optional. If you need more stuff to make you feel happy, to make you feel right in your own skin, like voice training, like certain surgeries, great, more power to you. I hope you can be happy, but I'm good, and I don't think that only being on hormones, the hormones that have saved my life as a trans person, makes me any less trends. It's wild, if I get voice training, that's something I choose to do, but I don't have to. Like, my voice doesn't really give me dysphoria, it's just upsetting if I get misgendered when I'm on the phone to someone or something, but it's not a big deal. I don't hate my voice, and I don't like surgery, I'm not made of money, I can't afford all these surgeries that I don't need when I look in the mirror. I don't think, oh, chin wrong, nose wrong, forehead wrong, some people do, and those people can be trans or cis, people get surgeries if they think it'll make them feel more comfortable, but it's optional stuff, I had no idea that there were things that make you trans and things that don't, and if you don't go far enough with this stuff, then you're not transgender, are we joking? I'm a very, very happy trans woman on her hormones feeling great, isn't that enough? I mean now! What is wrong with our community if there are people gatekeeping like this? No, no, not there for that, not, not having her.

 Strong disagree, let's do some gay science. So I've never seen a twink who doesn't have something extraordinary about them. And by and largely are academically very gifted. But let's try and figure this out. So I would agree that the twink persona, the TP, it doesn't include, you know, dumb. It has a legally ball-on-esque thing about it. But this is where I think things diverge. I think this persona, then entering this culture, happens after they have gone through school, after they have gone through everything. So they end up being bullied. Right. And they end up going through bad things before the twink persona. And what do people who are bullied to? They sit in their room. And what happens when you sit in your room? You learn, chit. And so this is the theory I have for why twink will have an inexplicable skill that no one knows about. Or why they have a series of random things that they know how to do, that there is no explaining. And this goes to my greater thesis of the peak of this example is the drag queens. Because they know how to do everything. Ever talk to a drag queen, they're very intelligent. So yeah, I think the twink persona expects you to be dumb. But prior to getting the twink persona, because you're gay, you sit in your room alone, you learn a lot of shit. And then once you're in twink persona, there are other expectations. You have to learn how to dress. You have to learn how to do your face, whatever. That you put those skills to use furthering them. And then we knew we hit twink death around 20 or 21. You have to bring back the other skills. And that leads to the final goal of drag.

 I'm going to begin. There's so many points to him. First off, the people of this land, the native people to this land, the people of color, like our natural state is love. That's our natural way of being. So the fact that we're even going to be in the community, we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in the community. So we're going to be in deep, deep, complex layers of this history within us and solving different emotions and things. It's like no wonder so many of our people are like on drugs or, you know, I'm saying alcohol or anger issues or anxiety depression bipolar disorder. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. Like the psyche, our psyches are going insane right now. So I do agree with her like in order to save yourself. And because I what I have to say, my guy, I'm so surprised and sanity and all this shit is. We'll rip everything out. Everything that they taught you, everything that you were told in life, consider yourself to be a baby, a walking baby. Okay. You don't know anything and relearn it all from scratch and actually learn the truth and try to like heal yourself from America's shit is absolutely insane.

 Can I graduate in 2020 in social media, you'll see where I was. So I can just imagine how it is four years later, baby. Like with the bullying and stuff online, right? And now that I'm wiser, like I'm 21 now, the whole exposed to each other. That's nasty. That's foul. That's in the fact that his key is doing it to kids. It's like, bro, you really putting naked bodies on line and y'all are not even of age like that is that's traumatizing. Like no one should have to go through that. Like everybody's just seeing you like, bro, that's messed up. Mail or female, bro. So I already know social media is having a huge negative impact. Cause it's not supposed to be necessarily for them at that age. Yet like they're still developing figuring out who they are. I feel like you know, social media is more for you after you've like developed and figured out things like that. And if anything, maybe like for a social experiment or for like an experiment or something like in class, but like to be on here, just to be on here without any real reason. And now it's just not, it's just too much on here. Like you have to already have a developed psyche. Otherwise, babe, you're going to be everywhere on here.

 I just saw a shout out to him for even allowing people to be able to still stitch this shit Because I know sometimes with conversations like this sometimes people shed the shit down Which is fair because this is a shaky conversation in my opinions a little bit of like everywhere But I see where he's coming from as far as like they don't need to have that on sesame street Like we don't need to know whether or not Elmo likes girls or boys like no one at that age to be Were you about kissing or anything in that sexual manner? I feel like Now with the case of Billy coming on there with the clothes that he has I don't feel like Billy Close our form of expression. I'm somebody that loves art. I love fashion I love everything that has to do with creativity and when it comes to Close clothes don't have a sexuality that they don't have a gender. We are the entities that give it that like Billy coming on there would address and some heels on if kids ask you Why does that man have on though that dress in those heels? You feel me if you if it bothers you to tell the kid that that is a form of self-expression and that is the way that he chooses to express himself I don't think you write for that one bro. I don't think you write for that because it's not fair You can't tell so you can't like that's messing with the kids psyche because When they go and meet somebody later on in life and what if they like them? But now in their subconscious mind they have In their head that oh, it's well not even in a romantic type of way But what if they like them enough from the tonics type of way? But now you know what I'm saying they have that in their head that they're not supposed to like them because well I want to even say they're not supposed to like them But they're not supposed to like the way that they dress and the things that they do it They feel like it's wrong and they should be adjusting it right because that's their friend and if they care I should tell their friend the right thing like it just it just starts a whole spiral of just fucked upness If y'all get what I'm but I like I said, I do agree with him and when he's seen to a certain extent because I feel like Why are y'all even talking about anything to do with relationships whether gay or straight when it comes to kids? Why are we talking about? But I don't know other other other hand I do feel like I don't think he's a self-hating gay I feel like y'all should chill on that poor. I do feel like I don't know because I seen another video What he was talking about he would never want his son to experience what he went through as a gay man And I know being a gay man especially a gay man of color Shit can get rocky. You know what I'm saying like they're probably the one person the one the people that I will put next to Me as being a woman of color and gay like I will put them next to me like they really kind of get what you go through as being In a minority group like that like because you don't get respected you don't get respected And I feel like whether you own the male side or the female side, you know what I'm saying if you gay and A person of color you didn't want to say it's just To a stock or double wing sometimes tell sometimes because we isn't 2024. You know I'm saying But racism in Sexism and every other fucking isism is still prevalent. So

But I also have to be f**king realistic here. Like if I want to compete in the world, this is the game. This is what I live in. I need to f**king pick it up. You didn't want to say, but the way that those stimulants make me feel, it like pushes on my sympathetic nervous system. It's like the nerves in my spine, in my back, throughout my entire body are agitated. They're annoyed, they're in pain. It's like literally like sometimes a force is annoying them, bro. When every time I take that medicine, it makes me more aggravated. My mind is a little like, all for a little bit. Like I can focus and I can get things done, but it's like I'm feeling shaky, I'm weak. I don't want to eat anything. And then that just makes me feel even more just disgusting. If I try to lay down and go to sleep, oh, that's hell. That's hell. Which is why I see why people don't want to say like drugs and I do not f**k with like pharmacies and stuff like that. Because pharmacies, everything that they're doing in there, all those pills and powders that they're making is just taking mother nature. Stuff that you, normal heartages, should we get from mother nature? They're figuring out how to like make it unnaturally and still have the same effects, which is never going to have the same effects of mother nature so that they can make it such a large global level, if that makes sense. And it feels like it f**king feels like and my body can tell it's like a fake acid fettic acid. So I've been trying to naturally find my way, like what is it that these drugs are mimicking like in nature for real. So if anybody could f**king tell me that, like let me know, bro, like a natural stimulant that isn't going to like come with that many side effects because that medicine is just ass, but I know that I definitely got to speak to stuff. I've been doing like little things like reprogramming my brand shit like that and I've been taking like DHA EPA all these different lights on vitamins and then I've switched over to the liquids which is getting better like I can say I'm getting better with like my memory and my how fast like my neurons are firing like me being able to process things and then you know have a reaction back so it's getting better but it's like if I can find more stuff that'll be beautiful

 Yeah, that shit is serious baby. It's gotten to the point where it's happening for me like, honey, it's like every other day, every other couple of weeks, it's happening so fast, so rapidly, but to be fair, it's a lot that I had to like, debunk it, I didn't realize that, especially when it comes to my parents, like I really thought the way they were doing things was proper, and then I thought like I was gonna be able to like, help them and save them, and that's another realization I'm having, like I don't really got to leave another focus with it, and I'm like, no, because I knew they was like, let me feel like I'm gonna be a gas site in me and shit like that, but I'm like, you know, they just don't know, they just don't get it, it's not processing in their brain. Like it's like, no, because they don't want it to process their brain. That shit is mind-boggling to me, but yeah, man, I'm having them about a resilient and it's like, yeah, sometimes, I don't know. Again, people have like my spirit guys, because they keep me on point baby, because it really can go sideways, it can, you can be cool and then not be cool.

 Cuz I got time today. I'm 21. I don't do it babe. Like the phones are absolutely insane. Like if you really sit here and take a second to think about it. Like from the text into the dinghings like all of it irks me babes, it irks the fuck. If you really wanted to come and see me. If you really needed me to have it, if you really had something to get in there, you would come and see me. You'll be knocking on that goddamn door. Other than that. No, I feel like that's where things in life can get a little slippery. Like when you always on this phone, like every time it ding, you look at an notification. You hop it on the app. You go in there. Like it's just, and then texting just y'all too comfortable with it. Y'all just too comfortable with it. We're gonna be talking about nothing because there's nothing to talk about. Like before phones, if you ask something to talk about, you just want to talk to that person. You wasn't want to walk it up, see you all free and ask them what they do in every five seconds. I just think about how we're supposed to like naturally work and like the way they got intended our brains to fucking work. And I don't see where a phone and all these dinghings and all these notifications and all these callings and checking to make sure somebody called or what the fuck ever I also had that factors in, baby. Like I'll be creative. Go read a book. You ain't even got to do that basic shit. Just go touch a butterfly or something like being tuned with yourself and your surroundings like these phones, they got us by the ass and it needs to, it needs to.

Look this extreme highlight which to be fair Okay, the house hope that I was raised in was HD Double hockey sticks. It was rough in there But like I had to be able to place where I could be fully accepted and fully me where I could be gay and like we could have fun and there was no rules and like There was no like reality pretty much the way that you live in the spiritual realm as like a free hybrid Hi vibrating name was how they were doing I had like you couldn't tell me nothing Maybe like the laws of this reality weren't even really mine and I to this day to this very day I have to like now that I'm wise there is a little bit more easier for me to not do it as much and I can be aware of what I'm doing and Bring myself to reality let myself know that that's not a real place You know, I mean there's art real people all these films and emotions are your things that you bring up in your But I can't one thing I can do is write a movie and a play a scene to a song like it's nothing Okay, like it's nothing like I can act out every single character So you get some really good like it traits and skill from if you learn how to monitor

 Okay, I have 23.5 followers. If each one of you were to go to Jen's page to the L-I-N-K and the beat I-O and donate $1, you could help her family out substantially for who knows how them. This is part of the reason that I'm no longer following celebrities with few exceptions. They're very few. They have to have shown a pattern of positive behavior and speaking about really important things for me to continue following them. Met Gala. Paying how much money to go to something like that when you got families out here who were struggling to survive in serious situations. So if you're an ally to LGBT plus people, there you go, there's something you can do. You can make a huge difference in a family who is struggling to survive when a loved one is dealing with cancer and we all know how hard that is. I hope y'all do. I think if you're following me, you get it. I have to wait until I pay a check and then I'm going to donate. And it's, I'm not going to tell you what to do very often but I will in this video. One dollar. It's not much. It's less than the cost of a cup of coffee from certain places with a better outcome, I think. So yeah, if you enjoy my content and you would like to tip me, this is how I want you to tip me. That's it. All right, I love y'all.

----------------------------------------

Video: @wutdafox_video_7370752325167746346-Scene-002.mp4
 All right, so I want to just fix this for a while because when I heard it, I just like was profoundly taken back. I like I was one of those statements. I was just like Yeah, okay. I like for a long time like there's been such a historical issue with with femininity and women in general and you know this topic is specifically about femininity. So I'm gonna keep it to that Let's you know, I'm not gonna skip over. I am gonna take a second to say there has been so much of a plight against women throughout our entire human historical Timeline, which is just absurd considering that like women are what give us birth. There's been zero men Zero men in belight biological history that have ever given us a child So we yet we commonly disrespect women just baffling But you know back to topic on femininity, you know, I grew up With a father who gave kind of poor advice sometimes. So I would often turn to my mother or my sister To get advice and then I had in in result of getting advice that way and accommodate a Customing myself to interaction with women. I then started having more female friends more queer feminine friends who I would also get advice from and You know, I year over a year time over time here about how people treat these people poorly and then You know as I come into my own gender and my own Identity as I start to accept my feminine anymore People just lose it when it comes to the idea of a man not being masculine 24-7 it doesn't really make sense It doesn't make sense that masculinity can be so fragile That if I don't have enough of it someone's gonna try to take it away from me or tell me I'm not masculine or tell me I'm a real man Even though they don't know what a real man really is And I want to say like don't get me wrong like I am masculine I definitely have my days where I you know, I rock this beard it gets longer I wear my suits and all that but I Don't understand the concept of having to be one or the other and having one be worse than the other Or flawed or bad in any way. I just don't understand why we can't get out of our stupid bubbles long enough to see the benefit of becoming a fully balanced human And that doesn't mean people have to express their gender in different ways or their identity even but accepting The different portions of ourselves is like the key to healing So I don't really know why this is such an issue. It is I'll always be here to fight for you all and myself Peace take care of yourselves go femininity

I honestly couldn't tell you I don't remember if they allowed it or not but it's just wild to me that in 2015 I had to ask permission to bring a female to prom with me and be careful guys because that's where we're headed again so

 What is the longest you have gone without getting an oil change? Me personally?
----------------------------------------

Video: @yodaddyseth_video_7373060605877488926-Scene-002.mp4
 Okay, so this definitely is not about me, but I have a little story. So I'm the second child out of four. So I'm the middle child. My older brother, little backstory. My mom bought him his first car. I was like a 1998 Monte Carlo. But I went from this really sweet couple, like the husband was like an engineer or something, and the wife was a substitute teacher. Basically, they drove the car for fun. I bought a brand new N 1998. Had like 40 or 50,000 miles on it. Super, super low. Fast forward, they didn't buy me a car, skip me, bought my little brother a car. So whatever, well, my brother hated, actually hated to in-care this car. He thought it was the most ridiculous and he had to get an oil change. I'm like at this time, it was like 2016, 17, 18. Testos were really ramping up. They were really, really popular at this time. But they had it really only come out with that main, the four door, like sedan one, that was like $100,000 at one point, like brand new, like that's like all they have. So he would always be like, I really wanna, I wanna test, I shouldn't have to do this. Testos, you don't have to maintenance. Like he would just literally like a spoiled fucking brat. Granite wig, grab with nothing. So I don't know where this attitude came from. But he felt entitled enough to own a car, but not has to take care of it. So fast forward, my mom had to put a whole new engine in his car because he didn't get an oil change for a fucking year. And then he wanted to complain and be mad because his car was fucked up. Like he literally was like out of his voice, he said, I shouldn't have to get an oil change. A Tesla doesn't have to, what? Baby, you're not, you don't have a Tesla tax bracket. You're not in that same bracket. That's not where you're at in life right now. But yes, if you don't, if you don't get an oil change, your engine will go bad on you. And you have to replace it. So get your fucking oil change whenever you're supposed to. For real.

 It's your favorite gay sigh in this and Alison Allison. Why do you keep appearing on my page? Trust me, girl. Both of us would be happy if you did it. But, because I can't do it all, you're not since myself. I've decided to bring in someone from Israel. There's handsome someone to help. This is all marine. Cleaning man. Okay, handsome. And we watched your video. We have a lot of things to say about it. So let's get into it. First starters, she thinks that people like you and I are bigger danger to Jews than H group. No. No. No. No. You are the most... Exactly. Because you are tokenizing yourself within a movement that is fundamentally hostile to us. Not to mention the history of the Palestinians. It's made up. Our efforts straight up admitted that he made it up before the before. Like Israel became a state. There was no such thing as a Palestinian Arab. They called themselves some of them, called themselves South Syrians. Some of them were Egyptians. Some of them were what we would now refer to as Jordanians. But like the ones in Judean Samaria that you would call the West Bank. They don't have a whole lot in common with the ones in Gaza. The most... I forget exactly what the name is, but the most common name in Gaza, right? It's Egyptian. Because guess what? They're Egyptians. They're not some Palastia. They're not some Nogneu breed. They're not like some new ethnic identity. No, they're just straight up Egyptians. That's just what they are. But also not to mention, you know, you're completely... You actually, Allison, you're centering your own whiteness, I would argue, in this because you're completely not talking about the history of visratic communities across the Middle East who don't even give me the... Oh, they everyone got along before Israel. They did it. No, they did not. I can literally... I can post on this page a list of attacks against Jewish communities in the Middle East that occurred long before Herzl and the advent of modern Zionism. Like... It was never that... I mean, it was better than in Europe, but like anything was better than what was going on in Europe, or like... But what else did she say? Oh, she's saying that, you know, because she's upset that we're calling her a traitor. Do you think she's a traitor, honey? No, she's just too busy. Welcome to Israelis. They think... Well, that's funny about them. You should go to Gaza. Yeah. You should. I think I should... I think I should sit up and go fund me to pay for her flight, you know? Yeah. You should do it, girl. Like... I think they'll get you in open arms, you know? Open arms with guns, but open arms. Can't say that. You can say that. You can say that. Oh, open arms with... Pippews. Pippew. Yes, I'm just so confused. He's gonna be half... Seriously, Allison, you're like... Just hope that I seek yourself. And I don't get why. That's like... I don't get why she's doing it. Like... What do you hope to gain? I... Maybe... Maybe she just won... What am I on? I don't know what, I don't know. This is what we do to water villains in Israel, honey. Hahaha. Hahaha. So anyway, Allison, enjoy being an even bigger pick me than I am. And have the day to deserve, girl. Enjoy Gaza. That's about it. Excuse me.

 It's your favorite case, I honest, I would go to this filter and yeah, you see what this is called is the consequences of our actions. You know, when the people of Gaza shows to elect a T group, specifically H group, they were putting themselves and their families in danger because that can provoke a war in an urban environment. What happened today in Raffa was tragic, but it's H groups fault because what happened was when the Israeli missile struck a legitimate target. We had no way of knowing this. There were secondary weapons, storage is there that we had no idea about and that triggered a secondary explosion, which started a fire that unfortunately hit some of the refugee areas that is very sad. And like I said from one another, they'll be a full investigation and there will probably be someone punished over it. But this is urban warfare. Things have been, it's sad, but civilians die in war. And what won't help is you being a demi. I believe I'm pronouncing it right, my Arabic is not the best, but you willingly submitting yourself to, you know, being subservient to the non Jew. It's not a good luck. Neither is her that color, but the demi thing is really not a good luck.

 Yeah, I get it. It's hilarious. Everyone in 2020 was they theming all over the place and calling themselves non-binary. However, it's kind of a dangerous narrative to put out there that it's a bit of a fact. We know that non-binary people transgender people who existed for centuries personally in my experience. I met my first trans person in the 90s and his only since TikTok and social media kind of made it a thing that became one of the things. So it's kind of dangerous and let's not talk about things like that.

 I've seen it here 30 years old. No kids. The thing that I do is just shrug because you know what? It's my decision. It's my body and the older generation doesn't have to understand. They're not going to understand and I'm cool with it.

 Are there though? Like I understand what you're trying to do when I appreciate it, but sometimes Given the nature of the internet. It's worth it to question the premise of a question instead of just answering it And I'm gonna be a hundred percent honest, okay? As a queer person who has spent my entire life watching bigoted assholes do their best to equate homosexuality with things like incest, beach, theality, and pedophilia, this whole map phenomenon looks like a conservative psi up to me and I can't get the thought out of my head that it might be. I've always felt that way In any case the answer is no because children can't consent and I you know I feel like anyone with half a brain stem understands that I shouldn't have to explain it, but be careful with this kind of shit

 I had just come out. It was right after Thanksgiving and before Christmas and you might recall it was because I'd been writing a book and my parents kept asking to read it and so I had to come out to them to explain that it was a bisexual fantasy. I didn't want to tell it. And I lost everything for a book that I thought I was just going to digitally publish on Amazon and maybe four people would read and it was really just for me. I wrote it for an audience of one. I wrote the book. I always wanted to see myself in. At the time I didn't have this online community that I have now and for no reason at all, you turn this book that four people were supposed to see into a bestseller. I have no publishing house, no agent. You did this. And today is its birthday. Happy birthday. The night that's moon.

 Look, I know y'all meant well in this video and in the comments, but Jesslin uses Day Them pronouns and we should respect that. Also, it's 2024 y'all. We should not be assuming people's genders based off what they look like. Anyways, thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

 This is so spot on though. I've got this distant relative I never see in once many years ago I went to go visit her and she had this new boyfriend and the second he walked through the door He's like an old fat boomer big old neck beard not a whole lot of hair up top and he's like oh my god I'm so mad I just went to Taco Bell and there were two lesbians in there and they were kissing and you know what they weren't even hot And then he walked upstairs and I've never seen him again ever in my life Obviously it didn't work out. Thank God for that

 Being the gay guy friend in a girlfriend group, the expectations of you are always different than the other friends in a group. And it's like, bitch, I'm not your man. I'm your friend.
