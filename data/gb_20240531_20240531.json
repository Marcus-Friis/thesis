    "voice_to_text": "Each group didn't suddenly make it appropriate for my age group. I was at MCM this past weekend. I saw a lot of. Hello. This is my first time ever making a stitch, so I do apologize if I speak bad. Um, but yeah, please go check out Addie's video. It's super, super, super important if you're a parent, um, or if you're just someone who is under 18, um, and watches Husband Hotel. Like Addie was saying in that video, they attended MCM. I attended MCM last weekend as well, and I did two Husband Hotel cosplays on the Saturday. I was genderbend slash femme Alistair. Um, shout out to my mum, who made this. I know you're watching. Love you, mum. And then, of course, nifty for the Sunday. Now, I had a fantastic time at MCM. It was amazing seeing so many husband cosplayers. But first thing I wanna say is, is that I got approached by a lot of people who are very much obviously minors. And I'm not talking like 15, 14 year olds, I'm talking nine year olds, ten year olds with their parents. Now, these parents would ask for a photo of me with their child and would then compliment my cosplay, saying how much my Alistair looked great. So they know the show, they know who I'm cosplaying. It got to the point where I was starting to feel a little bit uncomfortable and I was gonna start declining pictures. Pictures from Parents with their children. But of course, I'm a people pleaser and I don't like to disappoint people, so. But, yeah, I would have parents saying that, wow, we're big fans of the show, you look amazing. And I'm like, do you not realise what you're showing to your kid? My other thing that happened at con was that there were a lot of under. Under eighteens at the has been meets. At these husband meets as well, they would play the Husband Hotel soundtrack, which is fine and all, until it gets to songs like Loser Baby. And we all know that one lyric from Angel Dust and Loser Baby we know. And I can't tell you how uncomfortable I would feel when that. When they would sing those kind of lyrics. Uh, now, I'm not trying to gatekeep, I just want people to be safe at cons. Not only do I want minors to be safe, but also us adults to be safe. At the end of the day, I can't control what people watch. That's life. But parents, please be careful what you're showing to your children.",

In fact, I would say without British Muslims, the charitable states of this country would be in fucking dire states, let's be quite fair. But we know why the fruity Liberal eye gender is rolled out by people like Nigel Farage and Pierce Morgan. It's because they are puppets and their sockmasters want to push the entire British public against the Muslims because of the monstrous fucking things they're doing amongst that psychotic, genocidal nation. That's why now I won't mention them because I'm always getting fucking banned for it, but you know what I mean."

Is bloody flipping handstands and backflips like he's just chatting to his parents. Look how relaxed he look like, bro, he'd be breathing and they're gonna be like, oh, my God, look how much.

    "voice_to_text": "I'm sorry, but I've never met a girl with a boyfriend who's actually looking for friends. Please watch the video of the lovely lady of the stitch because she perfectly points out why there are sometimes issues with friendships between single and non single women. As a woman in a relationship, I have also had some of my other non single friends do similar things to me where we'll make a plan and suddenly our plan is non existent because their partner is acting up. Or they just wanna spend time with their partner. And sometimes they just don't tell you we're no longer chilling, they just don't message back. But honestly, I think the main issue has nothing to do with the fact that they're in a relationship. The issue is that they're too centered around their partner. Me and my boyfriend make active choices to ensure that we have lives outside of each other. I see him everyday, we live together and I love every single moment I spend with him. But I also have other people that I want to spend time with, like friends and family. That doesn't include him. The same way he has friends that he sees that I don't have to meet up with cause they're not my friends, they're his friends. And we also have mutual friends that we see together. We have been together for five years and we make it a point to develop lies outside of each other that Way this issue doesn't arise because I don't need to spend every waking moment with you like I don't. So I completely understand why some single women would feel a bit reserved in forming a relationship with someone who is in a romantic relationship. And luckily for me, making friends comes really easily for me because I am extroverted to the T unless I'm on my period. So generally, I've been. I've had no issues forming friendships with both single and non single women. So I just think you gotta find your girl.",

    "voice_to_text": "God bless America. And gentlemen, start. The reason why Donald Trump is so popular amongst so many millions of Americans is because he's an exception to the rule. He's against the establishment. He's his own man. And the fact that he is in his late 70s and still so virile and so strong, so potent and so acutely aware of the problems that the everyday common man faces in America is the reason why he is so celebrated among so many people. They see him as someone who can stand up to the establishment, to the elites and to those in power. They see him as a truth teller, someone who says it like it is, blunt, straightforward and straight talking. Now, he's far from perfect, and he has a lot of qualities that leave a lot to be desired, but nevertheless, the fact that he can stand up and be counted is what people respect and appreciate. Remember, he's a billionaire who doesn't need any of this. He could have stayed at home and lived his life without anyone ever knowing anything about him. Instead, he has faced immense scrutiny and he has done things wrong. But the problem here is not the fact that he's done things wrong. It's the hypocrisy in the way in which he is attacked and he is pursued by the law and others are let go. The people do not appreciate the law and the judiciary and the establishment turning a blind eye. When it comes to their own favorite candidates, and then attacking and going on the offensive when it comes to people like Donald Trump. So it seems that the more the establishment goes after him, the more popular he becomes among the people. This is the classic case of the gladiator rising up to the emperor, and the emperor ultimately succumbing to the will of the people. Like him or hate him, Donald Trump is a misnomer. He's an anomaly. He's an exception to the rule. He's a trailblazer, and he's a fire brand, individual, and leader who millions of people respect and appreciate. In the end, it comes down to a vote. It comes down to democracy, and it comes down to the will of the people whom they want in power. I've never liked Joe Biden. I've always been suspicious of him. I've always known that he is corrupt and corruptible. He has always voted for war. In the 50 years that he's been in power, that he's held positions of power. And I do not favour a candidate like Joe, who is essentially part of the establishment, and there to serve the rich and powerful at the very least. Donald Trump does not need anyone else's power, wealth or authority. He has his own.",

She went and dared me to. I dared you to? You dared me to? She said that I was scared, so she dared me. So then it's your fault. Wait a minute. You hadn't done turn, you would let the harp alone. We wouldn't be in trouble. In the first place, she raised the bees in the first place. The first place. She raised the bees in the first place. It's your fault. You're responsible.

I couldn't see them because I wasn't eligible to bid on them I searched for them I found them and- let me catch my breath and try to stay calm there are currently five - I wanna say five could be four - accessible properties available to be bidded on in my area but I can't bid on them because I am younger than 55 years old it's not even 45 it's 55 on one of them and it's 60 for the rest and I'm just- are young people not disabled too? are young people not disabled too? and needing somewhere to live too? do you know what I mean? it's just- oh I do just feel so left out sometimes and so excluded sometimes as a younger person with a disability and I get it like the older you are the more likely you are to develop a disability due to the things that come with aging it's understandable that they should be catered to more than people my age as disabled people in the older age group make up I think 40% of their age group whereas people in my age group we make up 25% - sorry disabled people in my age group make up 25% um on average, of my age group. if you're a disabled woman um of my age group uh it's probably 26% I think? I feel like I didn't phrase any of that correctly so I hope you understand what I'm saying so I get it why they should be catered to more than someone my age but that doesn't mean I shouldn't be catered to at all! I'm band 1 do you know how hard it is to get band one on the council house and register? I'm so incredibly lucky to be band 1 yet I am still waiting for a property to become available and meanwhile there are properties that would be suitable for me that are available but I'm not allowed because I'm too young and it's just so frustrating it's so frustrating I'm not trying to say I deserve it more they deserve it less I'm just frustrated I hope that that's understandable this is very much coming from a place of frustration, of just- I'm so exhausted living here where it is not accessible for me it takes so much energy to live here that I could- I would rather spend that energy *notif sound* sorry I would rather spend that energy looking for work or holding a job but I just don't have it to spare. peace sign with my hands because slay but ironically and I overuse the word and I should stop saying it so yeah if anyone's got any tips or advice I would very greatly appreciate it um unfortunately it seems like the best course of action for me right now is to just wait and keep checking the register and keep checking and yeah I just I'm fed up I'm so fed up I think what it is actually is the exclusion um that I feel a lot as a disabled person in this country I do feel very excluded from most things because of being disabled not because of my disabilities holding me back from things but because of ableism not making the space for people like me but that's a topic for another day and as this is a stitch I bet that the visuals have desynced from the sound so I do apologize for that and I'm just gonna leave a little bit of empty space at the end here for it to catch up and hopefully that should help I don't know okay take care bye haha",

    "voice_to_text": "Welcome. Thank you for having me. So this is the German leader meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu. He's treating Benjamin Netanyahu as if they're close friends, as if they have a warm, cordial relationship. The hypocrisy of Germany's political class, unlike the German people, is palpable. They seem to have dug their heels and dig in a deeper hole for themselves when it comes to the way in which they reserve a very warm place for people like Benjamin Netanyahu. In spite of all the atrocities that he's committed against the people of Gaza. Germany's ruling class finds itself in an incredibly awkward position, to say the least. They know full well that it was Germany where all this started and that it is Germany where all this might end. There are some very serious questions to be asked of the German elites and the German political class. First and foremost amongst them, why is it that they have decided to ban any kind of conference on Gaza? Why is it that they've decided that no doctors can access Germany to talk about Gaza and the plight of the people over in Gaza? Why is it that they have decided to clamp down heavily and brutally on protesters in Germany protesting for peace and ceasefire? These are important and difficult questions for Germany to grapple with. And the answer may lie in the fact that it was in Germany where 6 million Jewish people were massacred. It was Germany that decided that They no longer wanted the survivors back, that they wanted them far away, in a land called Palestine, out of sight and out of mind. And so, in many ways, it is Germany's legacy that is LED to the Palestinian people suffering in the way that they do and the Jewish people being trapped in Israel in the way that they are. The question is, will Germany's leaders be able to step up to the plate and stand up to Benjamin Netanyahu and his army of genocide? Will they be able to rise up and speak up for the Palestinian people and to finally play a more neutral, equal and fair role in this entire painful saga?"

But it is not a Japanese throwing flapjack. And even if it was a Japanese throwing flabjack, then the issue would lie with the little cunt that threw it and not the man in the, in the fucking kitchen at the school with the cookie cutter. Why have they banned a triangular flapjack? And now they've only given it an excuse to double the price because essentially now you got two fucking triangles.

Let's first of all talk about my second pregnancy where I did find out the gender. So I was gonna from a 20 week scan, I had like a nervous excited tummy thinking, oh, I wonder what it's gonna be. And went in find out it was a girl. Had like we happy tears. It was lovely. I felt like I was able to bond with my baby. Not saying you have to know to find to be able to bond with your baby, but I felt like I bonded better known that she was a little girl, been able to call her Olivia, been able to give her her name. I really love that experience and would 100% do it again. Now let's go back to my first pregnancy where I didn't know the gender. Imagine the sin. Imagine you've been at nine months wanting to know, but everybody telling you, no, you need to keep it a secret. So you keep it a secret. You don't know what you're having is driving you insane. You wanna buy clothes, you can't buy clothes. You wanna name the baby, you can't name the baby, you wanna call it its name, you can't call it its name. So driving absolutely insane. Then you go in and you be in 12+ hours of labour. I think I was in just and. And the induction back for 12 hours, then I went into labour. Then I had another 12 hours of actually being in labour and then the midwives changed over just before I started to push. So the night shift nurse came in. She didn't know that I didn't know the gender of the baby. Um, she end up being the midwife that delivered the baby. And I think when I posteroid, I expect that like a Lion King moment, like, ah, it's a girl! And I would be like, oh my goodness, it's a girl! And it would have been all so lovely. It doesn't happen like that in real life. What really happened was the midwife said, or I looked at the midwife, she looked at me, I looked at her and I said, what is that? And she said, you tell me. And I was like, I have just been in labor for 12 hours, I can hardly lift my head off this pillow. Please just tell me what it is. And I said to her, I can't say, tell me what it is. And she said, no, you look, you have a way. Look at tell me. And I was like, just tell me if it's a boy or a girl, I need to know. And then she said, it's a wee girl. And that was it. So anti climatic. Would never do it that way. Again, my husband always said he still wanted a surprise. Even with the second. I was like nope, no surprises. I am finding out 100% cause that was not what I imagined it would be. So there, that is my take on it.",

Hi, uh, I am one of those children who got moved around like you just said. Uh, I spent the ages between about 3 and twelve travelling around the Mediterranean and then later like the Caribbean and into like America, the US. So this is how I sound now after living in the UK, specifically Devon, for about 10 years. Uh, but before that I had just moved back from the States, so I had this accent. I actually sounded like this. This is my natural accent. I have to put it on a bit now because it's been 10 years since I actually sounded like this. But it's really, really natural and it comes really easily. But I got bullied for it at school. So back to your study more RP sounding thing. But my accent isn't quite that posh. I'm putting on a bit now. But. But I had a whole bunch of accents growing up, and about half of it was from my parents and then yes, from my peers. I spend a lot of time with French people, so I had more accents in French than I did in English. But I probably still pronounce some of my words really weirdly if you like a linguist person, because I probably pronounce them the French way, ha ha than the English one. Cause I learnt French alongside English. Uh, I had a Greek accent for a while because I went to school in Greece for a few months. I was mostly homeschooled, so I didn't really pick up native accents and, like, international school stuff. But my accent fascinates me because I don't know where all of it has come from. I really don't. I work in Wales now, and whenever I'm at work, like, talking to people, I do like, uh, hosting at an aquarium, and if someone comes in with a Welsh accent, I will have a Welsh accent for the duration of that conversation, and then I'll go back to English. If someone English comes in, it you pick up just the ability to change it on a dime. I have to be very careful around Texans, because for some reason, the Texas accent, I become the Texas accent. It's. Yeah, it's, it's fascinating. I, I love the way the accents work.",

Um, how it's gonna go is that as it comes to an end with the sat nav, your examiner's most probably just gonna come in and say something like, and this is what I used to say it would be, the sat nav's gonna be ending soon. That will be the end of the independent drive. I'll be directing you from here on in. Keep following the road ahead. And there's traffic signs tell you otherwise. Then the sat nav is maybe gonna come in once or twice and just say, you've now reached your destination on the left. You do not need to do anything. Just follow what the Examiner's just said. Keep following the road ahead unless traffic signs tell you otherwise. And they'll be directing you. Don't be one of those people that has to do weird, wonderful things.

For the young people and for people that care about young people out there, here's just a reminder that some university students got fined for partying in lockdown. 20+ thousand pound made news headlines. Yet our government had their own illegal parties with no consequences. One of our government members literally was breaking lockdown rules just to have an affair. Pair that with the fact that you've all basically been scammed because you've paid full price for university when you all got online university for two years. but tuition fees are going up and you've got longer to pay them back, so you gonna be paying off interest for the rest of your life. And now they want young people to do national service. Mandatory national service to pay due to the country for what? But this is why guys, it's so important for young people to go vote. Last time it was something silly like three point something. Million young people didn't vote. If you pair that with the fact that there's another four years worth of 18 year old that can now vote, that's a massive difference. So make sure you vote on July 4th.",

Now, there are many misinformed people out there who see someone like Hannah with a big following on a western stage and think that they are there solely because of their following. No, no, no. In 2,008, Hannah Lauder and I were in Oliver the musical together at the theatre all Drury Lane. Now, that was in 2,008. I don't know whether Hannah did anything that predates that, but she's a West End Wendy. She's been a working woman for over 15 years now. Just two tiktokers at the press night party. So before you come for people online saying you're only there not because you're talented, but because you got followers, do a little background check. Hannah Lava is a star and icon and hugely talented. I'm one of the hardest working people I know, so I don't know why I stitch this, but. Love you, Hannah.",

    "voice_to_text": "Omin, Enzo and Modri. Someone has finally said it. Someone has finally said it. These two are so underwhelming for the prices that they came to Chelsea on 88 million war reparations. On Makhilo Mudryk, who we were told last summer was the next hazard and he has been horrible. Honking. I have no words. Hundred and six million World Cup tax. On Enzo, who we were hearing is better than De Bruyne, but he's also been relatively underwhelming. As much as I'm enjoying the agendas, I have to disagree with this video to a certain extent. Where I agree here is that Mujik is just garbage. There's no saving him, there's no potential I see in him. He has zero redeeming qualities. He can't beat his man, he shoots his balls into Rosehead. There's no redeeming qualities about that guy. Now where I disagree is on Enzo. Has Enzo performed relatively underwhelming in relation to his price? Yes he has, but there's a class play in there. The only mistake Chelsea made when signing this guy didn't give him the key to the squad. Built a squad of bang average or inconsistent players around Enzo and thought he would prosper. Do not make me laugh. Put Enzo in a decent team where players compliment his play style, tactics compliment his play style and he will ball out. We saw it in Argentina, we saw it in Benfica. Why aren't we seeing it in Chelsea? These are the questions you must Ask yourself there's hope for Enzo, and call me crazy if you lack, but Enzo generally has a spot in the majority of midfields in Europe, whereas Modrik. There's just no hope for that brother. He's just garbage."

She's talking about. I think she's talking about triangles and how it's better to be in this particular trial, doing another trial deal. But I don't really understand what she's talking about. I don't think she understand what she's talking about. And we got a deal with the EU, which is an FDA. I don't know what FDA is. I would like to know what FDA is, but she's just always one of the terminologies. But I don't think she knows what she's talking about. And she's the business secretary or business minister or something. I think she also looks after toilets as well. I think that's a main concern though, is toilets. Then that's the problem. And Kemmy's been worrying about too much on the toilets and not enough on the business. So you know Kemmy. Yeah, well, to be honest, 5 weeks, love, you gonna be unemployed, so don't really matter, but, you know, thanks for that. Make no sense at all. At all. Ha ha!",

    "voice_to_text": "30 and all of a sudden you see, like, just a bunch of British men walking around. Okay, but you wanna know a real struggle? Let's talk about how people can perceive me as British when I'm travelling, and then how their personality completely changes when they found out that I'm not. Traveled the 40 countries. I love travelling, it's my favourite thing to do. I've been there a whole variety of countries and the similar occurrences happen time and time again. And it's actually at the point now where I'm like, no, it's clearly a trend. It happened to me in Bosnia, most recently in March when I was there for my birthday. I was like, buying a couple of souvenirs off this, like, chaos, man. He did not come across rent at all. He did not even look at my direction. He was just not interested. I was asking for help and he was kind of just pointing at something. Then he asked me, where you from? And I was like, oh, I'm from Ireland. When I tell you instantly, it was almost as if he was like Thorn stuff. He was like, take this, take that little gift you. What do you need? What do you want? Don't take the whole chaos. Just. Just take it with you. Yeah, I don't need it. I don't need it. His whole personality change. You almost see people's complete faces change towards you when you tell them, like, where you're From. And I think it's because they perceived you to be one thing which may not have the best, like, reputation across the world, compared to, like, nine times out of 10. I'm not saying there's some Irish arseholes out there, of course are. But, like, nine times out of 10, we're very friendly, just chat. We just don't really do much. I don't know, even as a Spanish and French speaker, because I speak English as, like, my main language, when you're having conversations about, they will refer to you as English only, and you have to, like, tell them, like, stop saying that. Like, I'm not English, I'm not. Like, it's a whole different thing. But when you're doing that, like, they change towards you. They're like, sorry, I forgot about that. Like, they lump us all together and then they have to differentiate between it. But, like, I've never once had a bad experience for being Irish, but I have had people treat me badly until they found out that I'm Irish because they thought I was a Brit.",

It's that they are very aware of how they're perceived and so don't get unreasonably mad at you for misgendering. If that trans person is mad at you for misgendering them, then it probably means you've done it multiple times after being corrected. Or you know them well enough to know better. Or both. Because correcting people on our pronouns is really dangerous for us. Like, we could literally be killed for doing that because people are transphobic, right? So a lot of trans people, even ones who pass and put an effort to passing, don't correct people on their pronouns because it's too dangerous for us. So no, this trans person doesn't exist. You're getting mad at an imaginary person. You're just fantasizing about being into misgender trans people.",

And there are some bakers who don't offer it because they feel they don't want to kind of encourage sort of people getting into debt.

All the 3 points. I can see what the 3 points to it. Cause as a business, you, you may wanna give your customers, um, more options, which in turn helps increase your income. But then it's like, what am I encouraging somebody to go into debt? And I don't know what other money issues they may have and do I wanna be part of that? And then it's like, actually, I'm a consumer, I can manage my money very well. You should be offering Klarna. And is it clear pay? Um, as somebody who a few years ago was in a bit of debt, I'm not in it anymore. Um, I. I wouldn't buy anything on, um, is it Klan or clear pay just because of my history. Because it's not just say, oh, I'd suddenly get into really lot of debt again, but it's just. It's just. I'm just talking from personal circumstances. But it's.

Um, it is, I think three months on from when we posted this video on our original account and nothing has really changed. Ah, I'm laughing cause if I don't laugh, I'm gonna cry. Um, we have pushed and pushed and pushed. We have done more lives, more hours on lives, more hours in general, more content, different content. And it's just not working out for us. There's no way of bringing this account back. I've spoken to specialists in analytics. I have had TikTok look into our analytics. We have Learned how to read the analytics. And after months of trying, we are now nearly a year on since this glitch and nothing is changing. So it is a very, very bitter pill to swallow. And a lot of you had reached out on the original video and said, start a new account. Can you start a new account? Why don't you? Here I am, girls. This is our new account. Um, I'm about to lose 20,000 followers on our original account, which is what's really difficult cause it took a lot for us to build that up. And TikTok is a completely different platform now from what it was when I first started. It was a lot easier to build followers. So I know it's gonna be a really tough road ahead of us, but I have 8 weeks now to turn This around before again? I don't know. Um, before I have to make the decision of staying in this unit or packing up my shit and going home to my mum's. And after a year of me not being there with all of this, I don't think she's gonna want me back. Girls. So this is our new account and we have about 100 and something followers. I would really love to build this back up. So if you love fashion, you love women's clothes, you regularly shop on TikTok shop, or you just feel sorry for me. Um, drop us a follow. We will be going live from this account ASAP. I will pop out some videos um, regarding when we will be going live. But I just wanted to tell you, this is the new account, girls. Um, fingers crossed. It's last chance alone. But like I said in the original video, I don't give up. I am a stubborn, stubborn girl. Um, and I refuse to give up. I put too much into this and serve my parents. I'm not giving up. Girls, help me out. Drop me a follow if you see me live. Hang around for a couple minutes, say hi. We can do this, girls. I'm adamant."

Especially with the fact that like, when you go see a band, they will be touring the most current album, and sometimes that current album isn't always the best. So you do have to go to a tour and see a lot of songs off a latest album that may not be for you. Now, 5 songs, to be honest, isn't that bad. Uh, I think the last time I saw placebo, they played almost something, something mad, like 12 songs off a 14 track album. So he pretty much played that whole album in full. No, no, um, is. It's okay, but god damn, 12 tracks? One thing I've, I've kind of noticed is, and this is just purely based on my opinion, is the more mid and album is, the more band likes to play songs from it. I don't know if that's like a sense of bitterness and a bit of resentment to the fans or. Fuck, you were playing this fucking album. I don't know if it's like trying to push it because it didn't sell as well. I, I don't know, but either Way. It. It kinda needs to stop."

With the world on fire and so many morons having the microphone right now, it is really hard to keep a straight face sometimes. You get the award for being the realist of the real. And I am now going to give some fake awards to zodiac signs for being the top 5 worst poker faces. Let's do it. Starting off strong with No.. 1. Of course, no one is surprised. Sagittarius. Sagittarius is the No.. 1 worst poker face of the zodiac. They literally have no filter. They're famous for it, and we love them for it. No. 2, Aries. Okay. No hesitation. No filter and no hesitation. They literally have no qualms about telling you exactly how they feel about what you're saying with their face, and they'll do it right away. You're not waiting for a reaction. It's immediate, it's quick, it's fast, it's speedy, it's honest. Love it. No. 3, Virgo. Need I say more? For obvious reasons. Obvious reasons. And No. 4, Capricorn. So Capricorn is, like, in a category of their own because they are really famous for having these, like, micro expressions. So it. So it's not that the whole face is. Is, you know, cringing. It's that just one eyebrow or just one nostril is flaring or just one curl of the lip, you know, just A little bit. Just so that we. We know. And that little bit is devastating. Devastating. Thank you, Capricorns. And last but not least, top 5. The fifth zodiac sign that has no poker face is Taurus. Because I have never met a person with strong Taurus placements who can sit in a meeting listening to an absolute idiot like this and not have judgment written all over their face. That is all. I hope you enjoy. Let me know in the comments if you wanna know best eye roll or maybe even best poker face.",

feet in terms of the NHS being refunded in terms of workers getting paid their fair dues and not having to go on strike to be able to pull out of a genocide all of these things require I'm afraid to say it everyone left leading policies and what labor is doing is getting rid of any person that has represented or has tried to represent or would represent and propose those left leading policies that we need they getting rid of every single one of them for anyone who thinks this is just about getting out the Tories right just getting rid of the Tories yeah that's one that's one that's one that's like the fundamental foundational like expectation of this general election it's almost an unwritten rule get the fucking Tories out but again let's examine that a little bit further we recognise that labor is getting rid of all of the people that would propose actual fundamental change that could benefit us a lot better than what labor is currently presenting then are we really getting rid of the Tories are we just rebranding them are we just gonna call them by a different name for all the things that that we have asked for in this country in the last 14 years labour on not proposing anything that could actually do that they're making minor changes here and there but they're not proposing anything that could actually do that nothing that could actually do that everything that we've cried about in the last and I say cried not in a condescending way but genuinely we cried out for it when when we asked our nurses to be paid better when we asked our conditions to be better when we asked to not have inflation and all of this shit right do you remember we had the opportunity to have someone who was going to actually put some measures in place to prevent all that shit from happening cause they knew it was gonna happen and they got kicked out because they presented actually some arguments that fundamentally would just pro Palestine that's it that's it they just had a pro Palestinian stance they got smeared and now here we are and every person in the Labour Party who probably is further aligned to that person some of you know exactly what I'm talking about I'm not gonna say their name only because I need you to listen I need you to stay with me here all the people that could propose anything close to what that person was going to do for us has been kicked out of the Labour Party and all of them centre centre left leftist whatever they've all gone so all of the people who actually would have policies that genuinely could get us back on our feet get our NHS back on our feet maybe pull out of a genocide maybe maybe you know support us in what is ridiculously difficult time have been kicked out of the party that we're all saying is gonna help us get rid of the Tories I wanna go on a rant about people who are saying oh the the green I'm gonna win cause no one's gonna vote for them are you gonna vote for them cause I fucking will I fucking will hundred percent I will that will be my vote I don't care I do not care I'm gonna put my vote where I want it to be not where I think it should be because of political games and blah blah blah blah I'm gonna vote that way that's the way I'm going labour are not going to fucking save us and I can guarantee you that I put money on it that they are not gonna help us out of the situation at all they're not can I guarantee that green will help us out of it I don't think that they'll be able to get us out of it in the time that they have but I think they'll be able to implement some policies that will demonstrate that they are taking us towards a route of betterment Labour not doing that not even that right now they're showing us that they actually have a counter measure to that we have watched the Tories infiltrate the Labour Party over the last what four six eight years I don't know so I want us to understand that the phrase out of the frying pan into the fire is a real thing and while I understand the foundational expectation of this general election is to get rid of the Tories let's make sure we get rid of all of the fucking Tories okay every last one of them not just the ones that call themselves Tories because I swear to god if Labour get voted in I will not be celebrating I will not be happy I will not be elated even if the toys are gone I will not be happy about it because it's not a good thing to celebrate we've got some dark uncertainty if Labour get in because of the behaviour and conduct they've shown us so far tells us they're not on our side either they're not on our side either I'm voting green I'm voting green nothing you can say will change my mind on that because again I recognise never mind my political stance to be honest with you I recognize what we've been doing for the last 14 years I recognize what the Labour Party have been doing for the last couple of years and neither of them share policies to tell me that they are actually gonna make our lives any better so to me and I will say it like this quite brazenly don't even think it's a political stance thing I think it's a fucking common sense thing that's what I think it is so I'll leave that with you you think about it as well",

This is day 9 of the legendary campaign for Sunak to not get himself elected as Prime Minister again. Today we're talking about his peloton. Now, peloton has what is called a memory bank, which tells exactly what you do on your thing. And somebody has access. Mr. Sunak's. Now, Mr. Sunak has told us that on his peloton, every single day at 6:30, he gets on and does, like, five to six miles on his bike every day to make sure he's fit. This is obviously after he's emptied the dishwasher and put the cushions back on the bed, made his wife some lunch and packed his kids off to school. He then gets on his bike half past six in the morning, does two hours, then goes to the office and works tirelessly to deliver for the British public. Well, actual fact, when we checked his peloton records, he's done none of that. And his longest run is 4 miles, the day after he called the general election. And he set the scene for his run to be a California sunset. So, literally, our prime minister walked out, called the general election, and then ran off into the California sunset on his peloton. Ha ha! Legend, mate. Legendary, legendary campaign. Anything and everything you do is just blowing up. But you Know you keep going sunshine. You hang in there cause you're gonna lose so badly haha."

Now, I live in a proper ghetto area, right? Like, I'm talking the ghetto, okay? You got cars coming out of places that people don't even existed. Yeah. You got people parking on the actual second lane because there's no parking space. You got people parking on the sideline as well. So obviously the insurance gonna be really high, isn't it? As a result of that? But when I was 22, I needed a car. So I thought, let me just see how much a year is would cost. So the car was only a few hundred pound. Yeah. Tell me why. The insurance was about three or four racks for Yaris. And I thought, oh, that's a bit expensive. Let me think of something else that could be cheaper. And you know what? That was extortion as well. The Toyota ego. So I ended up looking for three Wheeler cars to see if they still existed. Like the one in Mr. Bean. Yeah. Hmm. I've got no hope. So I've had my license for 5 years now. Yeah. I'm not driven in 5 years. I've got a pink license rotting away. What am I supposed to do? All I want in life is a purple Audi RS six. Yeah. Too much. My Dyson Hoover. I want to drive a V8. What am I supposed to Drive. The only V8 I drive these days is my Dyson cordless V8. And I hate buses with a passion. People fart under seats all the time. They don't clean the buses. Yeah, you people treat them like a bin, basically. It's vomit inducing. And I guarantee if you smack that seat with your hand. Yeah, you got a whole Sahara desert of dust flying around. Oh, and by the way, if anyone could recommend me the best way to walk from the West Midlands to London, that would be great."

It can be caused by your breast tissue, hormonal changes, and it can be caused by changes in the chest wall, the muscles, the bones, the nerves. So there's lots of reasons why you can get this type of random pain. It's nothing to worry about. It's very common. But if you are worried, then get it checked out. Always.

    "voice_to_text": "Allocation can be propagated by corp. This is what I mean when I say the internet be teaching me everything. So about 3 months ago I picked up this allocation, this one right here from B&Q. And it was a little bit funky, but I had planted it. When I dug into it, I found 8 combs, 8 eights corns. But one of them didn't survive the process and it got really mushy. So I just threw a little baby out, had a little funeral and everything. So I put them in this little container and they've been in there up until today. And this is just the amount of water I put in there. And they sprouted roots. And I'm gonna transfer them into the sphagnum moss to see if it will help. As you can see here, they're already like sprouting some sort of green green. So I'll be putting them in the moss this side down. So they all in there now. And I hope I did it the right way. And I'm just gonna close it back up, put it right back here, right next to the sun. I guess I'll catch you guys up in a couple more months.",

Because every promo that he does, and I know someone out there will say, well, in this one, he didn't. Every promo that I hear, he seems to bring up WWE in somewhere. And it just screams someone who is frustrated that he's not in WWE, but pretends that he isn't bothered. That's the vibe I'm getting here.

Anyway, yeah, boomers and Gen X, some you don't realise, were either in the ages of our brothers and sisters or our parents. And, well, they give up weapons. You never forget. And they did it for free too. They handed them out wherever they wanted, wherever they felt and whoever child they felt like it. So I wouldn't really, because you're signing up your own warrant for a weapon and we're just gonna start there and go. Yeah, let's see how it plays out for you guys. Didn't work for us as kids.

    "voice_to_text": "Did you guys have your transition from, like, terrible men to, oh, my God, I love this topic because I think about this all the time, and I actually talked to my friends about it. I think for me, it was around when I turned 25. So this is a couple years ago, because I think I had just got out of, like, I wanna say, talking to a guy who was, like, very nonchalant. Right. And prior to that as well, I was in a short term relationship with a guy that did, with a narcissist. And I think after that, like, short term talking to this guy, I just kinda like, took a step back and I was just, like, thinking about all the guys I've dated, and I was just like, there's a common trend here where, like, all the guys I've dated are kind of, like, nonchalant or, like, emotionally all available or, like, blah, blah, blah. That was one. And the second thing was that, like, with all these guys, every time, like, the relationship or the talking or whatever ends, it doesn't end with clarity. It just kind of like, maybe I stop replying and then that's the end of that, or he stops replying and that's the end of that. Or he ghosts me or I ghost him or, like, to get. I mean, it was never that kind of, like, sit down kind of thing, and I was like, this is messy. And I deep to myself, I was like, you need to improve your choices. Because I have to take accountability. You need to improve your choices. And kind of men you go for. Because I'm someone that wants to get married, right? And I was like, this is the kind of person you're gonna marry if you don't change what's going on right now. And I took, like, so I think I did, like, some serious, like, learning, like, self learning, self love, self, like, everything. Like, literally reading up on things, watching videos, blah, blah, blah. And I took, like, a break from dating. I wasn't on hinge. I wasn't on anything. I was just kinda like, I'm not dating. I just want to be by myself, um, and improve and, like, learn and stuff like that. And then basically did that for, like, a couple of months. And then soon as I, like, came out of that, I wasn't even out of that phase. I feel like I was still kind of in that phase. Then I met, like, my ex boyfriend, and then we were in a relationship for, like, a bit to go. I mean, so I think my advice is that, like, everyone, obviously, men are terrible, women are terrible. But I think people lack accountability a lot of the times when they're trying to address why, you know, something happens in their life and blah, blah, blah. If you can, like, obviously, you know, The world is the world. You know what I mean? But, like, whatever you can do by yourself to improve your situation, then do it. So I think it's very important to take accountability, um, for the part you play in the way things plan out in your life. Plan outs in your life. Um, yeah, that's just my quick rumble.",

It completely dismisses and discredits the reality we live in. It's like saying racism doesn't exist because we all have equal rights. Feminism is about equal experiences, not just rights. It's also not about men versus women. True feminists stand for Equality for all. And it's because we understand that dismantling patriarchy would benefit everyone. We understand that patriarchy restricts men's rights too, impacting their well being, which is evidence in the male suicidal rate. Without patriarchy, men could express themselves authentically. They could also form more healthy and fulfilling relationships with not only women, but also their men. Patriarchy's emphasis on dominance contributes to violence between men, and a more equal society would eventually lead to less aggression and a culture of peace. The argument of men and women having the same rights, it's simply intellectually weak. While our rights might be equal on paper, our experiences are far from being equal.",

She feels disgusting. And while it's, like, good to lift your friends up, being around people that constantly talk down on themselves and constantly talk bad about themselves, which is something that I've experienced so much in my life, drains you and, like, can literally completely ruin your night. So when I saw this, I was like, oh, girl, yes. Such a good feeling to not have somebody in your air right now, all, like, before you go out, complaining and. And stuff like that. But she was just talking about the taste of her drink. It does look lovely, I must say. But also, if, like, you're this type of friend, let's not. Let's actually not be a bad vibe before we go out.

Hundreds of them were abandoned in the street. We also gonna completely ignore the fact that when this band got announced and hundreds went into shelters, hundreds were getting sold on Gumtree for 50 quid because people couldn't afford or couldn't be asked with them anymore. People took these dogs into their homes with fears that they were gonna be put to sleep. Come to the end of December, people talking dogs that they couldn't handle, people talking dogs that they knew nothing about. And I take my fucking hat off to people who took these dogs in and tried the hardest. I feel for shelters that were having to push dogs into homes. Dogs that have been in shelters for years got pushed to the back burner while Excel bullies were forced into homes because the latter was worse and does the facts that you're fearing that dogs are gonna be on the loose in the street just not fair to prove that the band's not working and some people are still not following the rules? When are you gonna wake the fuck up and realise this is clearly not working?",

So if National Service had an easy opt out, um, that would be less concerning. But he's right about the people don't like the country. And it's because the social contract has been broken. And I've said this before in other videos, people don't get enough back. It's all at the top, at the older end and even they're still being screwed over. It's impossible to buy a house without help from parents. Jobs aren't paying enough to be for the ever increasing cost of living. Average house prices are 12 times average annual salary. This student death. Alright, it's not a loan in the same way that the US loan is, but you're still paying it back and it's still a crewing interest over your lifetime. So you to go to university, a degree, you're saddled with debt. You've got a government that is ridiculing anyone under the age of 25 for doing Mickey Mouse degrees, paying no attention to anyone that's not gonna vote for them. You've got a government that's putting money into business and finance and companies that they family own, rather than putting money into schools and education and the health service and social services. Contracts broken."

Like, yeah, we'd love to have a look at you. Come down. It was like a little exit trial type of thing. They invited loads of, like, ex academy players to kind of do this little trial thing to see if they could get into the first team. Whatever, bro. I played 45 minutes the first 10 minutes. I turned to ref, like, your ref, like, how long? He turns around now. We just started what? I was gonna cry. I was gonna cry on that pitch. The way I looked over to refers like, what? We just started like, what? It's only been 10 minutes. He's like, yeah, we still got number 35+ at the time. What? Plus at the time. Bro, I'm not gonna lie to you. This is why I told Amanda, once you stop playing football for a little bit, don't care if you're the fittest guy, you stop for one month. Especially me, you know, obviously, Mom's going out, party, whatever. Whatever. But when I hear preseason around the corner, my heart starts palpitating. Cause I know. The bleed test, oh my gosh. The bleed test, oh my gosh. Niggas know when preseason comes. All of them. Box runs, box to box, full filled runs. Flipping bleed test. Your heart, you can't handle it. You can't handle it.

And getting the bullets to that gun is super rare cause the technology isn't around anymore I don't think. If I remember correctly, but the wand is literally a gun and the spells are in shells that he puts into the gun and shoots. If you want a cool SCI fi wizard in a D&D campaign. Perfect. Perfect because you can pre do your spells, put them in shells, and then shoot them whenever you want. But you have to have the time to make those shells. Just an idea for y'all DnD guys."

    "voice_to_text": "okay so I'm gonna actually take a stab at this and I want people to um you know tell me how far off I might be or how close I am so there's been a conversation about how generally it's hard to pick up what British culture is like what is what about British culture I say English culture British culture is really hard to nail down because within Britain you've got Scotland which has its own culture Ireland which has its own culture Wales has their own culture so British culture you can't really you know nail it down so easily English culture and probably hard to define um well now I'm thinking about maybe maybe British we'll see we'll see but I've been thinking about this I went I went for a bike ride um it was 36 miles probably shouldn't have done that very unprepared I was driving riding through the Cotswolds and as I was riding I went through you know not in people's back gardens but around people's back gardens I went through you know little towns I went through tiny little villages I went through farmland I went through countryside roads single lane roads hills up and down everything it was great but as I was on this ride I would looking around I was really like in in an embarrassing awe considering how long I've lived here an embarrassing awe of the the nature the countryside the beauty of it all and I was like I remember when I went to America many years ago and I was looking around I was like man man America is gorgeous it's a stunning stunning landscape it really is but I spent so long growing up in cities that I didn't really have that visibility of how gorgeous our landscape is as well like how green and beautiful and wide um widespreading it is in the Rolling Hills just just it there's something really incredible um and I'd say something very earth centred about our landscape here in England and I was also also thinking this is all these little villages all these tiny tiny little towns probably like a population of less than 1,000 literally and they have one little shop run by one lady called Gladys right and that's all they need you know and they got one pub that does food so there's a there's kind of a restaurant pub situation there and I'm not joking these are some of the villages I go through and as I kept going through all these little villages I kept thinking to myself not explicitly like is this English culture but it was an element of I one I don't see enough of this I've grown up in cities I don't see this and they're really they're genuinely pretty villages they're nice villages right um and I thought and I think I think as I watched the video that I stitched was like what if what if British culture English culture was actually and I'm gonna say this with genuine genuine respect because it because I think as things have moved forward languages changed in terms of its interpretation but this is the best word I can actually use to describe it what if British slash English culture was embedded in simplicity what if it was embedded in simplicity a small village with you know not that many people in it one shop one pub slash restaurant that's it and everyone knows each other everyone's kind of you know everyone's friendly everyone looks after each other it's a community it's a community right of people that live in this small little village and the reason I think about that is because when we talk about culture when we look at other cultures we see other cultures celebrate themselves monthly sometimes daily annually at some point they make a big deal out of it right and for us we just I don't feel like we do that with anything really people can shout Saint George's Day but I don't think Saint George represents British culture at all actually it's a weird thing just that the the time we slayed a dragon and they weren't even British like you know what I mean like what that doesn't that I'm not saying that's illegitimate I'm saying that doesn't work as a representation of celebrating British culture I don't think that's it at all or English culture I think I think we have a magnificent landscape and ultimately it's been sold off people are mad because they think it's about multiculturalism they've been told it's diversity and all this kind of stuff no no it's been sold our culture's been sold and you could argue that England has benefited from that financially right because the pound was the strongest um currency in economy so yeah that was really good for us but it's what it's done is it had to erode what England represents and also I wanna say I'm not saying this like you know it's a big shame or anything like that and nor am I being disparaging about it because again I really I really enjoyed that bike ride I enjoyed the little villages I went through I enjoyed the countryside I got to see I got I enjoyed a different part of England that actually I don't see often enough and as I was riding through I was like this is this is effectively what is you know um being lost being forgotten and in some cases being disrespected not by multiculturalism or diversity but by an economic structure that fundamentally sells to the highest bidder for the lowest amount what can we give away that that we perceive to have no value that we can get the most value for and so I understand that there's this like green belt that they're trying to build across or something like that it's stuff like that right I mean people respect generally I find that people will be respectful of land if they're in it if they're among it um if you grew up in a city then I can understand why there might not be that same level of respect but anyway I'm I'm sorry I I go off track I'm wondering if English or British culture is actually about a Celebration of simplicity a Celebration of landscape um farmland countryside and community and I only think that we would laugh at that notion because it's been so heavily eroded over the years and so flippingly sold off for what some people might say British culture is you know Love Island or The Only Way Is Essex made in Chelsea um you know what I mean like getting absolutely blasted on a Friday night that kind of thing um and again I only think about this in the way that we respond to some things generally like how British people are trained English people are are conditioned to respond to some things they don't wanna get into the complexity they don't wanna get into the deep stuff they don't wanna get into that keep it simple keep it simple that's it but we don't celebrate that and so we don't really have attack on it I just my thought",

I've also taken our alley, recent winners of the African Champions League, put them into the UEFA Champions League and the Premier League too. So let's run the simulation and see how they do. So while I ain't, really tough Champions League group as they played Real Madrid and PSG Galatasara as well and they lost every single game. Managed goals against PSG though. Al Ahly meanwhile also a really tough group with Fire Nord, Atletico Madrid and Latzio. And they did actually manage a win over the Italian side, but they lost all of their other games without even scoring a goal. So neither side able to make a Mark in the Champions League. How did they do in the Premier League? Well this may come as no surprise, but even with the points deductions for Everton and forest, even with Luton and Sheffield United in there, they were both relegated by some distance, finishing in the bottom two, only winning three games each. Al Ahly actually did the double over Everton and beat Sheffield United as well. Al Ain did the double over Luton and also beat Fulham, but ultimately just too many defeats and they go down. To the championship. I've gone 5 seasons into the future on this so if you wanna see if they ever come back up to the Premier League, leave a like and drop me a comment.

Little tiny drones that will go out and do national service. They'll go out and clean the streets and they'll tidy this up and do that and everything else. Do all the little jobs that they're supposed to be paying people to do. And they get our children to do it. And they get them in the army. They hate them. They take away university places, they're voting rights, they're taking away their. Their freedom to move everything. These Tories, they're vile! Vote them out! Vote them out!",

    "voice_to_text": "hello um so the fact that I'm having to actually make this video um good morning so that video is an old video if you know me and you've been around for a while you will know that is an old video um if you're new here that was an old video um I did feel the need to post this sorry I'm actually in bed I've literally just woke up I just woke up and um it's been day oh it's been day so I had to like leg it downstairs to put the bin out however back to what I'm um talking about um I posted that video last night um to show people I wanted to I wanted to help people there is a person um oh God it's like it's happening again I'm sick of seeing this I am sick I am so sick of seeing this and seeing people using ill health for monetary gain sat crying on their livestreams of all Boohoo I'm ill and they're actually not they're actually not they're lying they're lying for the for the gifts now anyone who knows me when I'm on this live stream and I start talking about my seizures and talking about my ill health and boohoo I'm crying cause I'm sick I never say thank you for the gifts during that time I'm grateful don't get me wrong I am grateful but I don't wanna encourage that behaviour I'm not I'm not doing it for the gifts I'm not doing it for the gifts I'm doing it because that's what's happening in my life at that time and I spend my life on the internet so but these people these people are manipulating groups of people and brainwashing them into their way of thinking and making them scared that's the worst thing they're making them scared so anyone who dares stand up to these people and then being threatened and made to feel any kind of way to keep them silenced they're being silenced by these manipulative I don't know what the correct word is for these people I just know these people are liars they're lying they are saying they're just lying I was just gonna explain what lying is we we know what lying is they're lying and then anyone who dares stand up against them they're using bullying tactics against them and I'm sick of this and it's happening with another person on this app now that previous video was posted to Instagram that was about a situation or another platform I personally went through that broke my heart basically it was horrendous being bullied and it got so much worse it was so much worse than what that video actually tells you about and I'll happily talk about it one day um but at the minute that person's leaving me alone and I don't wanna get bullied again scared hmm but no I am I am an agency on here I've been called an influencer more than once and I want to use my power for good I don't stand for bullying I don't tolerate bullying and I will gladly put myself as the target if it protects people that are unable to speak up about it and if it protects those people who are scared you shouldn't be scared of another person they're bullying and I just think I think it's ridiculous just think it's ridiculous these people get a thrill out of making people feel this kind of way and they are sick in the head they need help they they need help I kinda wanna quote ha ha I kinda wanna quote sort of this out here like you're sick in the head darling you need to go in a mental hospital but on a very serious note they have mental health issues beyond beyond it and it's just so sad to see and it's sad to see these people are able to manipulate other people who I personally thought were stronger than that if you choose to stand by someone who is using these tactics in my opinion it makes you know better than them you may as well be bullying people yourself if you don't know that's a different matter however if you know if you know what certain people are like if you have voiced that to me especially but to anybody if you have voiced your concerns about other people and you choose still to associate with them it makes you know better than them I will stand up to bullies I I will I will call you out I will not tolerate this it is disgusting behaviour it's disgusting behaviour and this is happening to some people within the agency within my community and it has to stop it really does have to stop the information has been called out someone else has received someone else has all of the information I only have my own knowledge on the situation that's all I have from what I've seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears and it's pretty bad it's pretty bad this person has lied to my face and tried their manipulative tactics on me but they didn't work did they they didn't work on me you can't pick on someone bigger than you you gotta pick on those smaller not anymore you don't this has to stop this really has to stop and and I'll I'll do whatever I can I'll do whatever I can to to stop this situation happening um don't make me drop your name quit quit what you're doing you know what you're doing and I know you'll see this quit what you're doing stop picking on people stop bullying people we are not in high school okay it's not acceptable when you're in high school what what are you doing it now for and you should know better you of all people should know better I know these people these people that are doing the bullying have been bullied themselves they've literally been bullied themselves and it's turned them into these disgusting manipulative people oh I don't even know he has to stop like come on other community do better do better",

And I don't wanna use more video as a way of digging out the guy with a dash cam. But I thought I could do something that may educate other road users in what to look out for with trucks. To know if they're fully loaded or unloaded. Something US truckers do quite often and know if we can squeeze past them or not. And a few things in your video that I noticed that might throw up a few faults in what you were saying. Now for speed there, was this truck really doing 70 mile an hour? I've very much that it. Even with these fully freighted on a really good air one talking like the one on the M23 down a Brighton, you still sort of take a long long time to get up to 70. And if that's the case, how fast was that bloody van going then? You know what I mean? And the lines on the road didn't really support the speed that you're saying now when it comes on to being fully loaded. If you look on that particular tractor unit on the front, he had a category 2 badge on it. That means that truck can run up to 80 ton. Now the machines he had on there was nowhere near that. And if you look On the axles on these trailers, he had a full axle one, he had a little extra one here, which was up in the air. Now, if they're up in the air, that will suggest that that trailer isn't fully loaded. The same on the tractor units. If you've got a midlift in the middle here, when this axle's up in the air, or a rear tag when this one's up in the air, that will mean that that lorry isn't fully loaded. Or it's sort of skirting around a certain weight, where before the axle start dropping on the floor. Now, US truckers, we know if we're going up a hill and someone's coming up alongside us, or we wanna overtake, and they've got their tags up in the air, the chances are they're gonna about gas us on a hill. So, yeah, just a couple of little bits to look out for. If the wheels are up and floating around in the air, even if there's stuff on the trailer, the chances are it is not fully loaded.",
