    "voice_to_text": "A little over one month later I'm back with an update. I wanted to show you how all my little propagations are doing the ones that I stuck in with a cut up golden pothos that you see right here. So, I did this technique with more than I'd originally posted about in the video. As you can see right here, I did it with this Rosemary. I also did it with at least a few different clippings of Flaming Katy\u2026 more of which you can see right here. and little gold golden pothos in the back. I've Learned at least a few different lessons I'm gonna share with you from this experiment. The first lesson is that there's some plants that this technique works very well with. This Rosemary for instance\u2014 she's doing great got lots of little root growth I'll probably let her go for another month or two. It also really worked well with the flaming Katy\u2019s. With it's originally intended plant it did not work well. It\u2019s quite dead and rotted \ud83e\udd72 Moment of silence for the fallen \ud83e\udd27 but so um [Lesson #2] as it turns out from Google no matter what I did this one wouldn't have survived because she needed to have some of her  original root mass to come with her. So, yeah originally she started folding in her  leaves and I'm like \u201cNo baby your stem is still great keep holding on.\u201d So I Frankenstein the hell out of her with  some tape to hold her open. Just thinking: \u201cYou got this take in that light you're gonna you're gonna survive I swear!\u201d  She didn\u2019t \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72 No\u2014 she eventually just continued to rot and I felt like a terrible person.  Clearly I still have much to learn about  being a plant mom. [Lesson #3]: Though, I would consider this  Rosemary propagation a success, due to where the wax is located it did prevent roots from forming in that specific area. Do with that information what you will \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc8b",

I didn\u2019t trim her and quickly she took over one of my raised beds last year. Because she mesmerized me with her sweet scent and beautiful flowers, took me a while to decide to uproot her. By the time I did, she had self seeded and she succeeded!!! \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude01 Look at all her beautiful offsprings! This year I\u2019m goung to try to trim them bushes and harvest her glowers for tea as much as I can or Ill have a Chamomile farm.

In 2020, she double down on enabling my planting/ gardening hobby! Lol I started with a container vegetable garden on our deck, she bought me a Garden Tower 2, the soil, the seedlings and even the red wiggler worms! Whatever I needed, She provided. She\u2019s been a true gift since day one when I found out I\u2019m expecting. She changed my life! Just like the garden, she is a breath of fresh air. She is beautiful and kind and most of all loved! I love hanging out with her.

For reference, I'm 6 feet tall here in this picture. One of the coolest things about them is that their flowers actually exhibit thermogenesis. This means that they create their own heat, and they can actually reach temperatures of up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. We're just getting started. Each flower only blooms for two nights. The first night, the flower is white and female, like you see here. The heat attracts nocturnal beetles, which crawl in through this opening here. The flower provides carbohydrate reserves, which keeps the beetle orgy going all night long. In the morning, the flower closes up, trapping the beetles inside. On the second night, the flower opens as a pink male and begins releasing pollen as a trap. Beetles escape. They move past the anthers, carrying pollen with them to a fresh female flower for round two. They're also covered in insane spine.",

We use the wall for supports, but while I can still kind of get some bend, obviously in these, they're not paper thin like they were. She's got some new little offshoots, and she seems to enjoy the sun she gets from the giant bay window that's by my desk, because she does live in my work desk, so I don't know. I've got, like, six. Six points, six planes at work. I was trying to, like. I literally had to count them. Technically, some of them are cuttings from one of my others, but I kind of try to rehab some of my plants here because there's just such great lighting. I've also got my little, um, purple zebra. Those two ones that are hanging are from a rescue. The rest are cut offs from another.",

And just recently, like, her leaves have gotten bigger, she's more shiny. She's standing. She's standing up. And I noticed that she started doing this when I put the mirror in front of her so she could see herself. Conceited little bitch.",
