    "voice_to_text": "No.1. Why do people use handbags as school bags? How do you even carry anything in that bag? Hey girl, I'd love to answer this question for you as someone who's loved and threatened her whole life. So I took a handbag to school always. This one is actually so dirty. I cannot speak for the whole UK, cause a lot of English rules are really strict, but in Scotland we could literally wear and bring whatever we wanted. So this is my bag, and I'm gonna show you how I fit everything in there. So I've not been in high school for about a year now, so I packed this with the best of my memory. And first of all, we have one book. Like, I had barely any classes, so I did not need more than one book. Next, I have a pencil case, which probably has about four pens in it still, but yeah. And then we have my lovely Highland Spring water bottle, a hairbrush, my AirPods, of course. And then some makeup products. We've got some Vaseline lip liner and eyebrow pencil, and finally a tampon. That's literally all I brought in this little bag. I did not need more than that, but yeah. I use this bag religiously for two years. So I want to know 1 earth, are you carrying a skill that you need a bigger bag than this? So hope this answer your question. Bye. Also, I cannot comment on The other questions cause they mostly only apply to English."

First of all, the fact if. If it is a joke, that still sick in the head. You're using McDonald's to make a video because you know it's gonna get people raging in the comments. The comments are giving you engagement. You're. You're literally using it for clout. Now I don't know what her intention is behind that video, but there is nothing correct or right about the video. I can't even say I'm disappointed. I really can't. We need to stop looking at influences, looking up to them and thinking they're gonna do right. First of all, they're still human beings. They're just like us. They're just more Exposed on online. Right? They've decided to share their lives with us online.

All the trolls that tell me that the rest of the school are run as an absolute waste of time, that I'm setting kids up for failures and then they're gonna get nothing out of it. That when they come at the wrestling school, they'll be nothing but wasting their own time as well. Well, I'd like to introduce yous to Caden Cross, who is just in that video there. The stitch. Go watch this video, by the way. Go watch that stitch. I would like you to do that right, because Caden Kaden is one of our top students. And I'm gonna let you know the story of a kid, mate. When this kid started the wrestling school, eh, he get bullied out of hat. He'd been bullied at a high school. He stopped attending because, eh, people made fun of him, eh, we never really had many friends and it was, it was off of the anxiety and, eh, low self esteem, low confidence and stuff like that. So when we went to the resting. Resting school, eh, Macy's on looks like talking about all the time Caden joined us. He's been with us ever since. He's lost over 100 pounds, he's gained this self a week girlfriend. And now Caden, he's got the confidence to go in the middle of governing. Cross And film a video, a promotional video for Community Pro Wrestling Marathon company. Trying get as many people to come and watch them wrestle as possible. No, if you are one of these idiots that think Marathon school bring absolutely nothing to people, well I hope you know well that's a lie. And in fact you already know yourself it's a lie. Right? So go and watch the video. See the confidence that young man's got now, thanks to the Glasgow School wrestler. And you know what? Because I can't, we can't take all of it. And thanks to yourself, because you need to put in the work. And Caden Cross is one of the hardest work. Cause I know that banner had only been up there for 2 years. And that boy went the new phone a video way so he could promote the show. What an absolute be legend there. So remember the name Caden Cross, cause he's gonna be a wrestling superstar. In fact, no, not just a wrestling superstar, he's gonna be a star. And like Glasgow, Scotland all over. So remember him, go and give him a follow, watch his video and ask what's happened to it."

Whereas when I've been speaking to my friends and from what I've seen on social media, everyone who isn't to voting conservative are so torn between other parties. And I just feel like the vote is gonna be so split on that side that conservatives are just gonna get in. There are people saying, vote green. I mean, I'm a Green Party voter, I've always voted green, but, um, then there are people saying, no, don't vote green, it's a wasted votes, we need to vote Labour. And then people say, no, I'm not voting Labour. We need to vote reform, we need to vote libdomen. I'm seeing libdomes coming in, like, they're just so split, so divided on the other side. It's like, okay, can we all just come together for a minute? Let's all just focus on what we need to do. What we doing? You tell me, you tell me what we're doing. Cause I'm not well versed on politics at all. It just is not my fault here. I vote green because, I mean, I'm a hippie vegan is what it is. But what are we doing? What should I do? Should I Put labour. Should I just stick to my. My guns and. But grain. I will do anything to stop the toys from being reluctant. So just let me know. Bring me in. What we doing"

But don't get me wrong, there are ways to navigate all better your chances. And honestly, if you're LinkedIn doing the easy apply what not good luck. Like applying for jobs is a job in itself and you can treat it likewise. I feel like people forget that a degree is just leverage. Like it shows that you have knowledge within the field but eventually experience the accolades on your shoulder. Trump said within 5 10 years in the field, someone's gonna be asking you about where you degree. Where you degree, please kick rocks. And you'll come to realise that a lot of the things you do at uni does not translate into what the work life is like. So it's like another learning experience in itself. No, this is not to say that a degree is useless, don't get me wrong, he's got a masters, he's a step ahead. But as long with the knowledge, you also need to be able to prove that you can build, you can do stuff. Generally you can work in a working environment. Yeah, that's just my force in it",

I think the UK could learn a lot from Japan in the way that we feed our kids here, start by removing ultra processed foods from kids lunch. #toddlermom #nutrition #health #diaryofaceo #school #firsttimemom #controversialparenting ",
    "voice_to_text": "By law, every Japanese school has to employ a professional nutritionist as a difficult qualif. Imagine what UK school dinners would look like if we replaced pudding with a qualified nutritionist. And that was by law, as it is in Japan. Imagine if instead of saying let kids be kids, we taught our children to love healthy foods. Imagine if all processed foods were banned from schools like everywhere across the country. Imagine if we normalised kids enjoying healthy meals filled with fruits, veg, proteins, carbs, all the good stuff for them, instead of presuming that they're all gonna be picky eaters and all they want is junk food and sugar. Imagine expecting our kids to love broccoli and seaweed as they do in Japan. Imagine if every child who went to school was taught about nutrition and given the tools to live healthy lives forever. Imagine how easy it would be for you as a parent to feed your children only healthy food if that's all they ate at school. I encourage you to watch the entire clip because it is a great example of how culture shapes our reality and if only we could see that in this country. We have to do better in the way that we feed our children and educate them about food, because if we all did it, the world honestly would be a better place.",

So, I mean, unless you wanna pay \u00a380 for someone to massage you when formal can do the same job, by all means, don't form roll. Band work as well. Another way of increasing your range of motion and your mobility within your body. And last but not least, gym work.

But that's by the. By. The point is I put a very innocuous comment on there along the lines of this is actually disgusting or this is reprehensible and this couldn't have been good for his system, his immune system and all these kind of things.

I was like, Penelope and Colin are gonna kiss. An episode to how bright the moon. I think I've done over 100 theory videos on it now. I know it wasn't super, like, out there to predict that that was gonna happen, cause we had the still from to do, and we knew it's from episode two. But I had so many people be like, no, it's too early. It's too early. It's not gonna happen episode two. I was like, no, it's gonna happen in episode two, I tell you. Because in terms of the book, I was like, I feel like that's an episode 2 kind of marker of, like, where Episode 2 would go, like, where that scene happens in the book. I was like, that's giving Episode 2. And I just was in my mind, I was like, hand cut scene and would you kiss me scene. It both gonna be the same episode. Episode 2. And then it happened and I just was like, oh, my gosh. And how bright the moon is like my comfort episode. Like, I just love that episode so much. And their first kiss is so beautiful and even more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Like, I don't know how they could exceed my expectations, but they did. It is so beautiful, and I'm So glad that I've always been an episode 2 kiss truth. Uh, I feel like I need to compile every single time I said that they were gonna kiss an episode 2 now, because I feel like we'd have a lot of videos in there."

    "voice_to_text": "I do not know if I have it in me to attend big name anime conventions any. So. Hi, friends. I just wanna give my 2 cents on this topic of con etiquette and respect in general. Um, so I had something happened to me last year where I was attending MCM London in October, and I was in Artist Alley wearing an ombre. Ombre on romper. And I was cosplaying, um, and I was just, um, looking at God's, minding my own business. And, um, two men approached me and shouted ombre on! And I turned around and they both have their phones out taking photos of me. Um, and I pulled a really disapproving face and I said, you know, you didn't ask for permission. Oh, yeah. They started mocking me and saying that I should expect, um, people to wanna take my photo if I go there. Um, and why do I dress up if I don't want my photo taken? And it's not that I don't want my photo taken. I have no problem with people taking my photo. Just, you know, it would have been nice to have a bit of respect where somebody asks beforehand. And I don't mean to come across as entitled at all by saying that. It's just, you know, common, kind of like knowledge and. And common sense to kind of like, be respectful about it. Like, the end of the day, I was by myself and I felt a Bit uncomfortable, especially engaging in a bit of conflict with two random strangers that I didn't know. It just didn't sit right with me and didn't give me a good vibe at all. At the end of the day, cosplayers are real people, too. We're not show monkeys. We're not there to perform for other people. Were there to go make memories, you know, meet friends, go to Artist Alley, be able to look around freely without being harassed by people. Um, I don't know it. At these conventions, you know, it's. It's about using your common sense and just being respectful to each other. It's not a difficult thing to do. Like, regarding common sense, like, if you see someone sat down on the floor taking a break, maybe you can see that half a cosplay is off. You can see that they're clearly taking a break. And maybe asking them for a photo or to engage with them might be the wrong time. Um, because sometimes when you go to these conventions, they can be incredibly overwhelming. And, you know, a lot of us do suffer with problems, whether they be mental or physical. And we all are human beings at the end of the day. We're not machines. We need to take breaks and just kind of have a minute to relax. Um, and, you know, if you see someone just resting, just respect that, please. I mean, we all share the same hobby. We're all there. For the same reason, to go and have fun and make memories and have a great experience. Um, so, you know, let's just be kind to each other and try to be understanding towards each other, whether you're a cosplayer or just somebody attending the event just for the experience. You know, just be kind. It's. It's not hard.",

I want my team, I want a bloody Chelsea on my overcut scarf. What's wrong with you? Is Trump memorabilia. Get a Man United scarf. Oh, if you want. Um. Don't get a bloody half and half scarf. I went to Leicester versus Manu, I got a Leicester City scarf, didn't get a half and half scarf. Honestly, just really. Blood boils my blood. It really does.

Like, yes, people are wearing the same birthday dress that would in the same hairstyle. Everyone's doing that hairstyle with the deep wave when it comes to summer. Yes, on your FYP. But there's a whole other world outside then this London. Like, London's obviously very small, which is why a lot of the time these things are always like in your face. It looks like everyone's in the same thing. But if you just step outside, just go a little bit further, there's people on something else. People have a whole different wardrobe, people that have a whole different vibe. And I just feel like people are not really open to understanding and accepting that. They just always wanna think everyone's copying each other. And another thing like, it's okay to have trends. Like, is it a crime for there to be trends? Like, I just feel like in London, it's like that's the one place that we can't accept that something can be trending and everyone can do it. That's literally life everywhere in the world. There's always gonna be a trend and people, when there's A trend. People are going to jump on the trend. Like, let them. What's the problem? Like, I feel like this conversation comes out all the time. But that's not a problem, though. Like, everyone, we can talk about it. We can talk about it. But I just think, like, just don't be bashing people. If everyone wants to wear the same birthday dress from Mars, the label, let them. It's a trend, bro. It's a trend.",

But what's funny is the fighters, The Hall of Fame is Daniel call me a Dustin Poirier. People are actually watch fighting.

And I know that sounds a bit mad, yeah, but the UK Black Business Show actually hosting an in person event in Birmingham on Saturday, June 15th. Now this is the perfect opportunity where you can actually speak to these companies liveo direct in person. They're gonna be hosting a bunch of workshops and they're gonna be showcasing all the jobs they have available. Financial services companies, technology, professional services and so on and so forth. Now, I happen to have discounted tickets for anyone that wants to attend the event. You get 30% off if you use the code BEYOND EDUCATION30 in capital letters when you purchase a ticket for all the day passes to the event. But for you, bro, specifically, I will get you the ticket myself. I will get you the transportation to get to the event. Lunch is even on me, bro. And we're literally going to be pulling up to every single employer together to literally just like, get the drop, get some free game on how you can basically get a job. And I'll even help you do your CV as well, bro. And apart From that guys, there's a bunch more in person events that I'm actually hosting with a lot of companies that are gonna be hiring this summer. We are outside, we are putting up to the company's HQ's and asking them yo give us the job. Yeah, so just stay tuned. But for everyone else, you can click the link in my bio and basically get those tickets 30% off if you use the code BEYOND EDUCATION30 in capital letters. As for you bro, if you just drop me an email, Veter email my profile and it will sort all of that out for you bro. And we can get started on making sure that you have more of a productive, um, you know, kind of search like when it comes to just looking for jobs, bro. Make sure we get you hired like before summer ends, man. But for everyone else, just check the link in my bio and um, get your tickets man. And be outside and go to the companies and ask them yo hire me in person. You basically just need to pull up in person.",

We should sell Mason Greenwood for multiple reasons, which I'm not gonna go into, and use that money on position that we need to cover, like center backs. Also, Zhuang Felix has a history of, you know, not getting well with managers. And if Eric Turnhardt is to stay, we don't need another guy that's gonna give him problems, in my personal opinion. Also, this brother's wages are crazy. 2:50. And he hasn't been great in the last two to 3 years. Let's be real. Since Zhuang left beifika, he hasn't been the player that they bought him for. I don't think he suits acclaim Madrid system very well. I do see him suiting more of a Barca style. Where is that one touch football? So I feel it's a little bit like Jaden Sancho. And I don't think we need that at the club. If you're a stats guy, his stats has been okay over the years. It's been. It's been alright, as you can see if you're a stats person. Over the last three years in Portuguese. I think this guy needs to sort out his career, cause it's just all over the place. And I think going to Manchester United will be a wrong move for him and for us. So for me, it's a no."

So I understands that you want to know what photo cards in K pop are, and this is my explanation video for you from my understanding of K pop photo cards as a whole. So when you go and buy a K pop album, they will have things called inclusions inside of them, and one of these inclusions are cards of a set member or a unit, depending on the group and the album. Some groups will only have one photo card in, some will go up to three, maybe a few more than that, but it entirely depends on the group's album that you were buying. These photo cards are completely a random and you don't know who you're getting until you open the album. I am a Felix collector myself and I do have four of my cards that I have to show you. One I pulled from an album and three others I bought online from K Stars, which is a shop here in the UK. So, um, this is the one I pulled. This is from 5 Star Digipak. I can't remember which one because I have Felix Han and Hyunjin's. Did you pack for 5 star? So this is the card I pulled of Felix from the 5 star did you pack that I purchased. This next one is From ordinary. I can't remember if this was a pre order benefit. Which is another thing that some groups do. If you pre order an album, you'll get a special pre order benefit photo cards. This is one from ordinary. I can't remember if this is a pre order benefit. 1 but this is my ordinary card. Um, the next one is from the Jeju concert or fan meeting. Believe this was a lucky draw one. There's these machines that people can go up to with a certain ticket, press a button and member photo cards come out. And K Styles also selling this one to Felix so I bought it. And I do believe this last one my Christmas Eve one. I think this one was a pre order benefit. I'm not 100% sure, but this is the last one I want to show you. And um, as you can see I have these all protected with a plastic sleeve and a harder top loader. A lot of fans do this to keep their cards, like protected from like, damage, um, anything like that. Especially if you're a trader. Traders use these a lot to make sure cards don't get bent in transit. And the sleeves or also just to keep the cards in good condition as well. If you are going to look into sleeves for photocards, make sure that they are acid free ones because with photocard sleeves acid can damage the photocards. So keep a lookout For that, if you are going to be putting them in sleeves and top loaders. Okay, so that is my brief explanation on K pop photocards for you. I hope that helped in some way. Thank you to everyone for watching this video. Eddie, I hope this helped. And I'll see you all again very soon."

And you could say that I saw the ghost die before I was born. Let me explain. I was 9 years old, playing with some friends in our hallway. And walking along the hallway, look through the banisters, and I could see black boots, tiny little feet and black boot. Put my head through the banisters to look, and could see a head at the bottom of the stairs. So basically, it was a person upside down, although I couldn't see all their body. Told my mother when she came home from work, and she said, oh, my goodness me, that is. And she said her name, which I won't say. And this lady lived upstairs in the house that I grew up in. And my mother said, I was a week away from having you when she heard a thud. She opened the bedroom door, came out heavily pregnant with me in her tummy. And there was this poor lady dead upside down on the stairs. And she always wore these little black leather boots, which I saw. So you could say, I saw that ghost die before I was born."

I mean I don't understand how on what world that make sense for a manager to get his team sacked. Because he was so stubborn to change the way he plays to suit his team to keep him in the league. Yeah, though like Vincent company went wrong because he didn't. He didn't decide to switch up his tactics, he carried on persistently try to get his team to play how they did in championship. When you one of the best teams in the league as means Man City know you'll get away with it. But when you're promoted into the Premier League, you've kinda gotta adapt. You've kinda gotta realise that mighty my players and my team isn't strong enough to play that way in the Premier League and get results. So me as a western fan, I was annoyed that Moyes didn't adapt to certain games. He just played the same way over and over again. It's clear that Vincent Company does the same thing. And yeah, I can't see, I can't see anything but Leverkusen or another German team pipping Bayern Munich to the title again. But yeah, that's my opinion. I don't. Yeah, it is a bit of a weird one because although I think what he did with Burnley in the championship was great, how he coached them, it's all well and good to doing that With one of the best teams in the league. But when you're. When you're up against it and you've got use your head and try and change tactics to try and get the best result for the team at that time. Yeah, company kinda proved that he. He couldn't do that. He couldn't change how his team played. So I don't think it's gonna be much of a success forum in any way of form. And won't be surprised if Dortmund Salzburg is Salzburg. No, Leipzig. It's one or the other. Dortmund, Frankfurt, even. UM. Leverkusen. One of them. One of them. Pippin. Um. Bayern Munich. To start all again. But yeah.

But we deal with each other, we stand with each other. You touch one, you don't touch we all. Don't mess with the sisterhood, bro. Don't mess with the sisterhood, okay?

I've been working in the wedding industry for nearly 10 years now and there is still a long way to go. It's definitely become more inclusive slowly but surely, but at nowhere near the right that it needs to continue to actually make everybody feel like they have a place and they have a safe space and they have people that actually really want to cater for them and be inclusive. I investigated and collected lots of data and interviews and researched about how inclusive the wedding industry is and within that, the wedding media. And in short, a lot of the data showed that less than 10% of media within the wedding industry was catered to LGBTQ+ people, and maybe even not even 5% of that was real LGBTQ+ couples. This isn't even even going towards trans people. This is mainly just gay, lesbian, bisexual. And even that's not good enough. So for the wider queer community, it's shit. It really is. As wedding industry professionals, we can do better. We can make our forms and our booking forms and our inquiry forms inclusive and that it'll make, um, a whole manner of difference to everyone, everyone that we are marketing ourselves to, whether they are part of the LGBTQ+ community or not. And it does not have To be difficult, I don't say bride. Change bride to client. Change bride and groom to couple names. It's not rocket science, and it'll take you two seconds to change it, so please do.",

So the first is creating a new Instagram account for sub communities. So we're starting with the LGBTQ+ community. Because I know it's a painful process living with strangers. This is what it looks like. It's live. People can share a bit about themselves. They can also share a bit more about what it's like to live with them. And the second thing is a much better way to find someone to live with. Basically like a buddy up slash dating app for housemates. It's a whole new interface, completely different from everything out there. If you wanna hear more about either them, comment below and I'll make a specific video about how each one is really special in this space.",

And just because we are designed to be on our two feet doesn't mean that we can all run easily. I like to think of running like I think of pull UPS. If you were slight and light and smaller, you'll be pretty good at it. If you're bigger and heavier and thicker, you're gonna be less good, but even more so, because there's a technical element to it as well. There's something called running economy, which basically takes into account the mechanical and cardiovascular efficiency of your body to produce the running movements. So basically, all of this is to say, if you sometimes give yourself shit because you're not, like, easily an amazing runner, don't. Because running is fucking hard. And some people are built for it and some are not. And if you're like me, a slow plodder, just stay in your own lane and focus on your own improvement.",

And then everyone started getting, like, loads of rubbish, uh, gifts, uh, that were in this, the selection box. This is my understanding, anyway. I might be wrong. Uh, and then obviously he feels guilty because he did a video on it and he received really nice things. Now, that's my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong. But listen, mate, what you gotta know is right. And trust yourself on this one, right? You're a decent guy. I'm pretty sure that I can tell. How you can see the shit coming from a mile away. You're a decent guy. It's been a mistake. You got stitched up. Alright, so you got stitched up. But for you to beat yourself up so badly about this situation, which is gonna happen, it probably happen again at some point or whatever, then you've made an apology, what you think is brilliant, but you've got to pull yourself together, because remind yourself of the good things about yourself and Move forward. Now, it's important that we feel negativity and we feel pain. Because we don't feel pain, we can't protect ourselves. Um, the next time. Um. But to see you this distraught is. Is awful. And I hope you. Hope you listen to what I'm saying. So you got two roads to go down. Now, you felt the pain. This pain is debauchery, beating yourself up. Sorry. This, uh. This road is debauchery, beating yourself up. And this road is acceptance and forgiving of the situation. You need to forgive this situation so you can move on. Because at the end of the day, if you don't forgive this situation, they're not gonna be suffering. Whoever stitch you up, it's gonna be you that carries this. So you gotta snap out of it. Remind yourself that you're a great person. Get on with it. Any trolls, ignore them because they don't understand that they haven't got a heart. And they're just being trolls because they're behind the screen anyway, and they can't put themselves forward. They'd never say it to your face because they wouldn't be brave enough. Take it easy. Love yourself. We love you. Take care."

    "voice_to_text": "Widely accepted with girls that date girls to be friends with exes. Oh, it's not widely accepted, but it happens a lot in lesbian community. Let's talk about it. Now, for my experience, what I've seen through friends for my own, this is so common, it's actually ridiculous. What I have noticed is that a lot of lesbians in a community have attachment issues. Hundred percent. And when I was thinking about it, I was thinking, okay, when we look at heterosexual relationships, right, no man will happily be the woman that has a friendship with their ex. And vice versa. No woman will be happy if their boyfriend had a friendship with their ex. Now, whether what stand behind closed doors, we don't really know about. But in terms of it being open in the lesbian community, it is so open that we know that our partners are friends with their exes. Now, this is something that I don't accept. I wanna ask thinking about it. Yeah, I'm just thinking our community, bro, is so fucking weak. The fact that we actually accepted. We are the only community that do this. I don't know any other community, any other culture that do this. And we have to answer ourselves, why? Now, don't get me wrong, I know some people are okay with this. Listen, if you're okay with your partner being friends with their exes, whether, you know, it's something as part of your poly clan or open relationship, Clan or whatever it might be, that is fine. But I definitely think we have to ask ourselves why we are the only community that accept this.",

    "voice_to_text": "that was trans content creator Lily Tino talking about her gender reassignment surgery while sitting on a veranda outside at Disney World the video has gone viral and is getting a lot of negative responses and rightly so because nothing irritates me more than a self serving advocate Lily is very much aware that what she has just done is inappropriate in the environment in which she has done it there is nothing wrong with talking about gender reassignment surgery and educating people at an elementary level in the way that Lily was doing so in the video there is everything wrong with the environment that Lily chose to do it in and Lily knows that because Lily continuously says in the video I'm gonna get thrown out of Disney World for doing this because Lily knows that talking about sexually explicit content talking about adult genitalia in an environment that is specifically for children and families is a really bad idea it is an inappropriate thing to be doing but the thing with Lily is Lily doesn't care because her content is intentionally rage baiting the transphobes and is intentionally rage baiting the internet to engage with her videos so that she could potentially get finance or she just gets lots of views maybe she just enjoys pissing everybody off I don't know but it's an intentional strategy tactic so that people pay Lily specifically attention it has nothing to do with the desire to educate people on trans issues or on gender reassignment surgery it has everything to do with the fact that Lily wants to centre themselves and enrage people and rage bait people on purpose so that they'll engage with her and she'll be benefited from it potentially by finances because it doesn't matter if your content is being engaged with negatively or positively on TikTok you're still gonna get compensation if you get over a certain amount of engagement and nothing annoys me more than seeing an advocate do that to their community on purpose because we all know this has nothing to do with transgenderism that is not why people are angry at you people are angry at you because you are talking about adult genitalia and a children's environment which is inappropriate regardless of your gender if you are CIS if you are trans if you are non binary talking about genitalia an environment saturated with young people is completely inappropriate behaviour and I do not want to hear the argument of it's appropriate anyway we need to educate on trans rights and stuff listen you cannot be talking about genitalia like that in Disneyland in front of families because you couldn't do that if you were sis if I sat there and talked about my knob in the middle of Disneyland no one's gonna be very impressed with me either you know it's inappropriate so the content is not what's wrong it's the environment that you're doing in and Lily knows that and Lily is selling out intentionally to the rage baiters to prove point to herself that she can and get get this content to skyrocket and go viral that's what this is about and in doing so she's throwing the community the trans community under the bus because there are trans people and queer people who have fought and who work incredibly hard every day of their lives to try and undo the damage of history and undo and unpick the myths about transgenderism about queerness by actually educating people properly Lily is not trying to do that Lily is trying to anger people on purpose and in doing so in a child like a child friendly environment Lily is playing straight into the hands of the transphobes and she knows it she is helping to perpetrate the myths that trans people are inherently dangerous around kids JK Rowling is gonna look at this sort of content and use it and weaponize it against the trans community and Lily doesn't care as long as Lily's videos are getting likes and uh engagement it has nothing to do with wanting to educate people about transgender issues it has everything to do with Lily doing this on purpose for Lily's own self and it just makes my blood boil to think about all of the trans people and the queer people who are gonna go to Disney World land or work at Disneyland who are gonna be confronted by other people now because of this video because we all know that negative content like this about the trans community is gonna go far more viral than anything positive and so people are gonna be walking through Disneyland now and when they see a trans person be that a visitor or be that an employee they are just gonna think about this video because Lily has done this on such a viral scale enraged so many people with such intent but this is gonna be the first thing that people think about when they see a trans person at Disneyland Lily has single handedly raised question marks for all of the Disney parents who see Disney in their algorithm all of the time as to whether or not trans people are safe to be around whether with their kids that is what Lily has done because it is naive to believe that everyone is aware of transitions and everyone is a bigot that is not the case a lot of people are not aware of transitions and if you're just a family with kids you know and it's just not on your radar whatsoever and this is the first thing that you see maybe you're planning a vacation and the algorithm throw this this up you are gonna be immediately jumping to transphobic and homophobic rhetoric in your own head Lily has provided the foundation for hatred towards trans people she has helped to perpetrate and solidify and validate that myth that has been age old that queer people are inherently dangerous to kids and that is disgusting because Lily is doing it for her own benefit this has nothing to do with education nothing at all this is not progressive for the trans movement this is not freedom and if you think that because you're queer because you're trans and you can talk about these things wherever the hell you wanna talk about them then you really need to have a look at yourself and go this is not appropriate you can talk about anything in the right setting and children do need educating on transitions absolutely we need to teach children about gender we need to teach children about different people from different walks of life but we don't need to be doing it unprofessionally inappropriately while they're on a family holiday or day out with you know talking about genitals and doing it in the way that you are talking about your marshmallow tunnel you know it's inappropriate and that's the issue it's got nothing to do with the content because you can educate children on this but not at Disneyland not against the wills of those around them you know it's just inappropriate and it's makes my blood boil to think that Lily has done so much harm with this video on purpose on purpose go on their TikTok and look at all of their content it is intentionally rage baity Lily benefits from people getting angry at her and so she plays into it and in doing so massively damages her own community but it's okay because she benefits and that is just it's so disgusting",

I know this sounds a little crazy, but hear me out. Okay, so let's start with Red Bull. Yes, they have the little nasty Christian Horner. Hmm. I dislike him just as much as the next guy, probably a little more, but it is what it is. If that's what we have to put up with, we will. Okay, then we have Max. And yes, some people might not like Max. They might have their reasons, but we can't really argue that he's driving the hell out of that Red Bull car. Now, imagine Carlos in that Red Bull car, Max in that Red Bull car, both of them battling it out. Carlos actually winning some races. If Checo can win races in that Red Bull car, believe me, that Carlos can win races in that Red Bull car, it would be beautiful. Just imagine. Just imagine. Okay, next we have to talk about Carlos options if he doesn't go to Red Bull. Okay, let's start with Salber, which next year will be Audi. Sabra. Really think where Sabra is in the championship. It's not looking good. Do we think they'll have a better car next year? No. Just because they're changing their name, they're not changing the car. They might change the car in 2026, actually. Of course they will change the car in 2026, but it will take years. For Carlos to actually be back where he was with Ferrari. He's not gonna have a chance to actually win any races, and he's going to go back to the back of the pack. Well, actually, where he hasn't been in a long, long time. So we don't want that. We don't want that. It might be a lot of money for Carlos, but he's not getting any younger. Okay. Okay. Then we have Williams. Just a name says it all. Williams. Do we really want Carlos to replace Logan Sergeant at Williams and just be at the bottom, bottom, bottom of the pack? No, we don't. Like, no one even knows why Alex Albon just resigned with Williams. He's even better than Williams. I don't know where he could go, actually. But that's conversation for another day. Williams. And then we have Mercedes. Yes, it might be cool. Like, they'll do a swap. C's and then Louis to Ferrari, Carlos to Mercedes. Carlos and George could be good together. But then again, they'll probably give him a one year contract. So Carlos would be warming up the seat for Kimmy and Denelli, and then out we go with Carlos. And then where's Carlos gonna go? Hmm? Hmm, hmm hmm. We don't want Carlos at Mercedes. Well, that car is crap. No, I'm sorry. This makes me a little stressed, because unless Carlos goes to Red Bull, we're a bit screwed. He's a little screwed, and his fans are a little Screwed. Because it's not looking good. It's not looking fantastic. Like, am I do him good in terms of money, but other than that, hmm. Is it gonna win him races? It's not looking great. So all of this to say Carlos needs to go to Red Bull. And if that means we will have crappier merch, so be it. Like, Carlos, Red Bull, please, please, please. That's it.",

    "voice_to_text": "Passive investigation passive perception. Do you let that detect traps? It's an interesting topic and I flip flopped quite a lot upon thinking about this. My initial thought process is that no, I wouldn't use passives for detecting traps, because I think traps serve a different purpose in that they are designed to catch people out who aren't looking for them. And while I'm not a fan of GMS intentionally try to catch out players in this way, I think traps serve that purpose in making players think about the environment around them much more closely and encouraging them to take caution in the approach they're taking in the dungeon or whatever. So in that instance, I would much rather reserve passive investigation perceptions for spotting hidden things around the room, like hidden chests, the presence of a secret door, um, or finding generally useful information that they're trying to gather for whatever purpose. Where I think I would then use your passives is for noticing the potential for a trap. So while you don't notice for certain that there is one, if you got a rogue with a decently high passive perception, you would mention to them of hey rogue, this is a place where someone would probably put a trap. This room, this corridor. You may be thinking about looking for it specifically, at which point the row can then do the active investigation check. Study the brickwork of the corridor or the secret door, look for it, Closely to find where the trigger mechanism is and then allow them to use their thief's tools to disable it. Overall, I think it's a grand discussion about how to use passives. I think a lot of what player expectation is, and I'm guilty of it myself, is it if I have a high passive score I don't need to roll the active check cause my passive will get me it? I think that's incorrect. I think what passives are really designed for is for the general or general awareness of what's going on around you. You don't know exactly what's being said in the conversation across the street because of your passive, but you happen to be aware that that conversation is happening, and now you are aware of it happening, you can actively listen in to try and hear it. So I think it's a matter of just GMS reframing how they use their passives to make it about the general consciousness of what's going on that might trigger the need for a more precise look."

And out of all of these emissions created by the NHS, which is a massive corporation, so they produce a lot of emissions, 3% of those are created by inhalers. And when you're comparing the traditional inhaler to a powdered inhaler, the traditional inhaler, um, creates the emissions that are equivalent to driving 175 miles in a car, whereas the powdered one creates 4 miles worth of emissions in a car. This is because the traditional one doesn't have a dose counter. So on average, half of these doses are normally wasted. So if your inhaler looks a little bit different, that is probably why."

    "voice_to_text": "Not allowing girls to use the toilet, saying that they've got period passes, that they should plan around it all the. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched these clips from the talk at Westminster Hall regarding gynecological health being taught at school. And I also can't tell you how many times I've watched them and not cried. Because if you can resignate to this, then you will understand where all of my emotions come from. This clip in particular talks about toilet passes. And I cannot even begin to tell you the amount of times I had to beg, literally sit and beg my teachers to allow me to get out of class to go to the toilet. And then you get the hard hitter, why didn't you go at break? For you then to have to come away with a spiel of, I did quit break, but actually, like, I bleed so heavily that I am flooding my tampon and my pad that I put on about an hour ago. Unfortunately for me, at that point, I did not realise that that was not normal. When I watch this clip, it actually took me back to memory that I generally think I'll think about for the rest of my life. And that is, I had asked to be let out of class. I was allowed to do so. Went to the toilet, got changed, got clean, went back to class. However, on the way back, To class, all the walls started caving in on me, and at that point, I was like, this has never happened before. I don't really know what's happening, but I feel very unwell. And that marked a moment that would happen very frequently in my life there on, where I would pass out or get close to passing out, due to the level of blood loss and pain I was enduring. And this is why I think it's important not to only just scrap these passes. Like, we should just be able to go to the toilets, but maybe if we're aware of these conditions, understand that we might need, like, a buddy to come with us just in case things go wrong. To see this push for change, in my opinion, is incredible. And I just think to myself, how different would my life had been had I been given that education? And the words endometriosis, adenomyosis, PCOS, anything like that, if that was in my vocab, like, how different would life have been? So, yeah, I cannot even express how thankful I am that we are pushing this in the right direction. And I actually feel hopeful, like, I feel hopeful for the future in terms of the education.",

I see a few people doing this sort of thing now recently, where they're, like, biking from the UK to Australia, or walking from the UK to Ibiza or Mumbai or something like that. And I was thinking, hey, fair play. That's not bad going. Then I thought to myself, they got to cross oceans. I mean, I'm sure they don't walk or bike through the ocean, so does it really count? No, I don't know. Because if someone drives to the airport, gets on a plane and flies to Australia, gets back in a car, would they say, I've driven to Australia? No, they wouldn't. Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm. And I get it. They cross a few countries on the bike or walking or whatever it is, but, I mean, you could drive for a few countries, jump on a plane, and fly across the ocean to Australia, you. You wouldn't then be loved. Driven to Australia? No, I've driven to this place and flew to Australia. Do you know what I mean? So next time I hear or see someone doing this, I'm expecting them to walk to Australia. They gotta walk through the ocean or bike. Bike through the ocean or on the ocean. That's what I wanna see.

I get a few black hairs around here, few around here, and I can literally just pluck them out and they'll be gone. The problem is the majority of people who think they've had laser hair removal haven't had laser hair removal. They've had IPL, which is intense pulse light or something, which will give you a little bit of, like, reduced hair, but it will not kill the hair follicles. Ask wherever you're getting it done what laser they're using. The one I had was a light sheer diode laser and",

    "voice_to_text": "No one is forcing you to order a 10 dollar popcorn. No one is forcing you to order an 8 dollar soda. Look, people complain about the cost of food at the movies and saying it's way too expensive. I'm in agreement, it is way too expensive. But I'm gonna look at this through chef's point of view, cause that's where I am. I'm gonna take the restaurant I work in for example. Sometimes in my restaurant, it's that we get complaints that our food is too expensive and people don't understand why our food cost so much. It's the hidden costs that go into the food that causes the price of food to rise. For example, our restaurant has to pay gas, electricity, we have to pay wages, we have to pay transportation for the food to get to our restaurant. We have to pay sometimes a mortgage, sometimes there's a lease on the building. That and we don't have to physically own the building, so we have to pay rent to someone else. Sometimes we have to pay for the bins. And then it's all these hidden costs that causes your food to increase in price in restaurants. And it's the same with movie theaters. The reason movie theaters charge so much for food is simply due to the fact that they gotta pay, you know what, the staff, they've gotta pay, the transportation, they gotta pay, you know what, the huge electricity bills because movie theaters have Huge electricity bills they gotta pay. Ridiculous. I mean, ridiculous rents. I mean, most movie theater chains don't actually own the buildings their cinemas are in. They actually lease them. And leaseholders charge exuberant rents. Exuberant rents. So all these, so, like, hidden costs have to be recovered. And the way they recover the hidden costs is simply by over charging for food. Because what people don't, what some people don't realize is movie theaters don't really make a lot of money from the actual movies themselves. That's only a small portion of their profits. The large majority of their profits actually comes from concessions, and that is where they make most of their money. And if suddenly people stop buying, you know, concessions at the movie theatre, then I guarantee you a lot of cinema change will go out of business because they were lost a huge chunk of their profits. So people, cinemas need us to buy their concessions. I agree that, you know what? They should be cheaper. They absolutely should be cheaper. But there's a reason they're. They are expensive. Especially when you consider, like, people are not going to the movies as much as they used to. They're not. And until like, you know what? Cinema attendance is actually increasing again, so they can't really do anything else but raise the prices of the food because they're not getting the money from the movies themselves. So that's the reason why, you know what, cinema food Is so expensive. I don't agree with it. Absolutely not. But unfortunately, you're stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to prices."

Right, so ans already dealt with that person and beautifully explained, you know, just how skilled and knowledgeable and hard working that nurses are. So I don't need to add to that. Um, it was the first part of the comment that. That riled me a little bit. Nurses wipe asses. Okay. Yeah, they do. Nurses, carers, that that is part of their job. Um, usually part of an extensive care package catered to that individual. Everybody's different, but the main goals are usually to make sure somebody's clean, comfortable, Fed, entertained, that kind of thing. They've got the medications. Um, and yes, as wiping is part of the job, do you know what happens when that part of the job is just left out? I'll share a quick story. In 2017, there was a care home in Salford, and it was in serious trouble. And what happened? A resident haven't had their pad changed for over 12 hours, and they were left sitting in their own mess for an extended period of time. And they ended up with horrific urine burns. Those burns got infected, and then that infection was too much for that person's body to handle, and they passed away. So this is why it's a vitally important part for any care package to keep people clean. And then you get people like that comment to say that you just wipe asses for a living. No, you Need to realise that that's in itself, that. That one part of the care package in itself is a life saving acts. And uh. Yeah, more. More people need to realise that."

Ultimately, you're a government entity, and there needs to be, like, an element of professionalism here. Um, I don't know. I don't know if this is, uh, the right way to do it. Obviously, you know, we see the poles. You're most likely gonna get in. I'd really get in because of the social media strategy? I highly doubt it. Um, but maybe talk about your policies.

So basically what he's saying is 18 year old plus to go into the military service for a year or once a month or to do like kind of like a community thing where you run prescriptions etcetera. I'm gonna share a very unpopular opinion now. As much as I do not like Rishi Sunak, I do genuinely think that this is a good idea. Because nowadays we have 18 year olds who are sat in their mother's house on their ass complaining to their mothers talking about do my laundry, do this, do that. This generation needs to learn some independence. And we have enough young people that think they're bad, that think they're part of a gang. Step out into the field and show what you're really on if you're bad and say if we ever did go into the war, this country as much whatever you might not like this country, da da da da da. But say if we went into a war, yeah, your mum is going to die. Because at this very point they are lacking people in the military. And it's not a nice thought process thinking of your family dying. So I do genuinely think that this is a uh, chance for you to get up off your ass, do something good with your life. I mean running prescriptions and doing all of that, do you Know how many good deeds that you will get for that? But, yeah, I think that this is very good opportunity for young people to learn some independence. Like, all jokes aside, to learn some independence and to actually do something with their life.",

You were doing good for the community to try to use morality to have them accept being exploited in not having a fair. A fair pay. Um. And they do it with us a lot. Um, they know that people leave.

Why else doing one of the most important jobs in society that causes pretty substantial psychological harm? So, yeah, it's not just doctors, it's not just nurses, it's pretty much every government service where they are essential workers. They use this morality card and like, almost like a duty to serve the community, to force people into positions where they have to accept being exploited and it's not okay. And they will continue to do it and people will continue to leave and it will continue to get worse and the NHS will collapse and the justice system will collapse and our social services will collapse because they're not getting paid enough and they're being exploited. And the Tories and the government generally are not they. They're just not thinking about the fact that we don't buy it. People don't buy it and it's not a sustainable way to live and it's not worth it. And people leave and go to different countries where they get paid four times as much.

you know your little bouncy little robot dogs and you're actually dancing big robots let's take also neuralink on other technologies of like yeah brain interfaces such as we can put those two together and then we can take LLMs that are being developed and you know take the most recent chatGPT also getting even infused with personality and stuff now put them all together and here we go I just want y'all to just just just just put all of these together and make it make of it what you will and then yes one can go and ask the question of sentients but is this sentient then we're gonna go to the philosophical question of how are we measuring sentience  if you mean is this a productivity device that can take jobs that require no empathy no compassion no sensitivity no care which is a lot of the high paying jobs of the paying jobs under capitalism and the functional jobs under their capitalism then yeah I suppose that's if that's the \u201csentience\u201d that they're looking for those are sentient and those can take those jobs  for things that need actual arms uh and things um could could not even saying that those are necessary that it is necessary  to stick a brain organide inside a Boston Dynamics robot with the frigin LLM like machine learning model of language like uh a GPT sorts\u2026 I\u2019m not even saying that that's necessary to take those super functional jobs now for the existential question of of beings beings being a being um that's also like a receptacle that can learn they're training them on dopamine now okay as an adhd person I'm just like lol okay thanks this how we were made then back then okay cool you know cause you know you can build body parts and everybody there's there's body part robots also being made they're tiny you know self replicating there's all kinds of things so go check biotech everyone and and let\u2019s continuing this conversation in a very open minded and critical way both in thinking of capitalism but also thinking existentially and so far existentially spiritually speaking by me it's like if it can feel things see be around that's like it's an aliveness let's go back to Shinto and back to animism and then someone can say oh yeah but what if it's not feeling what if it's not it's just doing math um let's go back to a lot of people out there have zero empathy okay we're going through a freaking genocide we're watching politicians that could as well be an organoid in a Boston Dynamics body parenting a G P t using Project Lavender forgot the entire name from Google to bomb the living \ud83d\udca9 out of people children crying running around out of like in the G^za Strip they are they are already the freaking Terminator made of bone and flesh and skin and what not but like lacking a crucial part which is empathy which is compassion which is feeling everybody emotionally mutilated by patriarchal conditioning you know to quote  bell hooks like \u201cemotionally mutilated\u201d to function under capitalism (my commentary on bell hooks quote) that's what we're having we're having we're out there ha ha the only difference between anyone that thinks like this (emotionally mutilated) and the organoid within Boston Dynamics bot with the GPT is that ONE came out of a coochie that one was manufactured and one gets really old and passes and the other one gets a bit of brif of oil and is more powerful with their arms so that then you know you have a machine gun and ha ha interplayed with a with a brain organoid  you know but at a fundamental level it's not very different now if people don't start working on anything neural language like networks GPS and organising doing your conditioning for empathy and care now we're just gonna keep on going how's it going actually I'm never gonna say it's gonna get worse because it's it's how it's how it's what it's it always has been you know the mean with the world it always has been it always has been it just gets a little bit stronger always has been so I'm gonna take the choice here to stay on the positive and remember that we are here on this app discussing everything and I hope that this conversation reaches far enough and wide enough to cut tail panic to do with dark but also to infuse a bit of critical thinking and to reach whoever is working with these things to train your models for empathy and compassion and care remove remove anything that's like emotionally mutilating from your models like and really consider why and for what for are we making things if it's just for discontinuous repetition of patterns of consumption and a colonial like appropriating exclusionary um ever consuming transactional type of operations and relating I mean yeah that's not cool yeah anyways while we're at this I need thousand people to drop \u20ac10 into my p a y p a l so I can pay the debt caused by speaking up in g 3 r many against the jennycyd of Pall esteem ian people : since okt  so I'm trying to put it discretely now into videos because yeah for speaking up against all this psychopath behaviour of governments um yeah we're all being punished especially in this country and denied benefits and what not so yeah oh yeah and follow me cause I'm always unpacking all these things from tech to philosophy to to everything else um may the force be with all of us",

I think you'll be able to get them more out of Enzo Fernandez. Now, I'm not an expert on this guy, but he looks the part, doesn't he? Look at that. Look at that quote there.

So, 2019, and due to preventative measures, I ended up going through a hysterectomy. And basically we're like, well, we're gonna leave the eggs and then you'll just naturally come to the hot flush season and all the rest of it. And it has actually been proven that, uh, menopause, when brought on early, can cause medical complications. And family members of mine have suffered some of those medical complications. So when people have asked me, what about your ex? What happens to your ex? Idiot here. Cause I never looked into it. I assumed, which is the stupidest thing under the sun, because I know what thought did. I assumed that they had sued them, and I found out that, no, that's not what happened. And also, beyond the fact that my brain is a little bit, um. You know, I actually. And I have the image of the eggs waving at each other whenever they're coming out. I know they don't last that long. I'm not that stupid. But I've decided they're all sitting, going, hi! And having a party. Yeah. Don't my per brim. Yeah. Not only I feel stupid, I feel massively like. Then I also discovered, and I have been celibate for 9 years, and I, you know, thank. I'm staying that way. Cause now, my luck, I probably do have this little gappy Area that he's talking about. Which means if I happen to have smacks, the little sperm can still get to the eggs, which we then cause in the puppet. Something I actually. When I was very, very, very, very, uh. Okay, I wasn't very young, but I may be. And I was because I'm 50 soon. Um, I've engaged to be married and all the rest of it. And I actually did experience in a topic. Horrible experience and not anything. You know, it is really a horrible experience. And, yeah, the whole idea that that could possibly happen again, it just freaks me out right now. But. Yeah. No. Yeah. What? What? The eggs are just floating about in there having a party. Never mind the rest. So, yeah. Learn something new every day. And, um. Yeah, no, they weren't all sued. How?

    "voice_to_text": "I'm just gonna just jump straight to it right 9 11 happened when a lot of millennials were in school some millennials maybe on the top end perhaps would maybe starting their first job alright and as as millennials know some of the people know millennials are basically since since school then going into work have just experienced atrocity after atrocity after atrocity after atrocity I don't wanna give anyone false confidence with how to manage people because it isn't as easy as I might seem to communicate it being but also considering all of the the possible training and an information out there about how to manage people I wouldn't say it's as hard as the amount of information out there would suggest it is either at least not for millennials who have gone through an experience so many lies so much bullshit so many arbitrary rules so many made up iron fisted governance bollocks as we entered the workforce as we went through school as we kinda grew up and had families and bought houses and watched everything collapse around us slowly we all had all a lot of us start to question where's the humanity where is the humanity in humility here where is it and I think a lot of us collectively when I guess we just have well I guess I'll have to do it I guess I'll have to do it and of course on top of this millennials much like Gen Z we're getting railed left right and center all over the media oh they're too soft in the same actually very similar narrative the Gen Z are getting oh we don't wanna work and we're too soft and we're snowflakes and blah blah blah blah blah blah and as you hear some of this still today like people still call out millennials like motherfucker we're 40 years old can you can you stop ha ha even with Gen Z Gen Z at the top end of pushing 30 years old now and people still talking about them like they're fucking like they they haven't left school yet like can you please get it correct so yeah we've been getting the same shit so of course we we we we also had I would say boomer managers I'm not gonna say Gen X boomer managers um cause actually Gen X very much like seem like the silent the silent generation they're not the silent generation but they seem like it very quiet um but yeah boomer but yeah boomer managers so we had managers who were like you know you show up at 9:00 you're one minute late blah blah blah blah and you're gonna leave at five because if you're one minute ahead of that blah blah blah and all this kind of stuff I don't care if your child needs to be picked up from nursery you need to get the project done the end of all this this kind of thing we we moved now these are two I'm I'm talking to generalizations here I'm not saying this is you know absolutely 100% this way 100% that way I'm saying this is a cultural shift we're going through and you can see through the resistance that's coming up to it millennials I I have been a manager of 3 different teams in 3 different um institutions slash organizations not once have I been trained um not once have I been given like the insight into how to do it um and I will I will say as well to point to what I said initially about it not I don't wanna give people false confidence I wasn't a good manager the first time round I wasn't I was not a good I had I had one person to look after and I didn't do it very well alright and it's because I I not caught myself I've not caught myself in the conditioning of what a manager is and what they do and I wasn't correcting it I was not course correcting I was being a dick I was being a dick um and I I have I have to own that because I was given another team um later and I completely cause corrected and all it was was me actually going hang on a second I'm a manager of people people human beings hello and that was it like that shift that shift was incredible the way that people were able to show up for me for the team for themselves was fascinating and so I'm in a position now I'm not necessarily officially a manager of people however I'm on a project where I am managing the people on the project and again the first thing is like right okay so we've got deadlines to hit I understand that we all need to kind of work together on this but I also understand that these people this isn't the only thing they're doing they've got other things going on to bring about basically what I'm saying is we had to as millennials find our own humanity because we were not seeing it in the wider world and we were not treated as though we had any so we had to find it and we had to then deploy that in every single space that we possibly could this is why millennials are fucking tired man we're not just tired because of the economic climate the political climate we are emotionally spiritually tired because we have had to take a battering from the environment we were born into and then we've taken up the mantle to try and switch it around we're breaking cycles in our families we're breaking cycles in terms of relationships we're breaking cycles in terms of work culture we are trying our damnedest to flip this around right and of course Gen Z come up and step into the plate and they are they are taking what whatever they can from the foundation that we try to build and run with that too but the reason that none of us got trained is that we ended up being put in these positions because we were seen as people people right we were seen as people people but actually all it was was that we had some fucking humanity we had some fucking humanity we were basically treating people like human beings that was it and there was nothing out there that was gonna train us for that yeah there's training to be a manager and understanding formal processes right making sure you fill out the correct forms and perform interviews correctly there's training for that yeah but nothing could teach you how to treat people like human beings and because millennials had that because we fucking had to right we were put in these positions we will put these positions of looking after people because it was clear that we needed people to look after people not look after work clothes not look after time schedules not look after the bottom line we needed people to look after people and that's where millennials stepped up to the plate we didn't do that training in fact I believe a lot of us probably have to learn that as we go which is what I did which is why I'm happy to say I'm not happy about the fact that my first time managing was not good it was not good but the qualities that I was reminded of that I that put me in a position were not the fact that I was really good at looking at the bottom line really look good at looking at the numbers in the graphs really good at keeping people to schedule it was the fact that I knew how to talk to people I forgot that I forgot that part we didn't we didn't necessarily need the training because what the the value that millennials had to have because we were fucking battered into it we were battered into it and I'm not saying I'm great I'm grateful for that right is that we were collectively told there is no humanity out here and so I'm really really proud of us that we were like I bet let's bring it and look at us now we've been managing people well not all of us again I know but yeah we're in this position it's not because we know how to do the fucking admin shit it's because we actually learn how to treat people like people and we're not perfect but we're getting there we learn how to treat people like fucking people interestingly corporate couldn't produce the training for that bit but then interestingly outside of my role my freelance job is actually training people on how to treat people like people so there you go there you go ha ha it's not the bottom line it's not grass it's not numbers nothing like that it's literally how to treat people like people and I I I freelance on that and I actually made a nice word of mouth kind of pathway out of that as well so yeah that"

You only have to look at the comment section to see that. 2, it's the exact kind of content that he normally posts, so you can't even tell that it's an ad. And 3, it's something that's really relatable, which causes so much more engagement on the post, thus boosting it.

Unless you live in the UK and you have been to slam dunk before, you cannot speak. Bearing in mind I sometimes have disability requirements depending on how I'm feeling on the day, you cannot, I repeat, you cannot have a contingency plan for the kind of rain they put down in 24 hours at Leeds. It was not just there, it was everywhere. There is no contingency plan for the amount of rain they put down in 24 hours. They have those ramps that you mention everywhere, but they cannot cover a whole entire field in those ramps. It's just not possible. I don't think you realise how big the festival and park is and that people cannot control the weather. The disability access at Slam Dunk is actually really good. They have a lot of contingencies in there. But nowhere, literally nowhere, would have the contingencies for what happened in the past. In the 24 hours before that, everywhere was flooded.

Hosting as hell. Like I said already, hosting as hell. You have to prep, you have to clean up before they come. And then you have to make sure everybody is having fun at the event, because if you're a good host, you're gonna make sure of that. And during that time, you're not having fun, cause you're just making sure all your friends have fun. And then they're gonna leave, then you have to clean up after. No, no. It's a no for Me. And then you have situations where nobody cares about your property, you or your, or anything at your place. So things are gonna get broken, stuff is gonna get stolen. Sad to say, but it happens. Um, people are gonna show up late, um, people are gonna come empty handed, don't bring anything behind them. Even though you say, okay, I'm gonna cook, I'm literally contributing the majority of the stuff for this event, but you're bringing nothing. And you are in. Those people, I find to be the ones who is indulging everything that's there. They're gonna eat up all the majority of the food, they can drink, majority of the drinks, and then they're gonna leave. So the cookout, the grill out, whatever you wanna say, fuck it, I'm not having anymore. I'm not doing it. If you come to yours, no problem. I'll bring some stuff, I'll help, cause I know how it is. But I am not hosting any of them anymore. People just don't know how to act. So you stay over there and I'll stay over here. Simple.",

Well, your partner does most of the cleaning, the cooking, looking after the children and works, so. And I don't want to see lies here, because I know there's many men that do this.
